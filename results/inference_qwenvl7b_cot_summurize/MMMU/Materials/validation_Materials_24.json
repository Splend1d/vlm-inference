The image shows a close-packed arrangement of spheres, which is characteristic of face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC) structures.\n\n1. **FCC Structure**:\n   - In FCC, spheres are packed in a way that each sphere is surrounded by 12 other spheres, forming a close-packed structure.\n   - The unit cell of FCC has a face-centered arrangement, meaning there is a sphere at each corner of the cube and one sphere in the center of each face.\n\n2. **BCC Structure**:\n   - In BCC, spheres are packed in a way that each sphere is surrounded by 8 other spheres, forming a close-packed structure.\n   - The unit cell of BCC has a body-centered arrangement, meaning there is a sphere in the center of the cube.\n\nGiven the image, we can see that the spheres are arranged in a way that each sphere is surrounded by 12 other spheres, which is characteristic of FCC. Additionally, the unit cell plane is {100}, which is the plane that contains the closest-packed layers of atoms in FCC.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\nC. FCC {100}"
