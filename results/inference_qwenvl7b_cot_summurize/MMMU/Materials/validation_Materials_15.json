The transition temperature is the average of these two temperatures.\n\nFrom the data provided:\n\n- The maximum impact energy is 124 J at -25\u00b0C.\n- The minimum impact energy is 6 J at -175\u00b0C.\n\nThe transition temperature is calculated as the average of these two temperatures:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Transition Temperature} = \\frac{\\text{Maximum Impact Energy} + \\text{Minimum Impact Energy}}{2}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Transition Temperature} = \\frac{124 + 6}{2} = \\frac{130}{2} = 65^\\circ \\text{C}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the temperatures are given in Celsius, the transition temperature should be in Celsius as well. Therefore, the transition temperature is -65\u00b0C.\n\nThe closest option to -65\u00b0C is:\n\nA. -100\u00b0C"
