                "text": "To determine the average normal stress acting over the shaded section of the bar, we need to consider the geometry and the applied load.\n\n1. **Cross-sectional Area and Load**: The bar has a cross-sectional area \\( A \\) and is subjected to an axial load \\( P \\).\n\n2. **Shaded Section**: The shaded section is oriented at an angle \\( \\theta \\) from the horizontal.\n\n3. **Normal Stress Calculation**: The normal stress \\( \\sigma \\) at any point in the cross-section is given by the applied load \\( P \\) divided by the cross-sectional area \\( A \\). However, since the shaded section is oriented at an angle \\( \\theta \\), we need to consider the projection of the load onto the shaded section.\n\n4. **Projection of Load**: The load \\( P \\) can be projected onto the shaded section using trigonometry. The projection of the load \\( P \\) onto the shaded section is \\( P \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) \\).\n\n5. **Average Normal Stress**: The average normal stress \\( \\sigma_{avg} \\) over the shaded section can be calculated by considering the projection of the load onto the shaded section. The shaded section has an area \\( A_{shaded} = A \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) \\) ( (since the shaded section is a parallelogram with height \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\) and base \\( A \\)).\n\n6. **Calculation**: The average normal stress \\( \\sigma_{avg} \\) is given by the projection of of the load onto the shaded section divided by the area of the shaded section:\n\\[ \\sigma_{avg} = \\frac{P \\cdot \\cos(\\theta)}{A \\cdot \\sin(\\theta)} \\]\n\n7. **Simplification**: Simplifying the expression:\n\\[ \\sigma_{avg} = \\frac{P}{A} \\cdot \\frac{\\cos(\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)} \\]\n\\[ \\sigma_{avg} = \\frac{P}{A} \\cdot \\cot(\\theta) \\]\n\nHowever, the options provided do not directly match this form. Let's re-examine the options:\n\n- **Option A**: \\( \\frac{P}{A} \\cdot \\sin(2\\theta) \\)\n- **Option B**: \\( \\frac{P}{A} \\cdot \\sin^2(\\theta) \\)\n- **Option C**: \\( \\frac{P}{2A} \\cdot \\sin(2\\theta) \\)\n- **Option D**: \\( \\frac{P}{2A} \\cdot \\sin^2(\\theta) \\)\n\nNone of these options directly match the derived expression. However, considering the projection and the geometry, the correct approach involves understanding the projection of of the load onto the shaded section and the area of the shaded section.\n\nGiven the options and the derived expression, the closest match considering the projection and area calculation is:\n\n**Final Answer: D. \\( \\frac{P}{2A} \\cdot \\sin^2(\\theta) \\)**"
