The total load is equally distributed between the two supports.\n\n   - Therefore, \\( R_A = R_B = \\frac{72 \\text{ kip}}{2} = 36 \\text{ kip} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the internal forces at point D:**\n\n   - At point D, the beam is subjected to a uniform distributed load of 6 kip/ft on both sides.\n\n   - The internal forces at point D can be determined by considering the equilibrium of the beam segment from A to D.\n\n   - The internal force at point D is the sum of the reactions at A and B and the distributed load acting on the segment AD.\n\n   - The distributed load on segment AD is \\( 6 \\text{ kip/ft} \\times 3 \\text{ ft} = 18 \\text{ kip} \\).\n\n   - The internal force at point D is \\( N_D = R_A + R_B + \\text{Load on AD} = 36 \\text{ kip} + 36 \\text{ kip} + 18 \\text{ kip} = 90 \\text{ kip} \\).\n\n   - The shear force at point D is \\( V_D = R_A - \\text{Load on AD} = 36 \\text{ kip} - 18 \\text{ kip} = 18 \\text{ kip} \\).\n\n   - The bending moment at point D is \\( M_D = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Load on AD} \\times \\text{Distance from A to D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 18 \\text{ kip} \\times 3 \\text{ ft} = 27 \\text{ kip\u00b7ft} \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
