                "text": "To find the density of totally amorphous polypropylene, we need to consider the relationship between density and crystallinity. The density of a material is inversely proportional to its crystallinity. This means that as the crystallinity decreases, the density also decreases.\n\nGiven the data:\n\n1. For a material with a density of 0.904 g/cm\u00b3 and a crystallinity of 62.8%, the density of a totally amorphous material ( (\u03c1_a) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\rho_a = \\rho \\times (1 - \\frac{C}{100} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of the partially crystalline material,\n- \\( C \\) is the crystallinity percentage.\n\n2. For a material with a density of 0.895 g/cm\u00b3 and a crystallinity of 54.4%, we can use the same formula to find the density of a totally amorphous material.\n\nLet's calculate the density of the totally amorphous material using the first data point:\n\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.904 \\times (1 - \\frac{62.8}{100} \\]\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.904 \\times (1 - 0.628 \\]\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.904 \\times 0.372 \\]\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.340 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation is not directly applicable because it does not account for the second data point. Instead, we should use the average crystallinity to find the density of the totally amorphous material. The average crystallinity can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Crystallinity} = \\frac{62.8 + 54.4}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Crystallinity} = \\frac{117.2}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Crystallinity} = 58.6\\% \\]\n\nNow, we can use the average crystallinity to find the density of the totally amorphous material:\n\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.904 \\times (1 - \\frac{58.6}{100} \\]\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.904 \\times (1 - 0.586 \\]\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.904 \\times 0.414 \\]\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.374 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 \\]\n\nThis calculation is still not correct because it does not account for the second data point. Instead, we should use the average density to find the density of the totally amorphous material. The average density can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Density} = \\frac{0.904 + 0.895}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Density} = \\frac{1.799}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average Density} = 0.8995 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 \\]\n\nNow, we can use the average density to find the density of the totally amorphous material:\n\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.8995 \\times (1 - \\frac{58.6}{100} \\]\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.8995 \\times (1 - 0.586 \\]\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.8995 \\times 0.414 \\]\n\\[ \\rho_a = 0.374 \\, \\text{g/cm}^3 \\]\n\nThis calculation is still not correct because it does not account for the second data point.
