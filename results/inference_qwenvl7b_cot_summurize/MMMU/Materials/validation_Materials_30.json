                "text": "To determine the average normal strain $\\varepsilon _x$ along the x axis, we need to analyze the deformation of the triangular plate when its apex A is given a horizontal displacement of 5 mm.\n\nGiven:\n- The base of the triangle is 800 mm.\n- The height of the triangle is 800 mm.\n- The apex A is displaced horizontally by 5 mm.\n\nThe strain $\\varepsilon _x$ is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon _x = \\frac{\\Delta x}{x}\n\\]\nwhere $\\Delta x$ is the change in length along the x axis, and $x$ is the original length along the x axis.\n\nIn this case, the original length along the x axis is the base of the triangle, which is 800 mm. The change in length $\\Delta x$ is the horizontal displacement of the apex A, which is 5 mm.\n\nSubstituting the values into the strain formula:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon _x = \\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{800 \\text{ mm}} = 0.00625 \\text{ mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this value is not among the given options. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the options or the the question itself. Given the options provided, none of them match the calculated value of 0.00625 mm/mm.\n\nPlease double-check the question and the options provided. If the question and options are correct, then the calculated value does not match any of the given options."
