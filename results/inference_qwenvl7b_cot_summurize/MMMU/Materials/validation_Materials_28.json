This results in a separation of the light into its constituent colors, which is why different colors of light are refracted at different angles.\n\n1. **Schematic A**:\n   - The green light is refracted more than the red light.\n   - This is qualitatively correct because green light has a shorter wavelength and is refracted more than red light.\n\n2. **Schematic B**:\n   - The blue light is refracted more than the red light.\n   - This is also qualitatively correct because blue light has a shorter wavelength and is refracted more than red light.\n\n3. **Schematic C**:\n   - The green light is refracted less than the red light.\n   - This is not qualitatively correct because green light should be refracted more than red light.\n\n4. **Schematic D**:\n   - The blue light is refracted less than the red light.\n   - This is not qualitatively correct because blue light should be refracted more than red light.\n\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer is:\n\nC. <image 3>"
