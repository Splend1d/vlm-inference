The dimensions of the larger rectangle are 200 mm x 20 mm, and the dimensions of the smaller rectangle are 20 mm x 20 mm.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the area of the larger rectangle:\n\\[ A_{\\text{large}} = 200 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 20 \\, \\text{mm} = 4000 \\, \\text{mm}^2 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of the smaller rectangle:\n\\[ A_{\\text{small}} = 20 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 20 \\, \\text{mm} = 400 \\, \\text{mm}^2 \\]\n\nThe net area of the cross-section is the area of the larger rectangle minus the area of the smaller rectangle:\n\\[ A_{\\text{net}} = A_{\\text{large}} - A_{\\text{small}} = 4000 \\, \\text{mm}^2 - 400 \\, \\text{mm}^2 = 3600 \\, \\text{mm}^2 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the perimeter of the cross-section. The perimeter consists of the outer edges of the larger rectangle and the inner edges of the smaller rectangle:\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (200 \\, \\text{mm} + 2 \\times 20 \\, \\text{mm} + 2 \\times 20 \\, \\text{mm} = 2 \\times 200 \\, \\text{mm} + 2 \\times 20 \\, \\text{mm} + 2 \\times 20 \\, \\text{mm} = 400 \\, \\text{mm} + 40 \\, \\text{mm} + 40 \\, \\text{mm} = 520 \\, \\text{mm} \\]\n\nThe shape factor is then given by the ratio of the net area to the perimeter:\n\\[ \\text{Shape Factor} = \\frac{A_{\\text{net}}}{P} = \\frac{3600 \\, \\text{mm}^2}{520 \\, \\text{mm}} \\approx 6.92 \\]\n\nHowever, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the options provided, as none of them match the calculated shape factor. The closest option is:\n\nC. 0.87\n\nThis might be a mistake in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculations, the correct shape factor is approximately 6.92, which is not listed among the options."
