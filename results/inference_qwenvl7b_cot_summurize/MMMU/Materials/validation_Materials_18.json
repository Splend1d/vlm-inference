                "text": "To determine the normal strain along edge BC, we need to analyze the given shear strain equation and its effect on the dimensions of the square block.\n\nThe shear strain equation is given by:\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = 40 \\times 10^{-6} x + 20 \\times 10^{-6} y\n\\]\n\nThis equation indicates that the shear strain is dependent on both the x and y coordinates. However, since all lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical after the deformation, the strain along the y-axis ( \\(\\gamma_{yy}\\) ) is zero. Therefore, the strain along the x-axis ( \\(\\gamma_{xx}\\) ) is the only relevant component.\n\nThe normal strain along edge BC can be determined by considering the change in length along the x-axis. Since the shear strain is only in the x-direction, the normal strain along edge BC ( \\(\\epsilon_{xx}\\) ) is equal to the shear strain along the x-axis.\n\nGiven:\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = 40 \\times 10^{-6} x + 20 \\times 10^{-6} y\n\\]\n\nThe normal strain along edge BC ( \\(\\epsilon_{xx}\\) ) is:\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{xx} = 40 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nConverting to the correct units ( mm/mm):\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{xx} = 40 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mm/mm} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. 4.00*10^(-3) mm/mm"
