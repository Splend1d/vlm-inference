It would not sound at the same pitch.\n2. **double bass**: The double bass has an even lower range and a different timbre compared to the oboe. It would not sound at the same pitch.\n3. **bassoon**: The bassoon has a similar range and timbre to the oboe. It would sound at the same pitch.\n4. **violin**: The violin has a higher range and a different timbre compared to the oboe. It would not sound at the same pitch.\n\nTherefore, the best instrument to play the oboe part so that it sounds at the same pitch is the **bassoon**.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. box3"
