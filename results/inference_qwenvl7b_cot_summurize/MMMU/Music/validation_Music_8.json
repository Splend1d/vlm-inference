The bottom staff shows a chord with a sharp fourth ( (\u266f4) and a sharp second  ( (\u266f2). This suggests a dominant seventh chord as well.\n\nGiven that both chords are dominant seventh chords, we need to identify the key signature to determine the harmony.\n\nThe key signature has five sharps ( (F#, C#, G#, D#, A#), which corresponds to the key of E major.\n\nIn E major, the dominant seventh chord is E7 ( (E, G#, B, D#).\n\nTherefore, the harmony in the above example is:\n\nD.
