The distance between the two notes is a perfect fourth.\n\nA perfect fourth is an interval where the lower note is exactly four semitones above the higher note. This interval is characterized by a specific sound and is often used in music theory.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nA. perfect"
