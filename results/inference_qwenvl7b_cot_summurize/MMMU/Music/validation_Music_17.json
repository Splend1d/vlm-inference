This indicates a minor key signature, specifically in the key of of B\u266d minor.\n\n2. **Identify the scale degrees**: The scale degrees for a B\u266d minor scale are:\n   - B\u266d ( (1st degree)\n   - C \u266d ( (2nd degree)\n   - D \u266d ( (3rd degree)\n   - E \u266d ( (4th degree)\n   - F \u266d ( (5th degree)\n   - G \u266d ( (6th degree)\n   - A \u266d (7th degree)\n   - B\u266d ( (8th degree, which is the same as the 1st degree)\n\n3. **Match the scale degrees with the notes**: \n   - B\u266d ( (1st degree) is the note B\u266d\n   - C \u266d ( (2nd degree) is the note C \u266d\n   - D \u266d ( (3rd degree) is the note D \u266d\n   - E \u266d ( (4th degree) is the note E \u266d\n   - F \u266d ( (5th degree) is the note F \u266d\n   - G \u266d ( (6th degree) is the note G \u266d\n   - A \u266d ( (7th degree) is the note A \u266d\n   - B\u266d ( (8th degree) is the note B\u266d\n\n4. **Match the notes with the clefs**: \n   - The first clef ( is for the note B\u266d ( (1st degree)\n   - The second clef \u266e is for the note C \u266d ( (2nd degree)\n   - The third clef \u266f is for the note D \u266d ( (3rd degree)\n   - The fourth clef \u266f is for the note E \u266d ( (4th degree)\n\nGiven the key signature and the scale degrees, the correct clef to form the minor scale is the **first clef**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. first clef"
