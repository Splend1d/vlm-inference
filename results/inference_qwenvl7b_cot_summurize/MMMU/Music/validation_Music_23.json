This means there are 6 beats in each measure, and each beat is an eighth note.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. **Option 1:**\n   - Time signature: 4/4\n   - The bar is written with a 4/4 time signature, which means there are 4 beats in each measure, and each beat is a quarter note. This does not match the given bar.\n\n2. **Option 2:**\n   - Time signature: 3/4\n   - The bar is written with a 3/4 time signature, which means there are 3 beats in each measure, and each beat is a quarter note. This does not match the given bar.\n\n3. **Option 3:**\n   - Time signature: 3/4\n   - The bar is written with a 3/4 time signature, which means there are 3 beats in each measure, and each beat is a quarter note. This does not match the given bar.\n\nSince none of the options correctly represent the given bar in simple time, the correct answer is:\n\nD. None of above"
