The melodic minor scale has a different shape for the leading tone ( (the note that comes right before the final note of the scale) compared to the major scale. In the C melodic minor scale, the leading tone is a half step ( (C#) above the final note ( (C).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. c melodic minor scale"
