A:\n- The rhythm is: quarter note, quarter note, quarter note\n- This does not match the 2/4 time signature because there are three quarter notes instead of two.\n\nB. B:\n- The rhythm is: eighth note, eighth note, quarter note\n- This does not match the 2/4 time signature because there are three eighth notes and one quarter note instead of two eighth notes per beat.\n\nC. C:\n- The rhythm is: eighth note, eighth note, eighth note\n- This does not match the 2/4 time signature because there are three eighth notes instead of two eighth notes per beat.\n\nD. D:\n- The rhythm is: eighth note, eighth note, eighth note, eighth note\n- This matches the 2/4 time signature because there are two eighth notes per beat.\n\nTherefore, the correct notation in 2/4 time signature is:\n\nD.
