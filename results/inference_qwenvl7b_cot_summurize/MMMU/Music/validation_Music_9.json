BD:\n- Root (B\n- Third (D\n- Fifth (D\n- Seventh (D)\n\nThis chord is a major-minor seventh chord in the first inversion.\n\nB. CD:\n- Root (C\n- Third (D)\n- Fifth (D)\n- Seventh (D)\n\nThis chord is also a major-minor seventh chord in the first inversion.\n\nC. BC:\n- Root (B\n- Third (C)\n- Fifth (C)\n- Seventh (C)\n\nThis chord is not a major-minor seventh chord in the first inversion.\n\nD. AB:\n- Root (A\n- Third (B)\n- Fifth (B)\n- Seventh (B)\n\nThis chord is not a major-minor seventh chord in the first inversion.\n\nTherefore, the chords that belong to the first inversion of a major-minor seventh chord are:\nA.
