The time signature consists of two numbers: the top number indicates the number of beats per measure, and the bottom number indicates the type of note that gets one beat.\n\nIn the given music score, the time signature is 3/4. This means there are 3 beats per measure, and each beat is a quarter note.\n\nSince the music score ends with a fermata ( ( ), which indicates a pause, we can count the measures up to that point. The fermata is not counted as a beat.\n\nLet's count the measures:\n1. The first measure has 3 beats.\n2. The second measure has 3 beats.\n3. The third measure has 3 beats.\n\nSo, there are a total of 3 measures in the music score.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. 4"
