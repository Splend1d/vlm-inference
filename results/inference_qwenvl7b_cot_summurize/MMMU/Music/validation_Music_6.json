The first measure has a simple 6/8 time signature, indicating a pattern of three beats per measure, with each beat divided into two sub-beats.\n2. The second measure also has a compound 6/8 time signature, indicating a pattern of two beats per measure, with each beat divided into three sub-beats.\n\nThe second measure contains a syncopated note, which is a note that is played on the offbeat rather than on the beat. This is a common rhythmic device in compound time signatures.\n\nGiven this analysis, the rhythmic device used in the second measure is:\n\nC. Suspension"
