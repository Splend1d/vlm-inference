In this case, the root is the note G.\n\n2. **Identify the intervals**: \n   - The first note above the root is B ( (G to B is a major third).\n   - The second note above the root is D# ( (B to D# is a major third).\n   - The third note above the root is F# ( (D# to F# is a minor third).\n   - The fourth note above the root is C# ( (F# to C# is a minor third).\n\n3. **Determine the inversion**: \n   - The chord is in second inversion because the third is on top ( (F# is the third note above the root).\n\n4. **Determine the quality of the chord**: \n   - The chord is major because all the intervals are major or minor ( (major third, major third, minor third).\n\nGiven these observations, the chord is a major seventh chord in second inversion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Dominant seventh in second inversion"
