Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\n2. **Model the anatomy of the figures naturalistically**: The mosaic does not necessarily show figures with naturalistic anatomy. The figures are depicted in a stylized manner, which is typical of ancient art. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\n3. **Modify and transport the composition easily**: The use of small tiles allows for easy modification and transportation of the composition. This is because each tile can be individually replaced or removed, making it easier to alter the design or transport the artwork.\n\n4. **Reduce the figures into abstract forms**: The mosaic does not reduce the figures into abstract forms; instead, it depicts them in a detailed and realistic manner. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. modify and transport the composition easily"
