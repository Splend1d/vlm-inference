To enliven paintings through the use of scientific theories about color and optic function - This option suggests that Seurat aimed to use scientific theories to enhance the visual impact of his paintings. This alignss with the Divisionist technique, which involves breaking down colors into small dots and then blending them optically to create a more vibrant and dynamic effect.\n\nB. to bring Classical structure to the Impressionist's approach to painting - This option suggests that Seurat aimed to incorporate classical structure into the Impressionist style. However, Divisionism is more closely associated with the Impressionist movement rather than trying to bring classical structure to it.\n\nC. to use color to generate a strong emotional response from the viewer - While color can certainly evoke emotions, this is not the primary goal of Divisionism. The technique focuses more on the visual impact and the scientific aspects of color.\n\nD. to produce an idiosyncratic style characterized by the use of small dots of color - This option is correct but redundant. The Divisionist technique is indeed characterized by the use of small dots of color, but it is not the goal itself.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. to enliven paintings through the use of scientific theories about color and optic function"
