The lighting fixture above the table also hangs centrally, further emphasizing the circular symmetry.\n\nGiven these observations, the arrangement of the elements around the central table and the lighting fixture creates a circular symmetry, which is characteristic of radial balance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.
