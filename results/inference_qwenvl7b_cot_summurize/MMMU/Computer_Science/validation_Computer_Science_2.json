So, this statement is true.\n\nB. **12 is the right child of 8**:\n   - 12 is not the right child of 8; it is actually the left child of 8. So, this statement is false.\n\nC. **24 is the left child of 13**:\n   - 24 is not the left child of 13; it is actually the right child of 13. So, this statement is false.\n\nD. **35 is the right child of 24**:\n   - 35 is not the right child of 24; it is actually the left child of 24.
