                "text": "To determine the correct option when increasing the value of \\( C \\) in logistic regression with L1 regularization, we need to understand how L1 regularization affects the coefficients \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\).\n\nL1 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This tends to shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n\nGiven the data points in the image, we can observe the following:\n\n1. The data points are clustered in two distinct groups, one represented by circles and the other by pluses.\n2. The decision boundary is influenced by both \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\).\n\nWhen \\( C \\) is increased, the regularization term \\( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log P(y_i | x_i, w_0, w_1, w_2) - C(|w_1| + |w_2|) \\) becomes more significant. This term penalizes the absolute values of \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- If \\( C \\) is very large, the regularization term will dominate the cost function, leading to very small values for \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\).\n- Since L1 regularization tends to shrink coefficients to zero, it is likely that one or both coefficients will become zero.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n- **Option A**: First, \\( w_2 \\) becomes zero, and then \\( w_1 \\) becomes zero.\n- **Option B**: First, \\( w_1 \\) becomes zero, and then \\( w_2 \\) becomes zero.\n- **Option C**: Both become zero at the same time.\n- **Option D**: Both cannot be zero even after a very large value of \\( C \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhen \\( C \\) is increased, it is more likely that one or both coefficients will become zero due to the L1 regularization. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n**C. Both become zero at the same time**"
