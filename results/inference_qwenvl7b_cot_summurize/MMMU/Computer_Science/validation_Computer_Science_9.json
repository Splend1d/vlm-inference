Each of the four links from the shared middle link to a client has a transmission capacity of RC = 60 Mbps. <image 1> What is the maximum achievable end-end throughput (in Mbps) for each of four client-to-server pairs, assuming that the middle link is fairly shared (divides its transmission rate equally)?

Therefore, each pair will get a share of the middle link's capacity.\n\n4. **Share of Middle Link Capacity per Pair**: \n\\[ \\text{Share per pair} = \\frac{R}{4} = \\frac{300 \\text{ Mbps}}{4} = 75 \\text{ Mbps} \\]\n\n5. **Total Capacity for Each Pair**: \n\\[ \\text{Total capacity per pair} = R_S + \\text{Share per pair} = 80 \\text{ Mbps} + 75 \\text{ Mbps} = 155 \\text{ Mbps} \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each of the four client-to-server pairs is \\( 155 \\) Mbps."
