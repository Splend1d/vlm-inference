The IP address for the associated URL is not cached in your local host, so a DNS lookup is necessary to obtain the IP address. Suppose that four DNS servers are visited before your host receives the IP address from DNS. The first DNS server visited is the local DNS cache, with an RTT delay of RTT0 = 4 msecs. The second, third and fourth DNS servers contacted have RTTs of 14, 9, and 34 msecs, respectively. Initially, let's suppose that the Web page associated with the link contains exactly one object, consisting of a small amount of HTML text. Suppose the RTT between the local host and the Web server containing the object is RTTHTTP = 95 msecs. <image 1> Assuming zero transmission time for the HTML object, how much time (in msec) elapses from when the client clicks on the link until the client receives the object?Only write the number.\n\n"
