The DAG consists of two main nodes labeled \"+\", \"-\", and \"\u2260\".\n2. The \"+\" node has two incoming edges from the \"-\" and \"\u2260\" nodes.\n3. The \"-\" node has two incoming edges from the \"+\" and \"\u2260\" nodes.\n4. The \"\u2260\" node has two incoming edges from the \"+\" and \"-\" nodes.\n\nGiven these connections, we can infer the operations and their order. The \"+\" and \"-\" nodes represent addition and subtraction, respectively, while the \"\u2260\" node represents a comparison operation.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. ((x + y) - ((x + y) * (x - y))) - ((x + y) * (x - y))\n- This expression involves multiple operations and sub-expressions, which does not match the simple structure of the DAG.\n\nB. ((x - y) - ((x + y) * (x - y))) + ((x + y) * (x - y))\n- This expression involves subtraction and multiplication, which does not match the simple structure of the DAG.\n\nC. (x - ((x + y) * (x - y))) + ((x + y) * (x - y))\n- This expression involves subtraction and multiplication, which does not match the simple structure of the DAG.\n\nD. ((x + y) - ((x + y) * (x - y))) + ((x + y) * (x - y))\n- This expression involves subtraction and multiplication, which matches the simple structure of the DAG.\n\nGiven the structure of the DAG, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
