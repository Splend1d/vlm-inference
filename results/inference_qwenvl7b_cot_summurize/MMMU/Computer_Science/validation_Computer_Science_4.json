However, they have different transitions on 'a' ( G6 to G6 and G7 to G4. Therefore, they are not equivalent.\n- **G6 and G5**: Both have transitions on 'a' to the same state G5. However, they have different transitions on 'b' to G6 and G6 respectively. Therefore, they are not equivalent.\n- **G7 and G4**: Both have transitions on 'a' to the same state G4. However, they have different transitions on 'b' to G6 and G7 respectively. Therefore, they are not equivalent.\n\nSince there are no equivalent states that can be merged without changing the language accepted by the DFA, the DFA is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. yes"
