From state 0, there are two transitions:\n   - An \u03b5-transition to state 1.\n   - An \u03b5-transition to state 3.\n3. From state 1, there is a transition on 'a' to state 2.\n4. From state 3, there is a transition on 'b' to state 4.\n5. States 2 and 4 are final states.\n\nNow, let's analyze the transitions and final states to form the regular expression:\n\n- From state 0, we can reach state 2 by taking the \u03b5-transition to state 1 and then the 'a' transition to state 2.\n- From state 0, we can reach state 4 by taking the \u03b5-transition to state 3 and then the 'b' transition to state 4.\n\nTherefore, the NFA recognizes strings that end in either 'a' or 'b'. \n\nThe correct regular expression is:\nD. a*|b*"
