                "text": "To determine the exergy destruction in the condenser, we need to calculate the exergy of of the refrigerant entering and leave the condenser, and then find the difference.\n\n1. **Exergy of of Refrigerant at Condenser Inlet:**\n\n   The refrigerant enters the condenser as a saturated liquid at 1.2 MPa and 50\u00b0C. The exergy of a saturated liquid can be calculated using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   e_{x,liq} = h_{liq} - T_0 \\left( s_{liq} - s_{0} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n   where:\n   - \\( h_{liq} \\) is the enthalpy of the saturated liquid at 1.2 MPa and 50\u00b0C.\n   - \\( s_{liq} \\) is the entropy of the saturated liquid at 1.2 MPa and 50\u00b0C.\n   - \\( s_{0} \\) is the entropy of the reference state (0\u00b0C and 1 atm.\n   - \\( T_0 \\) is the reference temperature (20\u00b0C.\n\n   Using steam tables or thermodynamic software, we find:\n   - \\( h_{liq} \\approx 270 \\text{ kJ/kg} \\)\n   - \\( s_{liq} \\approx 0.95 \\text{ kJ/kg\u00b7K} \\)\n   - \\( s_{0} \\approx 0.006 \\text{ kJ/kg\u00b7K} \\)\n\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   e_{x,liq,in} = 270 - 20 \\left( 0.95 - 0.006 \\right) \\approx 270 - 18.8 \\approx 251.2 \\text{ kJ/kg}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Exergy of of Refrigerant at Condenser Outlet:**\n\n   The refrigerant leaves the condenser as a saturated liquid at 1.2 MPa and 20\u00b0C. The exergy of a saturated liquid at this condition is:\n   \\[\n   e_{x,liq,out} = h_{liq} - T_0 \\left( s_{liq} - s_{0} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Using steam tables or thermodynamic software, we find:\n   - \\( h_{liq} \\approx 240 \\text{ kJ/kg} \\)\n   - \\( s_{liq} \\approx 0.65 \\text{ kJ/kg\u00b7K} \\)\n\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   e_{x,liq,out} = 240 - 20 \\left( 0.65 - 0.006 \\right) \\approx 240 - 12.8 \\approx 227.2 \\text{ kJ/kg}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Exergy Destruction in the Condenser:**\n\n   The exergy destruction in the condenser is the difference between the exergy of the refrigerant at the condenser inlet and the exergy of the refrigerant at the condenser outlet:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{E}_{x,cond} = e_{x,liq,in} - e_{x,liq,out}\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\dot{E}_{x,cond} = 251.2 - 227.2 = 24 \\text{ kJ/kg}\n   \\]\n\n   Since the mass flow rate of the refrigerant is 0.13 kg/s, the total exergy destruction in the condenser is:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{E}_{x,cond} = 24 \\text{ kJ/kg} \\times 0.13 \\text{ kg/s} = 3.12 \\text{ kW}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the exergy destruction in the condenser is approximately 3.12 kW, which is closest to option C."
