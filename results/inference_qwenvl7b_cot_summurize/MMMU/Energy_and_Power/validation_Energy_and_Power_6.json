There are two inlets labeled \"IN\" and \"in,\" indicating that fluid enters the vessel from two different directions.\n3. There is a single outlet labeled \"out,\" indicating that the fluid exits from one point.\n\nGiven these observations, the diagram represents a vessel with a coiled section through which fluid flows. This is characteristic of a shell and tube heat exchanger, where the fluid flows through the tubes while the heat transfer fluid flows through the shell around the tubes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger"
