We can use the given data to find the work done by the engine.\n\n### Work Done by the Engine ( (w)\n\nThe work done by the engine can be calculated using the first law of thermodynamics:\n\n\\[ w = q_H - q_L \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( q_L \\) is the heat lost by the engine\n\nGiven:\n- \\( q_L = 300 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\)\n- \\( q_H = 1200 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\)\n\n\\[ w = 1200 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} - 300 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} = 900 \\, \\text{kJ/kg} \\]\n\n### Second-Law Efficiency ( (\u03b72)\n\nThe second-law efficiency (\u03b72) is given by the ratio of the work done by the engine to the heat supplied to the engine plus the heat lost by the engine.\n\n\\[ \\eta_2 = \\frac{w}{q_H + q_L} \\]\n\n\\[ \\eta_2 = \\frac{900}{1200 + 300} = \\frac{900}{1500} = 0.6 \\]\n\n### Summary\n\n- First-Law Efficiency ( (\u03b71) = 0.6\n- Second-Law Efficiency ( (\u03b72) = 0.6\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.67, 0.32"
