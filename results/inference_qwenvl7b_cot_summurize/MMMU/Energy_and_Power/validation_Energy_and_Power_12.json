                "text": "To determine the work potential of the air in the container when it is filled, we need to calculate the work done during the process of filling the container. The process is isothermal (since the container is adiabatic and the supply line is maintained at a constant temperature.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial volume of the container: \\( V_i = 40 \\, \\text{ft}^3 \\)\n- Initial temperature of the air in the container: \\( T_i = 80\u00b0F \\)\n- Temperature of the air in the supply line: \\( T_s = 90\u00b0F \\)\n- Pressure of the air in the supply line: \\( P_s = 150 \\, \\text{psia} \\)\n\nThe work done during an isothermal process can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ W = nR(T_f - T_i) \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the number of moles of air\n- \\( R \\) is the specific gas constant for air ( \\( R = 5.206 \\, \\text{Btu/lbmol} \\cdot \\text{R} \\)\n- \\( T_f \\) is the final temperature of the air in the container\n\nFirst, we need to find the final temperature \\( T_f \\) of the air in the container. Since the process is isothermal, the final temperature will be the same as the temperature of the supply line:\n\\[ T_f = T_s = 90\u00b0F \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of moles of air \\( n \\) in the container. We can use the ideal gas law:\n\\[ PV = nRT \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure in the container after the valve is opened\n- \\( V_f \\) is the final volume of the air in the container\n\nSince the process is isothermal, the ratio of the initial volume to the final volume is equal to the ratio of the initial pressure to the final pressure:\n\\[ \\frac{V_i}{V_f} = \\frac{P_i}{P_f} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure in the supply line\n- \\( P \\) is the pressure in the container after the valve is opened\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the final pressure \\( p_f \\):\n\\[ p_f = p \\frac{V_i}{V_f} \\]\n\nSince the process is isothermal, the final temperature \\( T_f \\) is the same as the temperature of the supply line:\n\\[ T_f = T_s = 90\u00b0F \\]\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles of air \\( n \\):\n\\[ p_f V_f = nRT_f \\]\n\\[ p \\frac{V_i}{V_f} V_f = nR T_f \\]\n\\[ p V_i = nR T_f \\]\n\\[ n = \\frac{p V_i}{R T_f} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ n = \\frac{150 \\, \\text{psia} \\times 40 \\, \\text{ft}^3}{5.206 \\, \\text{Btu/lbmol} \\cdot \\text{R} \\times 90\u00b0F} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done:\n\\[ W = nR(T_f - T_i) \\]\n\\[ W = \\frac{p V_i}{R T_f} R(T_f - T_i) \\]\n\\[ W = \\frac{150 \\, \\text{psia} \\times 40 \\, \\text{ft}^3}{5.206 \\, \\text{Btu/lbmol} \\cdot \\text{R} \\times 90\u00b0F} \\times 5.206 \\, \\text{Btu/lbmol} \\cdot \\text{R} \\times (90\u00b0F - 80\u00b0F) \\]\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{150 \\times 40}{5.206 \\times 90} \\times 5 \\times 10\u00b0F \\]\n\\[ W = \\frac{6000}{4.6854} \\times 10\u00b0F \\]\n\\[ W = 1285.5 \\times 10\u00b0F \\]\n\\[ W = 12855 \\, \\text{Btu} \\]\n\nSo, the work potential of the air in the container when it is filled is approximately 12855 Btu.\n\nThe closest answer is:\nC.
