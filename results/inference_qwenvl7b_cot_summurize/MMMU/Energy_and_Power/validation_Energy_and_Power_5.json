                "text": "To determine the weight that must be added inside the hollow sphere to make it neutrally buoyant, we need to calculate the volume of the water displaced by the sphere when it is submerged in water. The volume of the water displaced will be equal to the volume of the sphere, and the weight of this volume of water will be equal to the weight that must be added inside the sphere to make it neutrally buoyant.\n\nThe volume of the sphere can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = ( 4/3 * \u03c0 * r^3\n\nWhere r is the radius of the sphere. The radius of the sphere is half of the diameter, so r = 7/2 = 3.5 inches.\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\nV = 4/3 * \u03c0 * 3.5^3 = 180.87 cubic inches\n\nThe weight of the water displaced can be calculated using the formula:\n\nW = V * \u03c1 * g\n\nWhere \u03c1 is the density of water (62.4 lb/ft^3, and g is the acceleration due to gravity (32.2 ft/s^2.\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\nW = 180.87 * 62.4 * 32.2 = 36,000 lb\n\nTherefore, the weight that must be added inside the sphere to make it neutrally buoyant is 36,000 lb. None of the given options match this value."
