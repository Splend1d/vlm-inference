The background is relatively simple, but it is not completely devoid of elements.\n- **Photo 2** shows several cylindrical lamps with a patterned. The background is dark, which makes the lamps stand out, but it is not completely negative space.\n- **Photo 3** shows two large structures with a clear blue sky in the background. The sky is a significant part of the image and provides a clear contrast to the structures, creating a strong sense of negative space.\n\nTherefore, the image that features a strong use of negative space is:\n\nD.
