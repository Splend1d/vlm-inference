Egg tempera - This medium typically has a smooth, glossy finish and is often used for detailed and fine artwork.\n\nB. Watercolour - This medium is known for its transparency and ability to blend easily, creating a soft, painterly effect.\n\nC. Ink - Ink is typically used for drawing and writing, and it is not commonly used for painting large areas.\n\nD. Oil paint - Oil paint is known for its rich, thick texture and ability to blend and mix colors on the canvas.\n\nGiven the visible texture and blending of colors in the painting, it appears to have a smooth, blended look, which is characteristic of watercolor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Watercolour"
