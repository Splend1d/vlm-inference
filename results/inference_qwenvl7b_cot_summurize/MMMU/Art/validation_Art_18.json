The figure is holding a tower, which is a common attribute of Saint Barbara.\n2. Saint Barbara is often depicted with a tower and a palm branch, which is not visible in this image.\n3. Saint Apollonia is not typically associated with a tower.\n4. Saint Philomena is not typically associated with a tower.\n5. Saint Hilda is not typically associated with a tower.\n\nGiven the presence of the tower, the most likely candidate is Saint Barbara.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Barbara"
