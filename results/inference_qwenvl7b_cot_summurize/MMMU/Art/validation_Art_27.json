The painting features a figure that appears to be reclininging on a chair or similar object.\n3. The figure is stylizeded and somewhat abstract, which is characteristic of Bacon's work.\n\nGiven that Henrietta Moraes sat for Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, we need to identify which female artist she also sat for.\n\n- Maggi Hambling is a contemporary British painter known for her figurative works.\n- Elisabeth Frink was a British sculptor and painter known for her figurative works.\n- Barbara Hepworth was a British sculptor and painter known for her abstract and geometric works.\n- Georgia O'Keeffe was an American painter known for her abstract and nature-inspired works.\n\nSince Henrietta Moraes sat for Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, and considering the style of the painting in the image, it is likely that she also sat for an artist who created similar abstract and expressionistic works.\n\nGiven the options, Maggi Hambling is the most likely choice, as she is known for her figurative and abstract works that could fit the style of the painting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Maggi Hambling"
