The painting depicts a group of people gathered around a table, which is a common subject in art.\n2. The style appears to be impressionistic, characterized by loose brushstrokes and vibrant colors.\n3. The artist's name is not visible in the image, but the style and subject matter can provide clues.\n\nGiven these observations, the painting resembles works by Paul C\u00e9zanne, who is known for his loose, impressionistic style and his depictions of groups of people.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. PAUL C\u00c9ZANNE"
