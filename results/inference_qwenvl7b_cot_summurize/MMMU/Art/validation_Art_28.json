Each element is represented by a visual example.\n3. The first row shows:\n   - Line: Various lines and patterns.\n   - Shape: Different geometric shapes.\n   - Form: Three-dimensional shapes.\n   - Space: A visual representation of space.\n4. The second row shows:\n   - Texture: Different textures.\n   - Value: Different shades of color.\n   - Color: Different colors.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"When lines meet to form an enclosed area, this is formed.\"\n\n- A. Space: This is not formed by lines meeting to enclose an area.\n- B. Shape: This is formed when lines meet to enclose an area.\n- C. Form: This is a three-dimensional shape, not formed by lines meeting to enclose an area.\n- D. Line: Lines themselves do not form an enclosed area.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Shape"
