On physical examination there is a firm, well-circumscribed, non-tender nodule to the right of midline in her neck. She undergoes thyroidectomy and the microscopic appearance of the lesion is shown here. Which of the following statements regarding her disease is most appropriate? <image 1> \n\nA. The serum TSH is probably increased\nB. She will probably survive for at least 10 years\nC. Anti-microsomal and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are detectable\nD. A dietary iodine deficiency probably preceded its appearance\nE. The patient has relatives with a similar condition\n"

The presence of a single cell within a follicle is characteristic of a solitary thyroid nodule (STN. \n\nGiven the description of the patient's symptoms and the histological appearance of the lesion, the most appropriate statement regarding her disease is:\n\nC. Anti-microsomal and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are detectable\n\nThis is because solitary thyroid nodules are often associated with thyroid autoimmunity, and the presence of these antibodies is common in patients with thyroid nodules."
