Infiltrating ductal carcinoma\n\nThe image depicts a mass with a rough, irregular surface, which is characteristic of infiltrative ductal carcinoma. This type of cancer involves the ducts of the breast and can spread to other parts of the body. The induration, roughness, and reddish-orange appearance are also consistent with the clinical presentation of infiltrative ductal carcinoma."
