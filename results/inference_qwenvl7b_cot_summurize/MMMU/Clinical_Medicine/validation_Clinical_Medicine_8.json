A girl infant is born at 32 weeks gestation and is markedly icteric. The microscopic appearance of the placenta is shown here. Laboratory studies show the baby has a Hct of 18%, and an exchange transfusion is performed. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated and resulted in the birth of a normal girl at term. Which of the following immunologic mechanisms is most likely to produce these findings? <image 1> \n\nA. Anti-receptor antibody\nB. Immune complex formation\nC. Complement mediated cell destruction\nD. Delayed type hypersensitivity\nE. Loss of self tolerance\n"

                "text": "The image shows a histological section of a placenta, which appears to have a pattern consistent with hydrops fetalis. Hydrops fetalis is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the fetal tissues and body cavities, often associated with Rh incompatibility.\n\nThe most likely immunologic mechanism responsible for these findings is:\n\nE. Loss of self tolerance\n\nIn Rh incompatibility, the mother's immune system may recognize the Rh-positive fetal cells as foreign and produce antibodies against them. This can lead to the destruction of fetal red blood cells, causing hemolytic disease of the newborn ( (HDI), which can manifest as hydrops fetalis. The laboratory studies showing a low hematocrit ( (Hct) and the need for an exchange transfusion further support this diagnosis.\n\nThe other options do not typically result in the specific histological and clinical findings seen in hydrops fetalis:\n\nA. Anti-receptor antibody - This is not a common mechanism for causing hydrops fetalis.\nB. Immune complex formation - While immune complexes can cause inflammation, they are not the primary mechanism for hydrops fetalis.\nC. Complement mediated cell destruction - While complement activation can contribute to cell destruction, it is not the primary mechanism for hydrops fetalis.\nD. Delayed type hypersensitivity - This is a type of immune response that is not typically associated with hydrops fetalis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E. Loss of self tolerance."
