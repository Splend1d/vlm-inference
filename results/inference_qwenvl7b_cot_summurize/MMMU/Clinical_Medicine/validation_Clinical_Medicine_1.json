Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( (ESR) of 50 mm/hr\n\nAn elevated ESR is often seen in conditions associated with inflammation, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nThe other options ( serum lipase, total serum complement, serum carcinoembryonic antigen, serum alanine aminotransferase, and proteinuria are less likely to be directly related to the clinical presentation of subarachnoid hemorrhage."
