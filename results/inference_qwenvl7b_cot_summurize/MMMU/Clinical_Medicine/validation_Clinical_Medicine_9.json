The image shows irregular glandular structures with atypical cells, which is not typical of an adenoma.\n\n2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: Squamous cell carcinomas are characterized by squamous cell differentiation. The image does not show squamous cell differentiation, as the cells appear glandular rather than squamous.\n\n3. **Intestinal Type Adenocarcinoma**: Intestinal type adenocarcinomas are characterized by glandular structures that resemble normal intestinal glands. The image shows glandular structures that resemble normal intestinal glands, which is consistent with this type of cancer.\n\n4. **Diffuse Signet Ring Cell Adenocarcinoma**: Diffuse signet ring cell adenocarcinomas are characterized by cells with a large central vacuole that displaces the nucleus to one side. The image does not show cells with this specific morphology.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct statement is:\n\nC. The findings show intestinal type adenocarcinoma"
