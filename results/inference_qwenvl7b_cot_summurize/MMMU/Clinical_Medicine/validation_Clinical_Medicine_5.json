Gallstones - Gallstones are typically seen in the gallbladder or bile ducts and are not usually calcified in the liver.\nB. Pancreatic calcifications - Pancreatic calcifications are often seen in the pancreas and can be associated with chronic pancreatitis.\nC. Calcified hematoma of the liver - A calcified hematoma in the liver is a common finding in cases of liver trauma or severe liver injury.\nD. Hepatic artery aneurysms - Calcified hepatic artery aneurysms are rare and typically seen in the liver.\n\nGiven the location and appearance of the calcifications in the image, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nC. Calcified hematoma of the liver\n\nThis is because calcified hematomas are commonly seen in the liver after trauma or severe injury, and the calcifications are typically located in the liver parenchyma.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Calcified hematoma of the liver"
