Placenta accreta\n\nPlacenta accreta occurs when the placenta attaches too deeply to the uterine wall, causing it to adhere to the muscle layer of the uterus. This can lead to complications during delivery, such as difficulty in delivering the placenta and excessive bleeding. The gross appearance of the uterus in the image shows a large, irregularly shaped placenta that is deeply embedded in the uterine wall, which is characteristic of placenta accreta."
