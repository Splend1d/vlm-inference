Hypersensitivity pneumonitis\n\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis ( (HP) is a type of interstitial lung disease that occurs due to an immune response to inhaled antigens. The histological features seen in HP include non-caseating granulomas, lymphocytic infiltration, and fibrosis. The presence of these features in the biopsy is consistent with the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis."
