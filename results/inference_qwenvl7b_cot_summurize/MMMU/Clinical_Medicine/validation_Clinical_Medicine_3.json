It appears to be of normal size and shape in this image.\n2. **Liver**: The liver is usually visible in the upper right quadrant. It appears to be of normal size and shape in this image.\n3. **Gallbladder**: The gallbladder is often seen in the right upper quadrant. It appears to be of normal size and shape in this image.\n4. **Duodenum**: The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine and is typically visible in the upper abdomen. It appears to be of normal size and shape in this image.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the organs (stomach, liver, gallbladder, or duodenum appear abnormal in this radiograph.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Duodenum"
