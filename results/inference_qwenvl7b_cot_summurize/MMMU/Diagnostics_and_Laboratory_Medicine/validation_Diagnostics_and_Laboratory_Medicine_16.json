The mass lesion in the transverse view appears to be located in the posterior fossa, which is consistent with a posterior fossa tumor. The mass lesion in the sagittal view appears to be located in the cerebellum, which is also consistent with a posterior fossa tumor.\n\nGiven the location and appearance of the mass lesion, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nE. Medulloblastoma\n\nMedulloblastoma is a type of brain tumor that typically arises in the cerebellum and is common in children. It is characterized by a mass lesion that can cause symptoms such as headaches, vomiting, and neurological deficits."
