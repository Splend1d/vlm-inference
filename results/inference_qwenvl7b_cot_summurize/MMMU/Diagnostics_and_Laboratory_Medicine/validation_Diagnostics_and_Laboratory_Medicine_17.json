The sections do not show the typical appearance of Lewy bodies.\n\n2. **Progressive Supranuclear Palsy ( (PSP)**: PSP is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy bodies. The sections do not show the typical appearance of neurofibrillary tangles or Lewy bodies.\n\n3. **Either of the above**: Given that the sections do not show the typical pathological features of either PD or PSP, it is unlikely that either of these conditions is present.\n\n4. **None of the above**: Since the sections do not show the typical pathological features of either PD or PSP, it is likely that neither of these conditions is present.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is:\n\nD.
