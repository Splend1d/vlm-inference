The presence of these wide, undulating waves is characteristic of ventricular fibrillation ( (VF), which is a life-threatening arrhythmia where the ventricles of the heart quiver instead of pumping blood effectively.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Ventricular preexcitation syndrome - This is characterized by a short PR interval and a delta wave, which is not present in this ECG.\nB. Ventricular fibrillation - This is characterized by wide, undulating waves that do not resemble normal sinus rhythm.\nC. S sustained ventricular tachycardia - This is characterized by a regular, rapid rhythm with a narrow QRS complex, which is not present in this ECG.\nD. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm - This is characterized by a regular, slow rhythm with a narrow QRS complex, which is not present in this ECG.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Ventricular fibrillation"
