This pattern is characteristic of a subependymoma.\n\n2. **Benign and Slow Growing**: Subependymomas are typically benign and slow-growing tumors. They are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during imaging studies.\n\n3. **Location**: Subependymomas are commonly found in the ventricles of the brain, particularly in the lateral ventricles.\n\nGiven these observations, the correct answer is:\n\nD. all are correct"
