Here are the correct answers based on the image:\n\nA. **is commonly associated with Von Hippel Lindau** - This is incorrect. While cerebellar astrocytomas can occur in patients with Von Hippel Lindau syndrome, they are not exclusively associated with it.\n\nB. **contains inhibin A positive stromal cells** - This is incorrect. Inhibin A is typically associated with germ cell tumors, not astrocytomas.\n\nC. **is rich in reticulin** - This is incorrect. Reticulin is not typically abundant in astrocytomas.\n\nD. **all are correct** - This is incorrect as none of the statements are correct based on the image.\n\nThe correct answer is not listed among the options provided."
