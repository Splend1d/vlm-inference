The top image is stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( (H&E), which is commonly used to differentiate between various types of cells and tissues. The bottom image appears to be a reticulin stain, which is used to visualize the reticulin fibers that support the liver cells.\n\nThe reticulin stain in the bottom image shows a pattern of fibers that are disrupted or absent in certain areas, which can be indicative of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. This type of lesion is often seen in patients with chronic liver disease, such as viral hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nE. all are correct\n\nThis is because the lesion can be seen in a patient with chronic liver disease, it can be found incidentally during a routine examination, it may require the use of a reticulin stain to differentiate from normal gland, and it can present as a non-functioning tumor with mass effect."
