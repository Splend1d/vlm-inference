Tuberculous meningitis\n\nTuberculous meningitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the meninges and brain parenchyma caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The clinical presentation often includes fever, headache, and neurological symptoms, which can include cord problems. The histological features of tuberculous meningitis can include caseous necrosis, granulomas, and lymphocytic infiltration, which are consistent with the appearance in the image."
