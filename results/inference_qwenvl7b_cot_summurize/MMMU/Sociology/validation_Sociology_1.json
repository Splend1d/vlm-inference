The person in the image was arrested for refusing to sit in the blacks-only section of the cinema in Nova Scotia in 1946.\n2. This act of refusing to comply with segregation laws is an example of challenging and opposing discriminatory practices.\n\nGiven this context, the crime is an example of:\n\nB. A conflict crime\n\nConflict crimes are those that arise from conflicts between individuals or groups over the distribution of resources, power, or status. In this case, the conflict is between the individual's refusal to comply with segregation laws and the societal norms that upheld segregation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. A conflict crime"
