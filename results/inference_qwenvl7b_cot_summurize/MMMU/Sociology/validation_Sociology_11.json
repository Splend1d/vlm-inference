It lists several symptoms associated with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), including fatigue, severe headaches, loss of memory or concentration, sleeping problems, muscle pain, and sore throat.\n3. The symptoms are depicted in a way that suggests they are common and widely recognized.\n\nGiven these observations, the image is likely an example of a contested illness. A contested illness is a condition that is recognized by some but not by others, often due to lack of scientific consensus or lack of widespread acceptance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. A contested illness"
