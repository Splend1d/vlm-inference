Sociology often studies the structure and functions of governments and their relationships with society.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. The exercise of power by the state\n- This option focuses on the power aspect of government, which is a part of sociology's study of government.\n\nB. The strategies some use to direct the behavior and actions of others\n- This option is more about leadership and control, which is related to sociology but not specifically about government.\n\nC. The institutionalization of legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the state\n- This option specifically refers to the structure of government institutions, which is a key aspect of sociology's study of government.\n\nD. The means by which permanent hierarchies are established and enforced\n- This option is about hierarchies, which is a broader concept that includes government but is not solely focused on it.\n\nGiven the image and the options, the most accurate answer is:\n\nC. The institutionalization of legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the state\n\nThis option directly relates to the structure and functioning of government institutions, which is a central focus of sociology."
