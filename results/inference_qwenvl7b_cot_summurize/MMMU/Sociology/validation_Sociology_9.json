Symbolic interactionism\n\nSymbolic interactionism focuses on how people interact with each other and how they interpret and make sense of their social world through symbols, such as language, gestures, and other forms of communication. This approach would be particularly relevant for understanding the dynamics and interactions within the Occupy movement, including how members communicate and construct their shared identity and purpose.\n\nWhile functionalism and conflict theory are also important sociological perspectives, they do not focus as much on the micro-level interactions and symbolic meanings that are central to symbolic interactionism. Ethnocentrism, on the other hand, is a term that refers to the belief that one's's own group or culture is superior, which is not directly related to the study of interactions within a movement."
