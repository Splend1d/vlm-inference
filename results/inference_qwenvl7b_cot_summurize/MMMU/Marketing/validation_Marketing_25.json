                "text": "To conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the mean difference in the husband's versus the wife's satisfaction level is negative, we will perform a paired t-test. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the mean difference is zero, and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that the mean difference is negative.\n\nGiven data:\n- Wife's scores: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4\n- Husband's scores: 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4\n\nFirst, we calculate the differences between the husband's and wife's scores:\n- Difference 1: 2 - 2 = 0\n- Difference 2: 2 - 2 = 0\n- Difference 3: 3 - 1 = 2\n- Difference 4: 3 - 3 = 0\n- Difference 5: 4 - 2 = 2\n- Difference 6: 2 - 1 = 1\n- Difference 7: 1 - 1 = 0\n- Difference 8: 1 - 1 = 0\n- Difference 9: 2 - 2 = 0\n- Difference 10: 4 - 4 = 0\n\nNext, we calculate the mean difference:\nMean difference = ( (0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) / 10 = 0.2\n\nNow, we calculate the standard deviation of the differences:\n1. Calculate the squared differences from the mean difference:\n   - (0 - 0.2)^2 = 0.04\n   - (0 - 0.2)^2 = 0.04\n   - (2 - 0.2)^2 = 3.24\n   - (0 - 0.2)^2 = 0.04\n   - (2 - 0.2)^2 = 3.24\n   - (1 - 0.2)^2 = 0.64\n   - (0 - 0.2)^2 = 0.04\n   - (0 - 0.2)^2 = 0.04\n   - (0 - 0.2)^2 = 0.04\n   - (0 - 0.2)^2 = 0.04\n\n2. Sum the squared differences:\n   Sum = 0.04 + 0.04 + 3.24 + 0.04 + 3.24 + 0.64 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 7.6\n\n3. Calculate the variance:\n   Variance = Sum / ( (n - 1) = 7.6 / ( (10 - 1) = 7.6 / 9 = 0.8444\n\n4. Calculate the standard deviation:\n   Standard deviation = \u221aVariance = \u221a0.8444 \u2248 0.919\n\nNow, we calculate the t-value:\nt-value = (Mean difference - 0) / ( (Standard deviation / \u221an) = ( 0.2 / ( (0.919 / \u221a10) \u2248 0.2 / ( (0.919 / 3.162) \u2248 0.2 / 0.291 \u2248 0.687\n\nThe closest option to our calculated t-value of approximately 0.687 is not listed among the options provided.
