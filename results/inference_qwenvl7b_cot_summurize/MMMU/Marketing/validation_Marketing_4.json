The bars are not evenly distributed on both sides of the center.\n2. **Skewness**: The distribution appears to be skewed to the right. The tail on the right side of the histogram is longer than the tail on the left side.\n\nGiven these observations, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The distribution is skewed right."
