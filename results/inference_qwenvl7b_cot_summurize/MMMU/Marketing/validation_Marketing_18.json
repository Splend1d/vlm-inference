                "text": "To determine the p-value from Table 10.18, we need to perform a statistical test to compare the two groups: work hours with breakfast and work hours without breakfast. A common test for this type of data is the paired t-test, which is used to compare the means of two related groups.\n\nHere are the steps to calculate the p-value:\n\n1. **Calculate the differences**: For each pair of values, calculate the difference between the work hours with breakfast and the work hours without breakfast.\n2. **Calculate the mean difference**: Find the mean of these differences.\n3. **Calculate the standard deviation of the differences**: Find the standard deviation of the differences.\n4. **Calculate the t-statistic**: Use the formula for the t-statistic for a paired t-test:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\bar{d}}{s_d / \\sqrt{n}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\bar{d\\) is the mean difference, \\(s_d\\) is the standard deviation of the differences, and \\(n\\) is the number of pairs.\n5. **Find the p-value**: Use the t-distribution table or a statistical software to find the p-value corresponding to the t-statistic and the degrees of freedom (df = n - 1.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. **Calculate the differences**:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   6 - 8 &= -2 \\\\\n   5 - 7 &= -2 \\\\\n   5 - 9 &= -4 \\\\\n   4 - 5 &= -1 \\\\\n   7 - 9 &= -2 \\\\\n   7 - 8 &= -1 \\\\\n   7 - 10 &= -3 \\\\\n   5 - 7 &= -2 \\\\\n   6 - 6 &= 0 \\\\\n   5 - 9 &= -4\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the mean difference**:\n   \\[\n   \\bar{d} = \\frac{-2 - 2 - 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 0 - 4}{10} = \\frac{-20}{10} = -2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the standard deviation of the differences**:\n   \\[\n   s_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (d_i^2 - \\bar{d}^2}{n-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(-2)^2 + (-2)^2 + (-4)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-2)^2 + (-1)^2 + (-3)^2 + (-2)^2 + 0^2 + (-4)^2}{10-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 + 4 + 16 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 9 + 4 + 0 + 16}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{50}{9}} \\approx 2.22\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the t-statistic**:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{-2}{2.22 / \\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{-2}{2.22 / 3.16} \\approx \\frac{-2}{0.70} \\approx -2.86\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find the p-value**:\n   Using a t-distribution table or software with df = 9, the p-value for a t-statistic of -2.86 is approximately 0.01.\n\nTherefore, the p-value is approximately 0.01, which is closest to option C. 0.0004.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 0.0004"
