This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ P(x < 3.5 | x < 4) = \\frac{{P(x < 3.5)}{{P(x < 4)} \\]\n\nFirst, let's calculate \\( P(x < 4) \\):\n\nSince the distribution is uniform from 1.5 to 4.5, the probability density function (PDF) is constant within this interval. The total area under the PDF curve is 1 ( (the probability of all possible outcomes).\n\nThe length of the interval is \\( 4.5 - 1.5 = 3 \\).\n\nThe probability of \\( x \\) being less than 4 is the area under the PDF curve from 1.5 to 4:\n\n\\[ P(x < 4) = \\frac{4 - 1.5}{4.5 - 1.5} = \\frac{2.5}{3} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.8333 \\]\n\nNext, let's calculate \\( P(x < 3.5) \\):\n\nThe length of the interval from 1.5 to 3.5 is \\( 3.5 - 1.5 = 2 \\).\n\nThe probability of \\( x \\) being less than 3.5 is the area under the PDF curve from 1.5 to 3.5:\n\n\\[ P(x < 3.5) = \\frac{3.5 - 1.5}{4.5 - 1.5} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.6667 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate \\( P(x < 3.5 | x < 4) \\):\n\n\\[ P(x < 3.5 | x < 4) = \\frac{0.6667}{0.8333} \\approx 0.8 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.8"
