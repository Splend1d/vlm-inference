We will use a paired t-test since the data are paired (i.e., each individual's starting and ending cholesterol levels are measured.\n\nThe null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference between the starting and ending cholesterol levels:\n\\[ H_0: \\mu_d = 0 \\]\n\nThe alternative hypothesis (H1) is that there is a significant difference between the starting and ending cholesterol level:\n\\[ H_1: \\mu_d \\neq 0 \\]\n\nGiven the significance level (\u03b1 = 0.05.\n\nThe test statistic for a paired t-test is calculated as:\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{d}}{s_d / \\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\bar{d}\\) is the mean difference between the starting and ending cholesterol levels\n- \\(s_d\\) is the standard deviation of the differences\n- \\(n\\) is the number of pairs\n\nFirst, calculate the differences (d) between the starting and ending cholesterol levels:\n\\[ d = \\begin{cases} \n140 - 140 = 0 \\\\\n220 - 230 = -10 \\\\\n110 - 120 = -10 \\\\\n240 - 220 = 20 \\\\\n200 - 190 = 10 \\\\\n180 - 150 = 30 \\\\\n190 - 200 = -10 \\\\\n360 - 300 = 60 \\\\\n280 - 300 = -20 \\\\\n260 - 240 = 20 \\\\\n\\end{cases} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the mean difference (\\(\\bar{d}\\)):\n\\[ \\bar{d} = \\frac{\\sum d}{n} = \\frac{0 - 10 - 10 + 20 + 10 + 30 - 10 + 60 - 20 + 20}{10} = \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\]\n\nThen, calculate the standard deviation of the differences (\\(s_d\\)):\n\\[ s_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (d^2 - \\frac{(\\sum d)^2}{n}}{n-1}} = \\]\n\\[ \\sum d^2 = 0^2 + (-10)^2 + (-10)^2 + 20^2 + 10^2 + 30^2 + (-10)^2 + 60^2 + (-20)^2 + 20^2 = 0 + 100 + 100 + 400 + 100 + 900 + 100 + 3600 + 400 + 400 = 6000 \\]\n\\[ s_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{6000 - \\frac{100^2}{10}}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6000 - 1000}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5000}{9}} = \\sqrt{555.56} \\approx 23.55 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the t-statistic:\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{d}}{s_d / \\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{10}{23.55 / \\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{10}{23.55 / 3.162} = \\frac{10}{7.44} \\approx 1.34 \\]\n\nUsing a t-distribution table or calculator with 9 degrees of freedom ( (n-1), the p-value for a two-tailed test with t = 1.34 is approximately 0.21.\n\nSince the p-value (0.21) is is greater than the significance level (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the cholesterol levels were significantly lowered after 12 weeks.\n\nThe correct answer is A. there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the medication lowered cholesterol levels after 12 weeks."
