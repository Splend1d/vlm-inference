As a part of a feasibility study, the company conducts research into the types of fries sold across the country to determine if the type of fries sold is independent of the area of the country. The results of the study are shown in Table 11.43. Conduct a test of independence. At the 5% significance level, what can you conclude?\n\nA. There is insufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.\nB. There is sufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.\nC. Not certain.\n"
