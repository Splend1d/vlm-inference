                "text": "To compute the probability of winning a bet on three numbers in a line, such as 1-2-3, we need to understand the structure of the roulette table and the number of ways to win such a bet.\n\n1. **Understanding the Roulette Table:**\n   - The roulette table has 38 numbers.\n   - The numbers are divided into three sections (1-18 (19-36), and two sections for odd and even numbers.\n   - Each number is assigned a color ( red or black.\n\n2. **Calculating the Number of Ways to Win:**\n   - A bet on three numbers in a line means betting on three consecutive numbers.\n   - For example, betting on 1-2-3 means you are betting on the numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n   - There are 36 possible combinations of three consecutive numbers ( (1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, ..., 32-33-34, 33-34-35, 34-35-36).\n\n3. **Calculating the Probability:**\n   - The probability of winning a bet on three numbers in a line is the number of ways to win divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n   - There are 36 ways to win and 38 possible outcomes.\n   - Therefore, the probability is \\(36 / 38\\).\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - \\(36 / 38\\) can be simplified to \\(9 / 10\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 9/10"
