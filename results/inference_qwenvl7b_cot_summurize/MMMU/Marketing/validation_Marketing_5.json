This is a count of the number of goals, which is a discrete variable.\n\n2. **Sample Size**: The sample size is relatively small (7 teams in each conference, which is typically considered to be small.\n\n3. **Distribution of Goals**: The distribution of goals is likely to be skewed, as teams may have different levels of success and some may score significantly more goals than others.\n\nGiven these points, the exact distribution for the hypothesis test is likely to be the **Student's t-distribution**. This is because the t-distribution is used when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown, which is the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the Student's t-distribution"
