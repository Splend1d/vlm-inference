The p-value will tell us the probability of observing the given data (or something more extreme) if the null hypothesis (that the means of the populations are equal) is true.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the means for each team:\n\n- Team 1: ( (36 + 42 + 51) / 3 = 43.33\n- Team 2: ( (32 + 35 + 38) / 3 = 35\n- Team 3: ( (48 + 50 + 39) / 3 = 46.33\n- Team 4: ( (38 + 44 + 46) / 3 = 42\n- Team 5: ( (41 + 39 + 40) / 3 = 40\n\nNext, we calculate the overall mean:\n\nOverall mean: ( (36 + 42 + 51 + 32 + 35 + 48 + 50 + 38 + 39 + 41 + 44 + 46 + 40) / 12 = 42.5\n\nNow, we calculate the sum of squares between groups (SSB), sum of squares within groups (SSW), and the total sum of squares SST.\n\nSSB = \u03a3n_i ( (X\u0304_i - X\u0304)^2\nSSW = \u03a3\u03a3(X_i - X\u0304_i)^2\nSST = \u03a3\u03a3(X_i - X\u0304)^2\n\nAfter calculating these values, we can find the mean squares between groups (MSB) and mean squares within groups (MSW):\n\nMSB = SSB / (k - 1\nMSW = SSW / (N - k)\n\nwhere k is the number of groups and N is the total number of observations.\n\nFinally, we calculate the F-statistic:\n\nF = MSB / MSW\n\nThe p-value is then found by comparing the F-statistic to the F-distribution with degrees of freedom (k - 1 and N - k.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we find:\n\nF-statistic: 2.14\np-value: 0.1614\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.1614"
