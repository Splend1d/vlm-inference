The discounted cash flows are calculated by discountinging each cash flow at the appropriate discount rate.\n\nGiven the cash flows in the table, we can calculate the discounted payback period for each project as follows:\n\n1. **Project A:**\n   - Initial investment: $-1,000\n   - Cash flows: $1,000 in year 1, $0 in year 2, $0 in year 3, $0 in year 4, $0 in year 5\n   - Discount rate: 10%\n\n   Discounteding cash flows:\n   - Year 1: $1,000 / (1 + 0.10)^1 = $909.09\n   - Year 2: $0 / (1 + 0.10)^2 = $0\n   - Year 3: $0 / (1 + 0.10)^3 = $0\n   - Year 4: $0 / (1 + 0.10)^4 = $0\n   - Year 5: $0 / (1 + 0.10)^5 = $0\n\n   Cumulative discounted cash flows:\n   - Year 1: $909.09\n   - Year 2: $909.09\n   - Year 3: $909.09\n   - Year 4: $909.09\n   - Year 5: $909.09\n\n   The discounted payback period is 3 years because the cumulative discounted cash flows become positive in year 3.\n\n2. **Project B:**\n   - Initial investment: $-2,000\n   - Cash flows: $1,000 in year 1, $1,000 in year 2, $4,000 in year 3, $1,000 in year 4, $1,000 in year 5\n   - Discount rate: 10%\n\n   Discounted cash flows:\n   - Year 1: $1,000 / (1 + 0.10)^1 = $909.09\n   - Year 2: $1,000 / (1 + 0.10)^2 = $826.45\n   - Year 3: $4,000 / (1 + 0.10)^3 = $2,938.02\n   - Year 4: $1,000 / (1 + 0.10)^4 = $683.01\n   - Year 5: $1,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5 = $620.92\n\n   Cumulative discounted cash flows:\n   - Year 1: $909.09\n   - Year 2: $909.09 + $826.45 = $1,735.54\n   - Year 3: $1,735.54 + $2,938.02 = $4,673.56\n   - Year 4: $4,673.56 + $683.01 = $5,356.57\n   - Year 5: $5,356.57 + $620.92 = $6,977.49\n\n   The discounted payback period is 3 years because the cumulative discounted cash flows become positive in year 3.\n\n3. **Project C:**\n   - Initial investment: $-3,000\n   - Cash flows: $1,000 in year 1, $1,000 in year 2, $1,000 in year 3, $1,000 in year 4, $1,000 in year 5\n   - Discount rate: 10%\n\n   Discounteded cash flows:\n   - Year 1: $1,000 / (1 + 0.10)^1 = $909.09\n   - Year 2: $1,000 / (1 + 0.10)^2 = $826.45\n   - Year 3: $1,000 / (1 + 0.10)^3 = $751.26\n   - Year 4: $1,000 / (1 + 0.10)^"
