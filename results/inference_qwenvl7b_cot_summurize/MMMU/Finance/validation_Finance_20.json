The company will sell the shares at the highest price that each investor is willing to pay. \n\nFrom the table, we can see that the highest price that any investor is willing to pay is $80 per share. Therefore, the company will sell 20,000 shares at $80 per share, 10,000 shares at $78 per share, and 15,000 shares at $73 per share. \nTo calculate the total receipts, we multiply the number of shares sold at each price by the price per share and sum the results:\nTotal receipts = ( (20,000 shares * $80 per share) + (10,000 shares * $78 per share) + (15,000 shares * $73 per share) = $1,600,000 + $780,000 + $1,095,000 = $3,475,000\nTherefore, the company's total receipts from the sale will be $3,475,000."
