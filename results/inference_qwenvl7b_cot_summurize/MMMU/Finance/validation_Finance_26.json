We know the present value and the annual amount, so we can rearrange the formula to solve for the discount rate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Discount Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Amount}}{\\text{Present Value}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Discount Rate} = \\frac{3,000}{50,000} = 0.06 \\]\n\nSo, the interest rate is 6%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. interest rate = 6.0%; present value = $50,000"
