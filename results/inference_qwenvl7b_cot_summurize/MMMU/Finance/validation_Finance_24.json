The return on equity ( (ROE) is 25%, which is the earnings retention rate.\n\n   E1 = ROE * ( (1 - Retention Rate)\n   E1 = 25% * $1 ( (1 - 60%)\n   E1 = $0.40\n\n2. **Calculate the current stock price ( (P0):**\n\n   The equity risk premium is 5%, and the government bond yield is 6%. The industry beta is 1.2.\n\n   The expected return on the stock is the risk-free rate plus the equity risk premium:\n   Expected Return = 6% + 5% = 11%\n\n   The expected return on the stock is also equal to the cost of equity:\n   Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * ( (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)\n   Cost of Equity = 6% + 1.2 * ( (11% - 6%)\n   Cost of Equity = 11.4%\n\n   The current stock price is the expected earnings per share divided by the cost of equity:\n   P0 = E1 / Cost of Equity\n   P0 = $0.40 / 11.4%\n   P0 = $3.51\n\n3. **Calculate the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio:**\n\n   P/E Ratio = P0 / E1\n   P/E Ratio = $3.51 / $0.40\n   P/E Ratio = 8.775\n\nTherefore, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the industry is approximately 8.78."
