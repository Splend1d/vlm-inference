                "text": "To determine the average price per share of the new stock sold during 2015, we need to calculate the total proceeds from the sale of new stock and then divide it by the number of new shares sold.\n\n1. **Calculate the total proceeds from the sale of new stock:**\n   - The total stockholders' equity in 2015 is $9,080,000.\n   - The total stockholders' equity in 2014 is $2,370,000.\n   - The increase in stockholders' equity is $9,080,000 - $2,370,000 = $6,710,000.\n   - This increase is due to the sale of new stock and retained earnings.\n\n2. **Calculate the proceeds from the sale of new stock:**\n   - The retained earnings increased from $1,520,000 in 2014 to $2,380,000 in 2015.\n   - The increase in retained earnings is $2,380,000 - $1,520,000 = $860,000.\n   - This increase is due to retained earnings and dividends paid.\n   - The dividends paid in 2015 were $240,000.\n   - Therefore, the proceeds from the sale of new stock are $860,000 - $240,000 = $620,000.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of new shares sold:**\n   - The total number of shares outstanding in 2015 is 1,200,000.\n   - The total number of shares outstanding in 2014 is 600,000.\n   - The increase in the number of shares outstanding is 1,200,000 - 600,000 = 600,000 shares.\n\n4. **Calculate the average price per share of the new stock sold:**\n   - The average price per share is the total proceeds from the sale of new stock divided by the number of new shares sold.\n   - Average price per share = $620,000 / 600,000 shares = $1.0333 per share.\n\nThe closest answer choice is:\nA. $7.25"
