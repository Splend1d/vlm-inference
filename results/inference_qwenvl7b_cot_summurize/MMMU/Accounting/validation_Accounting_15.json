We can do this by calculating the overtime wages per invoice for each month and then using that rate to predict the overtime wages for 6,500 invoices.\n\nFrom the table, we can see the following data:\n\n- January: 12,000 invoices, $7,760 overtime wages\n- February: 8,000 invoices, $6,800 overtime wages\n- March: 1,000 invoices, $6,000 overtime wages\n- April: 7,000 invoices, $6,100 overtime wages\n- May: 5,000 invoices, $6,200 overtime wages\n- June: 10,000 invoices, $7,300 overtime wages\n- July: 11,000 invoices, $7,400 overtime wages\n- August: 9,000 invoices, $6,900 overtime wages\n- September: 5,000 invoices, $6,500 overtime wages\n- October: 9,000 invoices, $6,600 overtime wages\n- November: 8,000 invoices, $6,800 overtime wages\n- December: 11,000 invoices, $7,450 overtime wages\n\nWe can calculate the overtime wages per invoice for each month:\n\n- January: $7,760 / 12,000 invoices = $0.647 per invoice\n- February: $6,800 / 8,000 invoices = $0.850 per invoice\n- March: $6,000 / 1,000 invoices = $6.000 per invoice\n- April: $6,100 / 7,000 invoices = $0.871 per invoice\n- May: $6,200 / 5,000 invoices = $1.240 per invoice\n- June: $7,300 / 10,000 invoices = $0.730 per invoice\n- July: $7,400 / 11,000 invoices = $0.673 per invoice\n- August: $6,900 / 9,000 invoices = $0.767 per invoice\n- September: $6,500 / 5,000 invoices = $1.300 per invoice\n- October: $6,600 / 9,000 invoices = $0.733 per invoice\n- November: $6,800 / 8,000 invoices = $0.850 per invoice\n- December: $7,450 / 11,000 invoices = $0.677 per invoice\n\nNow, we can use the average overtime wages per invoice to predict the overtime wages for 6,500 invoices:\n\nAverage overtime wages per invoice = ( (0.647 + 0.850 + 6.000 + 0.871 + 1.240 + 0.730 + 0.673 + 0.767 + 1.300 + 0.733 + 0.850 + 0.677) / 12 = $0.917 per invoice\n\nOvertime wages for 6,500 invoices = 6,500 invoices * $0.917 per invoice = $5,915.50\n\nThe closest option to $5,915.50 is:\n\nC. $5,040"
