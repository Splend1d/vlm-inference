A strangle is a portfolio of a put and a call with different exercise prices but the same expiration date. Donie gathers the TRT option-pricing data: <image 1> Calculate, at expiration for long strangle strategy, the Maximum possible loss per share.\n\nA. $9.00\nB. $5.00\nC. the Maximum  possible loss is unlimited\n"
