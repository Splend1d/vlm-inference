Volatility is not directly provided in the table, but we can infer it from the price of the options.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model for option pricing includes volatility as a parameter. However, in this case, we can use the implied volatility from the option prices. The implied volatility can be calculated using the Black-Scholes formula, but since we don't have the exact formula or the necessary inputs (like the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, and time to expiration), we will use a simpler approach.\n\nThe price of an option is influenced by the volatility of the underlying asset. Generally, the higher the volatility, the higher the price of the option, assuming all other factors are equal.\n\nGiven the prices of the options:\n- Option A: $10\n- Option B: $12\n\nSince Option B has a higher price, it implies that the underlying stock for Option B has a higher implied volatility compared to Option A.\n\nTherefore, the call option written on the stock with the higher volatility is:\n\nB.
