                "text": "To calculate the sales price per composite unit, we need to first determine the total sales revenue and total variable costs for the composite unit.\n\nThe composite unit is a weighted average of the three models based on their sales mix. The sales mix is given as 5:4:1 for Junior, Adult, and Expert, respectively. This means that for every 10 units sold, 5 are Junior, 4 are Adult, and 1 is Expert.\n\nLet's calculate the total sales revenue and total variable cost for the composite unit:\n\n1. **Total Sales Revenue:**\n   - Junior: 5 units * $50 = $250\n   - Adult: 4 units * $75 = $300\n   - Expert: 1 unit * $110 = $110\n   - Total Sales Revenue = $250 + $300 + $110 = $660\n\n2. **Total Variable Cost:**\n   - Junior: 5 units * $15 = $75\n   - Adult: 4 units * $25 = $100\n   - Expert: 1 unit * $60 = $60\n   - Total Variable Cost = $75 + $100 + $60 = $235\n\nNow, we can calculate the sales price per composite unit:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sales Price per Composite Unit} = \\frac{\\text{Total Sales Revenue}}{\\text{Total Units Sold}} \\]\n\nSince the total units sold are 10 ( (5 Junior + 4 Adult + 1 Expert), the sales price per composite unit is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sales Price per Composite Unit} = \\frac{\\$660}{10} = \\$66 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems to have an error in the provided options, as none of them match the calculated value. Let's re-examine the calculation:\n\nThe correct calculation should be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sales Price per Composite Unit} = \\frac{\\text{Total Sales Revenue}}{\\text{Total Units Sold}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Sales Price per Composite Unit} = \\frac{\\$660}{10} = \\$66 \\]\n\nIt appears there was a misunderstanding in the options provided. Based on the correct calculation, the sales price per composite unit is $66, which is not listed among the provided options. Therefore, the closest option to the calculated value is:\n\nA. $660"
