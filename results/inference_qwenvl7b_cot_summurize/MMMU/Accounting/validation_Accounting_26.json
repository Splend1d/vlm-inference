                "text": "To determine the new break-even point after a 10% price increase, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new sales price per unit.\n2. Calculate the new contribution margin per unit.\n3. Calculate the new break-even point in units and dollars.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the New Sales Price Per Unit\nThe current sales price per unit is $90. A 10% increase is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{New Sales Price} = \\text{Current Sales Price} + (\\text{Current Sales Price} \\times 10\\%) \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Sales Price} = 90 + ( (90 \\times 0.10) \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Sales Price} = 90 + 9 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Sales Price} = 99 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the New Contribution Margin Per Unit\nThe current contribution margin per unit is $50. Since the variable cost per unit remains the same, the new contribution margin per unit is:\n\\[ \\text{New Contribution Margin} = \\text{New Sales Price} - \\text{Variable Cost Per Unit} \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Contribution Margin} = 99 - 40 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Contribution Margin} = 59 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the New Break-Even Point in Units and Dollars\nThe new break-even point in units is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{New Break-Even Point ( (in units)} = \\frac{\\text{Fixed Costs}}{\\text{New Contribution Margin Per Unit}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Break-Even Point ( (in units)} = \\frac{20,650}{59} \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Break-Even Point ( (in units)} \\approx 350 \\]\n\nThe new break-even point in dollars is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{New Break-Even Point ( (in dollars)} = \\text{New Break-Even Point ( (in units)} \\times \\text{New Sales Price Per Unit} \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Break-Even Point ( (in dollars)} = 350 \\times 99 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Break-Even Point ( in dollars)} = 34,650 \\]\n\nSo, the new break-even point is approximately 350 units and $34,650.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. 350 units and $34,647.65"
