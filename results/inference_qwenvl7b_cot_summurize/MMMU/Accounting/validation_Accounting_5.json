                "text": "To calculate the equivalent units for conversion cost using the weighted-average method, we need to consider both the units started and the units in beginning work in process inventory. The equivalent units are calculated by multiplying the units by the percentage of completion for conversion.\n\nHere are the steps to calculate the equivalent units for each quarter:\n\n1. **Quarter 1:**\n   - Units started: 255,000\n   - Units in beginning work in process: 0\n   - Units transferred out: 235,000\n   - Conversion completion: 50%\n   - Equivalent units for conversion: \\(255,000 \\times 50\\% = 127,500\\)\n\n2. **Quarter 2:**\n   - Units started: 275,000\n   - Units in beginning work in process: 250,000\n   - Units transferred out: 250,000\n   - Conversion completion: 40%\n   - Equivalent units for conversion: \\(275,000 \\times 40\\% + 250,000 \\times 40\\% = 110,000 + 100,000 = 210,000\\)\n\n3. **Quarter 3:**\n   - Units started: 290,000\n   - Units in beginning work in process: 275,000\n   - Units transferred out: 275,000\n   - Conversion completion: 45%\n   - Equivalent units for conversion: \\(290,000 \\times 45\\% + 275,000 \\times 45\\% = 131,500 + 123,750 = 255,250\\)\n\n4. **Quarter 4:**\n   - Units start: 300,000\n   - Units in beginning work in process: 650,000\n   - Units transferred out: 280,000\n   - Conversion completion: 60%\n   - Equivalent units for conversion: \\(300,000 \\times 60\\% + 650,000 \\times 60\\% = 180,000 + 378,000 = 558,000\\)\n\nNow, we add up the equivalent units for conversion for each quarter:\n\n- Quarter 1: 127,500\n- Quarter 2: 210,000\n- Quarter 3: 255,250\n- Quarter 4: 558,000\n\nTotal equivalent units for conversion: \\(127,500 + 210,000 + 255,250 + 558,000 = 1,140,750\\)\n\nHowever, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the provided options, as the total equivalent units calculated do not match any of the given options. The correct calculation should be:\n\n- Total equivalent units for conversion: \\(127,500 + 210,000 + 255,250 + 558,000 = 1,140,750\\)\n\nGiven the options provided, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a typo in the question or the options. The correct answer based on the calculation is not listed among the options provided."
