                "text": "To determine the per unit manufacturing overhead costs incurred when 30,000 units are produced, we need to understand the nature of the manufacturing overhead costs. Manufacturing overhead costs can be either fixed or variable. Fixed manufacturing overhead costs do not change with the level of production, while variable manufacturing overhead costs do.\n\nGiven the cost data for 25,000 units of production:\n\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead: $6 per unit\n- Variable manufacturing overhead: $2 per unit\n\nThe total manufacturing overhead cost for 25,000 units is:\n\\[ \\text{Total Manufacturing Overhead} = (\\text{Fixed Manufacturing Overhead} + \\text{Variable Manufacturing Overhead}) \\times \\text{Units Produced} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total Manufacturing Overhead} = (6 + 2) \\times 25,000 = \\$8 \\times 25,000 = \\$200,000 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the per unit manufacturing overhead cost for 30,000 units. Since the fixed manufacturing overhead remains constant, we only need to adjust for the variable manufacturing overhead.\n\nThe variable manufacturing overhead per unit remains the same at $2 per unit. Therefore, for 30,000 units, the variable manufacturing overhead would be:\n\\[ \\text{Variable Manufacturing Overhead for 30,000 units} = 30,000 \\times 2 = \\$60,000 \\]\n\nThe total manufacturing overhead for 30,000 units would be the same as for 25,000 units, since the fixed manufacturing overhead does not change:\n\\[ \\text{Total Manufacturing Overhead for 30,000 units} = \\$200,000 \\]\n\nTo find the per unit manufacturing overhead for 30,000 units, we divide the total manufacturing overhead by the number of units:\n\\[ \\text{Per Unit Manufacturing Overhead} = \\frac{\\text{Total Manufacturing Overhead}}{\\text{Units Produced}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Per Unit Manufacturing Overhead} = \\frac{\\$200,000}{30,000} = \\$6.67 \\]\n\nTherefore, the per unit manufacturing overhead cost incurred when 30,000 units are produced is approximately $6.67. However, since the options provided are whole numbers, the closest option to $6.67 is:\n\nA. $6"
