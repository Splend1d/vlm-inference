One of the studies was from Jiangsu Province, China, and the study design was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (phase III trial), which included a total of 10,077 healthy children aged 6-35 months. The primary outcome indicator was the incidence of EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina, according to the 0- and 28-day immunisation schedule, using block (one group of 10 persons) randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation of study participants to EV71 vaccine or placebo, and follow-up monitoring for 12 months, and the results were shown in the table below.<image 1> The protective rate against all EV71 related diseases was\n\nA. 100%\nB. 94.8%\nC. 94.6%\nD. 88.1%\n"

                "text": "To determine the protective rate against all EV71-related diseases, we need to calculate the proportion of EV71-related diseases in the vaccination group compared to the placebo group.\n\nFirst, let's summarize the data from the table:\n\n- **Vaccination group ( (4973.2 person years)**\n  - New cases of EV71-related hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina: 5\n  - New cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease: 5\n  - New cases of herpangina: 0\n  - New cases of EV71-related hospitalization events: 0\n  - New cases of EV71-related Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease with Combined Neurological Complications: 0\n  - Total new cases of all EV71-related diseases: 13\n\n- **Placebo group ( (4873.0 person years)**\n  - New cases of EV71-related hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina: 94\n  - New cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease: 90\n  - New cases of herpangina: 4\n  - New cases of EV71-related hospitalization events: 24\n  - New cases of EV71-related Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease with Combined Neurological Complications: 8\n  - Total new cases of all EV71-related diseases: 106\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of person-years for both groups:\n- Vaccination group: 4973.2 person years\n- Placebo group: 4873.0 person years\n\nTotal person-years = 4973.2 + 4873.0 = 9846.2 person years\n\nNow, we calculate the number of person-years for each group:\n- Vaccination group: 4973.2 person years\n- Placebo group: 4873.0 person years\n\nThe protective rate is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Protective rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of person-years in the placebo group} - \\text{Number of person-years in the vaccination group}}{\\text{Number of person-years in the placebo group}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Protective rate} = \\left( \\frac{4873.0 - 4973.2}{4873.0} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Protective rate} = \\left( \\frac{-100.2}{4873.0} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Protective rate} = -2.06\\% \\]\n\nThe protective rate is negative, which indicates that the vaccination group had a higher incidence of EV71-related diseases compared to the placebo group. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 100%"
