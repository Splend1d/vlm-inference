We want to compare the proportions of patients who developed an infection between the two hospitals.\n\nHere are the options:\n\nA. **Independent samples t test**: This test is used for comparing means between two independent groups. Since our data is categorical, this test is not appropriate.\n\nB. **Fisher's Exact test**: This test is used for comparing proportions in a contingency table, especially when sample sizes are small. It is suitable for our data.\n\nC. **Kappa**: This is a measure of agreement between two raters's classifications. It is not suitable for comparing proportions.\n\nD. **McNemar's test**: This test is used for comparing paired proportions. It is not suitable for comparing proportions between two independent groups.\n\nGiven that we have two independent groups ( Hospital A and Hospital B, and we want to compare the proportions of patients who developed an infection, the most appropriate test is:\n\n**B.
