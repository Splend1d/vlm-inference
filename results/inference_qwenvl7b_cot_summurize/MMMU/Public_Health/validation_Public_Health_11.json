                "text": "To determine which measure of association can be calculated from the given data, let's analyze the table and the options provided:\n\n1. **PAR ( Population Attributable Risk**:\n   - PAR is the proportion of cases in the population that can be attributed to a specific exposure. It is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     PAR = \\frac{P(E|R) - P(E)}{1 - P(E)}\n     \\]\n   - Where \\( P(E|R) \\) is the prevalence of the exposure in the presence of the disease, and \\( P(E) \\) is the prevalence of the exposure in the population.\n\n2. **AR. Attributable Risk**:\n   - AR is the absolute risk increase due to the exposure. It is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     AR = P(E|R) - P(E)\n     \\]\n   - Where \\( P(E|R) \\) is the prevalence of the exposure in the presence of the disease, and \\( P(E) \\) is the prevalence of the exposure in the population.\n\n3. **RR. Relative Risk**:\n   - RR is the ratio of the risk of developing the disease in the exposed group to the risk of developing the disease in the unexposed group. It is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     RR = \\frac{P(E|R)}{P(E)}\n     \\]\n   - Where \\( P(E|R) \\) is the prevalence of the exposure in the presence of the disease, and \\( P(E) \\) is the prevalence of the exposure in the population.\n\n4. **OR. Odds Ratio**:\n   - OR is the ratio of the odds of developing the disease in the exposed group to the odds of developing the disease in the unexposed group. It is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     OR = \\frac{P(E|R)}{P(E)}\n     \\]\n   - Where \\( P(E|R) \\) is the prevalence of the exposure in the presence of the disease, and \\( P(E) \\) is the prevalence of the exposure in the population.\n\nGiven the data in the table:\n- Number of smokers with lung cancer: 150\n- Number of smokers without lung cancer: 100\n- Number of non-smokers with lung cancer: 50\n- Number of non-smokers without lung cancer: 200\n\nWe can calculate the following:\n- \\( P(E) \\) ( the prevalence of smoking in the population: \\( \\frac{150 + 100}{250} = \\frac{250}{250} = 1 \\)\n- \\( p(E|R) \\) the prevalence of smoking in the lung cancer patients: \\( \\frac{150}{250} = 0.6 \\)\n- \\( p(E) \\) the prevalence of smoking in the non-lung cancer patients: \\( \\frac{100 + 200}{250} = \\frac{300}{250} = 1.2 \\)\n\nNow, let's calculate each measure:\n- **PAR**:\n  \\[\n  PAR = \\frac{0.6 - 1}{1 - 1} = \\frac{-0.4}{0} \\text{ ( undefined}\n  \\]\n- **AR**:\n  \\[\n  AR = 0.6 - 1 = -0.4\n  \\]\n- **RR**:\n  \\[\n  RR = \\frac{0.6}{1.2} = 0.5\n  \\]\n- **OR**:\n  \\[\n  OR = \\frac{0.6}{1.2} = 0.5\n  \\]\n\nFrom the calculations, we can see that the measures that can be calculated from the given data are:\n- **AR** ( Attributable Risk\n- **RR** Relative Risk\n- **OR** Odds Ratio\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. OR"
