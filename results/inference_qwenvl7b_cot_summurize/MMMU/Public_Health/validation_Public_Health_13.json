The food that has the highest ratio of people who got sick to people who ate it is the most likely cause of the outbreak.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio for each food:\n\n1. Cold chicken:\n   - Number of people who ate it: 86\n   - Number of people who got sick: 34\n   - Ratio: 34 / 86 \u2248 00.47\n\n2. Potato salad:\n   - Number of people who ate it: 54\n   - Number of people who got sick: 38\n   - Ratio: 38 / 54 \u2248 0.7\n\n3. Egg sandwiches:\n   - Number of people who ate it: 76\n   - Number of people who got sick: 40\n   - Ratio: 40 / 76 \u2248 0.53\n\n4. Fruit pie and cream:\n   - Number of people who ate it: 32\n   - Number of people who got sick: 12\n   - Ratio: 12 / 32 \u2248 0.375\n\n5. Cheese:\n   - Number of people who ate it: 48\n   - Number of people who got sick: 12\n   - Ratio: 12 / 48 \u2248 0.25\n\nThe food with the highest ratio of people who got sick to people who ate it is Egg sandwiches, with a ratio of approximately 0.53.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the outbreak of food poisoning is:\n\nC. Egg sandwiches"
