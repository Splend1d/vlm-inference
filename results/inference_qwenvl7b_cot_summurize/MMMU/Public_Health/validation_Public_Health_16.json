Women taking OC had an increased risk of pulmonary, cerebral, and coronary thrombosis or embolism.A larger case-control study was conducted in the United States between 1976-1978 by Shapiro et al. to explore the relationship between OC use and myocardial infarction(MI) in women under 50 years of age.The age distribution of the MI and control groups and OC exposure among MI patients and controls in each age group were shown in the table below.<image 1> The 95% CI for OR in 25-29 years was\n\nA.
