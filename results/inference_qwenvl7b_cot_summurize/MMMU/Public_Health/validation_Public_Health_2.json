The past alcohol consumption of the study subjects was investigated, along with variables such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI>24 as overweight). Considering that body mass index may be a potential confounder when analysing the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension, it needs to be analysed and judged. The following table presents unstratified information on the relationship between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive disorders. <image 1> The cOR between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive is\n\nA. 1.70\nB. 2.50\nC. 3.20\nD. 4.80\n"

The odds ratio compares the odds of having hypertension in the group that drinks alcohol to the odds of having hypertension in the group that does not drink alcohol.\n\nThe formula for the odds ratio is:\n\\[ OR = \\frac{(\\text{Cases who drink alcohol and have hypertension}) \\times (\\text{Controls who do not drink alcohol and have hypertension})}{(\\text{Cases who drink alcohol and do not have hypertension}) \\times (\\text{Controls who do not drink alcohol and do not have hypertension})} \\]\n\nFrom the table:\n- Cases who drink alcohol and have hypertension: 73\n- Cases who drink alcohol and do not have hypertension: 81\n- Controls who do not drink alcohol and have hypertension: 202\n- Controls who do not drink alcohol and do not have hypertension: 381\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\\[ OR = \\frac{73 \\times 202}{81 \\times 381} \\]\n\nCalculating the values:\n\\[ OR = \\frac{14916}{31111} \\approx 4.80 \\]\n\nSo, the correlation between drinking alcohol and hypertension is approximately 4.80.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 4.80"
