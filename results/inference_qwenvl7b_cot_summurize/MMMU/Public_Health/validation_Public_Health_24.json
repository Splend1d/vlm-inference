The cases are marked with circles and triangles.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of cases in 2010**: Sum the number of cases for each month.\n   - January: 1 case\n   - February: 1 case\n   - March: 1 case\n   - April: 1 case\n   - May: 1 case\n   - June: 1 case\n   - July: 1 case\n   - August: 1 case\n   - September: 1 case\n   - October: 1 case\n   - November: 1 case\n   - December: 1 case\n\n   Total number of cases = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12 cases\n\n3. **Calculate the incidence rate**: Incidence rate is the number of new cases per 1,000 population. The population at the beginning of 2010 was 2,528.\n\n   Incidence rate = ( (Total number of cases / Population at the beginning of the year) * 1000\n   Incidence rate = ( (12 / 2528) * 1000\n   Incidence rate = 0.476%\n\n4. **Round to the nearest hundredth**: The closest option to 0.476% is 0.48%.\n\nTherefore, the incidence in 2010 is approximately 0.48%.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 0.40%"
