It ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 0 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, a value of  0 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and a value of  0 indicates no linear relationship.\n\n2. **Regression Coefficient ( tb:**\n   - The regression coefficient, tb, is the slope of the regression line. It represents the change in the dependent variable ( for a one-unit change in the independent variable x. It is calculated as the covariance of x and y divided by the variance of x.\n\n3. **Relationship Between tr and tb:**\n   - In a simple linear regression model, the correlation coefficient tr and the regression coefficient tb are related by the formula:\n     \\[\n     tb = \\frac{tr \\cdot \\sigma_y}{\\sigma_x}\n     \\]\n     where \\(\\sigma_y\\) is the standard deviation of the dependent variable y, and \\(\\sigma_x\\) is the standard deviation of the independent variable x.\n\n4. **Interpretingation:**\n   - If both x and y follow a normal distribution, the correlation coefficient tr and the regression coefficient tb are related in such a way that the regression coefficient is a scaled version of the correlation coefficient.\n   - The regression coefficient tb is always less than or equal to the absolute value of the correlation coefficient tr.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. tr>tb\n- B. tr<tb\n- C. tr=tb\n- D. tr\u2260tb\n\nSince the regression coefficient tb is always less than or equal to the absolute value of the correlation coefficient tr, the correct answer is:\n\nB. tr<tb"
