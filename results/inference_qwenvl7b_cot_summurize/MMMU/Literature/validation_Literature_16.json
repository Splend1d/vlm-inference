Chronological plot - This term refers to a plot that unfolds in a linear, time-ordered sequence. This alignss with the description of the plot in 'Charlotte's Web', which follows the events of the story in a specific period of time and in a specific order.\n\nB. Episodic plot - This term refers to a plot that is divided into separate, distinct episodes or segments. This does not fit the description of 'Charlotte's Web'.\n\nC. Nonlinear plot - This term refers to a plot that does not follow a chronological order. This does not fit the description of 'Charlotte's Web'.\n\nD. Progressive plot - This term refers to a plot that moves forward in a steady, progressive manner. This does not fit the description of 'Charlotte's Web'.\n\nGiven the options, the term that best describes a plot that covers a specific period of time and events in a chronological order is:\n\nA. Chronological plot\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
