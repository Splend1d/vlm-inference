Science Fiction - This refers to a genre of literature and media that involves imaginary or futuristic concepts, not the study of living organisms.\n\nB. Biological Science - This term specifically refers to the scientific study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment.\n\nC. Physical Science Or Natural Science - This term encompasses the scientific study of non-living matter and natural phenomena, not specifically living organisms.\n\nD. Applied Science - This term refers to the application of scientific knowledge to practical problems, which is not the primary focus of biological science.\n\nGiven this analysis, the term that best describes the field dealing with living organisms and the laws and phenomena that relate to any organism or group of organisms is:\n\nB.
