Choral Reading - This involves reading aloud in unison or parts with a whole class, small group, or individual students so that students hear the text at the same time they read it. This is the most fitting description for the activity depicted in the image.\n\nB. Literature Circle - This refers to a small group discussion of a literary work, typically led by a teacher or a student.\n\nC. Readers Theatre - This is a form of dramatic reading where students perform a script, often with minimal props and costumes.\n\nD. Shared Reading - This involves the teacher reading aloud to the class, often accompanied by discussions and questions.\n\nGiven the context of the image, where students are sitting in a classroom and appear to be engaged in a reading activity, the term that best fits is:\n\nA.
