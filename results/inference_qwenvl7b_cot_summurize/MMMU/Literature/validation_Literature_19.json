It does not necessarily emphasize feeling, intuition, imagination, or the supernatural.\n\nB. **Romanticism** - This movement is characterized by a focus on emotion, individualism, and the supernatural. It often values imagination and the beauty of nature, which can be seen in the painting.\n\nC. **Realism** - This movement is known for its focus on everyday life and the accurate depiction of reality. It does not typically emphasize feeling, intuition, imagination, or the supernatural.\n\nD. **Transcendentalism** - This movement emphasizes the importance of individual intuition and the belief in a higher power. It often values nature and the spiritual.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the group that most values feeling, intuition, imagination, and the supernatural is:\n\nB. Romanticism"
