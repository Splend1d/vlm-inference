They are not necessarily about a contemporary twist or a new perspective.\n\n2. **Fractured Folktales**: These are traditional tales that have been altered or updated in some way, often with a humorous or satirical twist. They often retain the basic elements of the original story but present them in a new or unexpected way.\n\n3. **Humorous Tale**: This term refers to a story that is intended to be funny. While the image might be humorous, it is not specifically about a humorous tale.\n\n4. **Retold Tale**: This term refers to a story that has been told in a new way, often with a different setting, characters, or plot. It is similar to a fractured tale but emphasizes the retelling aspect.\n\nGiven the image, which shows a humorous and updated version of a traditional tale, the term that best fits is:\n\n**B. Fractured Folktales**"
