The figure shows a plot diagram with different sections labeled.\n2. The exposition is the initial part of the plot where the setting, characters, and the basic situation are introduced.\n3. The falling action is the part of the plot where the tension decreases and the conflict is resolved.\n4. The climax is the highest point of tension and conflict in the plot.\n5. The rising action is the part of the plot where the tension begins to decrease after the climax.\n\nGiven these definitions, the exposition is the part of the plot where the conflict is introduced. Therefore, the correct term is:\n\nC. exposition"
