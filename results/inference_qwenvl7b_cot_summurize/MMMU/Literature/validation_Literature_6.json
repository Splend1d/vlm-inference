Diagonal line - Diagonal lines often suggest movement and dynamism, which do not typically evoke a sense of calm and tranquility.\n\nB. Horizontal line - Horizontal lines are often associated with stability and calmness. They can represent the horizon and the calmness of the ocean or open prairies.\n\nC. Vertical line - Vertical lines can suggest height and stability, but they are less commonly associated with the calm and tranquility of the ocean and open prairies compared to horizontal lines.\n\nD. List spacing - This term refers to the space between items in a list and is not related to lines or their impressions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the term that refers to lines that give the impression of calm and tranquility is:\n\nB.
