This law suggests that there is an optimal level of arousal for performance, with both very low and very high levels of arousal leading to decreased performance.\n\nLet's analyze each graph:\n\nA. <image 1> - This graph shows a U-shaped curve, indicating that performance increases with increasing arousal up to an optimal point, after which it decreases. This matches the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nB. <image 2> - This graph shows a linear increase in performance with increasing arousal, which does not match the typical U-shaped pattern of Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nC. <image 3> - This graph shows a linear increase in performance with increasing arousal, which does not match the typical U-shaped pattern of Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nD. <image 4> - This graph shows a U-shaped curve similar to option A, but it is inverted. This also also matches the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nE. <image 5> - This graph shows a linear decrease in performance with increasing arousal, which does not match the typical U-shaped pattern of Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\nGiven the options, the graph that best represents the relationship between arousal and performance according to Yerkes-Dodson Law is:\n\nA. <image 1>\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. <image 1>"
