                "text": "An underlying belief in the theory of embodied cognition is that the understanding of cognition must include the interaction of the environment with the body. Proponents argue that human cognition evolved from primary sensorimotor processing and this necessitates understanding cognitive mechanisms as an interaction between the mind and body. An example of embodied cognition can be seen in mental imagery. There is strong evidence in favor of the visual imagery of an action conflicting with the performance of that action, such as visualizing an 'X' while writing an 'O'. Memory is also believed to be embodied. Proponents of theories of embodied cognition view memory as a representation of the event or object, linked to the sensorimotor information, which defines the possibilities of that event or object. To test whether sensorimotor experience aids decision making, researchers asked professional hockey players and people unfamiliar with hockey to read aloud either sentences that described hockey-specific situations or situations encountered in a normal day. An example of a hockey specific situation was reading the sentence \"the player knocked over the net\" and a picture of a hockey net tipped over (match) or right side up (mismatch) was displayed. An example of a situation encountered in a normal day was \"an umbrella was put into the closet\", with a closed (match) or open (mismatch) umbrella pictured. The subject pressed a button to indicate the sentence had been read; a fixation point was shown for 500 msec before a picture was displayed. The time was recorded between the picture presentation and the response of match or mismatch. Figure 1 shows the data from this experiment. Figure 1: The mean accuracy for matched and mismatched sentence/picture combinations for expert hockey players and people unfamiliar with hockey. Results for both hockey and nonhockey related scenarios are displayed. <image 1> How does the model for embodied cognition differ from the information-processing model?\n\nA.

The information-processing model is often characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer; however, the embodied cognition model views cognition as a product of represent actions, environment, and past experience.\n- This the information-processing model is often characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer; however, the embodied cognition model views cognition as a product of represent actions, environment, and past experience.\n\nThis option correctly identifies that the information-processing model often uses a metaphor of the mind like a computer, which is rule-based and logic-driven. In contrast, the embodied cognition model views cognition as a product of actions, environment, and past experience, which is more interactive and context-dependent.\n\nB. Both models are characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer, rule based and logic driven; however, the embodied cognition model views cognition as passive and problem solving as being based on the computation of inputs and outputs.\n- This both models are characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer, rule based and logic driven; however, the embodied cognition model views cognition as passive and problem solving as being based on the computation of inputs and outputs.\n\nThis option incorrectly states that both models are characterized by a metaphor of the mind like a computer, which is not accurate for the information-processing model. Additionally, it incorrectly suggests that the embodied cognition model views cognition as passive, which is not the case.\n\nC. They are essentially the same.\n- They are essentially the the same.\n\nThis option is incorrect because the embodied cognition model and the information-processing model have fundamentally different views on how cognition occurs. The embodied cognition model emphasizes the role of the body and environment in cognition, while the information-processing model focuses on the mind as a computer-like system.\n\nD. The embodied cognition model is characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer; however, the information-processing model views cognition as a product of represent actions, environment, and past experience.\n- The embodied cognition model is characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer; however, the information-processing model views cognition as a product of represent actions, environment, and past experience.\n\nThis option incorrectly states that the embodied cognition model is characterized by a metaphor of the mind like a computer, which is not accurate. It also also incorrectly suggests that the information-processing model views cognition as a a product of represent actions, environment, and past experience, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
