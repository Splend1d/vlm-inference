                "text": "The interference resulting from the performance of two simultaneous cognitive tasks can be categorized as either domain-general or domain-specific. Domain-general interference results from a lack of overall cognitive resources to attend to both tasks. A domain-specific interference is related to a lack of resources in a specific system, such as the visual or motor system. Recent research has suggested that language regarding visual and motoric content may engage some of the same systems through mental simulation, rather than engaging separate systems for language and perceptual systems. Studies have shown following distance increases with increased distraction or weather related stress. Other researchers wanted to understand the implications of this research on driving ability. They set up an experiment to test the effects of content specific language involving visual, motor, or abstract content on reaction times and following distance. All participants spoke English fluently and underwent training to ensure competence in the driving simulator did not affect their performance of the task. Participants were required to keep both hands on the wheel during the experiment. After the driving simulation began, the participants had to respond to a battery of true and false questions in each language condition. A possible visual language condition sentence is 'A stop sign is green'; a correct response is speaking the word 'false'. Sentences in the motor condition included fine motor details and differed from required movements for driving (e.g. 'It is possible to crush a remote between the thumb and first finger'; similarly, this would require speaking 'false'). Abstract sentences were taken from the U.S. citizenship exam (e.g. 'The American Civil War took place before WWII'; 'true'). The mean following distance from the pace car for each of the three language conditions and a control group (asked to repeat the word 'true' or 'false') is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: The mean following distance between the participant's vehicle and the vehicle in front of the participant in the simulation. There were significant differences between pairwise comparisons in all conditions. <image 1> The term 'LBFS (Look But Failed to See) accident' has crept into the nomenclature to describe an accident where the driver looked in a direction, only to be hit by an oncoming vehicle that should have been highly visible from that same direction. Which of these would NOT account for this problem?\n\nA. Saccadic masking occurrence, in which moving eyes are rendered temporarily blind\nB. Driving on an unfamiliar road\nC. Domain-general and domain-specific interference\nD. An experienced driver's existing schema does not match an oncoming car\n"

This could explain why a driver might not see an oncoming vehicle despite looking in the direction of the oncoming vehicle.\n\nB. **Driving on an unfamiliar road**:\n   - This could account for the problem because unfamiliar roads might cause increased distraction or stress, leading to reduced attention to the road and oncoming vehicles.\n\nC. **Domain-general and domain-specific interference**:\n   - This refers to the interference resulting from the performance of two simultaneous cognitive tasks. This could explain why a driver might not see an oncoming vehicle due to being distracted by other tasks or thoughts.\n\nD. **An experienced driver's existing schema does not match an oncoming car**:\n   - This suggests that the driver's expectations or mental models do not align with the actual situation. This could explain why a driver might not see an oncoming vehicle if their mental model does not include the presence of an oncoming vehicle.\n\nGiven the options, the one that would NOT account for the problem of \"LBFS\" accidents is:\n\n**B. Driving on an unfamiliar road**\n\nDriving on an unfamiliar road can indeed lead to increased distraction and stress, but it is not a direct explanation for why a driver might not see an oncoming vehicle due to their existing schema or mental models."
