At the end of the dual-task presentation, the students were tested both for their memory of the passage and their memory of the photographs. To establish a baseline for this dual-task condition, the same students also were tested for their memory when each of the component tasks was presented alone. The following graph shows the results. <image 1> In a study of the effectiveness of divided attention, it is most important that the experimental design include\n\nA. a counterbalance of the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions\nB. a consistent order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions\nC. an equal number of men and women as participants\nD. verification that participants believe themselves capable of dividing attention\n"

The graph shows the memory performance for prose and photographs under both the dual-task and baseline ( (single-task) conditions.\n\n1. **Counterbalance of the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions**:\n   - This is important to control for any order effects. If participants are tested in a different order in the baseline and dual-task conditions, it could introduce bias into the results.\n\n2. **A consistent order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions**:\n   - This is less important than counterbalancing the order. Consistency in order does not control for potential order effects.\n\n3. **An equal number of men and women as participants**:\n   - While gender distribution is important for demographic representation, it is not directly related to the effectiveness of divided attention.\n\n4. **Verification that participants believe themselves capable of dividing attention**:\n   - This is important for the participants' confidence but not for the experimental design itself. It does not control for potential order effects or other biases.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most important aspect of the experimental design is to include a counterbalance of the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions to control for any potential order effects.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. a counterbalance of the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions"
