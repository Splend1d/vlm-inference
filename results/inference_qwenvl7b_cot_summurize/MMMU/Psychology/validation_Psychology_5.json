The brain is divided into different lobes, each with a distinct color.\n\nThe arrow is pointing to the pink region, which is located on the front part of the brain.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. parietal lobe - located at the back of the brain.\nB. temporal lobes - located on the sides of the brain.\nC. cerebral cortex - the outer layer of the brain.\nD. occipital lobe - located at the back of the brain, near the occipital bone.\n\nThe pink region is part of the cerebral cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. cerebral cortex"
