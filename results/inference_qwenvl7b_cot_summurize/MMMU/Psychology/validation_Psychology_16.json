                "text": "Researchers studying vision use various methods to investigate human perceptual experience. Research on spectral sensitivity of the rod receptors (scattered throughout the retina) and cone visual receptors (mainly concentrated in the fovea area of the retina) highlights the relationship between perception and physiology. Signal detection methods have been used to measure the differences in how perception adjusts to low-light environments. Participant responses can be plotted based on sensitivity versus length of time in the dark. The dark adaptation curve can be plotted showing how rods and cones differ in their sensitivity to light over time. The following graph shows a plot of three calculated dark adaptation curves. <image 1> Which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. Rods are responsible for color vision, which explains color sensitivity under low-light conditions.\nB. Cones are responsible for color vision, which explains greater color sensitivity under low-light conditions.\nC. Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.\nD. Both rods and cones respond to specific colors in the light spectrum; loss of color vision in dark conditions is the result of fewer photons of light.\n"

                "text": "The correct answer is C. Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.\n\nExplanation:\n- Rods receptors are responsible for vision in low-light conditions and are not sensitive to color. They respond to changes in light intensity but do not distinguish between different wavelengths of light.\n- Cones, on the other hand, are responsible for color vision and are more sensitive to specific wavelengths of light. They are mainly concentrated in the fovea area of the retina.\n- In low-light conditions, rods become more sensitive, but they do not have the ability to distinguish colors, which is why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions."
