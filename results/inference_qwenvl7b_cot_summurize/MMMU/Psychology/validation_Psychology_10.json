The lobe labeled 1 is located at the front of the brain and is colored in a light brownish color. This is typically the frontal lobe.\n2. The lobe labeled 2 is located towards the back of the brain and is colored in a purpleish color. This is typically the parietal lobe.\n3. The lobe labeled 3 is located at the back of the brain and is colored in a blueish color. This is typically the occipital lobe.\n4. The lobe labeled 4 is located towards the side of the brain and is colored in an orangeish color. This is typically the temporal lobe.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the lobes labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 is:\n\nC. Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe"
