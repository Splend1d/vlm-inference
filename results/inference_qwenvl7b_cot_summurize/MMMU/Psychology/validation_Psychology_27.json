All groups were given the same set of questions in an exam, but the exam began with a brief introductory statement that differed for each group, establishing differing expectations for student performance, as follows: Group A: The introduction stated that most students are expected to pass the exam. Group B: The introduction stated that most students are expected to fail the exam. Group C: The introduction included statistics that showed female students performing worse than male students on similar exams. Group D: The introduction contained no information on expected performance. The results of the experiment are given in the bar graph below: <image 1> What phenomenon best explains the performance differences between Groups A and B?\n\nA. Social facilitation\nB. Group polarization\nC. Self-serving bias\nD. Unstable attribution\nE. The Pygmalion effect\n"

This effect describes how expectations can influence the behavior and performance of individuals. In this case, the expectation that most students will pass the exam ( (Group A) led to better performance, while the expectation that most students will fail the exam ( (Group B) led to poorer performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nE. The Pygmalion effect"
