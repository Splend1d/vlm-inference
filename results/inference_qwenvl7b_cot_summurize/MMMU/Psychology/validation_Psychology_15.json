The graph shows the percentage of aggressive behavior among elementary school girls and boys exposed to different levels of media violence.\n2. There is a clear trend: as the exposure to media violence increases, the percentage of aggressive behavior also increases for both boys and girls.\n\nObservational learning is a psychological theory that explains how people learn through observing the actions and outcomes of others. This theory suggests that individuals can learn new behaviors by watching others, even if they do not engage in the behavior themselves.\n\nGiven this, the most effective explanation for the data is:\n\nE.
