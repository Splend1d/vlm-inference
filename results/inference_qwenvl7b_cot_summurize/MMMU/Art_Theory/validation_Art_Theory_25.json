The style and technique of the painting, including the use of perspective and the detailed depiction of figures and objects, are characteristic of the Northern Renaissance.\n\nGiven these observations, the painting is most likely created by:\n\nB. Hugo van der Goes\n\nHugo van der Goes was a Flemish painter known for his detailed and realistic works, often featuring religious themes."
