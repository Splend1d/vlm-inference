The figure is a bronze statue of a young man holding a sword and wearing a helmet.\n2. The style and details of the statue suggest it is a work of art from the Renaissance period.\n3. The options are:\n   - A. Bemini\n   - B. Donatello\n   - C. Ghiberti\n   - D. Verrocchio\n\nDonatello is known for his work in the Renaissance period, and his style is consistent with the figure in the image. Bemini, Ghiberti, and Verrocchio are also Renaissance artists, but their styles and known works do not match the figure in the image as closely as Donatello's work.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Donatello"
