The sculpture features abstract geometric shapes and a modernist aesthetic.\n2. The use of metal and the minimalist design are indicative of modernist art movements.\n3. The style is reminiscent of the works of artists from the mid-20th century, particularly those associated with the Abstract Expressionism or Modernist movements.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely decade for this work is:\n\nC. 1960's\n\nThis period alignss with the rise of modernist art movements and the use of metal in sculpture."
