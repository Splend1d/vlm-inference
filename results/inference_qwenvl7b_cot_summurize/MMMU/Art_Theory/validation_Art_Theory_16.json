The presence of a choir and transept suggests that this is a church or cathedral.\n\n2. **Image 2**: This is a perspective drawing of a building with a central nave and side aisles, similar to the layout in Image 1. The structure also has a central nave with side aisles and a choir, indicating it is likely a church or cathedral.\n\nGiven the architectural features visible in both images, the building in question is a church or cathedral. \n\n- **A. a vaulted ceiling**: This is not visible in the floor plan or the perspective drawing.\n- **B. pedimental recesses**: These are not present in the floor plan or the perspective drawing.\n- **C. radiate chapels**: This is not visible in the floor plan or the perspective drawing.\n- **D. an atrium**: This is not visible in the floor plan or the perspective drawing.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. an atrium"
