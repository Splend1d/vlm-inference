The church in the first image does not have these characteristics.\n\n3. **Basilicas**: Basilicas are characterized by a long, rectangular nave with a central aisle and side aisles, often with a large central space and a high ceiling. The church in the first image has a similar layout with a central nave and side aisles, which is indicative of a basilica design.\n\n4. **Forums**: Forums are public squares with a central temple or other important building, surrounded by shops and other public buildings. The church in the first image does not resemble the layout of a forum.\n\nGiven the analysis, the design of the church in the first image is most influenced by:\n\nC. basilicas"
