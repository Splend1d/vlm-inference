For \\( x = 2 \\), the greatest integer less than or equal to 2 is 2 itself.\n\nLet's examine the values of \\( [x] \\) for \\( x \\) approaching 2 from both sides:\n\n1. As \\( x \\) approaches 2 from the left ( (\\( x < 2 \\)), the greatest integer less than \\( x \\) is 1.\n2. As \\( x \\) approaches 2 from the right (\\( x > 2 \\)), the greatest integer less than \\( x \\) is 2.\n\nSince the limit from the left is 1 and the limit from the right is 2, the limit does not exist because the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit are not equal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
