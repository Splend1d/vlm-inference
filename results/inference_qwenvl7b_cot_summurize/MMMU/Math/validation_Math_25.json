We need to find the time $t$ when this happens.\n\nSetting $y(t) = 0$:\n\\[4.2t - 4.9t^2 = 0\\]\n\nFactor out $t$:\n\\[t(4.2 - 4.9t) = 0\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions for $t$:\n\\[t = 0\\] ( (initial position)\n\\[4.2 - 4.9t = 0\\]\n\\[4.9t = 4.2\\]\n\\[t = \\frac{4.2}{4.9}\\]\n\\[t = 0.857\\]\n\nSince $t = 0$ is the initial position, we are interested in $t = 0.857$.\n\nNow, we need to find the angle $\\theta$ between the path of the object and the ground at this time. The angle $\\theta$ can be found using the tangent function, which relates the vertical and horizontal distances:\n\\[\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{dy}{dx}\\]\n\nDifferentiate $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ with respect to $t$:\n\\[\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1.4\\]\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8t\\]\n\nAt $t = 0.857$:\n\\[\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1.4\\]\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8(0.857)\\]\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 8.4266\\]\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -4.2266\\]\n\nNow, calculate $\\tan(\\theta)$:\n\\[\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\frac{dy}{dt}}{\\frac{dx}{dt}}\\]\n\\[\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{-4.2266}{1.4}\\]\n\\[\\tan(\\theta) = -3.019\\]\n\nNow, find $\\theta$:\n\\[\\theta = \\arctan(-3.019)\\]\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\\[\\theta \\approx -1.475\\]\n\nSince we are looking for an angle between 0 and $\\pi/2$, we take the absolute value:\n\\[\\theta \\approx 1.475\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. $\\theta = 1.475$"
