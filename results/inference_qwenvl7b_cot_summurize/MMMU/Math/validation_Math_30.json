                "text": "To find the side length \\(s\\) of the equilateral convex hexagon \\(APQCRS\\) inscribed in square \\(ABCD\\) with side length \\(1\\), we can use the properties of the square and the equilateral hexagon.\n\nGiven that \\(ABCD\\) is a square with side length \\(1\\), and \\(APQCRS\\) is an equilateral hexagon, we can observe that the hexagon is composed of two equilateral triangles on the top and bottom, and a parallelogram in the middle.\n\nLet's denote the side length of the hexagon as \\(s\\). Since \\(APQCRS\\) is an equilateral hexagon, the triangles \\(APQ\\) and \\(CRS\\) are equilateral triangles with side length \\(s\\).\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to recognize that the hexagon is composed of two equilateral triangles on the top and bottom, and a parallelogram in the middle. The side length of the hexagon \\(s\\) is the same as the side length of the square, which is \\(1\\).\n\nHowever, to find the exact value of \\(s\\), we need to consider the geometry of the situation. The hexagon is inscribed in the square, and the side length of the square is \\(1\\). The hexagon's side length \\(s\\) is the same as the side length of the square because the hexagon is formed by extending the sides of the square outward to form the hexagon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nE. \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)"
