A regular graph is a graph where all vertices have the same degree, meaning each vertex has the same number of edges connected to it.\n\nLet's analyze the degrees of each vertex in the graph:\n\n- Vertex \\( a \\) has degree 3 ( (connected to \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\)).\n- Vertex \\( b \\) has degree 3 ( (connected to \\( a \\), \\( c \\), and \\( h \\)).\n- Vertex \\( c \\) has degree 3 ( (connected to \\( b \\), \\( d \\), and \\( h \\).\n- Vertex \\( d \\) has degree 3 ( (connected to \\( a \\), \\( c \\), and \\( e \\).\n- Vertex \\( e \\) has degree 2 ( (connected to \\( a \\) and \\( f \\).\n- Vertex \\( f \\) has degree 2 ( (connected to \\( e \\) and \\( h \\).\n- Vertex \\( g \\) has degree 2 ( (connected to \\( e \\) and \\( h \\).\n- Vertex \\( h \\) has degree 3 ( (connected to \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( g \\).\n\nSince not all vertices have the same degree ( ( \\( e \\) and \\( f \\) have degree 2, while the others have degree 3), the graph is not regular.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. not all vertices have the same degree"
