At present there is an estimated maximum demand of 6,000 customers per season for these tours. The company does not wish to provide capacity in excess of the estimated maximum demand. The basic data are given below for the two types of available boats. The company will make an estimated seasonal profit of $4,000 for each boat of Type 1 and $7,000 for each boat of Type 2.
