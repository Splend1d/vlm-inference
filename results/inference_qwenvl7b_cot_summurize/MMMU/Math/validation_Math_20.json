Sort all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.\n2. Start with an empty set of edges for the minimum spanning tree.\n3. Add the next edge from the sorted list to the set of edges if it does not form a cycle with the edges already in the set.\n4. Repeat step 3 until there are ( edges in the set.\n\nApplying Kruskal's algorithm to the graph in figure 1, we get the following minimum spanning tree:\n\n- Add the edge (v1, v3) with weight 2.\n- Add the edge (v2, v3) with weight 2.\n- Add the edge (v3, v4) with weight 4.\n- Add the edge (v4, v5) with weight 9.\n- Add the edge (v5, v6) with weight 12.\n- Add the edge (v6, v7) with weight 13.\n- Add the edge (v7, v8) with weight 15.\n\nSo, the minimum spanning tree is G1 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs including (v1, v3), (v2, v3), (v3, v4), (v4, v5), (v5, v6), (v6, v7), and (v7, v8).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
