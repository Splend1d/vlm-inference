First, we need to find \\( y \\) when \\( x = 7 \\).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[ 7^2 + y^2 = 25^2 \\]\n\\[ 49 + y^2 = 625 \\]\n\\[ y^2 = 576 \\]\n\\[ y = 24 \\]\n\nNow we can substitute \\( x = 7 \\), \\( y = 24 \\), and \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = -1 \\) into the differentiated equation:\n\\[ 2(7) \\frac{dx}{dt} + 2(24)(-1) = 0 \\]\n\\[ 14 \\frac{dx}{dt} - 48 = 0 \\]\n\\[ 14 \\frac{dx}{dt} = 48 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{48}{14} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{24}{7} \\]\n\nTherefore, the bottom of the ladder is slipping along the ground at a rate of \\( \\frac{24}{7} \\) feet per second when the bottom of the ladder is 7 feet away from the base of the wall."
