                "text": "To determine the convergence of the Newton-Raphson method for the given equation \\( f_1(x) = xe^{-x} = 0 \\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function and its derivative near the root.\n\nFirst, let's find the root of the equation \\( f_1(x) = 0 \\). By inspection, we can see that \\( x = 0 \\) is a root because \\( 0 \\cdot e^{-0} = 0 \\).\n\nNext, we need to find the derivative of \\( f_1(x) \\):\n\\[ f_1(x) = xe^{-x} \\]\n\\[ f_1'(x) = e^{-x} - xe^{-x} \\]\n\\[ f_1'(x) = ( (1 - x) e^{-x} \\]\n\nThe Newton-Raphson method is given by:\n\\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f_1(x_n)}{f_1'(x_n)} \\]\n\nFor convergence, we need the derivative \\( f_1'(x) \\) to be non-zero at the root. Let's evaluate \\( f_1'(x) \\) at \\( x = 0 \\):\n\\[ f_1'(0) = ( (1 - 0) e^{-0} = 1 \\]\n\nSince \\( f_1'(0) = 1 \\neq 0 \\), the derivative is non-zero at the root, which means the Newton-Raphson method will converge to the root \\( x = 0 \\) if the initial guess \\( x_0 \\) is close to 0.\n\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of the function and its derivative for different values of \\( x_0 \\):\n\n1. **When \\( x_0 \\) is greater than 1**:\n   - The function \\( f_1(x) = xe^{-x} \\) is positive for \\( x > 1 \\) because \\( xe^{-x} \\) is positive for \\( x > 1 \\).\n   - The derivative \\( f_1'(x) = ( (1 - x) e^{-x} \\) is negative for \\( x > 1 \\) because \\( 1 - x < 0 \\) for \\( x > 1 \\).\n   - This means the function is increasing and the derivative is negative, which suggests that the function will not converge to the root \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n2. **When \\( x_0 \\) is equal to 1**:\n   - The function \\( f_1(x) = xe^{-x} \\) is positive for \\( x > 1 \\) because \\( xe^{-x} \\) is positive for \\( x > 1 \\).\n   - The derivative \\( f_1'(x) = ( (1 - x) e^{-x} \\) is negative for \\( x > 1 \\) because \\( 1 - x < 0 \\) for \\( x > 1 \\).\n   - This means the function is increasing and the derivative is negative, which suggests that the function will not converge to the root \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n3. **When \\( x_0 \\) is less than 1**:\n   - The function \\( f_1(x) = xe^{-x} \\) is negative for \\( 0 < x < 1 \\) because \\( xe^{-x} \\) is negative for \\( 0 < x < 1 \\).\n   - The derivative \\( f_1'(x) == ( (1 - x) e^{-x} \\) is positive for \\( 0 < x < 1 \\) because \\( 1 - x > 0 \\) for \\( 0 < x < 1 \\).\n   - This means the function is decreasing and the derivative is positive, which suggest that the function will converge to the root \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n4. **When \\( x_0 \\) is equal to 0**:\n   - The function \\( f_1(x) = xe^{-x} \\) is 0 at \\( x = 0 \\).\n   - The derivative \\( f_1'(x) == ( (1 - x) e^{-x} \\) is 0 at \\( x = 0 \\).\n   - This means the derivative is 0 at the root, which means the Newton-Raphson method will not converge.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. When \\( x_0 \\) is less than 1."
