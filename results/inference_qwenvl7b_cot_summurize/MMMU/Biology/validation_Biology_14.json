                "text": "<image 1> In Ayrshire cattle, the mahogany/red locus is an autosomal gene. In both sexes, mahogany homozygotes are mahogany colored, and red homozygotes are red. However, the mahogany/red heterozygote is mahogany if male and red if female. Here is a pedigree for an Ayrshire family that is of great interest to Farmer MacDonald. (In the pedigree, open circles and squares indicate the mahogany phenotype; filled indicate red.) Although Elmer has long ago become a huge pile of Big Macs, Farmer MacDonald has frozen a good supply of Elmer's semen and has used it to artificially inseminate Elmira. What is the probability that Elmira will produce a mahogany female calf?\n\nA. 1/2\nB. 1/4\nC. 3/4\nD. 1/8\nE. 1/16\n"

                "text": "To determine the probability that Elmira will produce a mahogany female calf, we need to analyze the pedigree and determine the genotypes of Elmer and Elmira.\n\n1. **Identify the genotypes of Elmer and Elmira:**\n   - Elmer is a mahogany male ( (open circle), so he is either MM ( mahogany homozygote or MR ( mahogany/red heterozygote.\n   - Elmira is a mahogany female ( (filled circle), so she is either MM ( mahogany homozygote or MR (mahogany/red heterozygote).\n\n2. **Analyze the offspring:**\n   - Elinor is a mahogany female ( (filled circle), so she is either MM or MR.\n   - Earnest is a red male ( (filled square), so he is RR.\n\n3. **Determine the genotypes of Elmer and Elmira:**\n   - Since Earnest is RR and Elinor is MM, Elmer must be MR ( mahogany/red heterozygote.\n   - Since Elmira is MM ( mahogany homozygote, she must be MR ( mahogany/red heterozygote.\n\n4. **Calculate the probability of Elmira producing a mahogany female calf:**\n   - Elmira is MR ( mahogany/red heterozygote.\n   - The probability of her producing a mahogany female calf ( MM is 1/2 ( since she is heterozygous.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Elmira will produce a mahogany female calf is 1/2.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. 1/2"
