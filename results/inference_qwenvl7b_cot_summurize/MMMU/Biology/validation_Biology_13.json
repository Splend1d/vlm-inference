                "text": "To determine the appropriate statements about the regulation of blood glucose levels, let's analyze the graph and the roles of glucagon and insulin:\n\n1. **Normal homeostatic mechanisms maintain a glucose concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml.**\n   - This statement is likely correct. The graph shows that the blood glucose level fluctuates around 1 mg/ml, which is within the normal range.\n\n2. **Glucagon is released at points A and C.**\n   - Glucagon is typically released when blood glucose levels are low to stimulate the release of glucose from the liver. Point A is where the blood glucose level is lowest, suggesting glucagon release. Point C is where the blood glucose level is rising, which is not typical for glucagon release. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate.\n\n3. **The individual eats a meal at point D.**\n   - Point D is where the blood glucose level starts to rise sharply, which is consistent with the ingestion of food leading to an increase in blood glucose levels. This statement is likely correct.\n\n4. **Insulin is being released at points B and E.**\n   - Insulin is typically released when blood glucose levels are high to lower them. Point B is where the blood glucose level is highest, suggesting insulin release. Point E is where the blood glucose level is slightly lower, which is also not typical for insulin release. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. I and IV only**"
