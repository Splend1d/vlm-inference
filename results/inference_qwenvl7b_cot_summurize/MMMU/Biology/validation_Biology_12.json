Dish A was wrapped completely in an opaque cover to exclude all light. Dish B was not wrapped. The dishes were placed equidistant from a light source set to a cycle of 14 h of light and 10 h of dark. All other conditions were the same for both dishes. The dishes were examined after seven days, and the opaque cover was permanently removed from dish A. Both dishes were returned to the light and examined again at 14 days. The following data were obtained: <image 1> What best describes the usefulness of the yellow-leaved phenotype as a variation subject to natural selection?\n\nA. The yellow-leaved phenotype can germinate in environments without light.\nB. The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is unaffected by light intensity.\nC. The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is accelerated as compared to the green-leaved phenotype.\nD. The yellow-leaved phenotype cannot germinate in environments with light.\n"

The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is unaffected by light intensity."
