The 170 structure is located centrally in the image, surrounded by other muscles and tendons structures.\n\nGiven the location and the surrounding structures:\n- The structure labeled 170 is located centrally and is surrounded by muscles that are typically involved in plantar flexion and inversion of the foot.\n- The structure labeled 170 is likely the Flexor Hallucis Longus muscle, which is responsible for plantar flexion of the big toe.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Flexor Hallucis Longus"
