The curve shows the relationship between the percentage of oxyhemoglobin saturation and the PO2.\n\n1. At a PO2 of 20 mmHg, the curve shows that the oxyhemoglobin saturation is approximately 20%.\n2. This means that 20% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered to the cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 17% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered."
