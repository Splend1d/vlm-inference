You confirmed the quality of plasmids by checking DNA and protein ratio (A260/280) and running them on a DNA agarose gel. They looked pure as they should be. You would now like to digest this vector for gene manipulation (molecular cloning) to generate vectors suitable for molecular cloning.

The plasmid is shown as a circular DNA molecule.\n2. HindIII is a restriction enzyme that cuts DNA at specific recognition sites.\n3. The recognition site for HindIII is indicated as 173 bp from the origin of replication (ori).\n\nWhen HindIII cuts the plasmid at its recognition site, it will:\n\n- **Linearize** the circular DNA, converting it from a closed circular form (supercoiled to a linear form.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nE.
