However, in this pedigree, the trait is not consistently present in all offspring of affected parents, which suggests it is not AR.\n   - **Autosomal Dominant (AD**: This mode of inheritance shows a 3:1 ratio in the offspring (AA: Aa. In this pedigree, the trait is present in both affected and unaffected offspring, which suggests it is AD.\n   - **X-linked Recessive (XR**: This mode of inheritance typically shows a 1:2:1 ratio in the offspring (XX: XA: Xa. However, in this pedigree, the trait is present in both males and females, which suggest it is not XR.\n   - **X-linked Dominant XD**: This mode of inheritance typically shows a 1:1 ratio in the offspring (XX: XA. However, in this pedigree, the trait is present in both males and females, which suggest it is not XD.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most likely mode of inheritance in the given pedigree is:\n\nB. autosomal dominant (AD)"
