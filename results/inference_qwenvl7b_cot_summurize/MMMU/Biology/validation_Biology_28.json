It is not visible in this section.\n2. **Fibular collateral ligament** ( This is the ligament that runs from the lateral side of the knee (fibula) to the tibia. It is visible in this section.\n3. **Tibial collateral ligament** This is the ligament that runs from the medial side of the knee (tibia) to the femur. It is not visible in this section.\n4. **Anterior cruciate ligament (** This is the ligament that runs diagonally across the knee joint from the femur to the tibia. It is visible in this section.\n\nGiven the orientation and location of the structure labeled as 164, it is the **Fibular collateral ligament**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB.
