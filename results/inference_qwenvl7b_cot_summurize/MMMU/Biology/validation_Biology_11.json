In electrophoresis, the anode is the positive terminal, and the cathode is the negative terminal. The direction of the electric current is from the anode to the cathode.\n\nIn the image, the buffer is shown at the bottom ( labeled as \"B,\" and the samples are placed in the wells labeled as \"A.\" The buffer at the bottom is typically the cathode, and the samples are loaded towards the anode.\n\nGiven this information, the anode is the side where the samples are loaded, which is labeled as \"A.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
