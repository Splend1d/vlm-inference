The reaction involves the addition of silver nitrate (AgNO3) to the double bond.\n3. The product is a silver salt of the carboxylic acid formed by the elimination of bromide ion.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\nA. Product is aromatic:\nThe product is a silver salt of a carboxylic acid, which is not aromatic. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. Product has high dipole moment:\nThe product is a silver salt of a carboxylic acid, which typically has a high dipole moment due to the polar nature of the carboxylic acid group. This statement is correct.\n\nC. Product has less resonance energy:\nThe product is a silver salt of a carboxylic acid, which has less resonance energy compared to the starting material (b-bromoalkene. This statement is correct.\n\nD. Product is soluble in polar solvent:\nSilver salts are generally soluble in polar solvents like water. This statement is correct.\n\nTherefore, the incorrect statement is:\n\nA. Product is aromatic"
