This can lead to steric hindrance and less favorable interactions.\n- **Isomer B**: This isomer has the hydroxyl group on one carbon and the OMe group on another carbon. This can also lead to steric hindrance and less favorable interactions.\n- **Isomer C**: This isomer has the hydroxyl group on one carbon and the OMe group on another carbon. This can also lead to steric hindrance and less favorable interactions.\n- **Isomer D**: This isomer has the hydroxyl group on one carbon and the OMe group on another carbon. This can also lead to steric hindrance and less favorable interactions.\n\nHowever, in isomer D, the hydroxyl group and the OMe group are on different carbonsons. This can lead to less steric hindrance and more favorable interactions.\n\nTherefore, the most stable isomer is:\n\n**D. <image 4>**"
