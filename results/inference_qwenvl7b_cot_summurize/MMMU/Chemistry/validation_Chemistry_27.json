The stronger the interaction with water molecules, the smaller the ionic radius, as smaller ions can more easily penetrate the water molecules' hydration shells.\n\nFrom the table, we have the following ionic radii:\n- $Cl^-$: 181 pm\n- $I^-$: 216 pm\n- $S^{2-}$: 184 pm\n- $Te^{2-}$: 221 pm\n\nThe $S^{2-}$ ion has the smallest ionic radius at 184 pm, making it the most likely to have the strongest interactions with nearby water molecules.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. $S^{2-}$"
