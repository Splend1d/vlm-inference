The tetrasubstituted carbon can exist in two stereoiseric forms: R and S.\n\n1. **R configuration**: The three bromines are in the same relative position as in the R configuration.\n2. **S configuration**: The three bromines are in the same relative position as in the S configuration.\n\nFor each configuration, the carbon atom can be either a chiral center or not. If it is a chiral center, it can exist in two stereoisomers (R and S.\n\nSo, for each configuration of the tetrasubstituted carbon, there are 2 possible stereoisomers.\n\nTherefore, the total number of stereoisomers is:\n2 configurations \u00d7 2 stereoisomers per configuration = 4 stereoisomers.\n\nHowever, since the compound is symmetrical, one of the stereoisomers will be identical to the other, so we have 3 unique stereoisomers.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 6"
