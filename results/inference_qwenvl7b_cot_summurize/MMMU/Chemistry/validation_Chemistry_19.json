Optical isomers are molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n\nIn the structure of isoleucine, there are two chiral centers:\n1.

The carbon atom bonded to the amino group (N-H, the carboxyl group (COOH, and two methyl groups (ch3).\n\nA chiral center is a carbon atom that is bonded to four different groups. Each chiral center can exist in two enantiomeric forms (R and S.\n\nFor the first chiral center:\n- There are two possible enantiomers (R and S.\n\nFor the second chiral center:\n- There are also two possible enantiomers R and s.\n\nTo find the total number of optical isomers, we multiply the number of enantiomers for each chiral center:\n- 2 (enantiomers (R and s) for the first chiral center\n- 2 enantiomers (R and s) for the second chiral center\n\nTotal number of optical isomers = 2 * 2 = 4\n\nTherefore, isoleucine has 4 optical isomers."
