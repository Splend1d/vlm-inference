In a phase diagram, melting/freezing equilibrium typically occurs at the points where the solid and liquid phases coexist. These points are usually represented by the intersection of the solid-liquid boundary with the temperature axis.\n\nIn the given graph:\n- Points 1 and 5 are on the solid-liquid boundary, indicating a melting/freezing equilibrium.\n- Points 2 and 4 are not on the solid-liquid boundary.\n- Points 6 and 7 are on the solid-liquid boundary, indicating a melting/freezing equilibrium.\n- Points 8 and 9 are not on the solid-liquid boundary.\n\nTherefore, the points that correspond to a melting/freezing equilibrium are:\nA. 1 and 5\nD. 6 and 7\n\nSince the question asks for a single correct answer, the correct choice is:\n\nA. 1 and 5"
