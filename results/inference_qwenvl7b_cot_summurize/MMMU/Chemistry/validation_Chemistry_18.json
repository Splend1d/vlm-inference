Five different samples of $CaCO_3$(s) of known mass react with an excess of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq) in identical sealed, rigid reaction vessels. The pressure of the gas produced is measured with a pressure gauge attached to the reaction vessel. Since the reaction is exothermic, the reaction system is cooled to its original temperature before the pressure is recorded. The experimental data are used to create the calibration line below. <image 1> The experiment is repeated with an eggshell sample, and the experimental data are recorded in the table below. <image 2> Which of the following modifications will increase the rate of the reaction the most? \n\nA.

                "text": "To determine which modification will increase the rate of the reaction the most, we need to consider the factors that affect the rate of a chemical reaction. The rate of a reaction is often influenced by the following factors:\n\n1. **Concentration of reactants**: Increasing the concentration of reactants generally increases the rate of the reaction.\n2. **Temperature**: Increasing the temperature generally increases the rate of the reaction.\n3. **Surface area of solid reactants**: Increasing the surface area of solid reactants generally increases the rate of the reaction.\n4. **Catalysts**: The presence of a catalyst can increase the rate of the reaction.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Using 2.0 M $CH_3COOH$(aq) instead of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq)**:\n   - $CH_3COOH$(aq) is a weaker acid compared to $HCl$(aq). Using a weaker acid would likely decrease the rate of the reaction because the reaction rate is directly proportional to the concentration of the acid.\n\nB. **Cooling the $HCl$(aq) to a lower temperature than it was in the original experiment**:\n   - Cooling the $HCl$(aq) would decrease the temperature, which generally decreases the rate of the reaction.\n\nC. **Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel**:\n   - Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel would increase the concentration of the reactants, which generally increases the rate of the reaction.\n\nD. **Using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment**:\n   - Finely powdered eggshells would increase the surface area of the solid reactants, which generally increases the rate of the reaction.\n\nAmong these options, **C. Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel** and **D. Using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment** both increase the concentration of the reactants and the surface area of the solid reactants, respectively. However, reducing the volume of the reaction vessel would have a more significant effect on the rate of the reaction because it would increase the concentration of the reactants more dramatically.\n\nTherefore, the modification that will increase the rate of the reaction the most is:\n\nC.
