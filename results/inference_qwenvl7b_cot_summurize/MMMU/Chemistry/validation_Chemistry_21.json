                "text": "To determine the geometry of the glycinium cation, we need to consider the structure and the $pK_a$ values of the labile protons. The glycinium cation is the cationic form of glycine, which has the following structure:\n\n\\[\n\\text{H}_2\\text{N}-\\text{CH}_2\\text{COOH}^+\n\\]\n\nThe $pK_a$ values indicate the stability of the protonated forms of the molecule. The lower $pK_a$ value ( (2.3) corresponds to the carboxyl group (COOH, which is more acidic and thus more stable. The higher $pK_a$ value ( (9.6) corresponds to the amine group (NH2, which is less acidic and thus less stable.\n\nThe geometry of the glycinium cation can be determined by considering the bonding and the presence of lone pairs on the nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The nitrogen atom has a lone pair, and the oxygen atoms in the carboxyl group also lone pairs. These lone pairs will affect the geometry around the nitrogen atom.\n\nGiven the presence of lone pairs on the nitrogen and oxygen atoms, the geometry around the nitrogen atom will be tetrahedral, not planar. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are not directly related to the geometry of the glycinium cation. The geometry of the glycinium cation is not specified by the planarity of the leftmost C atom, both C atoms, or both O atoms, nor is it the N-C-C bond angle specified as 180\u00b0.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The geometry around the N atom is planar."
