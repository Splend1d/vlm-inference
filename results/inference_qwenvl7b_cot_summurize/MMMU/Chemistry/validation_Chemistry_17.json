In meso-2, 3-butanediol, the two hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides of the carbon backbone, which means there is a plane of symmetry passing through the carbon atoms.\n\nLet's analyze each structure:\n\n- **P**: This structure does not have a plane of symmetry. The two hydroxyl groups are not on opposite sides of the carbon backbone.\n- **Q**: This structure does not have a plane of symmetry. The two hydroxyl groups are not on opposite sides of the carbon backbone.\n- **R**: This structure does not have a plane of symmetry. The two hydroxyl groups are not on opposite sides of the carbon backbone.\n- **S**: This structure has a plane of symmetry passing through the carbon atoms. The two hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides of the carbon backbone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. R, S"
