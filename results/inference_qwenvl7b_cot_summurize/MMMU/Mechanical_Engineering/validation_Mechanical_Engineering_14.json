                "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the kinetic energy in the system and then determine the additional brake torque required to bring the system to rest in 0.60 s.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the kinetic energy in the system. The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the object and \\( v \\) is its velocity.\n\nGiven:\n- Mass of the 1000 kg object: \\( m = 1000 \\, kg \\)\n- Velocity of the object: \\( v = 4 \\, m/s \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 \\, kg \\times ( 4 \\, m/s^2 = 2000 \\, J \\]\n\nSo, the kinetic energy in the system is 2000 J.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the additional brake torque required to bring the system to rest in 0.60 s. The torque \\( T \\) required to bring an object to rest is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{I \\cdot \\Delta \\omega}{\\Delta t} \\]\n\nwhere \\( i \\) is the moment of inertia of the object, \\( \\Delta \\omega \\) is the change in angular velocity, and \\( \\Delta t \\) is the time interval.\n\nThe moment of inertia \\( i \\) of a solid cylinder ( is given by:\n\n\\[ i = \\frac{1}{2}mr^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the cylinder and \\( r \\) is its radius of gyration.\n\nGiven:\n- Mass of the drum: \\( m = 2.5 \\, kN = 2500 \\, kg \\)\n- Radius of gyration of the drum: \\( r = 250 \\, mm = 0.25 \\, m \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ i = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2500 \\, kg \\times ( 0.25 \\, m^2 = 312.5 \\, kg \\cdot a^2 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the change in angular velocity \\( \\Delta \\omega \\). The change in angular velocity is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta \\omega = \\frac{v}{r} \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the linear velocity and \\( r \\) is the radius of the drum.\n\nGiven:\n- Linear velocity of the object: \\( v = 4 \\, m/s \\)\n- Radius of the drum: \\( r = 550 \\, mm = 0.55 \\, a \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ \\Delta \\omega = \\frac{4 \\, a/s}{0.55 \\, a} = 7.27 \\, a/s \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the additional brake torque \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{312.5 \\, kg \\cdot a^2 \\times 7.27 \\, a/s}{0.60 \\, s} = 4673 \\, N \\cdot a \\]\n\nSo, the additional brake torque required to bring the system to rest in 0.60 s is approximately 4673 N\u22c5a.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 9673J,1218N\u22c5m"
