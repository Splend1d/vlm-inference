A - This view shows a U-shaped object with a circular hole in the middle, but the circular hole is not aligned with the U-shape in the main view.\nB. B - This view shows a U-shaped object with a circular hole in the middle, but the circular hole is not aligned with the U-shape in the main view.\nC. C - This view shows a U-shaped object with a circular hole in the middle, and the circular hole is aligned with the U-shape in the main view.\nD. D - This view shows a U-shaped object with a circular hole in the middle, but the circular hole is not aligned with the U-shape in the main view.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct left view is:\n\nC.
