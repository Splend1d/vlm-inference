The peak time \\( T_p \\) and settling time \\( T_s \\) are related to the damping ratio \\( \\zeta \\) and natural frequency \\( \\omega_n \\) of the closed-loop system.\n\nGiven:\n- Peak time \\( T_p = 1 \\) second\n- Settling time \\( T_s = 2 \\) seconds\n\nThe peak time and settling time are related to the damping ratio \\( \\zeta \\) and natural frequency \\( \\omega_n \\) by the following equations:\n\\[\nT_p = \\frac{4}{\\zeta \\omega_n}\n\\]\n\\[\nT_s = \\frac{4}{\\zeta \\omega_n}\n\\]\n\nFrom the given options, we can see that the peak time \\( T_p = 1 \\) second and settling time \\( T_s = 2 \\) seconds are consistent with a damping ratio \\( \\zeta = 0.5 \\) and natural frequency \\( \\omega_n = 2 \\) rad/s.\n\nNow, let's find the values of \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\) that satisfy these conditions.\n\nGiven the closed-loop transfer function:\n\\[\nT(s) = \\frac{K_1 \\cdot \\frac{50}{s(s+1)}}{1 + K_1 \\cdot \\frac{50}{s(s+1)} + K_2s}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\), we need to match the closed-loop transfer function with the given options. \n\nAfter analyzing the options, we find that:\n\\[\nK_2 = 0.06, K_1 = 0.277\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nC.
