The beam has a rectangular cross-section with dimensions 200 mm (x 25 mm.\n\n\\[ A = 200 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 25 \\, \\text{mm} = 5000 \\, \\text{mm}^2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the stress at the hole and the notch. The stress at the hole will be the same as the stress at the notch because the stress is uniform across the cross-section.\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{{F}{A} = \\frac{{65000 \\, \\text{N}}{5000 \\, \\text{mm}^2} = 13 \\, \\text{MPa} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the stress concentration at the hole and the notch. The correct approach is to use the formula for stress concentration factor ( \\( K_f \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} \\times K_f \\]\n\nFor a hole or a notch, the stress concentration factor \\( K_f \\) is typically around 3 for a hole or a notch.\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{65000 \\, \\text{N}}{5000 \\, \\text{mm}^2} \\times 3 = 39 \\, \\text{MPa} \\]\n\nSo, the maximum stress at both the hole and the notch is 39 MPa.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 31.7Mpa,34.83Mpa"
