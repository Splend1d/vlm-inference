The spring constant \\( k \\) remains the same for both halves. The mass \\( m \\) is connected to both halves.\n\nThe natural period \\( \\tau_n \\) for the first system is given as 0.5 s. We can use this information to find the spring constant \\( k \\):\n\n\\[ 0.5 = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.5}{2\\pi} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{0.5}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 = \\frac{m}{k} \\]\n\n\\[ k = \\frac{m}{\\left(\\frac{0.5}{2\\pi}\\right)^2} \\]\n\nFor the second system ( (image 2), the spring is cut into two parts, one of length \\( \\frac{l}{4} \\) and the other of length \\( \\frac{3l}{4} \\). The mass \\( m \\) is connected to both parts.\n\nThe natural period \\( \\tau_n \\) for the second system can be found using the same formula:\n\n\\[ \\tau_n = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}} \\]\n\nSince the mass \\( m \\) is the same for both systems, we can use the same value of \\( m \\) in the second system. The spring constant \\( k \\) for the second system is the same as for the first system because the spring constant depends on the material and the geometry of the spring, not on its length.\n\nTherefore, the natural period \\( \\tau_n \\) for the second system is the same as for the first system:\n\n\\[ \\tau_n = 0.5 \\text{ s} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( (\\tau_n)_2 = 0.533 \\text{ s} \\)"
