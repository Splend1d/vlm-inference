The top view shows a rectangular block with a smaller rectangular protrusion on one side.\n2. The left views should show the side profile of the object as seen from the left side.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- Option (a) shows a side view with a rectangular block and a protrusion on one side, which matches the top view.\n- Option (b) shows a side view with a rectangular block and a protrusion on the opposite side, which does not match the top view.\n- Option (c) shows a side view with a rectangular block and a protrusion on one side, but the protrusion is not aligned correctly with the top view.\n- Option (d) shows a side view with a rectangular block and a protrusion on one side, but the protrusion is not aligned correctly with the top view.\n\nTherefore, the correct left view is:\n\nA.
