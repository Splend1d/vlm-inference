When viewed from the left, we should see the triangle.\n2. **Shape (b**: This shape has a square on the left side and a rectangle on the right side. When viewed from the left, we should see the square.\n3. **Shape (c**: This shape has a rectangle on the left side and a smaller rectangle on the right side. When viewed from the left, we should see the rectangle.\n4. **Shape (d**: This shape has a rectangle on the left side and a smaller rectangle on the right side.
