This distance is also equal to the wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) of the component traveling waves because in a standing wave, the distance between nodes (or antinodes) is equal to half a wavelength.\n\nTherefore, the wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) is:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = 0.5 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.5 m"
