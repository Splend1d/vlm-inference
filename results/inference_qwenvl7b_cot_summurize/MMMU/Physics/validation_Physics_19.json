                "text": "To determine which graph best shows the maximum kinetic energy \\( K \\) of the photoelectrons as a function of the frequency of incident light, we need to consider the photoelectric effect. According to the photoelectric effect, the maximum kinetic energy \\( K \\) of the photoelectrons is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ K = h\\nu - \\phi \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( h \\) is Planck's constant,\n- \\( \\nu \\) is the frequency of the incident light,\n- \\( \\phi \\) is the work function of the material.\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that the maximum kinetic energy \\( K \\) increases linearly with the frequency \\( \\nu \\) of the incident light. Therefore, the graph that best represents this relationship is a straight line passing through the origin.\n\nLet's analyze the given graphs:\n\n- Graph A shows a straight line passing through the origin, which represents a linear relationship.\n- Graph B shows a straight line not passing through the origin, which does not represent a linear relationship.\n- Graph C shows a curve that increases with frequency, which does not represent a linear relationship.\n- Graph D shows a curve that decreases with frequency, which does not represent a linear relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct graph is:\n\nA. A\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nA. A"
