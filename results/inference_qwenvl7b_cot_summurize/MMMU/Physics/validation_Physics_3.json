                "text": "To determine the direction of the force on the right-hand wire due to the current in the left-hand wire, we can use the right-hand rule for the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire. The right-hand rule states that if you point your right thumb in the direction of the current, your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field.\n\nIn this case, the current in the left-hand wire is directed into the page, so if we point our right thumb in the direction of this current (into the page), our fingers will curl upward in the plane of the page. This indicates that the magnetic field around the left-hand wire is upward in the plane of the page.\n\nNow, we need to consider the magnetic field produced by the left-hand wire on the right-hand wire. Since the magnetic field is upward in the plane of the page, the force on the right-hand wire due to the left-hand wire will be directed perpendicular to both wires. According to the right-hand rule, if we point our right thumb in the direction of the current in the left-hand wire (into the page), our fingers will curl in the direction of the force on the right-hand wire. In this case, our fingers will curl downward in the plane of the page.\n\nTherefore, the direction of the force on the right-hand wire due to the current in the left-hand wire is downward in the plane of the page.\n\nThe correct answer is D."
