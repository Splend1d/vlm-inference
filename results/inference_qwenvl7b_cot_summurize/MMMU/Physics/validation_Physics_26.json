This is because velocity is the rate of change of position, and when the velocity is zero, the object is no longer moving forward.\n\nLooking at the graph:\n- Point A shows a positive velocity, indicating the duck is moving forward.\n- Point B shows a peak in velocity, indicating the duck is still moving forward.\n- Point C shows a velocity that is close to zero but not exactly zero.\n- Point D shows a negative velocity, indicating the duck is moving backward.\n\nSince we are looking for the point where the duck stops its forward motion, we need to find the point where the velocity is zero. This occurs at point C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. C"
