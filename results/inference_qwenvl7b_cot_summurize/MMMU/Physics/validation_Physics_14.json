                "text": "To determine the speed of light in each medium, we need to consider the relationship between the indices of refraction (n1, n2, and n3, and the speed of light in each medium. The speed of light in a medium is inversely proportional to the index of refraction:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{c}{n} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of light in the medium,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light in a vacuum ( (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s),\n- \\( n \\) is the index of refraction of the medium.\n\nSince the speed of light decreases as the index of refraction increases, we can conclude that the medium with the highest index of refraction will have the lowest speed of light, and vice versa.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that the light beam changes direction at the interfaces between the media. This indicates that the index of refraction changes at these interfaces. The light beam changes direction more sharply at the interface between medium 1 and medium 2 than at the interface between medium 2 and medium 3. This suggests that the index of refraction is higher in medium 1 than in medium 2, and medium 2 has a higher index of refraction than medium 3.\n\nTherefore, the order of the indices of refraction is:\n\\[ n_1 > n_2 > n_3 \\]\n\nSince the speed of light is inversely proportional to the index of refraction, the order of the speeds of light in each medium is:\n\\[ v_1 < v_2 < v_3 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nB. v_1 > v_2 > v_3"
