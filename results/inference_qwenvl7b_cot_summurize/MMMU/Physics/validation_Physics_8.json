                "text": "To determine the distance from the axis at which the force should be applied to produce the same torque when applied perpendicular to the rod, we need to understand the concept of torque. Torque is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\tau = r \\times F \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the distance from the axis of rotation and \\( F \\) is the force applied.\n\nGiven that the force \\( F \\) is applied at an angle \\( \\theta \\) to the rod, the torque produced by this force is:\n\n\\[ \\tau = F \\times L \\times \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nIf we want to produce the same torque by applying the force perpendicular to the rod, we need to find the distance \\( r \\) from the axis such that:\n\n\\[ \\tau = r \\times F \\]\n\nSince the force \\( F \\) is applied perpendicular to the rod, the angle \\( \\theta \\) becomes 90 degrees, and \\( \\sin(90^\\circ) = 1 \\). Therefore, the torque equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\tau = r \\times F \\]\n\nComparinging the two torque equations, we see that the distance \\( r \\) should be equal to the length \\( L \\) of the rod.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
