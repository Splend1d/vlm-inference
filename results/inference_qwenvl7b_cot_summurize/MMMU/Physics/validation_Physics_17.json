                "text": "To determine which graph correctly represents the relationship between power dissipated \\( P \\) and current \\( I \\) in a component that obeys Ohm's law, we need to recall the formula for power dissipation in a resistor:\n\n\\[ P = I^2 \\cdot R \\]\n\nwhere \\( P \\) is the power dissipated, \\( I \\) is the current, and \\( R \\) is the resistance of the component.\n\nSince the component obeys Ohm's law, the voltage \\( V \\) across the component is directly proportional to the current \\( I \\):\n\n\\[ V = I \\cdot R \\]\n\nThe power dissipated \\( P \\) can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{V^2}{R} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( V = i \\cdot R \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{(i \\cdot R)^2}{R} \\]\n\n\\[ P = i^2 \\cdot R \\]\n\nThis shows that the power dissipated \\( P \\) is directly proportional to the square of the current \\( I \\). Therefore, the graph should show a curve that increases as the current \\( I \\) increases.\n\nLet's analyze the given graphs:\n\nA. A shows a curve that increases as the current \\( I \\) increases, which is consistent with the relationship \\( P \\propto I^2 \\).\n\nB. B shows a linear relationship between \\( P \\) and \\( I \\), which is not consistent with \\( P \\propto I^2 \\).\n\nC. C shows a linear relationship between \\( P \\) and \\( I \\), which is not consistent with \\( P \\propto i^2 \\).\n\nD. D shows a curve that decreases as the current \\( I \\) increases, which is not consistent with \\( P \\propto i^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct graph is:\n\nA. A"
