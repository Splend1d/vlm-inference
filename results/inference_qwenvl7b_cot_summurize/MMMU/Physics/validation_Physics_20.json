This energy is represented by the y-intercept of the graph, which is the maximum kinetic energy (E_km when the frequency f is zero.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the y-intercept is approximately at 1.5 eV. This means that the work function of the material is approximately 1.5 eV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1.5 eV"
