This indicates that the leaves are negatively charged because they repel the negatively charged rod.\n\n2. **After Touching ( (II)**: When the electroscope is touched with a finger, the leaves collapse. This suggests that the leaves have lost their negative charge and become neutral or positively charged. The finger, being neutral, neutralizes the negative charge on the leaves.\n\n3. **After Removing Finger and Rod ( (III)**: When the finger and the rod are removed, the leaves spring apart again. This indicates that the leaves have become negatively charged again.\n\nGiven this sequence, the charge on the leaves is:\n\n- **Positive in I**: The leaves are negatively charged initially.\n- **Negative in III**: The leaves become negatively charged again after the finger and rod are removed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. positive in I, negative in III"
