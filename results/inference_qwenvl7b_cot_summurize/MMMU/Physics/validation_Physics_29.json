                "text": "To determine the resistance \\( R \\) when the ammeter reads zero, we need to analyze the circuit and understand the conditions under which the ammeter reads zero.\n\nThe ammeter reads zero when the current through it is zero. This happens when the voltage drop across the ammeter is zero, which means the ammeter is effectively bypassed by the parallel combination of the resistors.\n\nThe resistors are connected in parallel, and the ammeter is in series with the parallel combination. The parallel combination of resistors \\( R_1 \\) and \\( R_2 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{parallel}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} \\]\n\nGiven \\( R_1 = 1 \\Omega \\) and \\( R_2 = 2 \\Omega \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{parallel}}} = \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \\]\n\n\\[ R_{\\text{parallel}} = \\frac{1}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3} \\Omega \\]\n\nNow, the ammeter is bypassed by this parallel combination, so the current through the ammeter is zero. The ammeter reads zero when the voltage drop across it is zero.\n\nThe total resistance \\( R \\) in the circuit is the sum of the parallel combination and the other resistors:\n\n\\[ R = R_{\\text{parallel}} + R_3 \\]\n\nGiven \\( R_3 = 3 \\Omega \\):\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{2}{3} + 3 = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{9}{3} = \\frac{11}{3} \\Omega \\]\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{11}{3} \\approx 3.67 \\Omega \\]\n\nHowever, this value is not among the given options. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. Based on the analysis, the correct resistance \\( R \\) should be approximately 3.67 \u03a9, which is not listed in the options.\n\nGiven the options provided, the closest value to 3.67 \u03a9 is:\n\nC. 5 \u03a9\n\nSo, the best choice among the given options is:\n\nC. 5 \u03a9"
