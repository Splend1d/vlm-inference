It is defined as the ratio of the distance between the foci to the length of the major axis. For an ellipse, the eccentricity \\( e \\) is always between 0 and 1 ( (0 < e < 1). Therefore, the eccentricity of the orbit cannot be less than zero or greater than 1. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n2. **Position of the Sun:**\n   - In an elliptical orbit, the Sun is located at one of the foci of the ellipse. This means that the Sun must be at one of the points labeled A, B, C, D, or E, but not necessarily at any specific point.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**E. the sun might be at point B**"
