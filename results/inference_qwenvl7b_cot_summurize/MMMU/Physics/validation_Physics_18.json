The circuit is divided into two parallel branches.\n2. Bulb 1 is in one branch.\n3. Bulb 2 is in the other branch.\n4. Bulb 4 is connected in series with the parallel combination of bulbs 1 and 2.\n\nWhen the switch is closed, the parallel combination of bulbs 1 and 2 is effectively bypasseded, and the current will flow directly through the parallel combination of bulbs 1 and 2.\n\nSince bulbs 1 and 2 are in parallel, closing the switch will increase the current flowing through both bulbs, making them brighter.\n\nBulb 3 is in series with bulb 4, and since bulb 4 is illuminated, the current through bulb 3 will also increase, making bulb 3 brighter as well.\n\nTherefore, the bulbs that become brighter when the switch is closed are:\n\nB. Bulb #2 only\nC. Bulbs #2 and #3 only\n\nThe correct answer is C."
