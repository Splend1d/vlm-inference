                "text": "To determine the film thickness for maximum constructive interference, we need to understand the condition for constructive interference in thin films. Constructive interference occurs when the path difference between the two reflected beams is an integer multiple of the wavelength.\n\nFor a thin film with index of refraction \\( n_f \\) and thickness \\( d \\), the path difference \\( \\Delta \\) between the two reflected beams is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta = 2nd \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the index of refraction of the film.\n\nFor constructive interference, the path difference must be an integer multiple of the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[ 2nd = m \\lambda \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is an integer.\n\nGiven that \\( n_1 < n_f \\) and \\( n_2 < n_f \\), the film is surrounded by materials with lower indices of refraction. This means that the film acts as a waveguide, and the light can be trapped within the film due to total internal reflection.\n\nFor maximum constructive interference, the film thickness \\( d \\) should be such that:\n\n\\[ 2nd = \\lambda \\]\n\nSolving for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2n} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( \\lambda \\)/2"
