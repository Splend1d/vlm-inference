                "text": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the relationship between the energy levels of a hydrogen atom and the emitted light. In the Bohr model, the energy levels of a hydrogen atom are quantized, and the energy difference between two levels corresponds to the energy of the emitted photon.\n\nThe energy of a photon is given by the equation:\n\\[ E = h \\cdot c \\cdot \\Delta n \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( E \\) is the energy of the photon,\n- \\( h \\) is Planck's constant,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light,\n- \\( \\Delta n \\) is the difference in principal quantum numbers between the two energy levels.\n\nWhen a hydrogen atom transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, it emits a photon with energy equal to the difference in energy between the two levels. The frequency \\( f \\) of the emitted photon is related to its energy by:\n\\[ E = h \\cdot f \\]\nThus, the frequency of the emitted photon is inversely proportional to the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\):\n\\[ f = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nWhen the transition is from \\( n=3 \\) to \\( n=2 \\), the energy difference is smaller than when the transition is from \\( n=3 \\) to \\( n=1 \\). This means the photon emitted in the latter case has higher energy, higher frequency, shorter wavelength, and greater momentum.\n\nTherefore, if the transition were from the \\( n=3 \\) to the \\( n=1 \\) level instead, the light emitted would have:\n\nA. lower frequency\nB. longer wavelength\nC. greater speed ( (speed of light is constant)\nD. greater momentum\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. greater momentum"
