                "text": "To determine the magnitude and direction of the current in the loop as the magnetic field is decreased, we can use Faraday's law of induction and Ohm's law.\n\n1. **Faraday's Law of Induction:**\n   The induced electromotive force ((\\(\\mathcal{E}\\)) in a loop is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi}{dt}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\Phi\\) is the magnetic flux through the loop and \\(d\\Phi/dt\\) is the rate of change of the magnetic flux.\n\n2. **Magnetic Flux:**\n   The magnetic flux (\\(\\Phi\\)) through the loop is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi = B \\cdot A\n   \\]\n   where \\(B\\) is the magnetic field intensity and \\(A\\) is the area of the loop.\n\n3. **Area of the Loop:**\n   The area of the square loop is:\n   \\[\n   A = ( 0.5 \\, \\text{m} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{m} = 0.25 \\, \\text{m}^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Magnetic Flux:**\n   The magnetic flux through the loop is:\n   \\[\n   \\Phi = B \\cdot A = 0.4 \\, \\text{T} \\times 0.25 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 0.1 \\, \\text{Wb}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Rate of of Change of Magnetic Flux:**\n   The magnetic field is decreasing at a constant rate of 0.4 tesla per second. Therefore, the rate of change of the magnetic flux is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\Phi}{dt} = -\\frac{0.4 \\, \\text{T}}{2 \\, \\text{s}} = = -0.2 \\, \\text{T/s}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Induced Electromotive Force:**\n   Using Faraday's law:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi}{dt} = -(-0.2 \\, \\text{T/s}) = = 0.2 \\, \\text{V}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Current in the Loop:**\n   The current (\\(I\\)) in the loop can be found using Ohm's law:\n   \\[\n   i = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R} = \\frac{0.2 \\, \\text{V}}{10^{-2} \\, \\text{ohm}} = = 20 \\, \\text{A}\n   \\]\n\n8. **Direction of the Current:**\n   The direction of the induced current can be determined using Lenz's law. Lenz's law states that the induced current will create a magnetic field that opposes the change in the original magnetic field. Since the magnetic field is decreasing, the induced current will create a magnetic field that opposes this decrease, which means the induced current will be clockwise.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the current in the loop is 20 A, and the direction is clockwise.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 20 A, clockwise"
