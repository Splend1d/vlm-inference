The magnetic force on a current-carrying wire is given by the cross product of the magnetic field and the current in the wire. Since the current in wire P is directed out of the plane of the page, the force will be perpendicular to both the the magnetic field and the current.\n\n- The magnetic field due to wire 1 is directed towards the right, and the current in wire P is directed out of the plane of the page. The force will be directed upwards ( out of the plane of the page).\n- The magnetic field due to wire 2 is directed downwards, and the current in wire P is directed out of the plane of the page. The force will be directed downwards ( into the plane of the page).\n- The magnetic field due to wire 3 is directed upwards, and the current in wire P is directed out of the plane of the page. The force will be directed downwards ( into the plane of the page).\n\nSince the forces due to wire 1 is upwards and the forces due to wires 2 and 3 are downwards, the net force will be upwards.\n\nTherefore, the direction of the total magnetic force on the wire labeled P P is:\n\n**C.
