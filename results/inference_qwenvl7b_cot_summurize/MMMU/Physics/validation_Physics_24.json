                "text": "To determine what the \"?\" represents in the nuclear reaction \\({}^{6}\\text{Li}_3 + ? \\rightarrow {}^{7}\\text{Li}_3\\), we need to consider the conservation of mass and charge in nuclear reactions.\n\n1. **Conservation of Mass**: The total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products.\n2. **Conservation of Charge**: The total charge of the reactants must equal the total charge of the products.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\nA. An alpha particle (\\({}^{4}\\text{He}\\)) has a mass of 4 and a charge of +2.\nB. An electron (\\({}^{0}\\text{e}\\)) has a mass of 0 and a charge of -1.\nC. A neutron (\\({}^{1}\\text{n}\\)) has a mass of 1 and no charge.\nD. A proton (\\({}^{1}\\text{H}\\)) has a mass of 1 and a charge of +1.\n\nGiven the reactant \\({}^{6}\\text{Li}_3\\) and the product \\({}^{7}\\text{Li}_3\\), we can see that the mass increases by 1 ( from 6 to 7) and the charge remains the same ( from 3 to 3).\n\nLet's check each option:\n\n- **Option A**: Adding an alpha particle (\\({}^{4}\\text{He}\\)) would increase the mass by 4 and the charge by +2, which does not match the given reaction.\n- **Option B**: Adding an electron (\\({}^{0}\\text{en}\\)) would decrease the mass by 0 and the charge by -1, which also does not match the given reaction.\n- **Option C**: Adding a neutron (\\({}^{1}\\text{n}\\)) would increase the mass by 1 and the charge by 0, which matches the given reaction.\n- **Option D**: Adding a proton (\\({}^{1}\\text{H}\\)) would increase the mass by 1 and the charge by +1, which does not match the given reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. a neutron"
