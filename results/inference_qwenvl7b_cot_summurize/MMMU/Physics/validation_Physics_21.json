In nuclear physics, the strong nuclear force is attractive, so a positive force at this point would not be correct.\n\n2. **Point B**: This point is located at the origin ( (0, 0), where the force is zero. The strong nuclear force is zero at the nuclear radius, but it is not repulsive at this point.\n\n3. **Point C**: This point is located in the negative region of the graph, indicating a negative force. In nuclear physics, the strong nuclear force is attractive, so a negative force at this point would not be correct.\n\n4. **Point D**: This point is located in the positive region of the graph, indicating a positive force. However, since the strong nuclear force is attractive, a positive force at this point would not be correct.\n\nGiven the options, none of the points A, B, C, or D correctly represents the repulsive nature of the strong nuclear force. The strong nuclear force is always attractive, and the graph should show a negative force at the nuclear radius ( ( 0,  0). Therefore, none of the given points options correctly represent the repulsive nature of the strong nuclear force."
