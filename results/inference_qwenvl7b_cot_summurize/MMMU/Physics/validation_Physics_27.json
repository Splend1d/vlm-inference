In the given circuit, each resistor has the same resistance, and the voltmeter has a very high resistance.\n\nLet's analyze the circuit step by step:\n\n1. The circuit is divided into two parallel branches.\n2. In each branch, the resistors are connected in series.\n3. The voltmeter is connected across two points in the circuit.\n\nTo find the points where the potential difference is zero, we need to consider the potential distribution across the resistors.\n\n- In the upper branch (W, U, and Q, the potential difference across each resistor is the same because they are in series.\n- In the lower branch, S, Q, and P, the potential difference across each resistor is the same because they are in series.\n\nNow, let's consider the potential difference across the resistors branches:\n\n- If the voltmeter is connected between Q and U, the potential difference across the resistors in the upper branch will be the same as the potential difference across the resistors in the lower branch. Since the resistors are identical, the potential difference across each will be the same, resulting in zero potential difference across the voltmeter.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
