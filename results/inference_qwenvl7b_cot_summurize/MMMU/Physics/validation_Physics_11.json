For constructive interference, the path difference between the two reflected waves must be an integer multiple of the wavelength of the light.\n\nGiven:\n- The wavelength of orange light in air, \\(\\lambda_{\\text{air}} = 600 \\text{ nm}\\)\n- The index of refraction of air, \\(n_{\\text{air}} = 1.00\\)\n- The index of refraction of glass, \\(n_{\\text{glass}} = 1.50\\)\n- The index of refraction of water, \\(n_{\\text{water}} = 1.33\\)\n\nThe path difference for constructive interference is given by:\n\\[ d = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{air}}}{2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(d\\) is the thickness of the glass layer.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ d = \\frac{{600 \\text{ nm}}{2} = 300 \\text{ nm} \\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum thickness of the glass that gives the reflected light an orange color is 300 nm.\n\nHowever, this option is not available in the given choices. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. Based on the calculation, the correct answer should be:\n\nC. 300 nm"
