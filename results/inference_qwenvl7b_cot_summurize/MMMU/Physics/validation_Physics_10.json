                "text": "To determine which statement is true for both spheres, let's analyze the motion of each sphere:\n\n1. **Sphere Attached to a Spring (**\n   - The sphere undergoes simple harmonic motion (SHM) due to the spring force.\n   - The maximum kinetic energy is indeed attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position because at this point, the spring force is zero, and the velocity is maximum.\n   - The minimum gravitational potential energy is also attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position because at this point, the height above the equilibrium position is zero.\n   - The maximum gravitational potential energy is not attained when the sphere reaches its point of release because the point of release is not at the maximum height above the equilibrium position.\n   - The maximum total energy is constant and is equal to the initial potential energy at the point of release.\n\n2. **Sphere Suspended from a String (**\n   - The sphere undergoes simple harmonic motion due to the pendulum's restoring force.\n   - The maximum kinetic energy is indeed attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position because at this point, the velocity is maximum.\n   - The minimum gravitational potential energy is also attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position because at this point, the height above the equilibrium position is zero.\n   - The maximum gravitational potential energy is not attained when the sphere reaches its point of release because the point of release is not at the maximum height above the equilibrium position.\n   - The maximum total energy is constant and is equal to the initial potential energy at the point of release.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct statements for both spheres are:\n\nA. The maximum kinetic energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.\nB.
