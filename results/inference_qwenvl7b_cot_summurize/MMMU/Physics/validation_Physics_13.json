This is because the initial position is reached when the object's velocity returns to zero after moving in a straight line.\n\nFrom the graph:\n- The object starts at t = 0 with a velocity of 0 m/s.\n- The object moves in the negative direction ( from t = 0 to t = 1 s.\n- The object moves in the positive direction from t = 1 s to t = 2 s.\n- The object returns to its initial position at t = 2 s, as its velocity returns to 0 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the object again passes through its initial position at t = 2 s.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 2 s"
