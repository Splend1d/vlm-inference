The molecule in blue has a positively charged amine group ((-NH3+).\n2. The binding site has a negatively charged carboxyl group (-COO-).\n\nThe interaction between the positively charged amine group and the negatively charged carboxyl group is an ionic bond. This is because the positive and negative charges attract each other, forming an ionic bond.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. ionic bonds"
