The rate law for the reaction is given by:\n\nrate = k[A]^x[B]^y\n\nwhere x and y are the orders with respect to A and B, respectively, and k is the rate constant.\n\nFrom the given data, we can calculate the rate law constants for different initial concentrations of A and B:\n\n1. For [A] = 0.08 M{ and [B] = 0.06 M:\n   rate = 0.012 M/s\n\n2. For [A] = 0.08 M and [B] = 0.03 M:\n   rate = 0.006 M/s\n\n3. For [A] = 0.04 M and [B] = 0.06 M:\n   rate = 0.003 M/s\n\nNow, we can use the method of initial rates to find the orders:\n\nFor A:\nrate = k[A]^x[B]^y\n0.012 = k(0.08)^x(0.06)^y\n\nFor B:\nrate = k[A]^x[B]^y\n0.006 = k(0.08)^x(0.03)^y\n\nDividing the two equations:\n(0.012/0.006) = ( (k(0.08)^x(0.06)^y)/(k(0.08)^x(0.03)^y)\n2 = ( (0.06)^y/(0.03)^y\n2 = ( (0.06/0.03)^y\n2 = 2^y\ny = 1\n\nFor A:\nrate = k[A]^x[B]^y\n0.012 = k(0.08)^x(0.06)^1\n\nFor B:\nrate = k[A]^x[B]^y\n0.006 = k(0.08)^1(0.03)^1\n\nDivide the two equations:\n(0.012/0.006) = ( (k(0.08)^x(0.06)^1)/(k(0.08)^1(0.03)^1)\n2 = ( (0.08)^x/(0.03)^1\n2 = 2^x\nx = 1\n\nTherefore, the order with respect to reactant A and B is 1,1.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 1,1."
