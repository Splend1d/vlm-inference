Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, and its concentration is directly related to the concentration of hydrogen ions ([H+]) in solution. The concentration of hydrogen ions is also what is typically measured in such a graph when discussing the acidity of a solution.\n\n- Option A: [H+] ( Hydrogen ion concentration\n- Option B: pH\n- Option C: [OH-] Hydroxide ion concentration\n\nGiven that the graph shows a linear relationship with [HCl], it is most likely that the y-axis represents the concentration of hydrogen ions ([H+]), as this is a direct measure of the acidity of the solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
