This ratio should be the same for all samples if they are the same compound.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see the following data points:\n- Sample 1: (5 g iron, 2.25 g oxygen\n- Sample 2: 10 g iron, 4.5 g oxygen\n- Sample 3: 15 g iron, 6.75 g oxygen\n- Sample 4: 20 g iron, 9 g oxygen\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratio of iron to oxygen for each sample:\n\n1. Sample 1: \\( \\frac{{5}{2.25} \\approx 2.22 \\)\n2. Sample 2: \\( \\frac{{10}{4.5} \\approx 2.22 \\)\n3. Sample 3: \\( \\frac{{15}{6.75} \\approx 2.22 \\)\n4. Sample 4: \\( \\frac{20}{9} \\approx 2.22 \\)\n\nSince the ratio is approximately the same for all samples, it is likely that all four samples are the same compound.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. True"
