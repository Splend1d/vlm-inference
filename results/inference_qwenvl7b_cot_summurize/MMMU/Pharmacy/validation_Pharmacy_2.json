This is because the low FEV1/FVC ratio suggests obstructive lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( (COPD), which is often treated with bronchodilators that block muscarinic receptors to relax the bronchial muscles and improve airflow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nE. muscarinic receptors"
