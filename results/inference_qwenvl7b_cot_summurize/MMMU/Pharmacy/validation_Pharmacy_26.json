Let's analyze each region:\n\n- **Region A**: This region appears to have a more random coil structure with no distinct helical segments.\n- **Region B**: This region also appears to have a more random coil structure with no distinct helical segments.\n- **Region C**: This region shows a clear helical structure with a regular pitch and a defined backbone conformation.\n\nTherefore, the part of the protein that is comprised mostly of \u03b1-helical secondary structure is **Region C**."
