The structure contains a tricyclic system, which is characteristic of doxorubicin.\n2. The tricyclic system is connected to a cyclic peptide through an amide bond.\n3. The cyclic peptide contains specific amino acids, including N-M-Gly ( (N-Methyl-Glycine), L-Val ( (L-Valine), and L-Pro ( (L-Proline).\n\nGiven these observations, the structure matches the characteristics of doxorubicin.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Doxorubicin"
