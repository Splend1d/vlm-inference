                "text": "To find the length and bearing of GA, we need to first determine the coordinates of point G. We can do this by adding the coordinates of points F to the coordinates of point G. The coordinates of point F are (1017.2, 370.4. The coordinates of point G are (1017.2 + 896.0, 370.4 + 0 = 1913.2, 370.4. The bearing of GA is the angle between the north direction and the line GA. We can find this angle by using the arctangent function. The length of GA is the distance between points G and A. We can find this distance by using the Pythagorean theorem. The length of GA is sqrt((1913.2 - 0)^2 + (370.4 - 0)^2) = 947.8. The bearing of GA is arctan((370.4 - 0) / (1913.2 - 0) = 216\u00b045'. Therefore, the answer is B."
