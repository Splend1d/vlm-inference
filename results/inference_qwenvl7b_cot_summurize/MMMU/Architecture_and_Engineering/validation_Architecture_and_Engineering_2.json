                "text": "To compare the scales of photography for the area recorded and the strip widths given by cameras A and B at the same flying heights, we need to calculate the scale for each camera and then compare the strip widths.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Scale for Camera A\n\nThe scale for Camera A can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Scale} = \\frac{\\text{Format Width}}{\\text{Focal Length}} \\]\n\nFor Camera A:\n- Format Width = 180 mm\n- Focal Length = 210 mm\n\n\\[ \\text{Scale}_A = \\frac{180}{210} = \\frac{6}{7} \\approx 0.857 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Scale for Camera B\n\nFor Camera B:\n- Format Width = 230 mm\n- Focal Length = 150 mm\n\n\\[ \\text{Scale}_B = \\frac{230}{150} = \\frac{23}{15} \\approx 1.533 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Scales\n\nCamera A has a scale of approximately 0.857, while Camera B has a scale of approximately 1.533. This means Camera B has a larger scale, which implies that it can capture more detail per unit area.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Photographs for Camera A\n\nTo calculate the number of photographs Camera A would take to cover a strip 16 km long at a flying height of 1350 m with a longitudinal overlap of 60%, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Photographs} = \\frac{\\text{Length of the strip}}{\\text{Length of one photograph}} \\]\n\nFirst, convert the flying height to meters:\n\\[ 1350 \\text{ ft} = 1350 \\times 0.3048 \\text{ m} = 411.52 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nThe length of one photograph can be calculated using the scale and the flying height:\n\\[ \\text{Length of one photograph} = \\text{Scale} \\times \\text{Flying Height} \\]\n\nFor Camera A:\n\\[ \\text{Length of one photograph}_A = 0.857 \\times 411.52 \\text{ m} \\approx 355.6 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nNow, calculate the number of photographs:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Photographs}_A = \\frac{16000 \\text{ m}}{355.6 \\text{ in}} \\approx 45.2 \\]\n\nSince we can't take a fraction of a photograph, we round up to the nearest whole number:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Photographs}_A \\approx 46 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems to have gone astray due to the units and the approach. Let's correct the approach:\n\n### Correct Approach\n\nTo find the number of photographs, we need to consider the strip width and the overlap:\n\n1. Calculate the strip width for Camera A:\n\\[ \\text{Strip Width}_A = \\text{Format Width} + 2 \\times \\text{Overlap} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Strip Width}_A = 180 \\text{ mm} + 2 \\times 60 \\text{ mm} = 240 \\text{ mm} \\]\n\n2. Calculate the number of photographs:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Photographs}_A = \\frac{\\text{Length of the strip}}{\\text{Strip Width}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of Photographs}_A = \\frac{16000 \\text{ mm}}{240 \\text{ mm}} = 66.67 \\]\n\nRounding up:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Photographs}_A \\approx 67 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is the number of photographs taken by Camera A is approximately 67.\n\nHowever, the provided options do not match this calculation. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the options provided. Given the options provided, the closest match to the calculated number of photographs is approximately 67 is not listed. Therefore, based on the provided options, the closest answer would be:\n\nD. 37.567 $\\approx$ 38"
