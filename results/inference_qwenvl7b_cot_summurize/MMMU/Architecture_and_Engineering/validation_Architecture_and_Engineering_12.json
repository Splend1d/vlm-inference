                "text": "To determine the directions of B, C, and D from A, we can use the given bearings and distances measurements. Let's denote the angles between the lines and the north direction as follows:\n\n- \\( \\theta_1 \\) is the angle between line AB and the north direction.\n- \\( \\theta_2 \\) is the angle between line AC and the north direction.\n- \\( \\theta_3 \\) is the angle between line AD and the north direction.\n\nFrom the given bearings:\n- \\( \\theta_1 = 143\u00b036'20\" \\)\n- \\( \\theta_2 = 238\u00b024'48\" \\)\n- \\( \\theta_3 = 307\u00b018'54\" \\)\n\nWe can use the Law of Cosines to find the angles between the lines. The Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) and opposite angles \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\):\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos C \\]\n\nIn our case, we have a triangle with sides \\( AB \\), \\( AC \\), and \\( AD \\) and angles \\( \\theta_1 \\), \\( \\theta_2 \\), and \\( \\theta_3 \\). We can rearrange the Law of Cosines to solve for the angles:\n\n\\[ \\cos C = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the angles step by step:\n\n1. Calculate \\( \\cos \\theta_1 \\):\n\\[ \\cos \\theta_1 = \\frac{3190.32^2 + 4085.15^2 - 3108.60^2}{2 \\cdot 3190.32 \\cdot 4085.15} \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\( \\cos \\theta_2 \\):\n\\[ \\cos \\theta_2 = \\frac{3190.32^2 + 3108.60^2 - 4085.15^2}{2 \\cdot 3190.32 \\cdot 3108.60} \\]\n\n3. Calculate \\( \\cos \\theta_3 \\):\n\\[ \\cos \\theta_3 = \\frac{4085.15^2 + 3108.60^2 - 3190.32^2}{2 \\cdot 4085.15 \\cdot 3108.60} \\]\n\nAfter calculating these values, we can find the angles \\( \\theta_1 \\), \\( \\theta_2 \\), and \\( \\theta_3 \\) by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of the results.\n\nFinally, we can determine the directions of B, C, and D from A by adding the calculated angles to the north direction.
