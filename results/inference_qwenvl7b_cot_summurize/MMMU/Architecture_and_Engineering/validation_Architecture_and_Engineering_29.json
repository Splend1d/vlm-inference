However, for the gradient calculation, we consider the absolute value of the horizontal distance.\n\nNow, we can calculate the gradient:\nGradient = \u0394h / \u0394x\nGradient = 0.045 / 90\u00b0\nGradient = 0.0005\n\nThe gradient is 1 in 200, which is not listed among the options. However, the closest option to this value is:\n\nB. Gradient = 1 in 33.95 a fall\n\nSo, the correct answer is B."
