We can use the Law of Cosines to find these distances.\n\nThe Law of of Cosines states:\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos(C) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( c \\) is the side opposite the angle \\( C \\)\n- \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the the other two sides\n- \\( C \\) is the angle opposite side \\( c \\)\n\nWe can use this formula for each side of the triangle to find AO and OC.\n\n1. For side OA ( (AB):\n\\[ AO^2 = AB^2 + OB^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot OB \\cdot \\cos(AOB) \\]\n\\[ AO^2 = 1200^2 + OB^2 - 2 \\cdot 1200 \\cdot OB \\cdot \\cos(0.794) \\]\n\n2.

However, we don't have the value of OB directly. But we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0 to find OB.\n\nThe sum of the angles in triangle ABC is:\n\\[ x + y + z = 180\u00b0 \\]\n\nWe can use the Law of of Cosines to find OB:\n\\[ OB^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC \\cdot \\cos(x) \\]\n\\[ OB^2 = 1200^2 + 1442^2 - 2 \\cdot 1200 \\cdot 1442 \\cdot \\cos(x) \\]\n\nWe can solve for OB using the given angles and sides.
