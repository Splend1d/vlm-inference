A price floor is a minimum price set by the government, which cannot be lower than this price. In this case, the price floor is set at $2 above the equilibrium price.\n\nFirst, let's find the equilibrium price. The equilibrium price is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. From the table, we can see that the equilibrium price is $8, as at this price, the quantity demanded (6 million Frisbees equals the quantity supplied 6 million Frisbees.\n\nNow, a price floor of $2 above the equilibrium price means the new price floor is $8 + $2 = $10.\n\nTherefore, the new market price after the imposition of the price floor is $10.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. 11"
