                "text": "To determine why it is probable that a monopoly exists in this market, we need to analyze the graph provided. The graph shows the average cost ( (AC) as a function of the quantity ( (Q).\n\n1. **Decreasing Returns to Scale**: If the average cost decreases as the quantity increases, it suggests economies of scale. This means that the cost per unit decreases as the production increases. This is typical of a competitive market where firms can produce more efficiently at larger scales.\n\n2. **Increasing Returns to Scale**: If the average cost increases as the quantity increases, it suggests diseconomies of scale. This means that the cost per unit increases as the production increases. This is typical of a monopoly market where the firm has control over the market and can produce at a higher cost per unit.\n\n3. **Constant Returns to Scale**: If the average cost remains constant as the quantity increases, it suggests constant returns to scale. This means that the cost per unit remains the same regardless of the production level. This is less common in monopoly markets.\n\nGiven the graph, the average cost ( (ac) decreases as the quantity ( (Q) increases. This indicates that the firm is experiencing economies of scale, which is more typical of a monopoly market where the firm has control over the market and can produce at a lower cost per unit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. There are increasing returns to scale well beyond the size of the market."
