The formula for CPI is:\n\n\\[ \\text{CPI} = \\frac{\\text{Price in the current year}}{\\text{Price in the base year}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the table, the price of Apples in 2015 is $1.10, and the price of Textbooks in 2015 is 140. The base year is 2015, so we don't need to adjust the prices for that year.\n\nThe total price of the basket of goods in 2015 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Price in 2015} = (\\text{Price of Apples in 2015} \\times \\text{Quantity of Apples}) + (\\text{Price of Textbooks in 2015} \\times \\text{Quantity of Textbooks}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Price in 2015} = ( (1.10 \\times 200) + ( (140 \\times 290) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Price in 2015} = 220 + 40600 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Price in 2015} = 40820 \\]\n\nNow, we calculate the CPI for 2015:\n\n\\[ \\text{CPI in 2015} = \\frac{40820}{140 \\times 290} \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{CPI in 2015} = \\frac{40820}{40600} \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{CPI in 2015} = 100.5 \\]\n\nSince the CPI is typically rounded to the nearest whole number, the CPI in 2015 is approximately 101.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided.
