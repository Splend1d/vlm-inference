The external cost is the difference between the willingness to pay and the cost of production.\n\nHere are the willingness to pay for each bottle of Zlurp:\n- First bottle: $5\n- Second bottle: $4\n- Third bottle: $3\n- Fourth bottle: $2\n- Fifth bottle: $1\n- Further bottles: $0\n\nThe cost of producing each bottle is $1.50.\n\nThe external cost is calculated as follows:\n- For the first bottle: $5 - $1.50 = $3.50\n- For the second bottle: $4 - $1.50 = $2.50\n- For the third bottle: $3 - $1.50 = $1.50\n- For the fourth bottle: $2 - $1.50 = $0.50\n- For the fifth bottle: $1 - $1.50 = -$0.50 ( (negative external cost, but we consider the absolute value)\n\nThe total external cost is the sum of the absolute values of the differences:\n$3.50 + $2.50 + $1.50 + $0.50 = $8.00\n\nHowever, the options provided do not include $8.00. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the options. Based on the given choices, the closest answer would be:\n\nC. 3\n\nThis choice is likely intended to represent the sum of the absolute values of the differences for the first four bottles, which is $3.50 + $2.50 + $1.50 + $0.50 = $8.00. However, since this option is not available, the correct answer based on the calculation would be $8.00, which is not listed among the provided choices."
