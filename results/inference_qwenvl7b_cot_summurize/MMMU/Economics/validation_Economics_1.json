The money supply can increase through the creation of new loans, which in turn can be deposited back into the banking system.\n\n1. **Initial Balance Sheet:**\n   - Reserves: $493\n   - Deposits: $2900\n   - Loans: $2407\n\n2. **Deposit of $700:**\n   - New Deposits: $700\n\n3. **Reserve Requirement:**\n   - Suppose the reserve requirement is 10% ( (This is a hypothetical scenario for calculation purposes. In reality, the reserve requirement would be determined by the central bank.)\n\n   - Required Reserves: $700 * 10% = $70\n\n4. **New Reserves:**\n   - New Reserves = Initial Reserves + New Deposits - Required Reserves\n   - New Reserves = $493 + $700 - $70 = $1123\n\n5. **New Loans:**\n   - New Loans = New Deposits - New Reserves\n   - New Loans = $700 - $1123 = -$423\n\nSince the new loans are negative, it means that the bank will have to reduce its loans by $423 to maintain its reserve ratio. This reduction in loans will not lead to an increase in deposits, and thus, the money supply will not increase.\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount by which the money supply will increase is:\n\nA. 0"
