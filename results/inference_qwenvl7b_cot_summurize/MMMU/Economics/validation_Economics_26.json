This would shift the entire consumption line upwards because the consumption at any given level of income \\( Y \\) would be higher.\n\n2. **\\( b \\) rises:**\n   - If \\( b \\) rises, it means that the marginal propensity to consume increases. This would make the consumption line steeper because a larger proportion of any increase in income \\( Y \\) would be spent on consumption.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is:\n\nA. C shifts upwards."
