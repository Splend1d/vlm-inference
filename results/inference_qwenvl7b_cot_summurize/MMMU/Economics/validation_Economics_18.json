LR as is typically influenced by changes in the economy's productive capacity, which is often associated with changes in capital, labor, and human capital.\n\n1. **Increase in capital**: An increase in capital would generally increase the economy's productive capacity, leading to a rightward shift of LR as. This is because more capital means more productive resources are available to produce goods and services.\n\n2. **Decrease in labor**: A decrease in labor would reduce the economy's productive capacity, leading to a leftward shift of LR as. This is because fewer workers mean fewer productive resources are available to produce goods and services.\n\n3. **Decrease in human capital**: A decrease in human capital would also reduce the economy's productive capacity, leading to a leftward shift of LR as. This is because less skilled or less educated workers mean fewer productive resources are available to produce goods and services.\n\nGiven the options:\n- **A. Increase in capital**: This would shift LR as to the right.\n- **B. Decrease in labor**: This would shift LR as to the left.\n- **C. Decrease in human capital**: This would also shift LR as to the left.\n\nSince the graph shows LR as shifting to the right from LRAS1 to LRAS2, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. Increase in capital**."
