Initially, the economy is at point B, which is on Curve 1. If the money supply growth rate increases, the Phillips curve shifts to the right, indicating a new equilibrium point where inflation is higher and unemployment is lower.\n\nLooking at the graph:\n- Point B is on Curve 1.\n- If the money supply growth rate increases, the Phillips curve shifts to Curve 2.\n- The new equilibrium point is at point C, where the inflation rate is higher and the unemployment rate is lower.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. move to C."
