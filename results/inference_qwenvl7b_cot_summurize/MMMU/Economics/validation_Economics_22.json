                "text": "To determine the effects of an increase in the money supply on GDP and the price level, we need to analyze the given graphs and the relationship between money supply, interest rates, and aggregate demand and supply.\n\n1. **Interest Rates ( (r) vs. Money Supply:**\n   - The graph shows that an increase in the money supply leads to a decrease in interest rates. This is because an increase in the money supply shifts the demand curve for money to the right, which in turn shifts the supply curve for money to the right, leading to lower interest rates.\n\n2. **Price Level ( (PL) vs. GDP:**\n   - The graph shows the aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves. The aggregate demand curve slopes downward, indicating that as GDP increases, the price level decreases. The aggregate supply curve slopes upward, indicating that as GDP increases, the price level increases.\n\nGiven these relationships:\n- An increase in the money supply leads to lower interest rates.\n- Lower interest rates stimulate investment and consumption, leading to an increase in aggregate demand.\n- An increase in aggregate demand shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right.\n- This shift in the aggregate demand curve leads to an increase in GDP.\n- As GDP increases, the price level decreases according to the aggregate demand and supply relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. GDP and the price level rise."
