In this case, it is IC 1.\n\n4. **Leisure Time**:\n   - The leisure time is the time not spent working. Since the budget constraint intersects IC 1 at point b, and the total time is 24 hours, the leisure time is 24 - (b.\n\nGiven the graph, point b is approximately at 12 hours from the 24-hour mark.
