Convergence proceeds too slowly.\n\nThe image illustrates the process of divergence and convergence, where divergence (the spreading out of ideas or concepts) precedes convergence (the coming together of ideas or concepts to form a new, innovative product. Critics often complain that convergence proceeds too slowly because they may perceive the process as taking too long to produce tangible results or innovative outcomes."
