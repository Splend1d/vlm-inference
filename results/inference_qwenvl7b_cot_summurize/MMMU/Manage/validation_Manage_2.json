Human Resource Management**: This is typically included in the Learning and Growth Perspective as it deals with employee skills, knowledge, and development.\n- **B. Technology**: This is not explicitly listed in the four perspectives but is often associated with the Internal Business Processes Perspective as it deals with process improvements and efficiency.\n- **C. Marketing**: This is typically included in the Customer Perspective as it deals with customer satisfaction, retention, and loyalty.\n- **D. Operations**: This is typically included in the Internal Business Processes Perspective as it deals with process efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nGiven the analysis, **B. Technology** is not explicitly included in the four perspectives of the BSC as described in the image.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. technology"
