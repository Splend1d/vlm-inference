The critical path is the longest sequence of activities, which determines the project completion time.\n\nHere are the steps to calculate the EST and EFT for each activity:\n\n1. **Activity A:**\n   - Normal time: 3 weeks\n   - Crash time: 2 weeks\n   - Normal cost: $1,000\n   - Crash cost: $1,600\n   - Immediate predecessor: None\n\n2. **Activity B:**\n   - Normal time: 2 weeks\n   - Crash time: 1 week\n   - Normal cost: $2,000\n   - Crash cost: $2,700\n   - Immediate predecessor: None\n\n3. **Activity C:**\n   - Normal time: 1 week\n   - Crash time: 1 week\n   - Normal cost: $300\n   - Crash cost: $300\n   - Immediate predecessor: None\n\n4. **Activity D:**\n   - Normal time: 7 weeks\n   - Crash time: 3 weeks\n   - Normal cost: $1,300\n   - Crash cost: $1,600\n   - Immediate predecessor: A\n\n5. **Activity E:**\n   - Normal time: 6 weeks\n   - Crash time: 3 weeks\n   - Normal cost: $850\n   - Crash cost: $1,000\n   - Immediate predecessor: B\n\n6. **Activity F:**\n   - Normal timeime: 2 weeks\n   - Crash time: 1 week\n   - Normal cost: $4,000\n   - Crash cost: $5,000\n   - Immediate predecessor: C\n\n7. **Activity G:**\n   - Normal timeime: 4 weeks\n   - Crash time: 2 weeks\n   - Normal cost: $1,500\n   - Crash cost: $2,000\n   - Immediate predecessor: D, E\n\nNow, let's calculate the EST and EFT for each activity:\n\n**Activity A:**\n- EST = 0\n- EFT = 3 weeks\n\n**Activity B:**\n- EST = 0\n- EFT = 2 weeks\n\n**Activity C:**\n- EST = 0\n- EFT = 1 week\n\n**Activity D:**\n- EST = 3 weeks ( (since it depends on A)\n- EFT = 10 weeks\n\n**Activity E:**\n- EST = 2 weeks ( (since it depends on B)\n- EFT = 10 weeks\n\n**Activity F:**\n- EST = 1 week ( (since it depends on C)\n- EFT = 11 weeks\n\n**Activity G:**\n- EST = 4 weeks ( (since it depends on D and E)\n- EFT = 11 weeks\n\nNow, let's calculate the LST and LFT for each activity:\n\n**Activity A:**\n- LST = 0\n- LFT = 3 weeks\n\n**Activity B:**\n- LST = 0\n- LFT = 2 weeks\n\n**Activity C:**\n- LST = 0\n- LFT = 1 week\n\n**Activity D:**\n- LST = 3 weeks\n- LFT = 10 weeks\n\n**Activity E:**\n- LST = 2 weeks\n- LFT = 10 weeks\n\n**Activity F:**\n- LST = 1 week\n- LFT = 11 weeks\n\n**Activity G:**\n- LST = 4 4 weeks\n- LFT = 11 weeks\n\nThe critical path is the longest sequence of activities, which is D, E, and G. The project completion time is the LFT of the last activity on the critical path, which is G.\n\nTherefore, the project completion time is 11 weeks.\n\nThe correct answer is C. Slack are: 0, 4, 9, 0, 4, 9, 0."
