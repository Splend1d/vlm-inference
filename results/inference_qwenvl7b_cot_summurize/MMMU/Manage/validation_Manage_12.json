The candidates we supported were defeated in more than two-thirds of the races we followed. The result is a harder battle to get policies that benefit our interests through the legislature, but it's also a budget issue. We can't continue throwing money at races we can't win, no matter how agreeable the candidate's stand on our issues may be. The fact that they share our viewpoints doesn't help if they can't get elected. How can we determine where it makes sense to invest? E-mail #2: E-mail from Legislative Consultant to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Staff Researcher: The demographic breakdown of elections where we supported the unsuccessful candidate can tell us a great deal. We've won only in one demographic, and our margin there is smaller than the margins by which we lost the others. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Staff Researcher to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Legislative Consultant: The demographic groups in which we lost are on track to become a majority of the U.S. electorate this century, and they vote. Right now, they make up 37% of the overall population and 28% of voters in the last election. By midcentury, we can expect the Hispanic population to rise from 17% to about 29% of the U.S. population, and Asian-Americans, now about 5%, will be about 9%. Our one successful demographic is the one whose share is declining. Now 63% of the population, non-Hispanic whites will be less than half of the population by 2050. Consider the following statement. Does the information in the three sources support the inference as stated? Statement: E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported candidates whose policy positions did not appeal to ethnic minorities.\n\nA. Yes\nB. No\n"

                "text": "To determine whether the information in the three sources supports the inference that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported candidates whose policy positions did not appeal to ethnic minorities, let's analyze the data provided in the bar chart and the emails.\n\n1. **Bar Chart Analysis:**\n   - The bar chart shows the percentage of votes for opponents and our candidates across different demographic groups.\n   - The \"Opponents\" category shows the percentage of votes for the candidates E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported.\n   - The \"Our candidates\" category shows the percentage of votes for the candidates E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported.\n\n2. **Emails Analysis:**\n   - Email #1 mentions that the candidates supported by E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing were defeated in more than two-thirds of the races.\n   - Email #2 states that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing has won only in one demographic and that the margin in this demographic is smaller than the margins by which they lost in other demographics.\n   - Email #3 provides demographic projections, indicating that ethnic minorities are projected to become a majority of the U.S. electorate by midcentury.\n\n3. **Inference:**\n   - The inference is that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported candidates whose policy positions did not appeal to ethnic minorities.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The bar chart shows that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing's candidates ( \"Our candidates\" \u2014 received a smaller percentage of votes compared to their opponents across all demographic groups.\n- This #2 indicates that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing has won only in one demographic (non-Hispanic whites) and that the margin in this demographic is smaller than the margins by which they lost in other demographics.\n- Email #3 projects that ethnic minorities will become a majority of the U.S. electorate by midcentury.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to infer that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing's candidates did not appeal to ethnic minorities, as they lost in all other demographics and won only in a declining demographic (non-Hispanic whites).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe information in the three sources supports the inference that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported candidates whose policy positions did not appeal to ethnic minorities.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nA. Yes"
