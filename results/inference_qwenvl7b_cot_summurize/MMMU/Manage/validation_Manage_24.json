These points will lie on the line \\( y = x \\), which represents the scenario where the 3-year and 5-year returns are equal.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the points that lie on the line \\( y = x \\) are:\n\n- (1, 1)\n- (2, 2)\n- (3, 3)\n- (4, 4)\n- (5, 5)\n\nThere are 5 points that lie on the line \\( y = x \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of mutual funds that have equal 3-year and 5-year returns is 5.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nE. 5"
