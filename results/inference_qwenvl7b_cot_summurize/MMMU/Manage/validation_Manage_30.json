Therefore, the line should be most successful at predicting the number of reports in the years closest to the line.\n\nLet's analyze the graph:\n\n- The solid line represents the regression line.\n- The dotted line connects the points for 2003 and 2011, representing the average rate of change over the eight years.\n\nThe least-squares regression line is least successful at predicting the number of injury and illness reports in the year that deviates the most from the line. \n\nLooking at the graph, we can see that the actual number of reports in 2003 is significantly higher than the predicted number based on the regression line. This indicates that the regression line is least successful at predicting the number of reports in 2003.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 2003"
