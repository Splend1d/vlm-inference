Information technology practices capability\n2. Information management practices capability\n3. Information behaviors and values capability\n\nNow, let's examine each option in the context of these categories:\n\nA. Information collection and integration\n- This is directly related to the \"Information management practices capability\" as it involves the processes of collecting and integrating information.\n\nB. IT practices\n- This is directly related to the \"Information technology practices capability\" as it involves the use of IT for various purposes.\n\nC. Information management\n- This is directly related to the \"Information management practices capability\" as it involves the management of information.\n\nD. Information Behavior and Values\n- This is directly related to the \"Information behaviors and values capability\" as it involves the behaviors and values associated with information.\n\nGiven this analysis, the ability that is not included in the options provided is:\n\nA. Information collection and integration\n\nThis is because it is not explicitly listed as a capability in the model, even though it is related to the \"Information management practices capability.\"\n\nFinal answer: A. Information collection and integration"
