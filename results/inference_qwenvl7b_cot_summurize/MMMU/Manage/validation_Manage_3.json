Information regarding budgeted sales for the last quarter of the year is as follows: <image 1> Past experience shows that 5 percent of credit sales are uncollectible. Of the credit sales that are collectible, 60 percent are collected in the month of sale; the remaining 40 percent are collected in the month following the month of sale. Customers are granted a 1.5 percent discount for payment within 10 days of billing. Approximately 75 percent of collectible credit sales take advantage of the cash discount. Inventory purchases each month are 100 percent of the cost of the following month's projected sales. (The gross profit rate for Timpco is approximately 30 percent.) All merchandise purchases are made on credit, with 25 percent paid in the month of purchase and the remainder paid in the following month. No cash discounts for early payment are available.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. **Cash Sales for November:**\n   - Cash sales for November = $120,000\n\n2. **Collectible Credit Sales for November:**\n   - Credit sales for November = $150,000\n   - Uncollectible credit sales = 5% of $150,000 = $7,500\n   - Collectible credit sales = $150,000 - $7,500 = $142,500\n\n3. **Cash Receipts from Collectible Credit Sales:**\n   - 60% of collectible credit sales are collected in the month of sale:\n     - Cash receipts from collectible credit sales in November = 60% of $142,500 = $85,500\n   - 40% of collectible credit sales are collected in the month following the month of sale:\n     - Cash receipts from collectible credit sales in December = 40% of $142,500 = $57,000\n\n4. **Total Cash Receipts for November:**\n   - Total cash receipts = Cash sales for November + Cash receipts from collectible credit sales in November\n   - Total cash receipts = $120,000 + $85,500 = $205,500\n\nTherefore, the budget budget total cash receipts for November are $205,500."
