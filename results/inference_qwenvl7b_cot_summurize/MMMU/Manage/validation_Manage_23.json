The data provided is as follows:\n\n- 1950: 1000 units\n- 1955: 1100 units\n- 1960: 1210 units\n- 1965: 1331 units\n\nWe can see that the number of units sold is increasing each year. To estimate the sales for 1970, we can assume a linear trend and calculate the average annual increase in units sold.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1965, the total increase in units sold is:\n\\[ 1331 - 1000 = 331 \\]\n\nThe number of years between 1950 and 1965 is:\n\\[ 1965 - 1950 = 15 \\]\n\nThe average annual increase in units sold is:\n\\[ \\frac{{331}{15} \\approx 22 \\]\n\nAssuming this trend continues, we can estimate the sales for 1970 by adding the average annual increase to the sales in 1965:\n\\[ 1331 + 22 = 1353 \\]\n\nTherefore, the estimated sales in units for 1970 would be approximately 1353 units."
