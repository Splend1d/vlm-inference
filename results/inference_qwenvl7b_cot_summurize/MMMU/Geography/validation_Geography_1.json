The torque at any section of a torsionally loaded shaft is equal to the product of the torque at the fixed end and the distance from the fixed end to that section.\n\nGiven:\n- Torque at the fixed end ( (T1) = 1kN.m\n- Torque at section 1-1 = 4.5kN.m\n- Torque at section 2-2 = 2kN.m\n\nWe can use the principle of torsion to find the torque at sections 1-1 and 2-2.\n\n1. **Torque at section 1-1:**\n   - The distance from the fixed end to section 1-1 is 1m.\n   - Using the principle of torsion, the torque at section 1-1 ( (T1-1) can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     t_{1-1} = T_1 \\times \\frac{d_{1-1}}{d_{1-1}}\n     \\]\n     where \\( d_{1-1} \\) is the distance from the fixed end to section 1-1 and \\( a_{1-1} \\) is the distance from section 1-1 to the fixed end.\n     \\[\n     t_{1-1} = 1 \\text{kN.m} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{m}}{1 \\text{m}} = 1 \\text{kN.m}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Torque at section 2-2:**\n   - The distance from the fixed end to section 2-2 is 2m.\n   - Using the principle of torsion, the torque at section 2-2 ( (t2-2) can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     t_{2-2} = T_1 \\times \\frac{d_{2-2}}{d_{2-2}}\n     \\]\n     where \\( d_{2-2} \\) is the distance from the fixed end to section 2-2 and \\( a_{2-2} \\) is the distance from section 2-2 to the fixed end.\n     \\[\n     t_{2-2} = 1 \\text{kN.m} \\times \\frac{2 \\text{m}}{2 \\text{m}} = 1 \\text{kN.m}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the torques at sections 1-1 and 2-2 are:\n- Torque at section 1-1: 1kN.m\n- Torque at section 2-2: 1kN.m\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. 12.0kN.m, -3kN.m"
