The length of the pile can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Length of the pile} = \\frac{\\text{Time of flight}}{\\text{Wave velocity}} \\]\n\nFrom the figure, we can see three distinct peaks corresponding to the times \\( t_1 \\), \\( t_2 \\), and \\( t_3 \\). The time of flight for each peak is the difference between the time at the peak and the time at the origin ( \\( t_1 \\), \\( t_2 \\), and \\( t_3 \\).\n\nGiven:\n- Wave velocity = 3555.6 m/s\n- Time of flight for each peak\n\nLet's calculate the length of the pile for each peak:\n\n1. For \\( t_1 \\):\n\\[ \\text{Length of the pile} = \\frac{t_1}{3555.6} \\]\n\n2. For \\( t_2 \\):\n\\[ \\text{Length of the pile} = \\frac{t_2}{3555.6} \\]\n\n3. For \\( t_3 \\):\n\\[ \\text{Length of the pile} = \\frac{t_3}{3555.6} \\]\n\nSince the figure does not provide specific values for \\( t_1 \\), \\( t_2 \\), and \\( t_3 \\), we cannot calculate the exact length of the pile. However, we can estimate the length based on the given options.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. 10.7m\nB. 21.3m\nC. 24.0m\nD. 48.0m\n\nWe can estimate the length by assuming the time of flight for each peak is approximately equal. Let's assume the time of flight for each peak is around 3 ms ( (since the figure shows the peaks are roughly equidistant).\n\n\\[ \\text{Length of the pile} = \\frac{3}{3555.6} \\approx 0.84 \\text{m} \\]\n\nNone of the given options match this calculated length. However, the closest option to this calculated length is:\n\nB. 21.3m\n\nTherefore, the closest value to the length of the pile is:\n\nB. 21.3m"
