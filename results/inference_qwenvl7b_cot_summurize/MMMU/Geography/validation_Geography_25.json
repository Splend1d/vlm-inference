                "text": "To determine the correct method for constructing the waterproofing layer of the basement exterior wall with coiled materials, we need to refer to the provided image and the options given.\n\n1. **Option A: The roll waterproof layer is laid on the upstream surface of the external wall**\n   - This option suggests laying the waterproof layer on the upstream side of the wall. However, the image does not provide specific details about the direction of the wall or the flow of water. Typically, waterproofing layers are laid on the side that will be exposed to water or moisture.\n\n2. **Option B: The roll waterproof layer is laid on the back surface of the external wall**\n   - This option suggests laying the waterproof layer on the backside of the wall. This is a common practice for basement walls to ensure that the waterproofing layer is on the side that will be exposed to water or moisture.\n\n3. **Option C: The outer wall roll adopts the empty laying method**\n   - This option suggests using the empty laying method for the outer wall roll. The empty laying method typically refers to laying the material without any overlap or gaps, which is not a standard practice for waterproofing layers.\n\n4. **Option D: When laying double layer coils, the two layers of coils are perpendicular to each other**\n   - This option suggests laying double layers of coils with the layers perpendicular to each other. This is a common practice to ensure a thorough waterproofing layer.\n\nGiven the options and the typical practices in waterproofing layer construction, **Option B** is the most logical choice as it alignss with standard practices of laying the waterproof layer on the side that will be exposed to water or moisture.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. The roll waterproof layer is laid on the back surface of the external wall**"
