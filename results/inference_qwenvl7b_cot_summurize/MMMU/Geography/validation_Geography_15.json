Siltstone is a type of clastic rock composed of silt-sized particles that are cemented together.\n\nB. Shale is Clay, breaking easily into flat flakes and plates\n- This is correct. Shale is a type of claystone that breaks easily into flat flakes and plates.\n\nC. Chert is Silica, a microcrystalline form of quartz\n- This is incorrect. Chert is not a microcrystalline form of quartz. Chert is a type of sedimentary rock composed of fine-grained silica (SiO\u2082.\n\nD. None\n- This is incorrect because option C is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
