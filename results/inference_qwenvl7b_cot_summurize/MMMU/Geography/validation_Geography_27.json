The CPT is a geotechnical engineering test used to determine the soil's shear strength and other properties. The cone penetration resistance ( (qC) is a key parameter in this test.\n\nGiven:\n- The cone penetration resistance (qC = 200 kPa\n- The depth of penetration = 6 mm\n\nWe need to compare this penetration resistance with the standard penetration resistance ( (N60) values for different soil consistencies.\n\n1. **Hard Plastic ( (N60 = 10 - 20)**:\n   - This consistency is characterized by a high penetration resistance.\n\n2. **Plastic ( (N60 = 20 - 30)**:\n   - This consistency is characterized by a moderate penetration resistance.\n\n3. **Soft Plastic ( (N60 = 30 - 50)**:\n   - This consistency is characterized by a low penetration resistance.\n\n4. **Flow Milling ( (N60 > 50)**:\n   - This consistency is characterized by a very low penetration resistance.\n\nGiven the penetration resistance of 200 kPa, which is significantly higher than the typical values for plastic soils ( (N60 = 20 - 30), it is more likely to be in the hard plastic range.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Hard plastic"
