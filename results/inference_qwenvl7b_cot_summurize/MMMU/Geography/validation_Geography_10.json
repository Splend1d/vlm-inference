The moment of inertia of a rectangle about its center is \\( I_{\\text{rectangle}} = \\frac{1}{12} (h^3 \\), where \\( h \\) is the height of the rectangle.\n- The net moment of inertia \\( I_{\\text{net}} \\) is the difference between the moment of inertia of the circle and the rectangle:\n\\[ I_{\\text{net}} = I_{\\text{circle}} - I_{\\text{rectangle}} \\]\n\n### Section (b)\n- This is a square with a circular hole in the middle.\n- The moment of inertia of a square about its center is \\( I_{\\text{square}} = \\frac{1}{12} (a^3 \\), where \\( a \\) is the side length of the square.\n- The moment of inertia of the circular hole can be approximated as a circle with a hole in the middle.
