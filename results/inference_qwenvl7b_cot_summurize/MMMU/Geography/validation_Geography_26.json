Inlaid fragmented structure and fragmented structure\n\nThe \"Code for Geological Investigation of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering\" (GB Classification of Rock Mass Structure for 50287-99\" categorizes rock mass structures based on their characteristics and distribution patterns. Let's examine each option:\n\nA. Overall, block, and sub block structures: These are recognized and classified in the GB standard.\nB. Giant thick layered, thick layered, medium thick layered, interbedded, and thin layered structures: These are also recognized and classified in the GB standard.\nC. Weather weather unloading structure and weather weather fragment structure: These are not explicitly mentioned in the GB standard. The standard focuses more on structural patterns rather than weatheringing processes.\nD. Inlaid fragmented structure and fragmented structure: These are recognized and classified in the GB standard.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that does not belong to the \"Code for Geological Investigation of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering\" is:\n\nC. Weather weather unloading structure and weather weather fragment structure\n\nFinal answer: C."
