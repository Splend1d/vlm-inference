Let's re-evaluate the currents.\n\n3. **Re-evaluate the currents:**\n   - Since \\( I_{12} = 0A \\), it does not contribute to the current at the junction.\n   - Therefore, the current \\( I_{11} \\) should be the only current contributing to the junction:\n     \\[\n     I_{11} = 1A\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the current \\( I_{12} \\):**\n   - Since \\( I_{12} \\) is not contributing to the current at the junction, it must be zero:\n     \\[\n     I_{12} = 0A\n     \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 2.5A and 0A"
