They can carry them over long distances and change their position significantly over time.\n\n2. **Tides**: Tides can cause movement of pumice rafts, but they are generally not strong enough to move large rafts over long distances in a short period.\n\n3. **Waves**: Waves can move pumice rafts, but they are typically not strong enough to cause significant changes in position over a period of days.\n\n4. **Wind**: Wind can also move pumice rafts, but it is generally not strong enough to cause significant changes in position over a period of days.\n\nGiven the scale of the movement observed in the image and the timeumice raft's position change, the most likely cause is:\n\nA. ocean currents\n\nTherefore, the direct cause of the pumice raft's change in position between 8 and 14 August is most likely due to ocean currents."
