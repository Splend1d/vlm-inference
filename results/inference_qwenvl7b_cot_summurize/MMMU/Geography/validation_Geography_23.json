                "text": "To determine the type of cross-section that produces the combined deformation of oblique bending and torsion, we need to consider how the force \\( P \\) acts on the beam and how the cross-sectional shape affects the deformation.\n\n1. **Rectangle**: A rectangular cross-section will primarily experience bending deformation along the major axis. The force \\( P \\) will cause bending along the length of the rectangle, but it will not induce torsion.\n\n2. **Channel Steel**: A channel steel cross-section has a hollow shape with a web and flanges. The force \\( P \\) will cause bending along the length of the channel, but it will not induce torsion effectively because the flanges are not aligned with the force.\n\n3. **I-beam**: An I-beam cross-section has a solid web and flanges. The force \\( P \\) will cause bending along the length of the I-beam, but it will not induce torsion effectively because the flanges are not aligned with the force.\n\n4. **Equilateral Angle Steel**: An equilateral angle steel cross-section has a solid shape with two equal sides. The force \\( P \\) will cause bending along the length of the angle steel, but it will not induce torsion effectively because the force is applied along one axis, and the cross-section is not symmetrically aligned with the force.\n\nGiven the options, none of them are designed to produce both oblique bending and torsion simultaneously. However, the question seems to be asking for the cross-section that would produce the most combined deformation under the given conditions. \n\nThe most appropriate choice, considering the options and the nature of the question, is:\n\n**D. Equilateral angle steel**\n\nThis is because the force \\( P \\) applied along one axis of the angle steel will cause bending along that axis, and the solid shape of the angle steel can potentially induce some torsion, albeit less effectively compared to a cross-section specifically designed for torsion.\n\nFinal answer: **D. Equilateral angle steel**"
