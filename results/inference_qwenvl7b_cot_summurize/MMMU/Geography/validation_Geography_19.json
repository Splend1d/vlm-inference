The annotations include \"1\u53f7\" and \"2\u53f7,\" which likely refer to specific points numbers or features within the area. The dimensions provided are 1200 meters and 1800 meters, which could be the length and width of the area.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. Land subsidence\nB. Ground collapse\nC. Ground fissures\nD. Earthquake\n\nWe can analyze each option in the context of the image:\n\n- **Land subsidence**: This is a common geological hazard where the ground surface sinks due to the removal of subsurface materials (like groundwater or mining activities. The image does not show any features that would indicate land subsidence.\n- **Ground collapse**: This refers to the sudden and rapid sinking of the ground surface due to the failure of the ground structure. The image does not show any features that would indicate ground collapse.\n- **Ground fissures**: These are cracks or splits in the ground surface. The image does not show any features that would indicate ground fissures.\n- **Earthquake**: This is a seismic event that can cause ground shaking and damage. The image does not show any features that would indicate an earthquake.\n\nSince the image does not show any features that would indicate land subsidence, ground collapse, or ground fissures, the option that is not included in the hazard assessment of geological hazards is:\n\nA. Land subsidence"
