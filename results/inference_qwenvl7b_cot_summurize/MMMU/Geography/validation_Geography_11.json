The arrows point to the edges of the ridges.\n3. The edges are sharp and distinct, forming a V-shape.\n\nGiven these observations, the edges indicated by the arrows are most likely:\n\nA. aretes\n\nAretes are sharp, V-shaped ridges formed by glacial erosion. They are typically found in mountainous regions and are characteristic of glacial valleys.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. aretes"
