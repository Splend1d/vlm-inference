Given the options provided:\n\nA. Virus infection - Viruses can cause yellowing leaves and sometimes dieback, but the symptoms are often more widespread and can affect the entire tree.\n\nB. Herbicide damage - Herbicides can cause leaf discoloration and dieback, but the symptoms are usually more uniform and can affect the entire tree.\n\nC. Fungus disease - Fungal infections can cause leaf blight, dieback, and other symptoms, but the symptoms are often more widespread and can affect the entire tree.\n\nD. Phytoplasma - Phytoplasmas are a group of plant pathogens that can cause symptoms similar to those described, including yellowing leaves and dieback, but they are often more widespread and can affect the entire tree.\n\nE. Don't know, not sure - This option is not specific enough to provide a definitive answer.\n\nGiven the options and the specific symptoms described, the most likely cause is:\n\nD. Phytoplasma\n\nPhyoplasmas are known to cause symptoms similar to those described, including yellow yellow leaves and dieback, and they can affect the tree in a patchy manner."
