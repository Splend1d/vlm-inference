Don't know and don't want to guess - This option is not helpful and does not provide a specific term.\nC. Worm - This term is often used colloquially to describe the larval stage of many insects, including the white pine weevil.\nD. Maggot - This term is specifically used for the larval stage of flies.\nE. Grub - This term is often used to describe the larval stage of beetles and other insects.\n\nGiven the options, the most appropriate term for the juvenile stage of the white pine weevil is:\n\nC.
