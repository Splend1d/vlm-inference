The image shows a blackberry plant with a growth habit that is similar to the 'little leaf' symptoms commonly witnessed post-glyphosate treatment.\n2. 'Little leaf' symptoms are often caused by a lack of nutrients or stress on the plant.\n3. The options provided are:\n   - A. I don't know and I don't want to guess\n   - B. Nematodes\n   - C. Fungi\n   - D. Phytoplasmas\n   - E. Bacteria\n\nNematodes, fungi, phytoplasmas, and bacteria can all cause stress and nutrient deficiencies in plants, leading to similar symptoms. However, nematodes are a common cause of root damage and subsequent nutrient deficiencies, which can lead to 'little leaf' symptoms.\n\nGiven the options, the most likely pathogen that can cause a growth habit similar to 'little leaf' symptoms is:\n\nB. Nematodes\n\nNematodes can cause root damage, leading to nutrient deficiencies and stress, which can result in 'little leaf' symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Nematodes"
