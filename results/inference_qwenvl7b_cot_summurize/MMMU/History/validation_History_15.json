The context provided indicates that this is a Maroon resistance fighter from Jamaica in 1796. Maroons are former slaves who fled to the mountains and fought against slavery and oppression.\n\n2. **Image 2**: This image is a map of the major Cossack hosts of the former Russian Empire. Cossacks hosts were regions where Cossacks communities were located. Cossacks were a group of warrior elites who played a significant role in the expansion and governance of the Russian Empire.\n\nGiven these observations, the best context that encompasses both images is:\n\nC. Societies governed by warrior elites\n\nBoth images depict societies where warriors or fighters played a significant role, either as resistance fighters or as part of a warrior elite."
