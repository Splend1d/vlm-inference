The image shows a temple structure built into the side of a cliff, which is a characteristic architectural style often associated with Daoist temples.\n2. The temple's design and location suggest a strong connection to natural elements, which is a common feature in Daoist architecture.\n3. The presence of traditional architectural elements, such as the wooden structures and the overall layout, further supports the idea that this is a Daoist temple.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most likely assertion supported by the image is:\n\nD. Daoism influenced Chinese architectural styles.\n\nThis is because the image clearly shows a temple structure that embodies architectural features typical of Daoist temples, indicating the influence of Daoism on Chinese architecture."
