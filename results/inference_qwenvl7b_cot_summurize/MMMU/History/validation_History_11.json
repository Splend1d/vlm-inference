This empire was extensive and could have been depicted in a similar cartoon.\n\n2. **France**: France had a substantial colonial empire in the 19th century, including colonies in Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Senegal, and many others. This empire was also extensive and could have been depicted in a similar cartoon.\n\n3. **Belgium**: Belgium did not have a significant colonial empire in the 19th century. Its colonies were limited to a few small territories in the Congo Free State, which was not recognized by the international community as a Belgian colony until 1908. Therefore, Belgium could not have been depicted in a similar cartoon prior to 1890.\n\n4. **Germany**: Germany had a colonial empire in the late 19th century, acquiring colonies such as Togo, Cameroon, and parts of the Congo. This empire was significant and could have been depicted in a similar cartoon.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Belgium"
