The map shows the Han dynasty's territory covering a vast area of China, including regions like Dunhuang, T'aiyuan, Chang'an, Luoyang, and Jiazh\u00ec.\n2. The presence of cities like Chang'an and Luoyang indicates major urban centers within the dynasty's territory.\n3. The map also shows the Great Wall, which was a significant defensive structure built by the Han dynasty to protect their borders.\n\nGiven this information, the best explanation is:\n\nC. The Han dynasty imposed political unity where there had previously been competing states.\n\nThe Han dynasty unified much of China, which is reflected in the extensive territory shown on the map. The presence of major cities and the Great Wall also suggest a well-established and expansive empire.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. The Han dynasty imposed political unity where there had previously been competing states."
