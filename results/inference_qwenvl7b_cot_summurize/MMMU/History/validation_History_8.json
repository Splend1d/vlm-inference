The map shows a voyage that starts in Lisbon, Portugal, and travels to the Cape Verde Islands, then to Natal in Africa, and finally to Calicut in India.\n2. The voyage involves traveling across the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean.\n3. The path is from Europe to Africa and then to Asia, indicating a significant interest in exploration and trade routes.\n\nGiven this information, the most directly supported conclusion is:\n\nA. Portugal was primarily interested in exploration of the African and Asian coasts\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the map showing the Portuguese voyage from Lisbon to the Cape Verde Islands, then to Natal in Africa, and finally to Calicut in India, indicating a focus on exploration and trade in these regions.\n\nThe other options are not directly supported by the map:\n- B. Vasco de Gama was the first European to embark on intercontinental travel by sea ( - This is not directly supported by the map, as the map does not indicate Vasco de Gama's specific voyage.\n- C. European nations began to look outward for economic opportunities - While this is a general trend, the map does not specifically show this.\n- D. European began mass migrations to distant lands in the early sixteenth century - The map does not show mass migration, only it shows a single voyage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
