Women in Japan exercised influence on society, despite the persistence of patriarchy elsewhere.**\n     - This option suggests that despite patriarchy, women in Japan had some influence. This is plausible given the statue of a woman, which could represent a notable figure who had influence.\n   - **B. Women in Japan of all classes had equal opportunities like men.**\n     - This option is unlikely because it would imply that women had equal opportunities across all classes, which is not historically accurate.\n   - **C. Japanese society was highly patriarchal, much like Chinese society.**\n     - This option is also unlikely because it would imply that Japanese society was as patriarchal as Chinese society, which is not historically accurate.\n   - **D. Chinese views of women influenced Japanese gender roles.**\n     - This option is unlikely because it would imply that Japanese gender roles were influenced by Chinese views, which is not historically accurate.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible option is:\n\n**A. Women in Japan exercised influence on society, despite the persistence of patriarchy elsewhere.**"
