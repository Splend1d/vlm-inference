                "text": "To determine why countries of Eastern Europe were admitted later than other European Union members, let's analyze the historical context and the information provided in the table.\n\n1. **Support of these countries' agrarian populations for protectionist trade policies**: This option is unlikely because the EU was founded on the principles of free trade and economic integration, which would not align with protectionist policies.\n\n2. **Control of those countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War**: This option is plausible because Eastern European countries were under Soviet control and were part of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. The fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s allowed these countries to gain independence and eventually join the EU.\n\n3. **Resistance to the West by fascist governments in those countries**: This option is not supported by the historical context. The fascist governments in Eastern Europe were not a significant factor in the timing of EU membership.\n\n4. **The greater effect on those countries of the Great Depression and world wars**: This option is unlikely because the Great Depression and World Wars occurred in the early 20th century, while the EU was founded in the late 20th century.\n\nGiven the historical context, the most plausible reason is that Eastern European countries were controlled by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War, which delayed their admission to the EU.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is:\nB. Control of those countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War"
