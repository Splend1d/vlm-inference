The map shows both migrations and expulsions of Jews across various regions.\n2. The expulsions are indicated by dotted lines, and the migrations are indicated by solid lines.\n3. The regions with expulsions are marked with arrows pointing outward, indicating that Jews were expelled from these regions.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\nA. Muslim regions were more likely to expel Jewish people than Catholic ones.\n- The map does not provide specific information about the religious affiliations of the regions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Muslim regions were more likely to expel Jewish people than Catholic ones.\n\nB. Most of the Jewish expulsions originated in Protestant regions.\n- The map does not indicate which regions were Protestant. Therefore, we cannot conclude that most of the Jewish expulsions originated in Protestant regions.\n\nC. Catholic regions were more likely to expel Jewish people than other regions.\n- The map shows that there are multiple regions with expulsions, including Catholic regions like Spain and France. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Catholic regions were more likely to expel Jewish people than other regions.\n\nD. Jews migrated voluntarily to the regions with the most economic prosperity.\n- The map does not provide information about the economic prosperity of the regions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Jews migrated voluntarily to the regions with the most economic prosperity.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is true is:\n\nC. Catholic regions were more likely to expel Jewish people than other regions."
