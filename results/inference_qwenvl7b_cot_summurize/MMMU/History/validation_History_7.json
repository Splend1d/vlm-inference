The cartoon depicts a woman labeled \"War\" inviting a man labeled \"Any European Youth\" into a building labeled \"Furnished Rooms To Let.\"\n2. The text above the cartoon reads, \"Come on in, I'll treat you right. I used to know your daddy.\"\n3. The cartoon is from 1936, a time time when the world was still recovering from World War I and tensions were rising again in Europe.\n\nGiven this context, the cartoon is likely making a point about the allure of war and the potential for European youth to be seduced into participating in another war. The woman labeled \"War\" is inviting the man, symbolizing European youth, into a building, which could be interpreted as a metaphor for the dangers and allure of war.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. although European individuals and countries might be seduced into waging another major war, the United States would be wise to avoid participating."
