The cartoon depicts several nations pointing at each other, each holding a flag.\n2. The title \"The Crime of the Ages - Who Did It?\" suggests that the cartoonist is attributing blame.\n3. The nations depicted are England, Germany, Belgium, Russia, Austria, Serbia, France, and Italy.\n\nGiven these observations, the most accurate statement of the cartoonist's meaning is:\n\nB. All nations involved in World War I at its outbreak are to blame for it.\n\nThe cartoonist is suggesting that all these nations are equally responsible for the outbreak of World War I."
