The cartoon depicts a scene where a man is being attacked by another man labeled \"UNION-Busting\" and \"STRIKE-Breaking.\"\n2. The man being attacked is labeled \"FACT-FINDING.\"\n3. The cartoon is titled \"Strike-Breaking.\"\n\nThe cartoon seems to be criticizing the actions of those who are attacking and breaking strikes, which is a form of union-busting. The term \"Strike-Breaking\" suggests that the cartoon is highlighting the negative impact of these actions on labor unions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nB. government inspectors turned their backs to illegal repression of labor unions\n\nThis option suggests that the government was not taking action against the illegal repression of labor unions, which alignss with the cartoon's message."
