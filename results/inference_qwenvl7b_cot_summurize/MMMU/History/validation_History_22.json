The image does not show any Christian missionaries or any indication of resistance from them. it does not show any Christian missionaries or any indication of resistance from them.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible reason for the failure of Japan's early attempts at introducing the Chinese-style imperial exam is that it was considered pagan by Christian missionaries.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nD. Christian missionaries discouraged the adoption of pagan practices."
