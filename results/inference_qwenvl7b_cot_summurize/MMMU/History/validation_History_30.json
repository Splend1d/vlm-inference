British ships did not sail along the west coast of Africa during this period.\nB. British ships did not sail the Atlantic Ocean during this period.\nC.

British ships did not sail along the west coast of Africa during this period.\n- The map does not provide specific information about the west coast of Africa. However, since the map shows trade routes, it is possible that British ships did sail along the west coast of Africa, but the map does not explicitly show this.\n\nB. British ships did not sail the Atlantic Ocean during this period.\n- The map shows numerous lines connecting various points in the Atlantic Ocean, indicating that British ships did sail in the Atlantic Ocean during this period.\n\nC. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.\n- The map does not show any lines connecting points in the Pacific Ocean, suggesting that British ships did not sail in the Pacific Ocean during this period.\n\nD. British ships did not sail in the Indian Ocean during this period.\n- The map shows lines connecting points in the Indian Ocean, indicating that British ships did sail in the Indian Ocean during this period.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct conclusion is:\n\nC. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period."
