Defensive walls were successful in preventing borderland nomads from conquering the Han dynasty.\n- This option suggests that the Great Wall was effective in preventing invasions. While the Great Wall was a significant defensive structure, the image alone does not provide enough information to conclude its effectiveness in preventing invasions.\n\nB. The Han government built fortifications to protect the Silk Road.\n- The image shows the Great Wall, which is not directly related to the Silk Road. The Silk Road was a network of trade routes, and the Great Wall was primarily a defensive structure.\n\nC. Monumental architecture served both a religious and a military purpose in the Qin and Han dynasties.\n- The image shows the Great Wall, which is a monumental architectural structure. While it does serve a military purpose, it does not provide evidence of a religious purpose.\n\nD. Fortifications were built to project military power and defend against invasions.\n- The image clearly shows the Great Wall, which is a fortification built to defend against invasions. This option directly relates to the purpose of the structure shown in the image.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most likely use of the image in a historical context is:\n\nD. Fortifications were built to project military power and defend against invasions."
