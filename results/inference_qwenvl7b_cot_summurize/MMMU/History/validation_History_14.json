The territories are color-coded as follows:\n- Spanish Territory\n- Portuguese Territory\n- British Territory\n- French Territory\n\nThe map indicates the expansion of European empires into the Americas, which is a key aspect of the rise of empires.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Joint-stock companies developed in order to monopolize all trade in the region.\n- This option is not directly supported by the map. The map does not provide information about the development of joint-stock companies or their role in monopolizing trade.\n\nB. Colonist exported manufactured goods to Europe.\n- This option is not directly supported by the map. The map does not provide information about the types of goods being exported or their destinations.\n\nC. Mercantilist policies were used to expand European economies.\n- This option is supported by the map. Mercantilism was a policy used by European powers to expand their economies by controlling trade and resources. The map shows the territorial expansion of European powers, which aligns with the goal of expanding European economies through trade and colonization.\n\nD. Trans-Atlantic trade increased as trade networks in the Indian Ocean basin declined.\n- This option is not directly supported by the map. The map does not provide information about the decline of trade networks in the Indian Ocean basin or the impact on trans-Atlantic trade.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best description of a result of the rise of empires shown on <image 1> is:\n\nC. Mercantilist policies were used to expand European economies."
