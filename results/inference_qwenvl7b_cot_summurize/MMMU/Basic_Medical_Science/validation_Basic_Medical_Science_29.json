                "text": "Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a degeneration of the striatum and cortex of the brain. Patients show motor abnormalities, personality changes, a gradual loss of higher brain functions, and eventually die. Below <image 1> is a family pedigree and an accompanying Southern blot that was obtained with genomic DNA that was probed with a DNA complementary to the gene for the Huntingtin protein. Based on the linked image above, which statement is most likely to be CORRECT?\n\nA. HD is an autosomal recessive disease\nB. The huntingtin gene is likely to be located on the X-chromosome\nC. A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene\nD. The pattern of bands in the blot is indicative of abnormal splicing of the HD mRNA\nE. In most individuals, the region of the HD gene detected by the DNA probe is distributed on six different restriction fragments\n"

                "text": "To determine the correct statement based on the family pedigree and the Southern blot, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Family Pedigree Analysis:**\n   - The pedigree shows a pattern of inheritance where affected individuals (II-1 and II-2 have affected offspring (III-1.\n   - This suggests an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, as affected individuals have affected offspring without the need for both parents to be affected.\n\n2. **Southern Blot Analysis:**\n   - The Southern blot shows a pattern of bands that are consistent with an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene. This is characteristic of Huntington disease, which is caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the HD gene.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- **A. HD is an autosomal recessive disease** is incorrect because the pedigree shows an autosomal dominant pattern.\n- **B. The huntingtin gene is likely to be located on the X-chromosome** is incorrect because Huntington disease is caused by a mutation in the HD gene on chromosome 4, not the X-chromosome.\n- **C. A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene** is correct because Huntington disease is caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the HD gene.\n- **D. The pattern of bands in the blot is indicative of abnormal splicing of the HD mRNA** is incorrect because the bands are indicative of an unstable triplet repeat, not abnormal splicing.\n- **E. In most individuals, the region of the HD gene detected by the DNA probe is distributed on six different restriction fragments** is incorrect because the blot shows a consistent pattern of bands, not six different fragments.\n\nTherefore, the most likely correct statement is:\n\n**C. A likely cause of HD is an unstable triplet repeat in the HD gene**"
