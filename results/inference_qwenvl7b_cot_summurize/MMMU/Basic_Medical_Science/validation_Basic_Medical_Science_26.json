There are multiple organelles visible, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria.\n3. The cell has a clearly defined cell wall.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the cell is a plant cell. Plant cells are eukaryotic cells that have a cell wall, a large central vacuole, and various organelles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. plant"
