The nucleus in question is likely the nucleus ambiguus, which is involved in the control of muscles of the pharynx and larynx.\n\n2. **Function of of the nucleus ambiguus**: The nucleus ambiguus is part of the cranial nerve X ( (vagus nerve) and is responsible for controlling the muscles of the pharynx and larynx.\n\n3. **Termination of axons**: The axons of the nucleus ambiguus terminate in the muscles of the pharynx and larynx.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Muscles of pharynx and larynx."
