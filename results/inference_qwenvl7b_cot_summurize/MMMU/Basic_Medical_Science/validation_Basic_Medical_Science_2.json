The tissue appears to be composed of long, cylindrical structures with a spiral pattern.\n2. These structures are arranged in a way that suggests they are connected to each other, forming a network.\n\nCardiac muscle is typically characterized by its ability to contract rhythmically and is found in the heart. Skeletal muscle is attached to bones and is responsible for voluntary movements. Bone tissue is rigid and does not have the spiral pattern seen in the image.\n\nGiven these observations, the tissue in the image does not resemble either cardiac or skeletal muscle. Instead, it resembles the spiral arrangement of of blood vessels, which is more consistent with the structure of bone tissue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Bone"
