The cell in question has a large, round nucleus with a prominent nucleolus, which is characteristic of lymphocytes.\n2. The cytoplasm is relatively sparse and lacks the granules typically seen in neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes.\n3. The overall shape and structure of the cell are consistent with lymphocytes.\n\nGiven these observations, the cell type pictured is:\n\nC. Lymphocyte"
