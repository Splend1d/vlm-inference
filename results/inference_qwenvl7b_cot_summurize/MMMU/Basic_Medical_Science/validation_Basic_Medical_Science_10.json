A hydrogen bond is formed when a hydrogen atom is bonded to an oxygen atom and is also bonded to another oxygen atom.\n2. In the given image, the hydrogen bonds are indicated by the dashed lines.\n\nLet's analyze the image:\n\n- Arrow (a: This arrow points to a hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom, but it is not involved in a hydrogen bond.\n- Arrow b: This arrow points to a hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom, but it is not involved in a hydrogen bond.\n- Arrow c: This arrow points to a hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom, but it is not involved in a hydrogen bond.\n- Arrow d: This arrow points to a hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom, and it is also bonded to another oxygen atom, forming a hydrogen bond.\n\nTherefore, the arrow that points to a hydrogen bond is:\n\nArrow d"
