The image shows elongated, cylindrical cells arranged in parallel.\n2. The cells have distinct, dark-stained nuclei.\n3. The cells are surrounded by a pink-stained matrix.\n\nThese characteristics are indicative of skeletal muscle tissue. Skeletal muscle cells are long and cylindrical, and they are typically found in muscles that are attached to bones and are under voluntary control. The pink staining is consistent with the staining of skeletal muscle tissue under a microscope.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Skeletal muscle"
