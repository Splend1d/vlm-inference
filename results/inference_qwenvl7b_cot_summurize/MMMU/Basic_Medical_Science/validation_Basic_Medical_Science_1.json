The image shows a histological section with a central dark structure surrounded by a lighter matrix.\n2. The central dark structure is round and appears to be a nucleus.\n3. The surrounding matrix is stained pink, indicating it is likely a type of cell or tissue.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the structure in the image is most consistent with:\n\nC. Corpora amylacea\n\nCorpora amylacea are small, round, and eosinophilic structures found in the brain, typically associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. They are often seen in the context of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Corpora amylacea"
