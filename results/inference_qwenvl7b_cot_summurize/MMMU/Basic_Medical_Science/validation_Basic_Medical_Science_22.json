                "text": "To determine if the pedigree in Figure 1 shows the pattern for the transmission of colorblindness, we need to analyze the genetic pattern and compare it to the known inheritance pattern of colorblindness.\n\nColorblindness is typically inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. This means:\n1. Affected males ( (X^bY) are always carriers of the trait.\n2. Affected females ( (X^bX^b) are carriers but usually do not show symptoms because they have a normal X chromosome.\n3. Normal males ( (X^BY) do not show symptoms and do not carry the trait.\n4. Normal females ( (X^BX^b) are carriers but usually do not show symptoms because they have a normal X chromosome.\n\nNow, let's analyze the pedigree:\n\n1. Individual 1 ( (X^bX^b) is affected (X^b) and has a normal male ( (X^BY) child ( (Individual 3).\n2. Individual 2 is normal ( (X^BY) and has an affected male child ( (Individual 4).\n3. Individual 3 is normal ( (X^BY) and has an affected female child ( (Individual 5).\n4. Individual 4 is affected ( (X^bY) and has a normal male child ( (Individual 6).\n5. Individual 5 is normal ( (X^bx^b) and has a normal male child ( (Individual 7).\n6. Individual 6 is normal ( (X^BY) and has an affected female child ( (Individual 8).\n7. Individual 7 is normal ( (X^bx^b) and has an affected male child ( (Individual 9).\n\nThe pattern of inheritance matches the X-linked recessive trait:\n- Affected males ( (Individual 4, 6, 8, 9) are carriers.\n- Affected females ( (Individual 5, 8) are carriers but do not show symptoms.\n- Normal males ( (Individual 3, 7) do not show symptoms and do not carry the trait.\n- Normal females ( (Individual 5, 7) are carriers but do not show symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the pedigree in Figure 1 shows the pattern for the transmission of colorblindness.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. True"
