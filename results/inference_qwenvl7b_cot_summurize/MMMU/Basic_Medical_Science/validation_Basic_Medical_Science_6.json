When a pathogen is engulfeded by an O.C. cell ( (which is likely a mistake for \"D.C. cell\"), it activates the D.C. cell. The activated D.C. cell then secretes a hormone, which attracts Th2 cells and enables the D.C. to differentiate T-cells to Th2 cells. Th2 cells then promote IgE production, promote mast cell activity, and bind to create mast cell IgE complexes, which ultimately stimulate eosininophil production."
