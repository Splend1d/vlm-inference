Identify the muscle labeled B:\n   - Muscle B is located at the top of the image, near the eye socket.\n\n2. Understand the function of of each muscle:\n   - Muscle B appears to be the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for lateral movement of the eye.\n\n3. Recall the innervation of the lateral rectus muscle:\n   - The lateral rectus muscle is innervated by Cranial Nerve III ( Oculomotor Nerve.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Cranial Nerve III."
