House members may serve on only one committee at a time.\n\nHouse members are typically assigned to committees based on their political affiliation and their areas of expertise. Each committee has a specific focus area, and members are assigned to committees based on their expertise and the areas they are most knowledgeable about. This means that a House member may only serve on one committee at a time, which can make committee assignments a more important consideration for them compared to senators, who have more flexibility in their committee assignments."
