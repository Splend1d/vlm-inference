The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nWhen the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, it indicates that the economy is producing less of all goods and services at a given price level. This shift leads to a decrease in the equilibrium price level, as the price of goods and services must rise to cover the lower output levels. At the same time, the equilibrium quantity of output decreases, as the lower output levels require a higher price level to be sold."
