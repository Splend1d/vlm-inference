The slope is equal to MPC + MPS.\n\nThe consumption function is a mathematical relationship that describes how much of a good or service consumers are willing and able to buy at different levels of income. It is typically represented as:\n\nC = MPC + MPS\n\nwhere C is consumption, MPC is the marginal propensity to consume, and MPS is the marginal propensity to save. The slope of the consumption function is the sum of the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and the marginal propensity to save (MPS), which is equal to 1 - MPC.\n\nThe consumption function is typically used to analyze the relationship between income and consumption, and to understand how changes in income affect consumption behavior. It is often used in macroeconomic models to predict consumption levels in the short and long run."
