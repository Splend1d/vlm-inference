If the MPC is 0.90, it means that 90% of the additional income is spent on consumption.\n\nLet's denote:\n- $A$ as the autonomous investment,\n- $C$ as the consumption,\n- $M$ as the marginal propensity to consume,\n- $Y$ as the income.\n\nThe equation for autonomous investment is:\n\\[ A = Y \\times M \\]\n\nThe equation for consumption is:\n\\[ C = Y \\times M \\]\n\nGiven that $A = 100$, we can substitute $A$ in the equation for consumption:\n\\[ C = 100 \\times 0.90 = 90 \\]\n\nThe equation for aggregate demand (AD) is:\n\\[ AD = C + M \\]\n\nSubstituting the values of $C$ and $M$:\n\\[ AD = 90 + 100 = 190 \\]\n\nTherefore, the aggregate demand would shift to the right by $190.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. $190"
