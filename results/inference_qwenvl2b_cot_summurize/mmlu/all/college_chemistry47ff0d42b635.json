T1, unlike T2, is sensitive to molecular motions at the Larmor frequency.\n\nThe T1 (spin-lattice relaxation time) is sensitive to molecular motions at the Larmor frequency, which is the frequency at which the nucleus's magnetic dipole moment is aligned with the magnetic field. This means that T1 is influenced by the rate at which the nucleus's magnetic dipole moment changes, which is related to the frequency of molecular motions. On the other hand, T2 (spin-spin relaxation time) is not sensitive to molecular motions at the Larmor frequency."
