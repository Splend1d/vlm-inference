The value of the log-likelihood function will almost always be bigger for the restricted model than for the unrestricted model.\n\nThe likelihood ratio test is a statistical test used to compare two models. In this case, we are comparing a GARCH(2,2) model to a process with a constant conditional variance. The likelihood ratio test compares the likelihood of the restricted model to the likelihood of the unrestricted model. If the restricted model has a higher likelihood, it suggests that the restricted model is a better fit for the data.\n\nThe test statistic for the likelihood ratio test is the ratio of the maximum likelihood of the restricted model to the maximum likelihood of the unrestricted model. This ratio is then compared to a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom to determine the significance of the difference between the two models.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
