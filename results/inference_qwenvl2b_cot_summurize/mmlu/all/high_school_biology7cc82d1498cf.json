The statement that explains how a point mutation can have no negative impact in the protein formed from a sequence in DNA is:\n\nA. The first codon of a gene is always AUG, a leader sequence; a mutation in that sequence will have no effect on the protein produced.\n\nThis is because the first codon of a gene is always AUG, which codes for the amino acid methionine. This means that any mutation in this codon will not affect the protein produced, as the protein is not dependent on this codon for its amino acid sequence."
