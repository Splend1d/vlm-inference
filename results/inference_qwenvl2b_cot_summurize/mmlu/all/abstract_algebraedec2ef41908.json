A homomorphism is defined as a function that preserves the structure of the group, meaning that if \\(g_1\\) and \\(g_2\\) are elements of the group, then \\(f(g_1) = f(g_2)\\) implies \\(g_1 = g_2\\). Therefore, the kernel of a homomorphism is always non-empty. The kernel is the set of all elements \\(g\\) in the domain such that \\(f(g) = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element of the group.\n\nStatement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.\n- This statement is false. A nontrivial homomorphism exists between any finite group and any infinite group. For example, the homomorphism from the integers to the rationals is nontrivial, as it maps every integer to a rational number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
