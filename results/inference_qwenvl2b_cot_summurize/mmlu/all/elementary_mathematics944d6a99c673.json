This year, she will make two times the amount of soup that she made last year, so she will make 2 * 32 = 64 one-cup servings of soup this year.\nSince there are 8 one-cup servings in a cup, Chesa will make 64 * 8 = 512 one-cup servings of soup this year.\nTo convert one-cup servings to gallons, we divide by 8 (since there are 8 one-cup servings in a cup). So, Chesa will make 512 / 8 = 64 gallons of soup this year.\nThe answer is: $A$"
