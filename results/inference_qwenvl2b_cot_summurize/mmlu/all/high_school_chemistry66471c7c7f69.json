Q must be close to 1.0 since there is one mole of gas on each side of the equation.\n\nThis is because the balanced chemical equation shows that there is one mole of gas on each side of the equation, which means that the reaction is in equilibrium. The equilibrium constant (K) for a chemical reaction is a measure of the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium. In this case, the equilibrium constant K is equal to 1.0, which means that the reaction is in equilibrium and the concentrations of the reactants and products are equal at equilibrium."
