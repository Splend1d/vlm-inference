This implies that the researcher is looking for a significant difference in both the positive and negative directions.\n\n4. **Rejection Criteria**: In hypothesis testing, the decision is based on whether the observed data is consistent with the null hypothesis or not. If the observed data is consistent with the null hypothesis, the null hypothesis is accepted (H0 is not rejected). If the observed data is inconsistent with the null hypothesis, the null hypothesis is rejected (H0 is rejected).\n\nGiven that the alternative hypothesis is 2-sided, the decision will be based on whether the observed data is consistent with the null hypothesis or not. If the observed data is consistent with the null hypothesis, the null hypothesis is not rejected (H0 is not rejected). If the observed data is inconsistent with the null hypothesis, the null hypothesis is rejected (H0 is rejected).\n\nTherefore, the appropriate conclusion is:\n\n**B. H0 is not rejected**"
