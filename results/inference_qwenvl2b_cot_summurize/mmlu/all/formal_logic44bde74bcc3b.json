E: Ashleigh stops by. into English sentences, we need to understand the logical structure of the given formula and then translate it into English.\n\nThe formula is:\n(A \u2228 ~E) \u2261 (D \u2022 ~B)\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. A \u2228 ~E: This means either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by.\n2. D \u2022 ~B: This means Russell makes dinner just in case Ashleigh does not stop by.\n\nNow, let's translate these into English sentences:\n\n1. Either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by.\n2. Russell makes dinner just in case Ashleigh does not stop by.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by just in case both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft."
