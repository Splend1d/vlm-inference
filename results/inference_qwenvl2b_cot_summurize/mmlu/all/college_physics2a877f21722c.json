In this case, the quantum efficiency is 0.1, which means that 10% of the photons sent into the detector will be detected.\n\nIf 100 photons are sent into the detector, the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times. This is because the quantum efficiency is the probability of detection, and it is not affected by the number of photons sent into the detector. Therefore, the detector will detect 10 photons on average.\n\nThe rms deviation of the number of photons detected is the square root of the variance. The variance is the average of the squared differences between the number of photons detected and the mean number of photons detected. In this case, the variance is 0.1^2 * 100 = 1. The square root of 1 is 1, so the rms deviation is 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. An average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 1."
