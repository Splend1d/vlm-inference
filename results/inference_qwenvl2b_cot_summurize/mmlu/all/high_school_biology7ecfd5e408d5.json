Allopatric isolation brought about reproductive isolation.\n\nAllopatric isolation refers to the separation of populations due to geographical barriers, such as mountains, rivers, or other natural barriers. In this case, the Andros Islands in the Bahamas are separated by a series of ponds, which act as allopatric barriers. This separation allowed the mosquito fish populations to evolve different body shapes in response to the different predation pressures in the ponds. The presence of predatory fish in some ponds favored the evolution of a body shape that enables rapid bursts of speed, while the absence of predators in other ponds favored a body type suited to swimming for long periods. This process of evolution due to allopatric isolation is an example of reproductive isolation."
