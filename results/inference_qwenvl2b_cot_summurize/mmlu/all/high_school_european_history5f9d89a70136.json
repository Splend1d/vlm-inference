The passage discusses the German attitude towards war and the role of the national anthem \"Deutschland \u00fcber alles\" in this context. Let's break down the options:\n\nA. \"that the lyrics from the popular song Deutschland \u00fcber alles (which eventually became the German national anthem) were the reason Germany started the war\"\n- This option suggests that the lyrics themselves caused the war. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the lyrics were the cause of the war. It only mentions that the Germans allowed themselves to be betrayed into an excess of candour by their characteristic tendency to go to extremes.\n\nB. \"that the lyrics from the popular song Deutschland \u00fcber alles (which eventually became the German national anthem) were evidence of Germany's aggressive attitude\"\n- This option aligns well with the passage. It suggests that the lyrics reflect Germany's aggressive attitude towards war. The passage mentions that the Germans allowed themselves to be betrayed into an excess of candour by their characteristic tendency to go to extremes, which is a clear indication of Germany's aggressive nature.\n\nC. \"that the reason Germany lost the war was that it was betrayed from within\"\n- This option suggests that Germany lost the war because it was betrayed from within. However, the passage does not provide any evidence or context to support this claim. It only discusses Germany's tendency to go to extremes and the betrayal of its character.\n\nD. \"that Germany provided the ultimate framework for modern warfare\"\n- This option suggests that the passage implies Germany's role in modern warfare. However, the passage does not discuss modern warfare or its framework. It focuses on the German attitude towards war and the national anthem.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, the most accurate inference based on the passage is:\n\nB. that the lyrics from the popular song Deutschland \u00fcber alles (which eventually became the German national anthem) were evidence of Germany's aggressive attitude.\n\nFinal answer: B."
