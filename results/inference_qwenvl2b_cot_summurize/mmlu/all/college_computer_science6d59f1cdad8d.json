This is because the union of any finite set with itself is still finite. Therefore, if A is finite, B must be finite.\n\n2. **Regular languages**: A language is regular if it can be recognized by a finite automaton. If A is regular, then B must also be regular. This is because the union of any regular language with itself is still regular. Therefore, if A is regular, B must be regular.\n\n3. **Context-free languages**: A language is context-free if it can be generated by a context-free grammar. If A is context-free, then B must also be context-free. This is because the union of any context-free language with itself is still context-free. Therefore, if A is context-free, B must be context-free.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I and II only**"
