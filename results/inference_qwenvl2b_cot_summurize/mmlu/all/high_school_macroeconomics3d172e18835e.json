Lower disposable income higher consumption higher real GDP lower unemployment\n\nThis policy, known as a tax cut, generally leads to higher disposable income for individuals, which in turn stimulates consumption. Higher disposable income also leads to higher real GDP, as it increases the purchasing power of the money in circulation. Lower unemployment is also a potential outcome, as the increased disposable income may lead to more people working, which in turn increases the labor force."
