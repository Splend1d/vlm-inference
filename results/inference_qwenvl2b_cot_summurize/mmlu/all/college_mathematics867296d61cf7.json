Then we have:\n\nL = sqrt(3+2L)\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\nL^2 = 3 + 2L\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n2L = L^2 - 3\n\nL^2 - 2L - 3 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nL = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = -3. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 sqrt((-2)^2 - 4*1*(-3))] / (2*1)\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(16)] / 2\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4*3)] / 2\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 2sqrt(3)] / 2\n\nL = 1 \u00b1 sqrt(3)\n\nSince L is a limit, it must be a real number. Therefore, we have two possible solutions:\n\nL = 1 + sqrt(3) and L = 1 - sqrt(3)\n\nHowever, since the sequence {x_n} converges, the limit L must be a real number that is less than or equal to 1. Therefore, we discard the solution L = 1 + sqrt(3) and accept L = 1 - sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the limit of the sequence {x_n} as n approaches infinity is L = 1 - sqrt(3).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 0"
