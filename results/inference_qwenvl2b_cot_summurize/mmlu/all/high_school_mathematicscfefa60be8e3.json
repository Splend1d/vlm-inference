                    "text": " Let the three numbers be $9, a, b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the second and third terms, respectively. Then the common difference of the arithmetic progression is $a - 9 = b - a$. The common ratio of the geometric progression is $\\frac{b}{9} = \\frac{b + 20}{a}$.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $a = 9 + b$. Substituting this into the second equation gives $\\frac{b}{9} = \\frac{b + 20}{9 + b}$.\n\nCross-multiplying gives $b^2 - 9b - 20 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it by factoring: $(b - 10)(b + 2) = 0$.\n\nSo, $b = 10$ or $b = -2$. Since the third term of the geometric progression is positive, we discard $b = -2$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is $\\boxed{10}$. The answer is: $B$"
