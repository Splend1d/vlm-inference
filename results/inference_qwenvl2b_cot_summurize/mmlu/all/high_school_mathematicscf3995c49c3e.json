If f(x) is continuous at x = c, then f\u2032(c) exists.\n\nThis is because the derivative of a function at a point is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as the change in x approaches zero. If the function is continuous at that point, then the limit of the difference quotient exists, which means the derivative exists at that point."
