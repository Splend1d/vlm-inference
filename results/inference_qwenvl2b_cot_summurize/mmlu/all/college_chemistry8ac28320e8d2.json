In this case, the Lewis base is the chlorine atom, which is a strong electron pair donor. Therefore, compounds like BeCl2, MgCl2, and ZnCl2 are likely to behave as Lewis acids because they can accept the electron pair from the chlorine atom. SCl2, on the other hand, is a Lewis base because it can donate the electron pair to the chlorine atom."
