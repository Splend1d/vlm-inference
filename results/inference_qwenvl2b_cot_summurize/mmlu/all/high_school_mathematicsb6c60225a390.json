The inverse of a function $f(x)$ is denoted as $f^{-1}(x)$ and is defined as the function that reverses the operation of $f(x)$. So, to find the inverse of $h(x)$, we need to find the function $g^{-1}(x)$ such that $h(g^{-1}(x)) = x$.\n\nWe know that $h(x) = f(g(x))$, so we can substitute $g(x)$ into the equation to get $h(x) = f(2x-3)$. To find the inverse of $f(2x-3)$, we need to find the inverse of $f(x)$ and then apply it to $2x-3$.\n\nThe inverse of $f(x) = 3x + 4$ is $f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x-4}{3}$. So, we substitute $2x-3$ into this equation to get $h(x) = \\frac{2x-3-4}{3} = \\frac{2x-7}{3}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse of $\\frac{2x-7}{3}$. To do this, we need to find the inverse of $2x-7$ and then apply it to $\\frac{1}{3}$. The inverse of $2x-7$ is $2x-7^{-1} = 2x-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo, the inverse of $h(x)$ is $2x-\\frac{1}{2}$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{2x-1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{x-5}{6}}$."
