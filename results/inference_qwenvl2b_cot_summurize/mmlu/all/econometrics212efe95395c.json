(i) and (iii) only.\n\nBootstrapping is a statistical technique that involves resampling the data with replacement to create new datasets, which are then used to estimate the distribution of a statistic of interest. It is preferred to pure simulation when the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are known exactly or when the distributional properties of the actual data are known. In these cases, bootstrapping can provide more accurate estimates of the distribution of the statistic of interest because it takes into account the known properties of the data.\n\nOn the other hand, bootstrapping is not preferred when the distributional properties of the data in the experiment are unknown or when the sample of actual data available is very small. In these cases, pure simulation is a more appropriate method because it does not require resampling the data with replacement, which can be difficult or impossible to do accurately."
