A \u2283 (B \u2022 C)\n2. ~(B \u2022 C)\n3. A \u2228 (D \u2228 B)\n\nLet's analyze each premise step by step:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: A \u2283 (B \u2022 C)\n   - This means that if A is true, then B and C must also be true.\n\n2. **Premise 2**: ~(B \u2022 C)\n   - This means that B and C are not both true.\n\n3. **Premise 3**: A \u2228 (D \u2228 B)\n   - This means that A or D or both are true.\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure of these premises:\n\n- Premise 1 tells us that if A is true, then B and C must be true.\n- Premise 2 tells us that B and C cannot both be true.\n- Premise 3 tells us that A or D or both are true.\n\nGiven these premises, we can see that:\n- If A is true, then B and C must be true.\n- If B and C are true, then D must be true (because B and C cannot both be true).\n- If A is true and D is true, then B must be true (because A or D or both are true).\n\nTherefore, the only way for all these premises to hold simultaneously is if A is true.\n\nThus, the immediate consequence of the given premises in PL is:\n**A.
