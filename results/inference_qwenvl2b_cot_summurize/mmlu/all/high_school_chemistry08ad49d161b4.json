Their kinetic energy increases by a factor of less than 2.\n\nWhen a gas is heated, the molecules gain kinetic energy due to the increase in temperature. The increase in kinetic energy is directly proportional to the temperature increase. Therefore, if the temperature increases from 50 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules will increase by a factor of 2 (since the increase in temperature is 50 \u00b0C, and the increase in kinetic energy is proportional to the temperature increase).\n\nHowever, the increase in kinetic energy is not necessarily proportional to the increase in temperature. The increase in kinetic energy is also influenced by the initial temperature of the gas. If the initial temperature is very low, the increase in kinetic energy will be relatively small, and the factor of 2 will be less than 2. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
