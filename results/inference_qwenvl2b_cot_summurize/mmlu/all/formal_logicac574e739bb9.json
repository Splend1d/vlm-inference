If not everything is not at work, then not everything is at work.\"\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Option A:**\n   - \"Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.\"\n   - This translates to:\n     - \"Nancy is at work or Marvin is at work.\"\n     - \"All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner.\"\n     - \"Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner.\"\n     - \"Not everything is not at work.\"\n   - This matches the original statements.\n\n2. **Option B:**\n   - \"Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.\"\n   - This translates to:\n     - \"Nancy is at work or Marvin is at work.\"\n     - \"All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work.\"\n     - \"Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner.\"\n     - \"Not everything is not at work.\"\n   - This also matches the original statements.\n\n3. **Option C:**\n   - \"Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.\"\n   - This translates to:\n     - \"Nancy is at work or Marvin is at work.\"\n     - \"All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work.\"\n     - \"Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner.\"\n     - \"Not everything is at work.\"\n   - This matches the original statements.\n\n4. **Option D:**\n   - \"Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.\"\n   - This translates to:\n     - \"Nancy is at work or Marvin is at work.\"\n     - \"All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner.\"\n     - \"Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner.\"\n     - \"Not everything is at work.\"\n   - This matches the original statements.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll the given options match the original statements. Therefore, the best English interpretation of the given arguments in predicate logic is:\n\n**Option A, B, C, and D**"
