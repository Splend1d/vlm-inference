While it is true that every free abelian group of rank \\( n \\) is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}^n\\), which is a finite-dimensional vector space over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), it is not necessarily true that every free abelian group of rank \\( n \\) is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}^n\\). This is because the rank of a free abelian group can be any positive integer, not just a finite number.\n\nStatement 2 is true. A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set. The Betti numbers of a finitely generated abelian group are the ranks of its free resolutions, and they are equal to the number of elements in some generating set if the group is free abelian."
