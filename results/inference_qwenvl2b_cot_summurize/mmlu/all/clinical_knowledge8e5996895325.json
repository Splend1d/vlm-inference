Less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet.\n\nProviding information sources that are internet-based is important for people aged over 65 for several reasons:\n\n1. Accessibility: Many people over 65 may have difficulty accessing traditional print-based information sources due to physical limitations, such as mobility issues or visual impairments. The internet provides a convenient and accessible way to access information.\n\n2. Convenience: Internet-based information sources are often more convenient than traditional print sources. They can be accessed from anywhere and at any time, making them ideal for people with busy schedules or limited mobility.\n\n3. Cost-effective: Internet-based information sources are generally more cost-effective than traditional print sources. They can be accessed for free or at a low cost, making them a more affordable option for people on a budget.\n\n4. Personalization: Internet-based information sources can be personalized to meet the specific needs and interests of individuals. This can be particularly helpful for people with specific health conditions or needs, as they can access information tailored to their specific situation.\n\n5. Updated content: Internet-based information sources are often updated regularly, providing the most current and accurate information available. This can be particularly important for people with specific health conditions or needs, as they may need to stay up-to-date on the latest medical information and treatments.\n\nOverall, providing information sources that are internet-based is important for people aged over 65 because it can make information more accessible, convenient, cost-effective, personalized, and up-to-date."
