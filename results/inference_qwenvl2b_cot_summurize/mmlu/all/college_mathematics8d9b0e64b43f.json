Since X and Y are independent, the probability that both variables are less than or equal to 3 is the product of their individual probabilities, which is \\((1/2)^3 = 1/8\\).\n\nThe probability that at least one of the variables is greater than 3 is the complement of the probability that both variables are less than or equal to 3. Therefore, the probability that at least one of the variables is greater than 3 is \\(1 - 1/8 = 7/8\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 3/8"
