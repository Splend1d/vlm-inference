In a height-balanced binary search tree, the worst-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes because the tree is balanced, meaning that the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because the tree is balanced, and the search operation can be performed in logarithmic time by using a binary search algorithm.\n\n2. **Average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes**: This is also true. In a height-balanced binary search tree, the average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because the tree is balanced, and the search operation can be performed in logarithmic time by using a binary search algorithm.\n\n3. **Best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree**: This is false. In a height-balanced binary search tree, the best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree, not proportional to the height of the tree. The best-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes, not proportional to the height of the tree.\n\n4. **The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes**: This is true. In a height-balanced binary search tree, the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because the tree is balanced, and the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I, II, and IV**"
