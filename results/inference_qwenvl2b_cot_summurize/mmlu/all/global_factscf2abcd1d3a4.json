The question is asking about the percentage of people who believe in the principle of equality and justice within the state.\n\nGiven the options provided, let's analyze each one:\n\nA. 36% - This option is not relevant because it is a percentage, not a percentage of people.\n\nB. 51% - This option is not relevant because it is a percentage, not a percentage of people.\n\nC. 66% - This option is not relevant because it is a percentage, not a percentage of people.\n\nD. 81% - This option is not relevant because it is a percentage, not a percentage of people.\n\nUpon careful consideration, none of the options provided accurately reflect the percentage of people from Turkey who agree that the state is run for the benefit of all the people. The question seems to be asking for a percentage, but none of the options provided are percentages.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nNone of the options provided accurately reflect the percentage of people from Turkey who agree that the state is run for the benefit of all the people."
