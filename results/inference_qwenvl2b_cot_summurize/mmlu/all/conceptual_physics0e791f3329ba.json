The acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s^2.\n\nThe weight of the crate is:\n\nW = m * g = 100 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 980 N\n\nThe force required to raise the crate is therefore:\n\nF = W = 980 N\n\nThe velocity of the crate is equal to the height it is raised divided by the time it takes to raise it:\n\nv = h / t = 2 m / 4 s = 0.5 m/s\n\nSubstituting these values into the power formula, we get:\n\nP = F * v = 980 N * 0.5 m/s = 490 W\n\nTherefore, the power required to raise the crate is 490 W, which corresponds to option D."
