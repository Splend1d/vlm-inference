The plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants.\n- This option suggests that the plant would be unable to reproduce due to genetic defects. However, the spontaneous doubling of the chromosome number does not necessarily lead to a genetic defect; it could simply result in a doubling of the chromosome number without any genetic defects.\n\nB. The descendants would be at a selective advantage because of the increased ability to introgress.\n- This option suggests that the increased chromosome number might provide the plant with an advantage in the environment, allowing it to better adapt to its surroundings. However, the spontaneous doubling of the chromosome number does not inherently imply an advantage in the environment; it could simply be a result of the doubling process.\n\nC. The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species.\n- This option suggests that the plant could successfully reproduce with the parental species, which would be the case if the doubling of the chromosome number did not result in any genetic defects. However, the spontaneous doubling of the chromosome number does not necessarily imply that the plant would be able to backcross successfully with the parental species.\n\nD. The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n- This option suggests that the plant would regain the ability to reproduce sexually, which would be the case if the doubling of the chromosome number did not result in any genetic defects. The spontaneous doubling of the chromosome number does not necessarily imply that the plant would be able to reproduce sexually; it could simply be a result of the doubling process.\n\nGiven the options, the best description of the descendants of plants with the double chromosome number is:\n\nC. The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species.\n\nFinal answer: C."
