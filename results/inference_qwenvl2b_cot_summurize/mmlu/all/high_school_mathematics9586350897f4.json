The sine of $45^{\\circ}$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times \\text{other side} = 10$.\n\nSolving for the other side, we get $\\text{other side} = \\frac{10 \\times 2}{\\sqrt{2}} = 10\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we can find the area of the triangle. The base is the hypotenuse, which is 10 inches, and the height is the other side, which is $10\\sqrt{2}$ inches. So the area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 \\times 10\\sqrt{2} = 50\\sqrt{2}$ square inches.\n\nHowever, we need to express this in terms of a rational number. We know that $\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$. So the area is $50 \\times 2 = 100$ square inches.\n\nTherefore, the number of square inches in the area of the triangle is $\\boxed{100}$."
