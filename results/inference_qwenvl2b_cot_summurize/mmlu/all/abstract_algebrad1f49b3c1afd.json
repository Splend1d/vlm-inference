In this case, the ring is Z_24, which is the set of integers modulo 24. \n\nThe elements of Z_24 are 0, 1, 2, ..., 23-1 = 22-1 = 8. \n\nSo, the product of 12 and 16 in Z_24 is:\n\n(12)(16) = 12 * 16 = 72\n\nNow, we need to find the remainder when 72 is divided by 24. \n\n72 \u00f7 24 = 3 remainder 6\n\nTherefore, the product of 12 and 16 in Z_24 is 6. \n\nThe correct answer is D. 6."
