                    "text": " Let's denote $2x-y$ as $2k$ and $x+y$ as $3k$ for some constant $k$. Then we have the equation $\\frac{2k}{3k} = \\frac{2}{3}$, which simplifies to $k = 3$. Substituting $k = 3$ into the expressions for $2x-y$ and $x+y$, we get $2x-y = 6$ and $x+y = 9$. \n\nNow we want to find the ratio of $x$ to $y$. We can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $k$ as $x = 3k - y$ and $y = 3k - x$. Substituting these into the ratio $\\frac{x}{y}$, we get $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{3k - y}{3k - (3k - y)} = \\frac{3k - y}{-y} = -\\frac{3k - y}{y} = -\\frac{3(3k - y)}{y} = -\\frac{9k - 3y}{y} = -\\frac{9k}{y} - \\frac{3}{y} = -\\frac{9k}{y} - \\frac{3}{y} = -\\frac{9k + 3}{y}$.\n\nWe know that $k = 3$, so we can substitute this into the expression to get $-\\frac{9(3) + 3}{y} = -\\frac{27 + 3}{y} = -\\frac{30}{y}$.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of $x$ to $y$ is $-\\frac{30}{y}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{30}{-y}$.\n\nBut we know that $y = 3k - x = 3(3) - (3k - y) = 9 - 3k + y$, so we can substitute this into the expression to get $\\frac{30}{-9 - y}$.\n\nBut we know that $9 - y = 3k - (3k - y) = 3k - 3k + y = y$, so we can substitute this into the expression to get $\\frac{30}{-9 - y} = \\frac{30}{-9 - (3k - y)} = \\frac{30}{-9 - 3k + y}$.\n\nBut we know that $3k - y = 6 - 2x = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - (3k - y)) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) = 6 - 2(3k - y) ="
