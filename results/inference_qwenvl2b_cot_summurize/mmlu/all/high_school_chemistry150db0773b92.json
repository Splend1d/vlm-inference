H2S > H2Se > H2O.\n\nPeriodic relationships in the periodic table indicate that the bond strength of the central atom in a binary compound increases as we move down a period. This is because the atomic radius of the central atom decreases as we move down a period, which leads to a stronger covalent bond.\n\n- H2Se: The central atom is selenium, which is in the 16th period of the periodic table. Selenium has a larger atomic radius compared to hydrogen, so the bond strength of H2Se is weaker than H2S.\n- H2S: The central atom is sulfur, which is in the 17th period of the periodic table. Sulfur has a smaller atomic radius compared to hydrogen, so the bond strength of H2S is stronger than H2Se.\n- H2O: The central atom is oxygen, which is in the 8th period of the periodic table. Oxygen has a smaller atomic radius compared to hydrogen, so the bond strength of H2O is stronger than H2S.\n\nTherefore, the strength of binary acids from strongest to weakest is H2S > H2Se > H2O."
