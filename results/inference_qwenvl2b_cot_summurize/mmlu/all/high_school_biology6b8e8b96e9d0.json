Short loops of Henle to maximize water secretion\n\nIn a hot arid environment, animals with short loops of Henle would likely have a higher rate of water reabsorption, which would help them conserve water and survive. Long loops of Henle, on the other hand, would be less efficient in a hot arid environment because they would not allow as much water to be reabsorbed. Therefore, the animal with short loops of Henle would be the most likely to survive in a hot arid environment."
