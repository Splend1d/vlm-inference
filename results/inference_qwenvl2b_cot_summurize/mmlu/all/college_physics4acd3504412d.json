If the Sun were replaced by a black hole of the same mass, the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole would be 3,000 m. This means that the black hole would be much larger than the Sun, and it would have a much stronger gravitational field.\n\nThe orbits of the planets would be affected by the gravitational pull of the black hole. If the planets were orbiting the Sun, they would be pulled into the black hole's event horizon, and they would be unable to escape. This would result in the planets being pulled into the black hole, and they would not be able to continue their elliptical orbits.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The planets would oscillate about their former elliptical orbits."
