                    "text": "To determine which statement about mules is true, let's analyze the given information and each option:\n\n1. **Mules are relatively long-lived and hardy organisms that cannot, generally speaking, perform successful meiosis.**\n   - This statement indicates that mules are not capable of meiosis, which is a crucial process for generating genetic variation.\n\n2. **Consequently, which statement about mules is true?**\n\n   - **A. They have a relative evolutionary fitness of zero.**\n     - This statement is not necessarily true. Mules can have a relative fitness, but it is not necessarily zero. They can be adapted to certain environments and have some evolutionary fitness.\n\n   - **B. Their offspring have less genetic variation than the parents.**\n     - This statement is not necessarily true. Mules can produce offspring with genetic variation, as they can undergo meiosis. However, the offspring's genetic variation might be less than that of the parents due to the limitations of meiosis.\n\n   - **C. Mutations cannot occur in their genomes.**\n     - This statement is not necessarily true. Mules can undergo mutations, just like any other organism. Mutations can occur in their genomes, but they might not be as frequent or as extensive as in other organisms.\n\n   - **D. If crossing-over happens in mules, then it must be limited to prophase of mitosis.**\n     - This statement is not necessarily true. Crossing-over can occur in both prophase and metaphase of mitosis, and it can occur in both meiosis and mitosis. The statement implies that crossing-over is limited to prophase of mitosis, which is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that is true about mules is:\n\n**A. They have a relative evolutionary fitness of zero.**\n\nThis statement accurately reflects the fact that mules are generally not capable of performing successful meiosis, which is essential for generating genetic variation and thus for evolutionary fitness."
