                    "text": "To determine the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid, we can use the stoichiometry of the reaction. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction is:\n\n\\[ \\text{M} + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{MCl}_2 + \\text{H}_2 \\]\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of metal reacts with 2 moles of hydrochloric acid. Therefore, if 0.0623 grams of metal produces 28.3 mL of hydrogen at STP, we can calculate the mass of the metal as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of metal} = \\frac{\\text{Volume of hydrogen}}{\\text{Volume of hydrogen at STP}} \\times \\text{Molar mass of hydrogen} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of metal} = \\frac{28.3 \\text{ mL}}{22.4 \\text{ L/mol}} \\times 2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of metal} = 28.3 \\text{ mL} \\times 2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of metal} = 56.6 \\text{ mL} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of metal} = 0.0566 \\text{ g} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of metal} = 56.6 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nTherefore, the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid is 56.6 grams, which corresponds to option C."
