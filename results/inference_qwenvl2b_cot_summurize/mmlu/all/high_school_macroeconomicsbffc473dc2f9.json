This is because a decrease in aggregate demand reduces the total spending in the economy, which in turn reduces the demand for goods and services. As a result, businesses may reduce production and prices may fall.\n\nIn the long run, the economy would return to full employment, and the price level would stabilize at its natural level. This is because the economy would adjust to the new level of aggregate demand, and the price level would adjust to reflect the new equilibrium. In the long run, GDP would also return to its full-employment level, but the price level would be different from the short-run level.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
