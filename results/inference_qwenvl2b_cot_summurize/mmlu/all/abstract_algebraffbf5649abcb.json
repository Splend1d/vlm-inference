The correct formula for the order of the product of two subgroups \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) of a group \\(G\\) is \\(|HK| = |H||K|\\), not \\(|HK| = |H||K|/|H \\cap K|\\). The intersection \\(H \\cap K\\) is a subgroup of both \\(H\\) and \\(K\\), so it is counted in both \\(|H|\\) and \\(|K|\\), but not in \\(|HK|\\).\n\nStatement 2 is true. A group of order \\(2p\\) where \\(p\\) is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to \\(D_p\\), where \\(D_p\\) is the dihedral group of order \\(p^2\\). The cyclic group of order \\(2p\\) is isomorphic to \\(C_{2p}\\), which is isomorphic to \\(D_p\\). Therefore, Statement 2 is true."
