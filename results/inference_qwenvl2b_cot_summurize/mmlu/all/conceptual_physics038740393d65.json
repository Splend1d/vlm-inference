                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of neutrons and time in the reactor. The number of neutrons doubles every minute, starting from 1 billion neutrons. \n\nLet's denote the number of neutrons after \\( t \\) minutes as \\( N(t) \\). According to the problem, \\( N(t) \\) doubles every minute. Therefore, we can express \\( N(t) \\) as:\n\n\\[ N(t) = 2^{t-1} \\cdot 10^{10} \\]\n\nWe want to find the time \\( t \\) when the number of neutrons reaches half a billion, which is \\( 5 \\times 10^{10} \\). So, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 2^{t-1} \\cdot 10^{10} = 5 \\times 10^{10} \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( 10^{10} \\) gives:\n\n\\[ 2^{t-1} = 5 \\]\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides with base 2 gives:\n\n\\[ t - 1 = \\log_2 5 \\]\n\nSince \\( \\log_2 5 \\) is approximately 2.321, we have:\n\n\\[ t - 1 = 2.321 \\]\n\nAdding 1 to both sides gives:\n\n\\[ t = 3.321 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\n\\[ t \\approx 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of neutrons reached half a billion after 3 minutes. The correct answer is:\n\nC. 5 minutes."
