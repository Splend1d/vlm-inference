A photographer is manipulating a digital image and overwriting the original image. Which of the following describes a lossless transformation of the digital image?\n\nA. Compressing the image in a way that may lose information but will suffer only a small loss of image quality.\nB. Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image. The new value of each pixel represents a shade of gray, ranging from white to black.\nC. Creating the negative of an image by creating a new RGB triplet for each pixel in which each value is calculated by subtracting the original value from 255. The negative of an image is reversed from the original; light areas appear dark, and colors are reversed.\nD. Modifying part of the image by taking the pixels in one part of the picture and copying them to the pixels in another part of the picture.\n"

Creating the gray scale of an image by averaging the amounts of red, green, and blue in each pixel and assigning this new value to the corresponding pixel in the new image.\n\nThis process is known as converting the image to a grayscale representation. In a grayscale image, each pixel is assigned a single value that represents the intensity of the color. This value is typically a number between 0 and 255, where 0 represents black and 255 represents white. The grayscale representation is lossless because it preserves the original image's information, but it reduces the number of colors to a single value per pixel, which can affect the image's visual quality."
