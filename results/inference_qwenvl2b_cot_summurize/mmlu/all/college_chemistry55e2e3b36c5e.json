                    "text": "The rotational correlation time of a molecule is a measure of how quickly the rotational motion of the molecule decays. The magnetic field at which the spin-lattice relaxation time is fastest is determined by the Landau level of the magnetic field. The Landau level is the lowest energy state of the magnetic field, and it is determined by the magnetic field strength and the temperature of the system. In this case, the magnetic field strength is 1 T, and the temperature is 300 K. Therefore, the Landau level of the magnetic field is 1, and the spin-lattice relaxation time is fastest at this level. The spin-lattice relaxation time is given by the equation:\n\n\u03c4 = 1/2\u03c0\u03b3B^2\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the spin-lattice relaxation time, \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnetic field strength. Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\u03c4 = 1/2\u03c0(9.27 \u00d7 10^7) = 1.47 ns\n\nTherefore, the magnetic field at which the spin-lattice relaxation time is fastest is 5.19 T. The correct answer is B."
