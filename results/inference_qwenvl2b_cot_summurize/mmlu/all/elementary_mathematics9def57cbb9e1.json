The multiplication operation tells us how many times 3 fits into 14. Since 3 fits into 14 exactly 4 times (14 \u00f7 3 = 4), the expression 14 \u00d7 3 = 42 means that 42 is the result of multiplying 14 by 3.\n\n2. **42 is 14 more than 3**: This statement is incorrect because 42 is not 14 more than 3; it is simply 42.\n\n3. **14 is 3 times as many as 42**: This statement is incorrect because 14 is not 3 times as many as 42; it is simply 14.\n\n4. **42 is 3 times as many as 14**: This statement is incorrect because 42 is not 3 times as many as 14; it is simply 42.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation of the expression 14 \u00d7 3 = 42 is:\n\n**B. 42 is 14 more than 3.**"
