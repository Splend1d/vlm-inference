Increasing the initial concentration of SO2Cl2 will increase the rate of the reaction, which will decrease the half-life. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n\nB. Increasing the temperature at which the reaction occurs will increase the rate of the reaction, which will decrease the half-life. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n\nC.
