There does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E.\n\nThis is because if there were an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E, then by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there would exist a sequence of points x_n in E that converges to a point x in R such that f is not differentiable at x. However, since f is bounded and Lebesgue integrable, it must be Riemann integrable. Therefore, by the Riemann-Lebesgue duality theorem, there exists a countable set of points in R such that f is Riemann integrable. This contradicts the assumption that there is an uncountable subset E such that f is nondifferentiable at every x \\in E."
