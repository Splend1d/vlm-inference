Investment tax credits.\n\nInvestment tax credits are a type of economic policy that encourages businesses to invest in capital goods, such as equipment and infrastructure, which can lead to long-term economic growth. This is because investment in capital goods can create jobs, stimulate economic activity, and increase productivity over time. On the other hand, rapid consumption of natural resources, higher adult illiteracy rates, and a falling stock of capital goods are all likely to have negative effects on economic growth over time."
