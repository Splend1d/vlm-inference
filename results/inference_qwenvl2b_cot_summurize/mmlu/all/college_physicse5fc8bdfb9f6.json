In this case, the two sources of light are moving relative to the observer O.\n\n2. **Time of Flashing**: The two sources flash simultaneously, which means the time it takes for the light to travel from one source to the observer and back to the other source is the same. This time is given as 13 ns.\n\n3. **Speed of O' Relative to O**: The speed of O' relative to O is the difference in their speeds divided by the ratio of their relative positions. Since the two sources flash simultaneously, the distance between them is the sum of their positions, which is \\(10\\,m + 10\\,m = 20\\,m\\).\n\n4. **Speed Calculation**: The speed of O' relative to O is \\( \\frac{20\\,m}{13\\,ns} = \\frac{20}{13}\\,m/s \\).\n\n5. **Convert to Speed of Light**: To convert this speed to the speed of light, we use the fact that \\(1\\,m/s = \\frac{1}{c}\\,c\\), where \\(c\\) is the speed of light.
