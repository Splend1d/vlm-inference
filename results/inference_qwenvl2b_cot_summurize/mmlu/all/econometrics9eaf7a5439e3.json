Independent\n\nIf the standard tools for time-series analysis, such as estimation of the autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF), and spectral analysis, find no evidence of structure in the data, it implies that the data are independent. This is because the absence of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation indicates that the data are not dependent on past values, which is a defining characteristic of independent data."
