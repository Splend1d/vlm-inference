The computers cannot communicate because different manufacturers use different communication protocols.\nB. The computers can communicate, but additional hardware is needed to convert data packets from one computer's protocol to the other computer's protocol.\nC. The computers can communicate directly only if the messages consist of text; other formats cannot be interpreted across computers.\nD. The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.\n"

The computers can communicate directly because Internet communication uses standard protocols.\n\nInternet communication typically uses standard protocols such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web servers and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) for secure web browsers. These protocols ensure that data packets are transmitted in a standardized format, allowing computers to communicate with each other across the Internet."
