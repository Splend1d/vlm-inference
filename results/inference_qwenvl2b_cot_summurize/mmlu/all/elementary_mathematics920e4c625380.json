The player scored 18 points in his first game, which is 4 points fewer than he scored in his second game. This can be represented by the equation:\n\n\\[18 = p - 4\\]\n\nWhere \\(p\\) represents the number of points scored in the second game. To solve for \\(p\\), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[18 + 4 = p\\]\n\n\\[22 = p\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 18 = p \u2212 4; 22"
