The like terms in this case are the terms with $k$ and the constant terms. \n\nThe expression $\\frac{k-3}{2} + 3k+1+\\frac{3k+1}{2}$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{k-3}{2} + \\frac{3k+1}{2} + 3k+1$.\n\nNext, we can combine the fractions by finding a common denominator. The common denominator of $\\frac{k-3}{2}$ and $\\frac{3k+1}{2}$ is 2. So, we can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{2(k-3)}{2} + \\frac{2(3k+1)}{2} + 3k+1$.\n\nSimplifying each fraction gives $\\frac{2k-6}{2} + \\frac{6k+2}{2} + 3k+1$.\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions by adding the numerators: $\\frac{2k-6+6k+2+6k+2}{2} = \\frac{14k+4}{2}$.\n\nFinally, we can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2: $\\frac{14k+4}{2} = \\frac{14k+4}{2} = \\frac{14k}{2} + \\frac{4}{2} = 7k+2$.\n\nSo, the simplified form of the expression is $7k+2$.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{7k+2}$."
