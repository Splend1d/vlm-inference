However, the text does not explicitly state that this was the case.\n\n2. **The program was a complete disaster as agricultural output plummeted until Pyotr Stolypin's reforms made privatized Russian farming profitable.**\n   - This option suggests that the emancipation led to a significant decline in agricultural output, which was later reversed by Stolypin's reforms. The text does not provide information about the immediate effects of the emancipation.\n\n3. **The emancipation terms relegated former serfs to communal farming, thus keeping them in perpetual poverty, and made wealthy conservatives nervous.**\n   - This option describes the long-term effects of the emancipation by stating that former serfs were forced to live in communal farming, which kept them in poverty. Additionally, it mentions that wealthy conservatives were nervous about the emancipation, which could imply that it was seen as a threat to their interests.\n\n4. **No longer tied to the land, former serfs moved to the cities, thus spurning the commencement of an industrial revolution in Russia.**\n   - This option suggests that the emancipation led to a shift in the former serfs' economic activities from agriculture to urban life, which could have hindered the industrial revolution. However, the text does not provide information about the specific impact on urbanization.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best description of the long-term effects of Tsar Alexander II's emancipation is:\n\n**C. The emancipation terms relegated former serfs to communal farming, thus keeping them in perpetual poverty, and made wealthy conservatives nervous.**\n\nThis option accurately captures the long-term effects of the emancipation, which included the forced communal farming of former serfs and the potential for conservative nervousness about the emancipation."
