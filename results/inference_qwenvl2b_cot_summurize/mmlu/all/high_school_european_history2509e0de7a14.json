It establishes the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion as the official religion of France, and allows the Reformed religion (Protestantism) to coexist peacefully with Catholicism. This indicates that prior to 1598, France was experiencing religious conflict, as the Edict of Nantes was a response to the ongoing conflict between the Catholic and Protestant communities in France."
