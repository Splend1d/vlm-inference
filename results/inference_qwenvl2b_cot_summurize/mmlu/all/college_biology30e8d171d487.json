Water that is taken up by the roots and carbon dioxide from the air\n\nThe dry mass of organic matter in an oak tree is primarily composed of water, carbon dioxide, and other organic molecules that are taken up by the roots and used by the plant. The roots absorb water and carbon dioxide from the soil and air, respectively, and use these nutrients to grow and produce the organic matter that makes up the tree. The organic matter is then used by the plant for growth, reproduction, and other metabolic processes."
