The cache hit ratio is degraded if two or more blocks used alternately map onto the same block frame in the cache.\n\nDirect mapping of a cache involves storing multiple blocks of data in the same block frame, which can lead to a decrease in the hit ratio. This is because the cache will have to search through multiple block frames to find the correct block for a given key, which can be slower than accessing a single block frame."
