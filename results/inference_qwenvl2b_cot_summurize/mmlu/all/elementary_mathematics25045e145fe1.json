This is because the portions each class ate were the same, but the total number of students in each class would determine the actual number of slices or hamburgers eaten by each class.\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n- In Mr. Paulson\u2019s class, 0.5 of the students ate pizza.\n- In Ms. Hugo\u2019s class, 0.5 of the students ate hamburgers.\n\nSince the portions each class ate were the same (0.5 of the students), we need to know the total number of students in each class to determine the actual number of slices or hamburgers eaten by each class.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. the total number of students in each teacher\u2019s class"
