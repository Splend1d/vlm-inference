The explanatory variable is fixed in repeated samples.\n\nIn statistics, \"non-stochastic\" refers to a variable that does not change over time or across different observations. In the context of regression analysis, the explanatory variable is often considered to be fixed in repeated samples if it remains constant across different observations or samples. This means that the explanatory variable does not change from one sample to the next, which is a common assumption in many statistical models."
