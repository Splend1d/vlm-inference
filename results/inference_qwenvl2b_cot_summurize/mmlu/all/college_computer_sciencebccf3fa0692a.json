All bit strings whose number of zeros is a multiple of five\n\nThis is because a regular expression can only match patterns that are finite and regular. In this case, the pattern \"number of zeros is a multiple of five\" is not finite and regular, as it can match any number of zeros that is a multiple of five. Therefore, it cannot be described with a regular expression."
