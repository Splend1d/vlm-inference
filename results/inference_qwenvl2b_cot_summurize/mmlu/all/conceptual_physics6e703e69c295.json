When a star explodes, it releases energy in the form of gravitational waves, which can travel through space at the speed of light.\n\nThe time it takes for gravitational waves to reach Earth depends on the distance between the star and Earth. The faster the wave travels, the shorter the time it takes to reach Earth. In this case, the gravitational waves from a 20-light-year star would take more than 20 years to reach Earth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. more than 20 years."
