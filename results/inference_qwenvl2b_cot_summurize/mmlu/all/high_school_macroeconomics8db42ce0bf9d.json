The nominal interest rate minus anticipated inflation.\n\nThe real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the anticipated inflation rate. This is because the nominal interest rate is the interest rate as stated by the bank, while the real interest rate is adjusted for inflation, which is the expected increase in the price level of goods and services over time."
