This is because the intersection of two subspaces is a subspace itself, and the dimension of a subspace is the number of linearly independent vectors in it. If the intersection is empty (i.e., U \u2229 V = \u2205), then the dimension of U \u2229 V is 0. If the intersection is a single vector, then the dimension of U \u2229 V is 1. If the intersection is a subspace of dimension 2, then the dimension of U \u2229 V is 2. Therefore, the possible dimensions of U \u2229 V are 0, 1, or 2. The answer is D."
