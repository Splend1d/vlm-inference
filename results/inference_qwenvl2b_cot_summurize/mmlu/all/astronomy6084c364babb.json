Because it\u2019s in the northern hemisphere where it is winter now.\n\nThe Mars Exploration Rover Spirit is currently tilted towards the north because it is in the northern hemisphere, where it is currently experiencing winter. This is due to the Earth's axial tilt, which causes the Northern Hemisphere to be tilted towards the Sun during the winter solstice, resulting in shorter days and colder temperatures."
