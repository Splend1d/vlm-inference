False, False.\n\nTLS (Transport Layer Security) is designed to protect against attacks that involve the interception of data in transit, such as an attacker replacing bytes sent by a client with bytes of the attacker's own choosing. This is because TLS encrypts the data in transit using a symmetric key, which is then decrypted by the recipient. An attacker cannot replace the data in transit without being detected by the recipient's security mechanisms.\n\nHowever, TLS does not protect against attacks that involve reading the plaintext bytes sent by a client. This is because TLS encrypts the data in transit using a symmetric key, which is then decrypted by the recipient. An attacker cannot read the plaintext bytes sent by a client without being detected by the recipient's security mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, TLS protects against attacks that involve replacing bytes sent by a client with bytes of the attacker's own choosing, but it does not protect against attacks that involve reading the plaintext bytes sent by a client."
