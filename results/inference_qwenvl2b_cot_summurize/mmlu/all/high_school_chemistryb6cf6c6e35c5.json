Nonpolar covalent bonds are formed between atoms that have similar electronegativities, resulting in a stable, nonpolar molecule. The substance does not dissolve in water, which is another characteristic of nonpolar covalent bonding. Ionic bonding typically involves the transfer of electrons, which is not the case here. Metallic bonding involves the transfer of electrons from one atom to another, which is also not the case. Covalent network bonding involves the formation of a network of covalent bonds, which is not the case here."
