                    "text": "The Eisenstein criterion states that a polynomial in Z[x] is irreducible over Q if and only if it has no roots in Q. In this case, the polynomial is x^2 - 12.\n\nWe can check if the polynomial has any roots in Q by using the Rational Root Theorem. The Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial has integer coefficients, then any rational root must be of the form p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nFor the polynomial x^2 - 12, the constant term is -12 and the leading coefficient is 1. The factors of -12 are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b14, \u00b16, and \u00b112. The factors of 1 are \u00b11. Therefore, the possible rational roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b14, \u00b16, and \u00b112.\n\nWe can test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial:\n\n- For p = 1, q = 12, the polynomial becomes x^2 - 12 = 0, which has a root of x = 2.\n- For p = 2, q = 1, the polynomial becomes x^2 - 12 = 0, which has a root of x = -2.\n- For p = 3, q = 1, the polynomial becomes x^2 - 12 = 0, which has a root of x = 2.\n- For p = 4, q = 1, the polynomial becomes x^2 - 12 = 0, which has a root of x = -2.\n- For p = 6, q = 1, the polynomial becomes x^2 - 12 = 0, which has a root of x = 2.\n- For p = 12, q = 1, the polynomial becomes x^2 - 12 = 0, which has a root of x = -2.\n\nSince the polynomial has roots in Q, it is not irreducible over Q. Therefore, the correct answer is D. No."
