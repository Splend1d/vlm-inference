One method begins by heating a solid or liquid in a flask to produce a gaseous product. The gas passes through a tube and displaces water in an inverted, water-filled bottle. The mass of the starting material is measured, along with the volume of the displaced water and the temperature of the system. The pressure in the inverted water-filled bottle is equal to the external pressure. Once the barometric pressure has been recorded, what other information is needed to finish the experiment?\n\nA. The heat of formation of the gas\nB. The density of the water\nC. The mass of the displaced water\nD. The vapor pressure of the water\n"

The mass of the displaced water\n\nThis is because the volume of the displaced water can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( V \\) is the volume, \\( r \\) is the radius of the water-filled bottle, and \\( h \\) is the height of the displaced water. The mass of the displaced water can then be calculated using the formula \\( m = \\rho V \\), where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water and \\( V \\) is the volume of the displaced water."
