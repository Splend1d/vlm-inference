The half-life of a radioactive material is the time it takes for half of the material to decay. In this case, the half-life is 36 minutes.\n\nFirst, let's convert the time from minutes to hours since the time given is in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n\\[36 \\text{ minutes} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.6 \\text{ hours}\\]\n\nNow, we know that after 0.6 hours, half of the 10.00 grams of the radioactive material will have decayed. This means that after 0.6 hours, 5 grams of the material will remain.\n\nTo find out how much will be left after 2 hours, we can simply double the amount that remains after 0.6 hours:\n\n\\[5 \\text{ grams} \\times 2 = 10 \\text{ grams}\\]\n\nTherefore, after 2 hours, 10 grams of the radioactive material will be left.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 1.00 grams"
