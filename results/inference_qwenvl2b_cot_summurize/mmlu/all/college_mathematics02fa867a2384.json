For example, \\( 2 \\cdot 3 \\neq 3 \\cdot 2 \\) because \\( 2 \\cdot 3 = 5 \\) and \\( 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\), so \\( 5 \\neq 6 \\).\n\n2. **Identity Element**: The operation does not have an identity element. For example, \\( 0 \\cdot n \\neq n \\) for any integer \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Elements**: The operation does not have all elements having inverses. For example, \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\neq 2 \\) because \\( 1 \\cdot 2 = 2 \\), but \\( 2 \\cdot 1 = 2 \\), so \\( 1 \\) does not have an inverse.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nNone of the statements I, II, or III are true about the binary structure (Z, \u2022).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. I and II only"
