The membership of committees often overrepresents constituencies with the greatest stake in the committee's business.\n\nThis option is the most accurate because it explains why the opinions of congressional committees may not accurately reflect public opinion. Committees are typically composed of members who are elected to represent their constituents, and those with the most significant stake in the committee's business are more likely to be appointed to the committee. This can lead to a bias in the committee's decisions, as the members with the most influence are more likely to have a vested interest in the committee's work."
