First year: Salary increases by 10%.\n   - Original salary: $20,000\n   - Increase: $20,000 * 0.10 = $2,000\n   - New salary after the first year: $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000\n\n2. Second year: Salary increases by 10% more than the previous year.\n   - Increase from the first year: $2,000 * 0.10 = $200\n   - New salary after the second year: $22,000 + $200 = $22,200\n\nTherefore, after two years, Patricia's salary would be $22,200.\n\nThe correct answer is C. $22,000."
