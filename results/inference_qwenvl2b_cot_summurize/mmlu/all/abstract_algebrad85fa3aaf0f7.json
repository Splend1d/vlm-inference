For n = 6, the number of permutations is 6! = 720. However, since we are looking for the maximum possible order, we need to consider the number of permutations that can be formed with the given elements. The maximum possible order is achieved when the number of elements is a multiple of 3, because the number of permutations of n elements is given by n!/(n/3)! = n!*(3^n). For n = 6, this gives us 720/(6/3)! = 720/2 = 360. However, this is not the maximum possible order, because we can also form permutations of 6 elements by using the elements in any order. The maximum possible order is achieved when the number of elements is a multiple of 3, because the number of permutations of n elements is given by n!/(n/3)! = n!*(3^n).
