And this power has its original only from compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community. \u2026\nWhensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.\nJohn Locke, Second Treatise of Government, 1690\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Locke argued that society and its legitimate government held power over the members of society by virtue of\n\nA. divine right\nB. the consent of those members of society\nC. a covenant between the members of society\nD. conquest\n"
