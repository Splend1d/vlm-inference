The other options (geographic isolation, behavioral isolation, and different courtship rituals) can prevent interspecific breeding by preventing individuals from coming into contact and engaging in mating behavior. However, similar breeding seasons do not necessarily prevent interspecific breeding as long as the species can still engage in mating behavior and come into contact with each other."
