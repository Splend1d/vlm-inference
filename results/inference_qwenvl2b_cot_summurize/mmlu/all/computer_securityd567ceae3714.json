Blinding prevents the server from using the CRT optimization, which is essential to the timing attack.\nB. Blinding changes the p and q primes that are used, so an adversary cannot learn the server\u2019s true p and q values.\nC. Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary\u2019s input and the timing differences.\nD. Blinding adds a random amount of time to the decryption due to the multiplication and division by the blinding random value r, which obscures the timing differences used in the attack.\n"

Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary's input and the timing differences.\n\nBlinding involves multiplying the plaintext by a random value, which randomizes the ciphertext. This randomization obscures the correlation between the adversary's input and the timing differences used in the timing attack. This makes it difficult for an adversary to use the CRT optimization, which is essential to the timing attack."
