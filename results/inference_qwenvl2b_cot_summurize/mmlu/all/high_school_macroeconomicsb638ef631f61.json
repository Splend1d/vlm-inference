As the labor force shrinks, the number of workers available to produce goods and services decreases, which can lead to lower productivity. At the same time, the aging population can also lead to a decrease in the overall size of the labor force, which can further reduce productivity. On the other hand, the aging population can also lead to an increase in the number of retirees, which can provide a pool of potential workers for the labor market. This can potentially offset some of the negative effects of the shrinking labor force on productivity. However, the overall impact on economic growth will depend on the extent to which the aging population can be managed and the extent to which the labor force can be expanded through immigration or other means."
