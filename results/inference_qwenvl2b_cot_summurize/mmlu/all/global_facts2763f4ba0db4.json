However, we need to know the average years spent in school by women of the same age group to make this calculation.\n\nLet's denote the average years spent in school by women as \\( x \\).\n\nThe equation to represent the average years spent in school by women of the same age group would be:\n\\[ \\frac{10}{30} = \\frac{x}{30} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{10}{30} \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{10 \\times 30}{30} \\]\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, women of the same age have spent 10 years in school as of 2020.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 9 years"
