U \u2283 W\n2. W \u2283 (X \u2261 ~Y)\n3. (X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z\n4. ~Z\n\nWe need to find a proposition that follows directly from these premises.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. U \u2283 Z\n- This is not necessarily true. The premises do not provide any information about the relationship between U and Z.\n\nB. U \u2228 W\n- This is not necessarily true. The premises do not provide any information about the relationship between U and W.\n\nC. ~W\n- This is not necessarily true. The premises do not provide any information about the relationship between W and ~W.\n\nD. ~(X \u2261 ~Y)\n- This is not necessarily true. The premises do not provide any information about the relationship between X and Y.\n\nNow, let's analyze the third premise:\n(X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z\n\nThis premise states that if X is equivalent to ~Y, then Z is true. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (X \u2261 ~Y) is true, then the consequent (Z) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the fourth premise:\n~Z\n\nThis is not necessarily true. The premises do not provide any information about the relationship between Z and ~Z.\n\nGiven the analysis, the only proposition that logically follows from the given premises is:\n(X \u2261 ~Y) \u2283 Z\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. ~(X \u2261 ~Y)"
