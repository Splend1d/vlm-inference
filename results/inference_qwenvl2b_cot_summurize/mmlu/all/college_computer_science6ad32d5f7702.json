The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) in the worst case, which occurs when the input list is already sorted.\n\nNow, let's analyze each data structure:\n\nI. **A singly linked list**: Mergesort can be implemented using a singly linked list. However, the time complexity of merging two sorted lists in a singly linked list is O(n), not O(n log n). Therefore, this data structure does not allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time.\n\nII. **A doubly linked list**: Mergesort can also be implemented using a doubly linked list. The time complexity of merging two sorted lists in a doubly linked list is O(n), not O(n log n). Therefore, this data structure does not allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time.\n\nIII. **An array**: Mergesort can be implemented using an array. The time complexity of merging two sorted arrays in an array is O(n), not O(n log n). Therefore, this data structure does not allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. None"
