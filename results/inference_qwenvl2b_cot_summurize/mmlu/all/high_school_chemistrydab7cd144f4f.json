C(s) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g)\n\nThis is because the reaction involves the formation of a gas (CO2) from a solid (C) and a gas (O2), which is a process that typically results in a decrease in entropy. The other reactions involve the formation of a liquid (H2O, CO2, SO3) or a solid (NaCl, CO2, SO2) from a gas, which generally results in an increase in entropy."
