In this case, the subset S is closed under addition modulo 10 because the sum of any two elements in S (e.g., 0 + 2, 0 + 4, etc.) will result in an element in S (e.g., 2, 4, etc.).\n\nB. **(S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.**\n   - A ring is closed under multiplication if the product of any two elements is also an element of the ring. In this case, the subset S is closed under multiplication modulo 10 because the product of any two elements in S (e.g., 0 * 2, 0 * 4, etc.) will result in an element in S (e.g., 0, 0, etc.).\n\nC. **(S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10.**\n   - An identity under addition modulo 10 is an element that, when added to any element in S, leaves that element unchanged. In this case, the identity under addition modulo 10 is 0, because adding 0 to any element in S (e.g., 0 + 2, 0 + 4, etc.) will result in the same element in S (e.g., 2, 4, etc.).\n\nD. **(S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.**\n   - A ring has an identity under multiplication if there exists an element that, when multiplied by any element in the ring, leaves that element unchanged. In this case, the identity under multiplication modulo 10 is 1, because multiplying any element in S (e.g., 0 * 2, 0 * 4, etc.) by 1 will result in the same element in S (e.g., 0, 0, etc.).\n\nTherefore, the statement that is FALSE is:\n\n**D. (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.**"
