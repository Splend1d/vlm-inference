R is commutative.**\n   - If \\(R\\) is commutative, then for all \\(a, b \\in R\\), \\(ab = ba\\). Given that \\(ur \\in U\\) for all \\(u \\in U\\) and \\(r \\in R\\), we can write \\(ur = ur\\). This implies that \\(r\\) is in the right ideal \\(U\\), which is a property of commutative rings. Therefore, \\(R\\) must be commutative.\n\n2. **II. R is a division ring (that is, all elements except the additive identity have multiplicative inverses).**\n   - A division ring is a ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Given that \\(U\\) is a right ideal of \\(R\\) and \\(ur \\in U\\) for all \\(u \\in U\\) and \\(r \\in R\\), it follows that \\(r\\) is in \\(U\\). This means that \\(r\\) has a multiplicative inverse in \\(R\\), which is a property of division rings. Therefore, \\(R\\) must be a division ring.\n\n3. **III. R is infinite.**\n   - If \\(R\\) is infinite, then there exists an infinite number of elements in \\(R\\). However, the given conditions do not provide enough information to conclude that \\(R\\) must be infinite. The conditions given only imply that \\(U\\) is a right ideal of \\(R\\), but they do not provide any information about the size of \\(R\\).\n\nGiven the analysis, the statements that must be true are:\n\n- I. R is commutative.\n- II. R is a division ring.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I and II only"
