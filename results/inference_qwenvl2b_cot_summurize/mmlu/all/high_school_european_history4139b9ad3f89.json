Already at the Council of Ferrera (1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western churches, there was a debate in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of Plato to Aristotle. Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were both addicted to Plato; Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Florentine Academy, which was largely devoted to the study of Plato&\u2026The humanists of the time, however, were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to be able to produce anything of value.\"\nBertrand Russell, British philosopher, History of Western Philosophy, 1946\nIn what way does this passage best exemplify the view of twentieth-century philosophers and thinkers?\n\nA. Faced with an unprecedented number of social and technological changes, the twentieth century embraced innovation as one of the most valued characteristics of life.\nB.

This is evident from the quote that states, \"The humanists of the time, however, were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to be able to produce anything of value.\" This suggests that the humanists of the time were focused on acquiring knowledge of antiquity, which was a way of seeking refuge from the overwhelming changes of the time.
