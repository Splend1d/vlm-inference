(-1.98,1.98)\n\nThis is because the 95% confidence interval for the intercept term of a linear regression model is typically centered around the mean of the intercept, which is the value of the intercept term. In this case, the mean intercept is 0. Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the intercept term would be centered around 0, which is represented by the interval (-1.98, 1.98)."
