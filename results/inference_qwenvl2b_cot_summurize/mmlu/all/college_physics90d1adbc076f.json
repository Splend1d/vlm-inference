The dielectric constant is a measure of the ability of the material to store electrical energy. \n\nFor a non-magnetic dielectric material with a dielectric constant of 4.0, the speed of light inside the material is approximately 1.2 x 10^9 m/s. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1.2 x 10^9 m/s"
