Higher interest rates that decrease private investment.\n\nWhen interest rates increase, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) decreases, as it becomes more costly for individuals to spend their income. This reduces the overall impact of an expansionary fiscal policy, as it leads to a decrease in aggregate demand rather than an increase. Lower interest rates, on the other hand, increase the marginal propensity to consume, which can lead to an increase in aggregate demand. Higher interest rates, such as those caused by an increase in the federal funds rate, can also decrease private investment, which can further reduce aggregate demand."
