We can do this by checking the second partial derivatives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial y^2} = 3y\n\\]\n\nAt \\( x = 0 \\), the second partial derivative with respect to \\( x \\) is positive, indicating a relative minimum. At \\( y = 0 \\), the second partial derivative with respect to \\( y \\) is negative, indicating a relative maximum. Therefore, the relative minimum occurs at \\( (0, 0) \\).\n\nNow, let's check the other options:\n\nA. \\( f \\) has all of its relative extrema on the line \\( x = y \\). This is true because the relative minimum at \\( (0, 0) \\) and the relative maximum at \\( (0, 0) \\) are both on the line \\( x = y \\).\n\nB. \\( f \\) has all of its relative extrema on the parabola \\( x = y^2 \\). This is false because the relative minimum at \\( (0, 0) \\) is not on the parabola \\( x = y^2 \\).\n\nC. \\( f \\) has a relative minimum at \\( (0, 0) \\). This is true because the relative minimum at \\( (0, 0) \\) is indeed a relative minimum.\n\nD. \\( f \\) has an absolute minimum at \\( (2/3, 2/3) \\). This is false because the absolute minimum occurs at \\( (0, 0) \\), not at \\( (2/3, 2/3) \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( f \\) has a relative minimum at \\( (0, 0) \\)."
