None of the individual insects should have possessed genomes that made them resistant to DDT.\n\nDDT was once considered a \"silver bullet\" because it was effective against many insects, but its effectiveness has since declined due to the development of resistance in insects. To ensure the pest eradication effort was successful in the long run, it would have been necessary to prevent the development of resistance in the insects. This can be achieved by ensuring that the DDT is applied in a way that prevents the insects from developing resistance, such as by using DDT-resistant strains of the insects or by using other insecticides that are less likely to be resistant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
