Breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials.\n\nThe orbital resonance in Neptune and Pluto is caused by their mutual gravitational attraction, which leads to a 2:3 periodic ratio of their orbits. The Kirkwood Gaps are caused by the gravitational interactions between the planets and their moons, which create gaps in the orbit of the moons. Saturn's rings are formed by the gravitational interactions between the planet and its moons, which cause the moons to orbit in a way that creates gaps in the ring system. The breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials is also caused by gravitational interactions between the moons and the planet."
