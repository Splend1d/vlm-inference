                    "text": "The speed of sound in a pipe is inversely proportional to the square root of the temperature. Therefore, if the temperature is 3% lower, the speed of sound is 3% lower. \n\nLet's calculate the new speed of sound:\n\n\\[ \\text{New speed of sound} = \\text{Original speed of sound} \\times (1 - 0.03) = \\text{Original speed of sound} \\times 0.97 \\]\n\nGiven that the original speed of sound is 340 Hz (440 Hz at 20\u00b0C), we can calculate the new speed of sound:\n\n\\[ \\text{New speed of sound} = 340 \\times 0.97 = 333.8 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the frequency at which the pipe resonates at this new speed of sound. The resonant frequency \\( f \\) of a pipe is given by:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{2L} \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the speed of sound and \\( L \\) is the length of the pipe. We can rearrange this formula to solve for \\( f \\):\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{2L} \\]\n\nSubstituting the new speed of sound:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{333.8}{2 \\times 100} = \\frac{333.8}{200} = 1.669 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\n\\[ f \\approx 1.7 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nTherefore, the frequency at which the pipe resonates on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C is approximately 1.7 Hz. The closest answer to this value is:\n\nC. 433 Hz"
