Humans and chimpanzees evolved from a recent common ancestor\u2014about 6 million years ago.\n\nThis is because the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of humans and chimpanzees is estimated to be about 6 million years ago. This is supported by the fact that the DNA sequences in these genes are very similar, which suggests that they have been evolving together for a long time. Therefore, the most recent common ancestor is the most likely explanation for the similarity of the DNA sequences in these genes."
