HIV can change its surface proteins and resist vaccines.\nB. The patient must have become reinfected with 3TC-resistant viruses.\nC. HIV began making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug.\nD. A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n"

A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n\nWhen a patient is treated with a drug like 3TC, it can inhibit reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that synthesizes new RNA from the DNA template. This can lead to the development of drug-resistant viruses that are resistant to the drug. Over time, as the drug-resistant viruses are selected for by the drug, their frequency in the population increases. This is a common phenomenon in the evolution of drug-resistant viruses and is not specific to HIV. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
