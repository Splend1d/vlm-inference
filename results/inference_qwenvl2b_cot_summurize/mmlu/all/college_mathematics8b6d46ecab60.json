This implies that every open set in K has a finite number of connected components. Since a continuous function maps connected sets to connected sets, every continuous function defined on K must map each connected component of K to a connected component of its image. Therefore, every continuous function defined on K is bounded.\n\n2. **Statement II: If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.**\n   - **Proof:** If every continuous function defined on K is bounded, then the image of K under any continuous function is a compact set. Since K is a subset of R^n, it is compact by definition. Therefore, K is compact.\n\n3. **Statement III: If K is compact, then K is connected.**\n   - **Proof:** If K is compact, then every open cover of K has a finite subcover. This implies that K is connected because a connected set cannot be divided into two non-empty, disjoint open sets. Therefore, K is connected.\n\nGiven these proofs, we can conclude that all three statements must be true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. I and II only"
