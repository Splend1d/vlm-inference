The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nWhen consumers expect the price of corn to be lower in the near future, this expectation will lead to a decrease in the demand for corn. As a result, the equilibrium price of corn will fall. However, the demand for seed corn and fertilizer will also decrease, leading to a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of these goods. Since the decrease in the equilibrium quantity of corn is greater than the decrease in the equilibrium quantity of seed corn and fertilizer, the equilibrium quantity will be indeterminate."
