Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\n   - This statement suggests that the development of a vertebrate organism is a reflection of its evolutionary history. While this is true, it does not directly address the specific developmental stages or features of the organism.\n\nB. Early embryos display identical features of their class, order, and species.\n   - This statement is too broad and does not specify the features that are being compared. It does not provide a clear indication of the developmental stages or features of the organism.\n\nC. An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos.\n   - This statement is more specific and indicates that the early human embryo shares developmental features with earlier stages of fish and avian embryos. This is a reasonable conclusion based on the embryological development of vertebrates.\n\nD. A human embryo displays features of adult fish and birds in the course of its development.\n   - This statement is too broad and does not specify the developmental stages or features of the organism. It does not provide a clear indication of the developmental stages or features of the organism.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most justified conclusion is:\n\nC. An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
