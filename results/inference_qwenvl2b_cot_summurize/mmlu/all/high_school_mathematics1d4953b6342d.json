So, there are 4 choices for the numerator.\n\nThe denominator can be any of the four numbers $2, 3, 4,$ or $6$. So, there are 4 choices for the denominator.\n\nSince the numerator and denominator can be chosen independently, we multiply the number of choices for each to get the total number of unique fractions.\n\nSo, the total number of unique fractions is $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the number of unique fractions. For example, the fraction $\\frac{3}{3}$ is the same as the fraction $\\frac{6}{6}$, and the fraction $\\frac{4}{4}$ is the same as the fraction $\\frac{6}{6}$.\n\nTo correct for this overcounting, we need to divide the total number of unique fractions by 2.\n\nSo, the number of unique fractions is $\\frac{16}{2} = 8$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
