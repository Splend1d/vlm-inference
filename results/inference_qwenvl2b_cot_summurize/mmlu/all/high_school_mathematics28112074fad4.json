Two of these computers do not work.\n3. Every student must use a computer.\n and each computer can only accommodate 2 students at most.\n\nFirst, let's subtract the two non-working computers from the total number of computers:\n\n20 - 2 = 18 computers available for use.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many students can use these computers. Since each computer can accommodate 2 students at most, we divide the number of available computers by 2:\n\n18 / 2 = 9 students can use a computer.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider that there are 14 students in Mr. Cleary's class and 12 students in Ms. Ntuala's class. Since each student must use a computer, we need to subtract the total number of students from the number of available computers:\n\n14 + 12 = 26 students in total.\n\nNow, we subtract the total number of students from the number of available computers:\n\n26 - 26 = 0 students can have a computer to themselves.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves is:\n\nA. 2"
