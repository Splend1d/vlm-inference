The statement \\(|G + H| = |G||H|\\) is a consequence of the fact that the direct sum of two groups is the set of all possible sums of elements from \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), and the cardinality of the direct sum is the product of the cardinalities of \\(G\\) and \\(H\\). However, this does not necessarily hold for all finite groups \\(G\\) and \\(H\\). For example, consider the direct product of two cyclic groups of prime order. The direct product of two cyclic groups of prime order is not isomorphic to the direct sum of the two groups, which is a counterexample to the statement.\n\nStatement 2: If \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\), then \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) has a subgroup isomorphic to \\(Z_r + Z_s\\).\n\nThis statement is true. The statement \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) has a subgroup isomorphic to \\(Z_r + Z_s\\) is a consequence of Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the group. Since \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\), the order of \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) is a divisor of the product of the orders of \\(Z_m\\) and \\(Z_n\\), which is \\(mn\\). Therefore, the order of \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) is a divisor of \\(mn\\), and since \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) are relatively prime (i.e., \\(r\\) and \\(s\\) have no common factors other than 1), the order of \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) is a divisor of \\(mn\\) and is thus isomorphic to \\(Z_r + Z_s\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
