According to this principle, no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers (spin, orbital angular momentum, total angular momentum, and magnetic quantum number). This means that the electron spins in an ortho- state must be antiparallel, while the electron spins in a para- state must be parallel. The Pauli exclusion principle also states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers, so the ortho- state must have lower energy than the para- state. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
