A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is either 0 or 11.\n\nGiven the expression \\(3x + 7y\\), let's examine the divisibility rule for 11:\n\n1. If \\(3x + 7y\\) is divisible by 11, then the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions (1st and 3rd) and the sum of the digits in the even positions (2nd and 4th) must be 0 or 11.\n\n2. Let's examine each option:\n\nA. \\(4x + 6y\\)\n   - The sum of the digits in the odd positions (1st and 3rd) is \\(4 + 6 = 10\\).\n   - The sum of the digits in the even positions (2nd and 4th) is \\(x + y\\).\n   - The difference between these sums is \\(10 - (x + y) = 10 - x - y\\).\n   - For this to be divisible by 11, \\(10 - x - y\\) must be either 0 or 11.\n\n   - If \\(10 - x - y = 0\\), then \\(x + y = 10\\), which is not necessarily true for all positive integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n   - If \\(10 - x - y = 11\\), then \\(x + y = -1\\), which is not possible since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers.\n\n   Therefore, \\(4x + 6y\\) is not divisible by 11.\n\nB. \\(x + y + 5\\)\n   - The sum of the digits in the odd positions (1st and 3rd) is \\(x + y\\).\n   - The sum of the digits in the even positions (2nd and 4th) is \\(5\\).\n   - The difference between these sums is \\(x + y - 5\\).\n   - For this to be divisible by 11, \\(x + y - 5\\) must be either 0 or 11.\n\n   - If \\(x + y - 5 = 0\\), then \\(x + y = 5\\), which is not necessarily true for all positive integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n   - If \\(x + y - 5 = 11\\), then \\(x + y = 16\\), which is not possible since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers.\n\n   Therefore, \\(x + y + 5\\) is not divisible by 11.\n\nC. \\(9x + 4y\\)\n   - The sum of the digits in the odd positions (1st and 3rd) is \\(9 + 4 = 13\\).\n   - The sum of the digits in the even positions (2nd and 4th) is \\(x + y\\).\n   - The difference between these sums is \\(13 - (x + y) = 13 - x - y\\).\n   - For this to be divisible by 11, \\(13 - x - y\\) must be either 0 or 11.\n\n   - If \\(13 - x - y = 0\\), then \\(x + y = 13\\), which is not necessarily true for all positive integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n   - If \\(13 - x - y = 11\\), then \\(x + y = -2\\), which is not possible since \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers.\n\n   Therefore, \\(9x + 4y\\) is not divisible by 11.\n\nD. \\(4x - 9y\\)\n   - The sum of the digits in the odd positions (1st and 3rd) is \\(4 + (-9) = -5\\).\n   - The sum of the digits in the even positions (2nd and 4th) is \\(x + y\\).\n   - The difference between these sums is \\(-5 - (x + y) = -5 - x - y\\).\n   - For this to be divisible by 11, \\(-5 - x - y\\) must be either 0 or 11.\n\n   - If \\(-5 - x - y = 0\\), then \\(x + y = -5\\), which is not necessarily true for all positive integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n   - If \\(-5 - x - y = 11\\), then \\(x + y"
