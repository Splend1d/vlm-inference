A subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group is not necessarily free abelian. For example, consider the subgroup \\(K = \\langle a, b \\rangle\\) of the free abelian group \\(F_2^2\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are generators. This subgroup is not free abelian because it is not generated by a single element.\n\nStatement 2: If \\(K\\) is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then \\(G / K\\) is free abelian.\n\nThis statement is true. The quotient group \\(G / K\\) is indeed free abelian. This is because the quotient group is generated by the cosets of \\(K\\) in \\(G\\), and since \\(G\\) is free abelian, each coset is free abelian."
