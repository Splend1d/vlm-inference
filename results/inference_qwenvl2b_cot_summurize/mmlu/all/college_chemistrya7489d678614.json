The higher the E\u00b0, the more easily the element will gain or lose electrons.\n\nA. Al(s) + 3 NaNO3(aq) 3 Na(s) + Al(NO3)3(aq) - This reaction is not likely to occur because the oxidation-reduction potential of Al is higher than that of NaNO3. Therefore, Al will gain electrons from NaNO3, and the reaction will not proceed.\n\nB. Zn(s) + 2 Ag(NO3)(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq) - This reaction is likely to occur because the oxidation-reduction potential of Zn is higher than that of Ag. Therefore, Zn will lose electrons to Ag, and the reaction will proceed.\n\nC. Pb(s) + Ca(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 Ca(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) - This reaction is not likely to occur because the oxidation-reduction potential of Pb is higher than that of Ca(NO3)2. Therefore, Pb will gain electrons from Ca(NO3)2, and the reaction will not proceed.\n\nD. Pb(s) + 2 LiNO3(aq) \u2192 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) - This reaction is not likely to occur because the oxidation-reduction potential of Pb is higher than that of Li(NO3)2. Therefore, Pb will lose electrons to Li(NO3)2, and the reaction will not proceed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
