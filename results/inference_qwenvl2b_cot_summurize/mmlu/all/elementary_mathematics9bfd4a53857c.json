This expression multiplies the number of boxes (3) by the number of packages in each box (4), and then by the number of shirts in each package (7). \n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The store has 3 boxes.\n2. Each box has 4 packages.\n3. Each package has 7 shirts.\n\nSo, the total number of shirts is:\n\\[ 3 \\times (4 \\times 7) \\]\n\nThis expression can also be used to find the total number of shirts because it directly multiplies the number of boxes (3), the number of packages in each box (4), and the number of shirts in each package (7), resulting in the total number of shirts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 28 \u00d7 7"
