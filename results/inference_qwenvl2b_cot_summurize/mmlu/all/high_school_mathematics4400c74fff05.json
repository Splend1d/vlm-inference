                    "text": " The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (often denoted as $x$) for which the function is defined. For the function $h(x) = \\sqrt{25-x^2}+\\sqrt{-(x-2)}$, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the square roots are defined.\n\nThe square root of a number is defined if and only if the number is non-negative. So, we need to solve the inequalities $25-x^2 \\ge 0$ and $-(x-2) \\ge 0$.\n\nFor the first inequality, $25-x^2 \\ge 0$, we can rewrite it as $x^2 \\le 25$, or $-5 \\le x \\le 5$. So, the domain of $h(x)$ is the interval $[-5, 5]$.\n\nFor the second inequality, $-(x-2) \\ge 0$, we can rewrite it as $x \\le 2$. So, the domain of $h(x)$ is the interval $(-\\infty, 2]$.\n\nThe width of an interval is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the interval. In this case, the width of the domain of $h(x)$ is $5 - (-\\infty) = \\infty$.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the width of the domain in a specific interval. The interval $[-5, 5]$ has a width of $5 - (-5) = 10$. But this is not an option, so we must have made a mistake in our calculations.\n\nLet's retrace our steps and check our work.\n\nFor the first inequality, $25-x^2 \\ge 0$, we can rewrite it as $x^2 \\le 25$, or $-5 \\le x \\le 5$.
