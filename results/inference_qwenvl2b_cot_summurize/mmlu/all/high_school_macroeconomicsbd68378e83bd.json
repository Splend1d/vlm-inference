In this case, the MPC is 0.8, meaning that 80% of the additional income is spent on consumption.\n\nTo find the largest total increase in GDP that can result from $500 of new spending, we can use the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Increase in GDP} = \\text{New Spending} \\times \\text{MPC} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Increase in GDP} = 500 \\times 0.8 = 400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the largest total increase in GDP that can result from $500 of new spending is $400.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. $400"
