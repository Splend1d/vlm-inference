The factor group of a non-Abelian group is indeed non-Abelian, but it is not necessarily non-Abelian. The factor group of a non-Abelian group is Abelian if and only if the original group is Abelian.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\nThis statement is true. If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is indeed a normal subgroup of G. This is a consequence of the definition of normal subgroups and the properties of normal subgroups in group theory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
