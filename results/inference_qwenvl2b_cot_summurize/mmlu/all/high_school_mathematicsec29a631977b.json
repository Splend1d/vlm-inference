This is a combination problem, and the formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \\(n!\\) denotes the factorial of \\(n\\), which is the product of all positive integers up to \\(n\\).\n\nFor a 52-card deck, \\(n = 52\\) and \\(k = 3\\), so the total number of ways to draw 3 cards is:\n\n\\[C(52, 3) = \\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!} = \\frac{52!}{3!49!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 22100\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of ways to draw a pair. A pair consists of two cards of the same rank, and the third card can be any of the remaining 41 cards (since there are 4 suits and 10 ranks, and we're choosing 3 cards, leaving 41 cards for the third card).\n\nThe number of ways to draw a pair is:\n\n\\[C(41, 2) = \\frac{41!}{2!(41-2)!} = \\frac{41!}{2!40!} = \\frac{41 \\times 40}{2} = 820\\]\n\nFinally, the probability of drawing a pair is the number of ways to draw a pair divided by the total number of ways to draw 3 cards:\n\n\\[P(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{820}{22100} = \\frac{41}{1105}\\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction, we get:\n\n\\[P(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{41}{1105} = \\frac{1}{27.5}\\]\n\nThis fraction can be simplified further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 5:\n\n\\[P(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{1}{55}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\(\\frac{1}{78}\\)"
