The total number of points if a player made 7 shots and each shot was worth 2 points.\n   - This is not possible because the expression 7 x 2 does not represent the total number of points. It represents the total number of shots made multiplied by the value of each shot.\n\nB. The total number of basketballs if 7 basketballs were old and 2 basketballs were new.\n   - This is not possible because the expression 7 x 2 does not represent the total number of basketballs. It represents the total number of shots made multiplied by the value of each shot.\n\nC. The total number of points if one player had 7 points and a different player had 2 points.\n   - This is not possible because the expression 7 x 2 does not represent the total number of points. It represents the total number of shots made multiplied by the value of each shot.\n\nD. The total number of basketballs used if there were 7 basketballs and 2 of the basketballs were not used.\n   - This is possible because the expression 7 x 2 represents the total number of shots made multiplied by the value of each shot. If 2 of the basketballs were not used, then the total number of basketballs used would be 7 - 2 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
