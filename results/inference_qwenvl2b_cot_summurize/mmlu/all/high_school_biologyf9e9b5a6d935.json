Here's a breakdown of each option:\n\nA. **Mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently of the eukaryotic host cell by a process similar to binary fission.**\n   - This option supports the theory because it indicates that mitochondria and chloroplasts have the ability to divide independently, which is a characteristic of prokaryotes.\n\nB. **Mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes that more closely resemble those of bacteria than of eukaryotic cells.**\n   - This option supports the theory because it shows that mitochondria and chloroplasts have ribosomes that are similar to those of bacteria, which are typically found in prokaryotes.\n\nC. **Mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the eukaryotic host cell.**\n   - This option supports the theory because it indicates that mitochondria and chloroplasts operate independently of the eukaryotic host cell, which is a characteristic of prokaryotes.\n\nD. **Mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria have a single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins.**\n   - This option does not support the endosymbiotic theory. It states that mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria have a single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins, which are characteristics of eukaryotic cells. This suggests that these organelles are not derived from prokaryotes but rather are derived from eukaryotic cells through endosymbiosis.\n\nTherefore, the option that does not support the endosymbiotic theory is:\n\n**D. Mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria have a single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins.**"
