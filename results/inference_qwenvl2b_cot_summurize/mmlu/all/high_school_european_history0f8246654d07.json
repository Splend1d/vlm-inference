What shall I say of it now, when the words are put into my mouth, my hope of its destruction\u2014what shall I say of its supplanting by Socialism?\nWhat shall I say concerning its mastery of and its waste of mechanical power, its commonwealth so poor, its enemies of the commonwealth so rich, its stupendous organization\u2014for the misery of life! Its contempt of simple pleasures which everyone could enjoy but for its folly? Its eyeless vulgarity which has destroyed art, the one certain solace of labor? All this I felt then as now, but I did not know why it was so. The hope of the past times was gone, the struggles of mankind for many ages had produced nothing but this sordid, aimless, ugly confusion; the immediate future seemed to me likely to intensify all the present evils by sweeping away the last survivals of the days before the dull squalor of civilization had settled down on the world.\nThis was a bad lookout indeed, and, if I may mention myself as a personality and not as a mere type, especially so to a man of my disposition, careless of metaphysics and religion, as well as of scientific analysis, but with a deep love of the earth and the life on it, and a passion for the history of the past of mankind.\nWilliam Morris, How I Became a Socialist, 1896\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Morris\n\nA. chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society\nB. chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments\nC. rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion\nD. rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it\n"

He then discusses his hope for the destruction of modern civilization and the eventual replacement by socialism. Morris mentions the waste of resources, the poverty of the commonwealth, and the contempt for simple pleasures, all of which he finds ugly and aimless.\n\n3. **Analyze each option**:\n   - **Option A**: \"chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society.\"\n     - This option suggests that Morris was appalled by the waste and misery of modern society. However, the passage does not explicitly state that Morris was appalled by the waste and misery of modern society. It only mentions that he felt this way and did not know why.\n   - **Option B**: \"chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments.\"\n     - The passage does not provide any information about the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments. It only mentions Morris's hope for the destruction of modern civilization and the eventual replacement by socialism.\n   - **Option C**: \"rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion.\"\n     - The passage does not explicitly state that Morris rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion. It only mentions that he felt the present evils would intensify all the present evils by sweeping away the last survivals of the days before the dull squalor of civilization had settled down on the world.\n   - **Option D**: \"rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it.\"\n     - The passage does not explicitly state that Morris rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it. It only mentions Morris's deep love of the earth and the life on it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The passage does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that Morris chose to become a socialist because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it. Therefore, the most reasonable inference is that Morris chose to become a socialist because he felt the present evils would intensify all the present evils by sweeping away the last survivals of the days before the dull squalor of civilization had settled down on the world.\n\n**Final answer**: D. rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it."
