Since the plane is traveling due north at a constant speed of 100 m/s, the velocity of the payload relative to the plane is 100 m/s north. The velocity of the payload itself is the same as the velocity of the plane, which is 100 m/s north. Therefore, the velocity of the payload relative to the plane is 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down. The correct answer is D."
