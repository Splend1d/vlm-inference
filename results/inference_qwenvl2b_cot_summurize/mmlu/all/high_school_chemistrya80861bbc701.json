                    "text": "The correct answer is D. This is a spontaneous process because it is exothermic.\n\nWhen potassium perchlorate (KClO4) dissolves in water, it releases heat energy, which is an exothermic process. This means that the reaction releases energy, which is a characteristic of spontaneous processes. The entropy of a system can increase or decrease depending on the nature of the process, but in this case, the exothermic nature of the reaction results in an increase in entropy. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that the process is spontaneous because it is exothermic."
