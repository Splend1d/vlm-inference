Capacity for long-distance dispersal\n\nA species with a capacity for long-distance dispersal is more likely to become cosmopolitan in distribution because it can spread its genes across large areas, allowing it to adapt to new environments and species. This ability to disperse over long distances is a key factor in the spread of many species across different regions."
