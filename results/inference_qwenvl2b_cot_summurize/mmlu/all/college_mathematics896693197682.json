The product of two functions in this ring is defined as the composition of the functions. \n\nFor the product of two nonzero elements to be zero, one of the functions must be the zero function. This is because the product of two functions is zero if and only if one of the functions is the zero function. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
