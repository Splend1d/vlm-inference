It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nMarx and Engels would be most inclined to view which of the following developments as a significant event in European history?\n\nA. The War of the Roses\nB. The French Revolution of 1789 to 1793\nC. The Seven Years' War\nD. Britain's Glorious Revolution of 1688\n"

The Manifesto argues that the modern bourgeoisie society has simplified class antagonisms and has split society into two great hostile camps, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.\n\nGiven this context, the development that would be most aligned with the ideas presented in the Communist Manifesto is the French Revolution of 1789 to 1793. This period saw the rise of the bourgeoisie and the fall of the feudal aristocracy, leading to the establishment of a new class structure and the beginning of the modern capitalist system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The French Revolution of 1789 to 1793"
