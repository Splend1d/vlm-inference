This can increase the cost of borrowing, making it more expensive for them to pay off their loans. Therefore, borrowers at fixed interest rates are likely to be hurt by inflation.\n\n2. **Individuals on fixed incomes**: Inflation can lead to a decrease in purchasing power for individuals who have fixed incomes. This means that their purchasing power decreases, making it harder for them to buy goods and services. Therefore, individuals on fixed incomes are likely to be hurt by inflation.\n\n3. **Those with savings earning fixed interest rates**: Inflation can lead to a decrease in the value of savings. If the inflation rate is high, the value of savings will decrease, making it less attractive to save. Therefore, those with savings earning fixed interest rates are likely to be hurt by inflation.\n\n4. **Restaurant owners**: Inflation can lead to higher costs for restaurant owners, including wages, materials, and energy. This can increase the cost of running a restaurant, making it more difficult for them to maintain their prices and profitability. Therefore, restaurant owners are likely to be hurt by inflation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the groups that are hurt by inflation are:\n\n- Borrowers at fixed interest rates\n- Individuals on fixed incomes\n- Those with savings earning fixed interest rates\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. I and II only"
