For any two distinct column vectors \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) of \\(M\\), the set \\(\\{u, v\\}\\) is linearly independent.\n- This condition ensures that the columns of \\(M\\) are linearly independent. If this condition holds, then the columns of \\(M\\) are independent, and the matrix is invertible. Therefore, this condition is equivalent to the other four conditions.\n\nB. The homogeneous system \\(Mx = 0\\) has only the trivial solution.\n- This condition states that the only solution to the homogeneous system is the trivial solution, which is the zero vector. This implies that the matrix \\(M\\) is invertible. Therefore, this condition is equivalent to the other four conditions.\n\nC. The system of equations \\(Mx = b\\) has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector \\(b\\).\n- This condition states that the system has a unique solution for each vector \\(b\\). This implies that the matrix \\(M\\) is invertible. Therefore, this condition is equivalent to the other four conditions.\n\nD. The determinant of \\(M\\) is nonzero.\n- This condition states that the determinant of \\(M\\) is nonzero. This implies that the matrix \\(M\\) is invertible. Therefore, this condition is equivalent to the other four conditions.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that all the conditions are equivalent to each other. Therefore, none of the conditions is equivalent to NONE of the other four.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nNone of the other four."
