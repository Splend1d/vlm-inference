Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is an upper motor neurone lesion secondary to a Herpes Zoster infection\n\nRamsay Hunt Syndrome is a rare condition that occurs when a virus called Varicella-Zoster (Chickenpox) infects the facial nerve. This infection causes the nerve to become inflamed and painful, leading to facial paralysis. The symptoms typically start with a rash on the face, followed by a tingling sensation in the face and then the inability to close the eyelids on the affected side. The sense of taste may also be affected, but it is not always affected."
