The first scientist contends that organisms evolved via the increase of organs that were used the most during their time. They would then pass these on to subsequent generations. The second scientist, however, believed that advantages each organism possessed were absent for a long time, randomly occurred, and when they were beneficial, that organism would rapidly populate the population over a short period of time, evolutionarily speaking. Which of the following statements would strengthen the second scientist\u2019s argument?\n\nA. A study that shows that bodybuilders who train more have larger children.\nB. A taxonomy study that shows long periods of stagnant growth followed by short burst of massive evolution.\nC. A study that showed a species who were more successful due to the things they learned over their lifetime that they passed on to their children.\nD. A study that showed a consistent amount of time between the emergence of each new species.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which statement would strengthen the second scientist's argument, we need to analyze the core of their argument. The second scientist argues that advantages are not present for a long time and are only beneficial when they are present. This implies that the advantage must be rare and beneficial, which is a key point in their argument.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **A study that shows that bodybuilders who train more have larger children.**\n   - This study suggests that training more leads to larger children, but it does not directly address the rarity and beneficial nature of the advantage. It only shows a correlation between training and offspring size.\n\nB. **A taxonomy study that shows long periods of stagnant growth followed by short burst of massive evolution.**\n   - This study shows that organisms have periods of stability followed by rapid evolution. This does not directly address the rarity and beneficial nature of the advantage.\n\nC. **A study that showed a species who were more successful due to the things they learned over their lifetime that they passed on to their children.**\n   - This study suggests that successful individuals pass on their learned traits to their offspring, which implies that these traits are beneficial and rare. This directly supports the second scientist's argument by showing that the advantage is rare and beneficial.\n\nD. **A study that showed a consistent amount of time between the emergence of each new species.**\n   - This study does not provide information about the rarity and beneficial nature of the advantage. It only shows that new species emerge at a consistent rate.\n\nGiven the analysis, the statement that would strengthen the second scientist's argument is:\n\n**C. A study that showed a species who were more successful due to the things they learned over their lifetime that they passed on to their children.**\n\nThis study directly supports the idea that the advantage is rare and beneficial, aligning with the second scientist's argument."
