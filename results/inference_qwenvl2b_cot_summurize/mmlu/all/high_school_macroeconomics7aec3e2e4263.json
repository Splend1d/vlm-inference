The United States begins to import rice to eliminate a domestic surplus.\n\nWhen free trade occurs, the world price of rice falls below the domestic price in the United States. This means that the domestic producers of rice are no longer able to sell their product at a price that covers their costs. As a result, domestic producers will have a surplus of rice, meaning they will have more rice than they can sell at the current price.\n\nTo eliminate this surplus, the United States will need to import rice. This will allow the domestic producers to sell their surplus rice at a price that covers their costs and still make a profit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
