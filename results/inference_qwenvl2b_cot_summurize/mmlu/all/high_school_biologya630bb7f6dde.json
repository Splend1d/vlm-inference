                    "text": "The phenomenon described in the question is an example of polygenic inheritance, where multiple genes contribute to the expression of a trait. In this case, the color of the hydrangea flowers is influenced by multiple genes, each with its own specific effect on the flower color. This is different from the other options:\n\nA. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.\n   - This option suggests that the alleles for flower color are incompletely dominant, meaning that the expression of one allele can mask the expression of the other. However, this does not explain the phenomenon of varying flower colors due to soil type.\n\nB. The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.\n   - This option suggests that the alleles for flower color are codominant, meaning that both traits are expressed equally in the environment. However, this does not explain the phenomenon of varying flower colors due to soil type.\n\nC. In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\n   - This option suggests that the environment influences the expression of the trait, which is not the case here. The flowers' color is determined by the genes, not by the environment.\n\nD. The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.\n   - This option correctly identifies that the genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance, meaning that multiple genes contribute to the expression of the trait. This is the correct explanation for the phenomenon of varying flower colors due to soil type.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for the phenomenon in the question is:\n\nD. The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance."
