This point is the intersection of the plane and the line passing through the origin and the point on the plane that is closest to the origin.\n\nThe line passing through the origin and the point on the plane that is closest to the origin is given by the equation $x = \\frac{3}{7}$, $y = \\frac{3}{14}$, and $z = \\frac{9}{14}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation of the plane, we get $2\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right) + \\frac{3}{14} + 3\\left(\\frac{9}{14}\\right) = \\frac{6}{7} + \\frac{3}{14} + \\frac{27}{14} = \\frac{42}{198} + \\frac{21}{198} + \\frac{678}{198} = \\frac{747}{198} = \\frac{373}{99}$.\n\nSo, the point on the plane that is closest to the origin is $\\left(\\frac{3}{7}, \\frac{3}{14}, \\frac{9}{14}\\right)$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{B}}$."
