                    "text": "To express $0.1\\overline{7}$ as a common fraction, we can use the concept of repeating decimals and the method of partial fractions.\n\nLet's denote $x = 0.1\\overline{7}$. This means that $x$ is a repeating decimal with a repeating block of 7s. We can write:\n\n\\[x = 0.1\\overline{7} = 0.177777... = 0.1 + 0.077777...\\]\n\nTo separate the repeating part from the non-repeating part, we can multiply $x$ by a power of 10 that aligns with the repeating block. In this case, we multiply by 100 (since there are two digits in the repeating block):\n\n\\[100x = 100 \\cdot 0.1\\overline{7} = 100 \\cdot 0.177777...\\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[100x = 17.7777...\\]\n\nNow, we can subtract the original $x$ from this equation to eliminate the repeating part:\n\n\\[100x - x = 17.7777... - 0.1\\overline{7}\\]\n\n\\[99x = 17\\]\n\n\\[x = \\frac{17}{99}\\]\n\nTherefore, $0.1\\overline{7}$ expressed as a common fraction is $\\frac{17}{99}$. The correct answer is:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{8}{45}\\)"
