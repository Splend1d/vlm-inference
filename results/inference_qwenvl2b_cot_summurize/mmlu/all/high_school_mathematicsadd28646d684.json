This means that the function $y=f(x)$ is symmetric about the line $x=20$.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest positive $a$ such that if we shift the graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$ $a$ units to the right, then we know that the resulting graph is identical to the original graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$.\n\nThis means that the function $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$ is symmetric about the line $x=20$.\n\nThe function $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$ is a transformation of the function $y=f(x)$, where $x$ is replaced by $\\frac{x}{5}$. This means that the function $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$ is symmetric about the line $x=20$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive $a$ such that if the graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$ is shifted $a$ units to the right, then we know that the resulting graph is identical to the original graph of $y=f\\left(\\frac x5\\right)$ is $20$.\n\nThe answer is: $D$"
