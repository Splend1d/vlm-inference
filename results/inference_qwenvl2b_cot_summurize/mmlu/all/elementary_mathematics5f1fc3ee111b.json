The least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 3 is 6.\n\nNow, we convert each width to have the common denominator of 6:\n\n- For the first strip: \\(5 \\div 6 = \\frac{5}{6}\\)\n- For the second strip: \\(2 \\div 3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\nNow, we add the two fractions:\n\n\\(\\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{9}{6}\\)\n\nSimplifying the fraction \\(\\frac{9}{6}\\) gives us \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), which is equivalent to \\(1 \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the combined width of the cardboard strips is \\(1 \\frac{1}{2}\\) feet, which is approximately \\(1.5\\) feet.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 1 and 1 over 2 ft."
