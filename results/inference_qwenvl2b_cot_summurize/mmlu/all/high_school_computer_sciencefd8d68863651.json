If `a` is not 0, `b` will be incremented by 20.\n\nTherefore, the only change that will not affect the results when the code segment is executed is changing line 3 to `b \u2190 10`. This will not change the value of `b` based on the value of `a`, but rather set `b` to 10 regardless of the value of `a`.\n\nThe other changes will affect the value of `b` based on the value of `a`. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
