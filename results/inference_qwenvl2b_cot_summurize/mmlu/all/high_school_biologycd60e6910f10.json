The bonds linking the monomers of starch differ in shape from the bonds linking the monomers of cellulose.\n\nStarch and cellulose are both composed of glucose monomers, but they differ in their structure and arrangement. Starch is a long-chain polymer of glucose molecules, while cellulose is a crystalline polymer of glucose molecules. The bonds between glucose monomers in starch are hydrogen bonds, while the bonds between glucose monomers in cellulose are covalent bonds. These differences in bond structure make it difficult for cells to digest starch, as the bonds linking the monomers are too strong to be broken by digestive enzymes."
