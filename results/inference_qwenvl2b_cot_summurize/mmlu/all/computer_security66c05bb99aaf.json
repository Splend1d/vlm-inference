This can happen when a program reads data from an external source and then writes it to a buffer that is not large enough to hold the data. If the buffer is not large enough, the program may overwrite the data that is already in the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\nIn languages like C and C++, it is common to use predefined functions that do not perform string boundary checks. These functions may not check that the data being read from an external source is within the bounds of the buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow. This is because these functions do not perform any checks on the data being read, and the program may overwrite the data that is already in the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. No string boundary checks in predefined functions."
