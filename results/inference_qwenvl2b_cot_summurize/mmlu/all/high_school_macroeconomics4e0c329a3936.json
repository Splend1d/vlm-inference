The increase in the standard of living could be due to various factors, such as technological advancements, increased productivity, or better resource allocation. Without specific information about the nature of the increase, we cannot conclude that output must have increased.\n\nB. **Population must have increased**: This is also not necessarily true. The increase in the standard of living could be due to improvements in living conditions for individuals, which might not necessarily lead to an increase in population size.\n\nC. **Output and population must have increased**: This is not necessarily true. The increase in the standard of living could be due to improvements in living conditions for individuals, which might not necessarily lead to an increase in both output and population size.\n\nD. **Output must have increased proportionally more than population**: This is the most plausible conclusion. If the standard of living increases, it is likely that the output must have increased proportionally more than the population. This is because the increase in the standard of living would require more resources to meet the higher living standards, which would necessitate an increase in output to meet the increased demand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Output must have increased proportionally more than population.**"
