The order of a solvable group can be any prime power, not just prime powers of prime numbers. For example, the group of integers under addition is solvable but has an order of 2^3 * 3 = 24, which is not a prime power.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of prime-power order is solvable.\nThis statement is also false. A group of prime-power order is solvable if and only if it is cyclic. A cyclic group is a group that is generated by a single element. If the order of the group is a prime power, then the group is cyclic and solvable. However, if the order is not a prime power, then the group is not cyclic and therefore not solvable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
