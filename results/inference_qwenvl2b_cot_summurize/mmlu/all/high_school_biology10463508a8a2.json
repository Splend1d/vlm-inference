Apoptosis prevents an aging and dying cell from damaging neighboring cells.\n\nApoptosis is a process by which cells die voluntarily, usually in response to stress or damage. It does not prevent cells from dying; rather, it allows cells to die in a controlled manner, which is essential for the maintenance of the body's homeostasis and the removal of damaged or unnecessary cells."
