In contrast, Economy Y is a closed economy, meaning that the value of the currency is determined by the balance of trade and the demand for and supply of the currency within the country.\n\nEconomic X is more open to trade than Economy Y, which means that the exchange rate is more flexible and can be adjusted to reflect changes in the balance of trade. This flexibility allows for more effective monetary policy, as it can be used to influence the exchange rate and the balance of trade in a way that is not possible in a closed economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. more effective in X because the policy will increase net exports."
