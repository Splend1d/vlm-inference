Not enough information is provided to determine if the frequency of the allele will remain the same or change.\nC.

This means that the allele frequency is the same in the current generation as it was in the previous generation.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the allele in the population is 0.3, and assuming the population remains in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the expected frequency of the allele after 500 years would be the same as it is now, which is 0.3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
