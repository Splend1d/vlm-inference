However, it cannot have elements of orders 1, 2, and 5 alone.\n\nStatement 2 is false. A group with an element of order 2 and an element of order 3 cannot have an element of order 6. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(a^n = e\\), where \\(a\\) is the element and \\(e\\) is the identity element. If an element has order 2 and another has order 3, the order of the product of these two elements is the least common multiple (LCM) of their orders, which is 6. However, if the order of the product of these two elements is 6, it means that the element of order 6 is not in the group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
