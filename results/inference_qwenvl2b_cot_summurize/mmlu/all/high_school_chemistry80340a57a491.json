The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart.\n\nDuring the boiling process of liquid NH3, the molecules of NH3 gain enough energy to overcome the hydrogen bonds that hold them together. This results in the breaking apart of these hydrogen bonds, causing the molecules to separate and the liquid to boil."
