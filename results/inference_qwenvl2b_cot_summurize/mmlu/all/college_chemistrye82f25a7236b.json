We can rearrange the equation to solve for B:\n\nB = \u03bcI / g\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nB = (2.884 x 10^-27 J T-1) / 1\n\nB = 2.884 x 10^-27 J T-1\n\nNow, we need to find the magnetic field strength (B) that corresponds to this value. We can use the equation:\n\nB = \u03bcI / g\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nB = (2.884 x 10^-27 J T-1) / 1\n\nB = 2.884 x 10^-27 J T-1\n\nThis value is very close to the magnetic field strength of a hydrogen nucleus (H), which is approximately 2.00 x 10^-27 J T-1. Therefore, the unknown nuclide is most likely a hydrogen nucleus (2H). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 2H."
