A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following contributed the LEAST to the health and hunger problems faced by the French people in the seventeenth century?\n\nA.

This suggests that the agricultural productivity was low, leading to a reliance on hunting for food.\n\n2. **Adverse weather**: The report does not provide specific information about weather conditions, but it does mention that the inhabitants were unable to relieve the 200 sick persons, which could be due to poor weather conditions that made it difficult to find food.\n\n3. **Low taxes on the peasants and middle class**: The report does not provide any information about taxes or their impact on the peasants and middle class.\n\n4. **Poor transportation**: The report does not mention any issues related to transportation, such as lack of roads or poor infrastructure.\n\nGiven this analysis, the option that contributed the least to the health and hunger problems faced by the French people in the seventeenth century is:\n\n**D. Poor transportation**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is D."
