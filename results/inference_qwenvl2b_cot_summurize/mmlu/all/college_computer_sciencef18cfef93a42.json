For example, AND and NOT are both Boolean operators, and they can be used to represent any Boolean expression.\n\nB. {NOT, OR} - This set also includes all possible Boolean expressions. For example, NOT and OR are both Boolean operators, and they can be used to represent any Boolean expression.\n\nC. {AND, OR} - This set also includes all possible Boolean expressions. For example, AND and OR are both Boolean operators, and they can be used to represent any Boolean expression.\n\nD. {NAND} - This set does not include all possible Boolean expressions. NAND is a Boolean operator that is not sufficient to represent all Boolean expressions.
