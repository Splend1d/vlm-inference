The organelles in larger eukaryotic cells took care of the problems of having a larger surface area\u2013to\u2013volume ratio.**\n\nThis statement aligns with the idea that eukaryotic cells have more complex organelles that can help in managing the increased surface area-to-volume ratio, thus improving metabolic efficiency."
