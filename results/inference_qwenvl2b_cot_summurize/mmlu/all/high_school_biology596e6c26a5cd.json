Translocation events that change gene sequences\n\nTranslocation events, which involve the exchange of genetic material between two chromosomes, can significantly alter the amino acid sequence of homologous proteins, making them less similar than if the proteins were encoded by homologous genes. This is because translocation events can introduce new amino acids or alter existing ones, leading to a different protein structure and function. Therefore, determining the evolutionary relatedness of different species based on the amino acid sequence of homologous proteins is generally less accurate than determinations of relatedness based on the nucleotide sequences of homologous genes."
