Development of a two-party system\n\nAn electoral system with single-member districts tends to favor the party that wins the most votes in a district, leading to a two-party system where the two major parties compete for control of the presidency and Congress. This system can lead to a balance of power that favors the president over Congress, as the president has more influence in the selection of the members of Congress."
