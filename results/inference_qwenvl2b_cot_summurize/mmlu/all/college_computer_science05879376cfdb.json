However, definitions of such a structure often contain declarations of components of the structure (e.g., the header file for a C++ class may contain declarations of its private components). For such a language, an object's name could be bound at run time to stack storage for its component values (direct representation) or to a stack pointer referencing heap storage for its component values (indirect representation). Which of the following statements about comparisons between direct and indirect representations is (are) true?\nI. Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time.\nII. Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable.\nIII. When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed.\n\nA. I only\nB.

Indirect representation can be faster than direct representation if the indirect representation is implemented efficiently and does not require additional overhead.\n\n2. **Statement II: Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable.**\n   - This statement is not necessarily true. Direct representation can be faster than indirect representation if the direct representation is implemented efficiently and does not require additional overhead.\n\n3. **Statement III: When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed.**\n   - This statement is true. Indirect representation allows for a more efficient use of memory, which can minimize the number of recompilations needed when the storage size of a component changes.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
