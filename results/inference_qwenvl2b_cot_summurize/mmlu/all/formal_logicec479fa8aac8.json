Either England's importing beef is a sufficient condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\n2. Or China doesn't promote human rights when and only when South Africa supplies diamonds.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2283 S)\n- This option suggests that if England imports beef, then France subsidizes agriculture. If China doesn't promote human rights, then South Africa supplies diamonds. This option captures the essence of the sentence but does not explicitly state the sufficiency condition between England's importing beef and France's subsidizing agriculture.\n\nB. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 ~C\n- This option suggests that if France subsidizes agriculture, then England imports beef. If South Africa supplies diamonds, then China promotes human rights. This option captures the essence of the sentence but does not explicitly state the sufficiency condition between England's importing beef and France's subsidizing agriculture.\n\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 ~(S \u2261 C\n- This option suggests that if England imports beef, then France subsidizes agriculture. If China doesn't promote human rights, then South Africa supplies diamonds. This option captures the essence of the sentence but does not explicitly state the sufficiency condition between England's importing beef and France's subsidizing agriculture.\n\nD. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2261 S\n- This option suggests that if England imports beef, then France subsidizes agriculture. If China doesn't promote human rights, then South Africa supplies diamonds. This option captures the essence of the sentence but does not explicitly state the sufficiency condition between England's importing beef and France's subsidizing agriculture.\n\nUpon careful analysis, option D best captures the essence of the sentence. It explicitly states that if England imports beef, then France subsidizes agriculture, and if China doesn't promote human rights, then South Africa supplies diamonds. This option does not explicitly state the sufficiency condition between England's importing beef and France's subsidizing agriculture, but it does capture the logical structure of the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization of the given sentence is:\nD. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (~C \u2261 S)"
