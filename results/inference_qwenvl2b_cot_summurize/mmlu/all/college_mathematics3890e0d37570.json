                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's first understand the pattern of their work and how it affects the total time it takes to complete the practice test.\n\n1. **Kate's Work Pattern**: Kate works on the test for 2 days out of every 3 days. This means she works for 2/3 of the days.\n2. **John's Work Pattern**: John works on the test for 2 days out of every 3 days. This means he works for 2/3 of the days.\n\nGiven that they work in alternating 2-day shifts, we can calculate the total number of days they work together in one cycle as follows:\n\n- **Kate's 2-day shifts**: 2/3 of the days\n- **John's 2-day shifts**: 2/3 of the days\n\nSince they work in alternating shifts, the total number of days they work together in one cycle is the sum of their individual contributions:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total days in one cycle} = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3} \\]\n\nThis means they work for \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) of the days in one cycle.\n\nGiven that they work for 10 days when Kate starts and 10.5 days when John starts, we can infer that the total number of days they work together in one cycle is \\(10 + 10.5 = 20.5\\) days.\n\nSince they work for \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) of the days in one cycle, the total number of days it takes for them to complete the practice test when they work together is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total days for 2 people} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 20.5 = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{205}{10} = \\frac{410}{30} = \\frac{41}{3} \\approx 13.67 \\]\n\nHowever, since the number of days must be a whole number, we round this to the nearest whole number, which is 14 days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 41/8 days**"
