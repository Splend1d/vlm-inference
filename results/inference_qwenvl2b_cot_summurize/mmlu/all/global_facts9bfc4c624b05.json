The total population of India as of 2018.\n2. The percentage of the population that is composed of people of different races, ethnic groups, and nationalities.\n3. The percentage of this population that believes that having more people of these diverse backgrounds makes the country a better place to live.\n\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n\n1. **Total Population of India as of 2018**: According to the latest data, India's population was approximately 1.3 billion people as of 2018.\n\n2. **Percentage of Population Composed of People of Different Races, Ethnic Groups, and Nationalities**: This percentage is not provided directly, but we can infer it based on the context. It is likely to be a significant portion of the population, possibly around 20-30%.\n\n3. **Percentage of This Population Believing That Having More People of These Diverse Backgrounds Makes the Country a Better Place to Live**: This percentage is also not provided directly, but we can estimate it based on the context. It is likely to be around 50-70%.\n\nGiven these assumptions, let's calculate the percentage:\n\n- Let's assume the total population is 1.3 billion.\n- Let's assume the percentage of the population that is diverse is 20%.\n- Let's assume the percentage of this diverse population that believes it makes the country better is 50%.\n\nThus, the percentage of Indians who say that having an increasing number of people of many different races, ethnic groups, and nationalities in their country makes it a better place to live is approximately 20% * 50% = 10%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. 23%**"
