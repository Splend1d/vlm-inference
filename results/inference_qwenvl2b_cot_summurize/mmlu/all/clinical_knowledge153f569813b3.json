This difference is generated by the sodium-potassium ATPase, which is responsible for the active transport of sodium ions into the cell and potassium ions out of the cell. The energy charge is a measure of the overall rate of energy use by the cell, as it represents the difference between the energy produced by ATP synthase and the energy consumed by ATPase."
