They formed as dense rocky planets close to the star in the same orbits that they are seen today.\n\nHot Jupiters are planets that orbit stars that are much hotter than the Sun. These planets are typically much smaller and denser than Earth, and they are often referred to as \"hot Jupiters\" because they are similar in size and density to Jupiter, but much hotter. The formation of hot Jupiters is thought to have occurred when dense rocky planets formed close to the star in the same orbits that they are seen today. These planets would have been formed from the material that was left over after the star had finished its main sequence phase of its life. As the star continued to cool and contract, it would have drawn in the material from the surrounding space, creating the dense rocky planets that we see today."
