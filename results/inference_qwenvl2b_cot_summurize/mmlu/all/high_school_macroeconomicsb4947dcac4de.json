This is because the CPI is calculated by dividing the total cost of a basket of goods and services by the number of people in the economy. As the cost of goods decreases, the CPI will decrease, which means that the overall price level of goods and services will also decrease. This can lead to a decrease in the inflation rate, as the rate of increase in the price level of goods and services is reduced."
