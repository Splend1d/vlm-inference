Neptune and Pluto won't collide because of their orbital resonance.\n\nWhile Neptune and Pluto are in a 3:2 orbital resonance, this does not necessarily mean that they will collide. Collisions between celestial bodies are influenced by a variety of factors, including their masses, orbital speeds, and the strength of gravitational forces. The orbital resonance between Neptune and Pluto does not necessarily imply that they will collide in the future."
