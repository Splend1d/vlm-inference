Therefore, if the computation C lasts for at least n steps, it is decidable.\n\n### Problem II: The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.\nThis problem requires M to print a 1 at some point after the nth step. Since M is deterministic, it can only print a 1 if it has been instructed to do so. Therefore, if M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step, the computation C lasts for at least n steps. Hence, this problem is decidable.\n\n### Problem III: M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.\nA Turing machine can only scan a tape square at most once. Therefore, if M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C, it is decidable.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe problems that are decidable are:\nI. The computation C lasts for at least n steps.\nIII. M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. I and III only"
