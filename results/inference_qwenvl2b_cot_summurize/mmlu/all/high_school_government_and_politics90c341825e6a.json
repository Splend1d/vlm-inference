The lower court's ruling is overturned if the Supreme Court denies a writ of certiorari.\n\nWrits of certiorari are petitions filed by the United States Supreme Court to review the decisions of lower courts. If the Supreme Court grants a writ of certiorari, it will review the case and determine whether the lower court's decision was correct. If the Supreme Court finds that the lower court's decision was incorrect, it will reverse the lower court's ruling and issue a new decision. If the Supreme Court denies a writ of certiorari, it means that the lower court's decision is not being reviewed by the Supreme Court, and the lower court's ruling stands."
