A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rh\u00e9tel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the cur\u00e9, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n\u2014Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following would be most responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "To determine which of the given options would most likely have ended the problems of hunger mentioned in the report, we need to analyze the context and the historical context of the time period in which the report was written.\n\nThe report describes a severe famine in Normandy during the 1650s, with a high number of people dying from hunger. The famine is attributed to a combination of factors, including a lack of food, a decline in population, and the inability of the inhabitants to relieve the sick. The report also mentions the use of a \"putting-out system\" to pay people to work in the fields, which suggests that there was some form of economic incentive to work and produce food.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. **The elimination of the Black Plague in Europe during the seventeenth century**\n   - The Black Plague was a major pandemic that affected Europe in the 1600s and 1700s. While it had a significant impact on population and food production, it did not directly address the issue of famine. The famine in Normandy was likely exacerbated by other factors, such as the agricultural revolution and the decline in population.\n\nB. **The elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century**\n   - The agricultural revolution, which began in the 1600s and continued into the 1700s, led to the widespread use of new farming techniques and the expansion of agricultural land. This could have led to increased food production and a decrease in the number of people who were unable to relieve the sick and die of hunger.\n\nC. **The creation of a strong putting-out system that allowed people to be paid for their work**\n   - The putting-out system mentioned in the report was a form of economic incentive to work in the fields. This system could have provided a means for people to earn a living and potentially produce more food, thereby reducing the number of people who were unable to relieve the sick and die of hunger.\n\nD. **A declining population during the seventeenth century that led to better food yields and less hunger as Europe urbanized**\n   - While this option suggests a positive outcome, it does not directly address the issue of famine. The decline in population and the resulting increase in food production could have been a result of the famine, rather than a cause.\n\nGiven the context and the historical context of the 1650s, the most responsible option for ending the problems of hunger would be:\n\n**C. The creation of a strong putting-out system that allowed people to be paid for their work**\n\nThis option directly addresses the issue of economic incentives and the potential for increased food production, which could have helped alleviate the famine in Normandy."
