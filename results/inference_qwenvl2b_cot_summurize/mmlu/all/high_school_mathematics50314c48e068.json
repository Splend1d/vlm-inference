                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of composite numbers and how they are formed when we multiply the numbers on the faces of 5 dice.\n\nA composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one or itself. In other words, it is a number that can be formed by multiplying two smaller positive integers.\n\nWhen we roll 5 dice, the possible outcomes range from \\(1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1\\) to \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6\\). The number of outcomes is \\(6^5\\).\n\nA composite number can be formed by multiplying any combination of the numbers on the dice. For example, \\(1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1\\), which is a prime number, and \\(6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 6^5\\), which is a composite number.\n\nTo find the probability that the product is a composite number, we need to find the number of outcomes that result in a composite number and divide it by the total number of outcomes.\n\nThe number of outcomes that result in a composite number is the sum of all the outcomes that result in a composite number, which is \\(6^5 - 1\\), because we subtract 1 from the total number of outcomes to exclude the prime number 1.\n\nSo, the probability is \\(\\frac{6^5 - 1}{6^5}\\).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6^5 - 1}{6^5} = \\frac{7776 - 1}{7776} = \\frac{7775}{7776}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{7776}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \\(\\frac{2}{7776}\\)"
