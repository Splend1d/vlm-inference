However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots. Let's assume we find the roots to be \\( x_1, x_2, x_3 \\). If these roots are real and distinct, then \\( f(x) = 0 \\) has three real solutions.\n\nB. **f(x) \u2265 \u201318 for all x \u2265 0.**\n   - To check if \\( f(x) \\geq -18 \\) for all \\( x \\geq 0 \\), we substitute \\( x \\geq 0 \\) into the function:\n     \\[\n     f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 9x - 18 \\geq -18\n     \\]\n   - This inequality is always true for \\( x \\geq 0 \\) because the cubic function is always non-negative.\n\nC. **f(x) \u2264 \u201318 for all x \u2264 0.**\n   - To check if \\( f(x) \\leq -18 \\) for all \\( x \\leq 0 \\), we substitute \\( x \\leq 0 \\) into the function:\n     \\[\n     f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 9x - 18 \\leq -18\n     \\]\n   - This inequality is always true for \\( x \\leq 0 \\) because the cubic function is always non-positive.\n\nD. **The function f(x) is decreasing for x \u2264 \u20133.**\n   - To check if \\( f(x) \\) is decreasing for \\( x \\leq -3 \\), we need to find the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) and analyze its sign. However, since \\( f(x) \\) is a cubic function, its derivative is not straightforward to compute analytically. Instead, we can use a graphing tool or numerical methods to find the critical points and determine the behavior of the function.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n**B. f(x) \u2265 \u201318 for all x \u2265 0.**\n\nThis statement is true because the function \\( f(x) \\) is always non-negative for \\( x \\geq 0 \\)."
