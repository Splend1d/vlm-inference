Squaring this gives us approximately 197.999.\n\nThe square root of 121 is approximately 11.079. Squaring this gives us approximately 121.999.\n\nTo find the percentage increase from the square root of 121 to the square root of 200, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{14.142 - 11.079}{11.079} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{3.0643}{11.079} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = 0.285 \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = 28.5\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the positive square root of 200 is approximately 28.5% larger than the positive square root of 121, which is closest to option A. 29."
