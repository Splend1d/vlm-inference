However, a vertex with no outgoing edges is not necessarily isolated. It could be a vertex with multiple incoming edges, or it could be a vertex with no incoming edges but multiple outgoing edges. Therefore, option II is not necessarily true. \n\nOption III is true because in a DAG, every vertex must have either an incoming edge or an outgoing edge. An isolated vertex, which has neither an incoming nor an outgoing edge, is not a vertex in a DAG. Therefore, option III is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. III only."
