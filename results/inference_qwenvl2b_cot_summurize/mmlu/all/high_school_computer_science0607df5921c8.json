This means that the returned value must be within the range of low and high. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. (int) (Math.random() * high) + low:\nThis option uses the `Math.random()` method to generate a random number between 0 and 1. Multiplying this by high and adding low will give a random number between low and high, inclusive. This option satisfies the postcondition.\n\nB. (int) (Math.random() * (high - low)) + low:\nThis option uses the `Math.random()` method to generate a random number between 0 and 1. Multiplying this by (high - low) and adding low will give a random number between low and high, inclusive. This option also satisfies the postcondition.\n\nC. (int) (Math.random() * (high - low + 1)) + low:\nThis option uses the `Math.random()` method to generate a random number between 0 and 1. Multiplying this by (high - low + 1) and adding low will give a random number between low and high, inclusive. This option also satisfies the postcondition.\n\nD. (int) (Math.random() * (high + low)) + low:\nThis option uses the `Math.random()` method to generate a random number between 0 and 1. Multiplying this by (high + low) and adding low will give a random number between low and high, inclusive. This option does not satisfy the postcondition because it includes the value low in the range.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
