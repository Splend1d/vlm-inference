The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\nC. The cell would need to consume another food source other than glucose because it will not be able to make adequate ATP with only glucose.\nD. The cell will begin to divide rapidly because larger cells require more oxygen and glucose than smaller ones.\n"

The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\n\nWhen a yeast cell is moved from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment, it must switch from aerobic respiration to anaerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic respiration because it produces less ATP per glucose molecule compared to aerobic respiration. Therefore, the cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate to generate the same amount of ATP as it would in an aerobic environment."
