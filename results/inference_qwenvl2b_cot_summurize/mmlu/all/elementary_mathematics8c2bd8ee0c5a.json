Therefore, this set satisfies the inequality.\n\nC. {4, 6, 8} - This set does not contain any values less than 5.5, so it does not satisfy the inequality.\n\nD. {2, 3, 4} - This set does not contain any values less than 5.5, so it does not satisfy the inequality.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. {5, 7, 9}."
