M2 includes various types of assets that are not as liquid as the currency in MI.\n\nB. M2 is smaller than MI.\n- This statement is false. M2 is not smaller than MI; in fact, it is larger.\n\nC. M I is backed by gold and M2 is backed by silver.\n- This statement is false. M2 is backed by various types of assets, including currency, while M1 is backed by currency only.\n\nD. The biggest component of M I is currency.\n- This statement is false. The biggest component of M1 is currency, not M2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Some of the things included in M2 are not as liquid as the things in MI."
