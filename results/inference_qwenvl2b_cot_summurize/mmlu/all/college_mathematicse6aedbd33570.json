This means that $k!$ ends in exactly 99 zeros when we divide it by 9.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of positive integers $k$ such that $k!$ ends in exactly 99 zeros when we divide it by 9. This is equivalent to finding the number of positive integers $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 9.\n\nThe number of positive integers $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 9 is the number of positive integers $k$ such that $k$ is divisible by 9. This is equal to the number of positive integers $k$ such that $k$ is divisible by 3. Since there are 3 positive integers that are divisible by 3, there are 3 positive integers that end in exactly 99 zeros when we divide them by 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{3}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
