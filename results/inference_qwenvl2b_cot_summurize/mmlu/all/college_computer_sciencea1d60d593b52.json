The access matrix approach to protection has the difficulty that the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage.\n\nThis is because the access matrix is a representation of the rights and permissions of users or processes to access resources, and storing it directly can lead to a large and complex structure that is difficult to manage and maintain. This can make it cumbersome and time-consuming to update and maintain the access matrix, which is a significant challenge in the field of access control and security."
