This is because the intersection of two subspaces is a subspace itself, and its dimension is the minimum of the dimensions of the original subspaces.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. 0\n- If V \u2229 W is the empty set, then the dimension of V \u2229 W is 0. This is possible because the intersection of two subspaces can be the empty set.\n\nB. 1\n- If V \u2229 W is a one-dimensional subspace, then the dimension of V \u2229 W is 1. This is possible because the intersection of two subspaces can be a one-dimensional subspace.\n\nC. 2\n- If V \u2229 W is a two-dimensional subspace, then the dimension of V \u2229 W is 2. This is not possible because the intersection of two subspaces cannot be a two-dimensional subspace. The intersection of two subspaces must be a one-dimensional subspace or the empty set.\n\nD. 3\n- If V \u2229 W is a three-dimensional subspace, then the dimension of V \u2229 W is 3. This is not possible because the intersection of two subspaces cannot be a three-dimensional subspace. The intersection of two subspaces must be a one-dimensional subspace or the empty set.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the subspace V intersect W cannot be 3.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 3."
