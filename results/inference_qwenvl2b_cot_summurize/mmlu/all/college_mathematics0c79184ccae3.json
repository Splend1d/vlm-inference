This is a region where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are both positive or both negative, but not both zero.\n\nThe probability that a point (x, y) in this region is chosen is the area of the region divided by the total area of the plane.\n\nThe total area of the plane is \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\).\n\nThe area of the region described by \\(0 < |x| + |y| < 1\\) is the area of a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1). This triangle has base length 1 and height 1, so its area is \\(\\frac{1 \\times 1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that a point (x, y) in this region is chosen is:\n\\[P = \\frac{\\text{Area of region}}{\\text{Total area of plane}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nB. 1/4"
