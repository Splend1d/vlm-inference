Initialize variables: heads_counter = 0, f1ip_counter = 0.\n2. Assign a value to coin_f1ip (either 0 or 1).\n3. If coin_f1ip is 0, flip the coin and set heads_counter to 1.\n4.

If f1ip_counter equals 4, the simulation resulted in an equal number of heads and tails.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\nA. coin_f1ip = 1: This indicates that the coin flip resulted in heads, which is not necessarily an equal number of heads and tails. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nB. flip_counter = 1: This indicates that the first flip resulted in heads, which is not necessarily an equal number of heads and tails. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nC. flip_counter = 2: This indicates that the second flip resulted in heads, which is not necessarily an equal number of heads and tails. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nD. heads_counter = 2: This indicates that the first and second flips resulted in heads, which is an equal number of heads and tails. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
