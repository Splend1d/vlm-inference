This doesn't directly capture the condition that the person must have been born or died in the present year and the home must have been the person's home for the entire time.\n\n2. **Option B**: \\([L \u2283 (B \u2228 D)] \u2022 H**\n   - This option suggests that if L is true, then either B or D must be true. This doesn't capture the condition that the person must have been born or died in the present year.\n\n3. **Option C**: \\(L \u2283 [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H]\\)\n   - This option suggests that if L is true, then either B or D must be true. This captures the condition that the person must have been born or died in the present year.\n\n4. **Option D**: \\((B \u2228 D \u2022 H) \u2283 L\\)\n   - This option suggests that if B or D is true, then H must be true. This doesn't capture the condition that the person must have been born or died in the present year.\n\nGiven the sentence's condition that the person must have been born or died in the present year and the home must have been the person's home for the entire time, the correct option that captures this condition is:\n\n**Option C**: \\(L \u2283 [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H]\\)\n\nThis option directly states that if L is true, then either B or D must be true, which aligns with the given sentence's condition."
