A cycle is a sequence of elements where each element is followed by the same element, and the sequence repeats.\n\nStatement 2: Every cycle is a permutation.\n- This statement is true. A cycle is a permutation because it is a specific type of permutation where the elements are arranged in a fixed order, and the order of the elements within the cycle is significant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
