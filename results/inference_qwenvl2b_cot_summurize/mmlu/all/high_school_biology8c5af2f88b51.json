After leaving the nucleus, the poly-A tail is added.\n\nRNA processing involves several steps, including the removal of introns, addition of a 5\u2032 cap, and the addition of a poly-A tail. The 5\u2032 cap is added to the 5\u2032 end of the preRNA, and the poly-A tail is added to the 3\u2032 end."
