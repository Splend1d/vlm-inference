According to the problem, Dani has 5 times as many marbles as Joe, which can be represented as \\(5J\\).\n\nWe know that Dani has 45 marbles, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[5J = 45\\]\n\nTo find \\(J\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n\\[J = \\frac{45}{5}\\]\n\n\\[J = 9\\]\n\nTherefore, Joe has 9 marbles. The correct answer is C."
