In this case, the polynomial is:\n\n8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24\n\nWe can check if it has any roots in Q by using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (24) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (8). The possible rational roots are:\n\n\u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b14, \u00b16, \u00b18\n\nWe can test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial:\n\n8(1)^3 + 6(1)^2 - 9(1) + 24 = 8 + 6 - 9 + 24 = 25\n\nSince 25 is not equal to 0, we can conclude that the polynomial has no roots in Q. Therefore, it is irreducible over Q.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. No."
