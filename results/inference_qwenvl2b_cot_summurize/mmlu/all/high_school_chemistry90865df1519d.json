The O\u2013H bonds in sulfuric acid are much weaker than in sulfurous acid due to the electron withdrawing of the oxygen atoms on sulfuric acid.\n\nSulfurous acid (H2SO3) has a weaker acid strength compared to sulfuric acid (H2SO4) because the oxygen atoms in sulfuric acid are electron-withdrawing, which makes the O\u2013H bonds in sulfuric acid weaker than in sulfurous acid."
