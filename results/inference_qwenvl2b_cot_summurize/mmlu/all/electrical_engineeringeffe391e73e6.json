A null type instrument is characterized by its ability to measure the absence of a particular quantity, such as a force or a displacement. This means that it has a lower sensitivity compared to a deflected type instrument, which is designed to measure the presence of a particular quantity. However, both types of instruments have a faster response and a higher accuracy compared to other types of instruments."
