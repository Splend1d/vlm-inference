As the present sciences are useless for the discovery of effects, so the present system of logic is useless for the discovery of the sciences.\nXIX. There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&\u2026\nXXXVI.

The passage discusses the two main ways of investigating truth: one method starts from the senses and particulars and constructs axioms, while the other method constructs axioms from the senses and particulars and arrives at general axioms.\n\n2. The passage mentions that each method begins from the senses and particulars and ends in the greatest generalities.\n\n3. The passage also states that Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and essayist, discusses these methods in his work \"Novum Organum\" from 1620.\n\nGiven this information, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. It had weakened to the point of irrelevance.\n   - This option suggests that the method of empirical reasoning had become so weak that it was no longer useful. However, the passage does not imply that the method had weakened to the point of irrelevance. It only states that it is \"useless for the discovery of effects\" and \"useless for the discovery of the sciences.\"\n\nB. It had become a core principle of European culture.\n   - This option suggests that the method became a fundamental principle of European culture. The passage does not explicitly state that it became a core principle of European culture. It only mentions that it is \"useless for the discovery of the sciences\" and \"can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth.\"\n\nC. It had been refined and changed by so many people that it had become unrecognizable to those such as Bacon who had pioneered it.\n   - This option suggests that the method had been refined and changed by many people, making it unrecognizable to those who pioneered it. The passage does not provide information about the method being refined and changed by many people.\n\nD. It had stagnated to the point that the common person had begun to search for a new organizing principle of life.\n   - This option suggests that the method had stagnated and that people were searching for a new organizing principle of life. The passage does not provide information about stagnation or the common person searching for a new organizing principle.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nC. It had been refined and changed by so many people that it had become unrecognizable to those such as Bacon who had pioneered it.\n\nFinal answer: C"
