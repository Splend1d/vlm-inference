Yes, if the PRG is really \u201csecure\u201d\n\nA stream cipher with perfect secrecy means that the ciphertext is indistinguishable from random noise, even when the plaintext is known. This is achieved by using a random permutation function (PRG) that is secure against chosen-plaintext attacks. The PRG is used to generate the keystream, which is then used to encrypt the plaintext. The ciphertext is indistinguishable from random noise because the keystream is unpredictable and the plaintext is unknown."
