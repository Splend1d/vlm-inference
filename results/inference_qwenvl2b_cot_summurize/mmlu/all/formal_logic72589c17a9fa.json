The argument is presented by Sigmund Freud, and it discusses the difficulty in convincing people about the unconscious mind and the difficulty in teaching them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.\"\n- This option talks about verifying weakened intelligence due to emotions, which is not the main focus of the argument.\n\nB. \"The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.\"\n- This option discusses the arrogance of consciousness and its role in blocking unconscious complexes, which is a part of the argument but not the main conclusion.\n\nC. \"Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\"\n- This option directly addresses the main conclusion of the argument, which is the difficulty in convincing people about the unconscious mind and the difficulty in teaching them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nD. \"It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\"\n- This option is similar to option C but slightly rephrased. It also focuses on the difficulty in convincing people about the unconscious and the difficulty in teaching them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nAfter careful analysis, option C is the most accurate representation of the conclusion of the argument.\n\nFinal answer: C. Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts."
