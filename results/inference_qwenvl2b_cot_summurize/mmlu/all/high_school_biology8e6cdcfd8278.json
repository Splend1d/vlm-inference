The first three children are sons, so the probability of having a son in each of the first three pregnancies is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) for each child.\n2. The probability of having a son in the fourth pregnancy is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) since the woman is pregnant with their fourth child.\n\nTo find the overall probability that the fourth child will also be male, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1/4"
