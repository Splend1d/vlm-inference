Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I. Lenin Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U., November 19,1928\nWhich of the following policies of Joseph Stalin was NOT used to correct the problem cited by Lenin above?\n\nA.

Let's break down the problem and analyze each option:\n\n1. **Collectivization**: This policy aimed to collectivize agriculture, which was a significant step towards industrialization and modernization. It was used to correct the problem of the scattered and backward small commodity economy of the peasants.\n\n2. **Persecution of the better-off peasants**: This policy was used to suppress the peasantry and concentrate power in the hands of the Communist Party, which was not aimed at correcting the problem of the scattered and backward small commodity economy of the peasants.\n\n3. **The Berlin blockade**: This was a military action taken by the Soviet Union to block the passage of goods and supplies to the Western Allies during World War II. It was not related to industrialization or the problem of the scattered and backward small commodity economy of the peasants.\n\n4. **The five-year plans**: These were economic plans set by the Soviet Union to achieve industrialization and modernization. They were used to correct the problem of the scattered and backward small commodity economy of the peasants by providing a systematic and persistent approach to industrialization.\n\nGiven this analysis, the policy of Joseph Stalin that was NOT used to correct the problem cited by Lenin is:\n\n**B. Persecution of the better-off peasants**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B."
