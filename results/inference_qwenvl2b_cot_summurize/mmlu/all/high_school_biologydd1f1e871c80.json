In the context of the given scenario, the death of a disproportionate number of long-finned fish due to the summer thunderstorm leads to a shift in the relative frequency of the two forms in the population. This is an example of genetic drift, where the frequency of the two forms changes due to random events rather than a selective pressure or natural selection."
