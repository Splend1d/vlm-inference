Bosons have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nBosons are particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This means that bosons cannot occupy the same quantum state, even if they are in the same location. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nC. Fermions have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nFermions are particles that do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This means that fermions can occupy the same quantum state, even if they are in the same location. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nD.
