The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point. \n\nThe intermolecular forces in a molecule are primarily determined by the type of bonds and the size of the molecules. The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point.\n\nA. CH3CH2CH2CH3: This molecule has three carbon atoms bonded together, forming a ring. The intermolecular forces in this molecule are primarily hydrogen bonding, which is stronger than the intermolecular forces in the other molecules. Therefore, this molecule is expected to have the highest normal boiling point.\n\nB. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH: This molecule has a hydroxyl group (OH) bonded to the carbon atom. The hydroxyl group is a polar group, which means it has a dipole. The dipole can interact with the dipole of another molecule, leading to stronger intermolecular forces. Therefore, this molecule is expected to have a lower normal boiling point than the other molecules.\n\nC. CH3CH2CH2CH2Cl: This molecule has a chlorine atom bonded to the carbon atom. The chlorine atom is a polar group, which means it has a dipole. The dipole can interact with the dipole of another molecule, leading to stronger intermolecular forces. Therefore, this molecule is expected to have a lower normal boiling point than the other molecules.\n\nD. CH3CH2CH2CH2Br: This molecule has a bromine atom bonded to the carbon atom. The bromine atom is a polar group, which means it has a dipole. The dipole can interact with the dipole of another molecule, leading to stronger intermolecular forces. Therefore, this molecule is expected to have a lower normal boiling point than the other molecules.\n\nTherefore, the molecule with the highest normal boiling point is:\n\nA. CH3CH2CH2CH3"
