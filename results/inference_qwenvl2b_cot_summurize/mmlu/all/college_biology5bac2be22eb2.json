The blastomere with the gray crescent will grow in size more quickly than the one without the gray crescent.\nB. The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\nC.

                    "text": "The expected fate of the blastomeres is:\n\nC. The blastomere without the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\n\nThis is because the first cleavage plane was manipulated to create a situation where the gray crescent is contained in only one of the two blastomeres. This means that the blastomere with the gray crescent will not have the gray crescent, and thus will not have the advantage of having the gray crescent in its blastomere. The blastomere without the gray crescent will have the advantage of not having the gray crescent, and will therefore have a better chance of forming a complete, but small, embryo."
