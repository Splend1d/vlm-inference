An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after q lags\n\nAn ARMA(p,q) model is a type of autoregressive moving average model. The autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) of an ARMA(p,q) model are given by:\n\nACF: r(t) = p * r(t-p) + (1-p) * r(t-q)\nPACF: r(t) = p * r(t-p) + (1-p) * r(t-q)\n\nwhere r(t) is the autocorrelation function at lag t, p is the order of the autoregressive part, and q is the order of the moving average part. The ACF and PACF both decline geometrically as the lag increases, but the PACF is zero after q lags."
