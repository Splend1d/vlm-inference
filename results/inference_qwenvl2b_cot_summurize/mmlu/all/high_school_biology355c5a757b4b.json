The sudden demise of the dinosaurs, and various other groups, by the impact of a large extraterrestrial body with Earth.\n\nCatastrophism refers to the idea that significant changes in the Earth's environment occur in a single event, often involving large-scale geological or biological events. The sudden demise of the dinosaurs is an example of a catastrophic event that occurred due to the impact of a large extraterrestrial body, such as a meteorite or asteroid, which caused widespread destruction and extinction of many species."
