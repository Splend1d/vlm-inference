The order of a group is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(a^n = e\\) for all \\(a\\) in the group and \\(e\\) is the identity element. For a group of order 159, the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) that satisfies \\(a^n = e\\) for all \\(a\\) in the group is 159 itself. This means that 159 is the smallest positive integer that is a power of a prime number, and thus, 159 is a prime number. Therefore, a group of order 159 cannot be cyclic because it cannot be generated by a single element.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n- This statement is false. The order of a group is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(a^n = e\\) for all \\(a\\) in the group and \\(e\\) is the identity element. For a group of order 102, the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) that satisfies \\(a^n = e\\) for all \\(a\\) in the group is 102 itself. This means that 102 is the smallest positive integer that is a power of a prime number, and thus, 102 is a prime number. Therefore, a group of order 102 cannot be cyclic because it cannot be generated by a single element.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
