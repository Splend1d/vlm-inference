It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field is primarily due to the presence of a partially molten metallic core, which acts as a giant magnet. The Earth's rotation also plays a significant role in generating the magnetic field, as it causes the Earth's magnetic field lines to spiral around the planet. The Earth's rotation rate is relatively slow compared to other terrestrial planets, which allows the magnetic field lines to spiral around the planet more efficiently. This spiral motion is known as the Coriolis effect, and it helps to generate the Earth's magnetic field."
