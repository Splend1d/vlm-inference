The demand curve would shift up increasing the equilibrium interest rate.\n\nWhen a financial planner convinces more Americans to save for retirement, it typically leads to an increase in the demand for loanable funds, as people are more likely to save for retirement, which increases the demand for loans. This, in turn, shifts the demand curve for loanable funds to the right, leading to a higher equilibrium interest rate."
