                    "text": "To determine which circle has the greatest number of points of intersection with the parabola \\(x^2 = y + 4\\), we need to consider the nature of the parabola and the circles in question.\n\nThe given parabola \\(x^2 = y + 4\\) is a parabola that opens upwards, with its vertex at \\((-4, 0)\\). This means that for any point \\((x, y)\\) on the parabola, the distance from the vertex to the point is the same, which is the distance from \\((-4, 0)\\) to the point \\((x, y)\\).\n\nNow, let's analyze each circle in relation to the parabola:\n\nA. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\)\n- This circle is a circle centered at the origin with radius 1. Since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, any point on the parabola will have a corresponding point on the circle that is symmetrically placed with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, for any point on the parabola, there will be a corresponding point on the circle that is symmetrically placed with respect to the y-axis. This means that for every point on the parabola, there will be exactly one point on the circle. Thus, the number of points of intersection is 1.\n\nB. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\)\n- This circle is a circle centered at the origin with radius \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). The parabola \\(x^2 = y + 4\\) is symmetric about the y-axis, so any point on the parabola will have a corresponding point on the circle that is symmetrically placed with respect to the y-axis. However, since the circle is larger than the parabola, there will be more points of intersection. Specifically, for every point on the parabola, there will be exactly one point on the circle that is symmetrically placed with respect to the y-axis. Thus, the number of points of intersection is 1.\n\nC. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 9\\)\n- This circle is a circle centered at the origin with radius 3. The parabola \\(x^2 = y + 4\\) is symmetric about the y-axis, so any point on the parabola will have a corresponding point on the circle that is symmetrically placed with respect to the y-axis. However, since the circle is larger than the parabola, there will be more points of intersection. Specifically, for every point on the parabola, there will be exactly one point on the circle that is symmetrically placed with respect to the y-axis. Thus, the number of points of intersection is 1.\n\nD. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 16\\)\n- This circle is a circle centered at the origin with radius \\(\\sqrt{16} = 4\\). The parabola \\(x^2 = y + 4\\) is symmetric about the y-axis, so any point on the parabola will have a corresponding point on the circle that is symmetrically placed with respect to the y-axis. However, since the circle is larger than the parabola, there will be more points of intersection. Specifically, for every point on the parabola, there will be exactly one point on the circle that is symmetrically placed with respect to the y-axis. Thus, the number of points of intersection is 1.\n\nComparing the number of points of intersection for each circle, we see that the circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\) has exactly 1 point of intersection with the parabola \\(x^2 = y + 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 1\\)"
