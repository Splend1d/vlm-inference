It displays the final value of `sum`.\n\nGiven the initial list `numList = [0, 1, 4, 5]`, let's calculate the sum:\n\n- `sum \u2190 numList [1] = 1`\n- `sum \u2190 sum + numList [2] = 1 + 1 = 2`\n- `sum \u2190 sum + numList [3] = 2 + 4 = 6`\n- `sum \u2190 sum + numList [4] = 6 + 5 = 11`\n\nSo, the final value of `sum` is 11.\n\nGiven this calculation, the program indeed displays the correct value of 11 for the test case `[0, 1, 4, 5]`.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
