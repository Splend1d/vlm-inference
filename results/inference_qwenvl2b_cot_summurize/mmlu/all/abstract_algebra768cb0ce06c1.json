There are groups of order 4 that are not isomorphic to each other, such as the cyclic group of order 4 and the Klein four-group.\n\nStatement 2 is true. The statement \"If Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n\" is a well-known fact in group theory. This is because the sum of two cyclic groups of the same order is isomorphic to a subgroup of the direct product of the two cyclic groups, and the order of the subgroup is the product of the orders of the cyclic groups. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
