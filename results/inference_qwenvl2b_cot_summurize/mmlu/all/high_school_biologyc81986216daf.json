The dominant allele B codes for black fur, the recessive allele b codes for brown hair. A second gene consisting of two alleles, E and e, codes for the deposition of pigment in the hair. In this case, the alleles for pigment deposition (E or e) are said to be epistatic to the gene that codes for black or brown pigment. If the dominant allele (E) is not present, regardless of the genotype at the black/brown locus, the animal's fur will be yellow.\n\nA. BBEe will be brown.\nB. BbEe will be brown.\nC.
