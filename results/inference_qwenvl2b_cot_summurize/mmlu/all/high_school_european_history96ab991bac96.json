It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nHuizinga's apparent support of Erasmus' belief in the \"book of antiquity\" being \"open to all\" is most likely a product of\n\nA. the author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics\nB. the longevity of Erasmus' works\nC. the Dutch reverence for the works of Erasmus\nD. the typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work\n"

The passage discusses how Erasmus' work, which he dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea, was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and was intended to help authors in writing an elegant Latin style. The passage also mentions that Erasmus' work was more than just a collection of sayings; he introduced the classic spirit among the educated classes, which was previously monopolized by humanists.\n\nThe passage then goes on to discuss how Erasmus' work was a significant contribution to the humanistic movement, as it introduced the classic spirit among the educated classes and made it accessible to a wider audience. It also mentions that Erasmus' work was not exclusive to a few, but rather was widely disseminated and influenced many people.\n\nBased on this information, the most likely reason for Huizinga's apparent support of Erasmus' belief in the \"book of antiquity\" being \"open to all\" is:\n\nD. the typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that Erasmus' work was widely disseminated and supported by other humanists, which Huizinga acknowledges."
