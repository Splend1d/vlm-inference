In this case, the photon is created when an electron is struck by a photon, and the electron and positron pair are created when the photon is destroyed. The energy of the photon is therefore equal to the energy of the electron and positron pair.\n\nThe energy of the electron and positron pair is given by the equation E = (1/2) * m_e * v_e^2 + (1/2) * m_p * v_p^2, where m_e and m_p are the masses of the electron and positron, respectively, and v_e and v_p are their respective velocities.\n\nSince the electron and positron are moving in the same direction, their velocities are equal. Therefore, the total energy of the electron and positron pair is equal to the energy of the photon.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the photon is equal to the energy of the electron and positron pair, which is equal to the energy of the photon itself. Therefore, the correct answer is A. mc^2."
