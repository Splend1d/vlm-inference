The value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies is high.\n\nWhen the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies is high, it means that the dollar is stronger compared to other currencies. This can lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of the dollar, which can have a negative impact on the real GDP of the United States. This is because a stronger dollar makes imported goods more expensive, which can reduce consumer spending and investment, leading to a decrease in real GDP."
