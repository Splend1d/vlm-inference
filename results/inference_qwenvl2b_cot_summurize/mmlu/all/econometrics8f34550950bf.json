(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nAutocorrelated residuals occur when the dependent variable's response to changes in the independent variables is not linear, which can happen due to omitted variables, autocorrelation in the independent variables, or outliers in the data. Slowness of response and over-reactions are also potential causes of autocorrelated residuals, but they are not directly related to the presence of autocorrelation in the independent variables."
