Each student dislikes three of their classmates.\n3. The teams do not need to be equally sized.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Teams and Students**: We need to divide the class into teams such that each student is a member of exactly one team. This means we need to find the minimum number of teams that can accommodate all students without any student being a member of more than one team.\n\n2. **Dislikes**: Each student dislikes three of their classmates. This means we need to find the minimum number of teams such that no student is a member of more than one team and no student dislikes more than three classmates.\n\n3. **Equal Team Size**: The teams do not need to be equally sized. This means we can have teams of different sizes.\n\nLet's consider the minimum number of teams required:\n\n- If we have 1 team, then each student can be a member of that team. This means each student dislikes 3 classmates, which is not possible since each student dislikes exactly 3 classmates.\n- If we have 2 teams, then each student can be a member of one team. This means each student dislikes 2 classmates, which is not possible since each student dislikes exactly 3 classmates.\n- If we have 3 teams, then each student can be a member of one team. This means each student dislikes 1 classmate, which is not possible since each student dislikes exactly 3 classmates.\n- If we have 4 teams, then each student can be a member of one team. This means each student dislikes 0 classmates, which is not possible since each student dislikes exactly 3 classmates.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of teams required is 4.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n**A. 4**"
