The spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt.\nC. Collisions are common in the asteroid belt and we can track the fragments from their source asteroid to the Earth where they become meteorites.\nD. The asteroid belt is the only possible source of meteorites therefore they must originate there.\n"

The spectra of some meteorites are similar to the spectra of asteroids in the asteroid belt.\n\nThis is because the spectra of meteorites and asteroids are similar, which suggests that they are made up of the same materials. This similarity in spectra is a strong indicator that the majority of meteorites come from the asteroid belt."
