People often have a negative perception of their own happiness compared to others, which is a common psychological phenomenon.\n\n(2) In the United States, women's happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men.\n- This statement is false. While women's happiness has increased in the United States, it is not necessarily true that it has increased relative to men. Happiness is a subjective measure, and it can vary from person to person. Therefore, it is possible for women's happiness to increase without necessarily increasing relative to men.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nB. True, False"
