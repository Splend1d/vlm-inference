When the money supply is changed, it affects the interest rates, which in turn affect the spending of individuals and businesses. However, the theory also recognizes that there are many other factors that can affect spending, such as expectations, government policies, and other economic indicators. Therefore, the money supply change can have multiple effects on the economy, not just on interest rates."
