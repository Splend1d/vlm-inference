Since the two piles had an equal number of pins, the number of pins in the other pile is also $x$.\n\nJohn gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. This means he gave his brother $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot x = \\frac{x}{6}$ pins.\n\nAfter giving his brother some pins, John had 66 pins left. This means the number of pins in the other pile is $x - \\frac{x}{6} = \\frac{5x}{6}$.\n\nSince the two piles had an equal number of pins, we can set up the equation $\\frac{5x}{6} = x$.\n\nSolving this equation, we get $5x = 6x$, which simplifies to $x = 0$.
