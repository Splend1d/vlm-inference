Increase in methylation activity.\n\nEukaryotic cells condense coding regions when they are not being expressed, which is typically achieved through methylation of DNA. Methylation is a post-transcriptional modification that can silence genes by preventing transcription. Therefore, increasing methylation activity will usually lead to a decrease in gene expression. \n\nA. Increased histone acetyltransferase activity would increase gene expression by promoting histone acetylation, which is the opposite of methylation.\nB. Decrease in histone deacetyltransferase activity would also increase gene expression by promoting histone deacetylation, which is the opposite of methylation.\nD. Increase in heterochromatin:euchromatin ratio would not directly affect gene expression but could indirectly affect gene expression through changes in transcription factors or chromatin structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
