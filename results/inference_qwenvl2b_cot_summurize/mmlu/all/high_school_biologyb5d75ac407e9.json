When the body is dehydrated, ADH is released to increase the amount of water reabsorbed in the kidneys, which helps to maintain a stable water balance and prevent dehydration. This is an example of maintaining homeostasis, which is the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in the external environment."
