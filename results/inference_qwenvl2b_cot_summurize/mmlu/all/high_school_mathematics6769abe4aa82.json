The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping its numerator and denominator. So, the reciprocal of $-\\frac{6}{5}$ is $-\\frac{5}{6}$.\n\nSo, the fraction on the left side of the equation becomes $-\\frac{18}{7} \\cdot -\\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{18 \\cdot 5}{7 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{90}{42}$.\n\nNow, we can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 21. So, $\\frac{90}{42} = \\frac{90 \\div 21}{42 \\div 21} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nFinally, we can simplify the fraction on the right side of the equation. We can do this by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. So, $\\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4 \\div 3}{3 \\div 3} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{7}}$. The answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{7}}$"
