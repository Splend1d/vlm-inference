This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. 4, 7\n- The sum of 4 and 7 is 11, which is greater than 10. Therefore, this pair could be the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nB. 5, 5\n- The sum of 5 and 5 is 10, which is equal to 10. Therefore, this pair cannot be the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nC. 3, 9\n- The sum of 3 and 9 is 12, which is greater than 10. Therefore, this pair could be the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nD. 9, 8\n- The sum of 9 and 8 is 17, which is greater than 10. Therefore, this pair could be the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nTherefore, the pair that could not be the lengths of the other two sides is B. 5, 5."
