The government increases spending matched with an increase in taxes.\n\nWhen the economy is experiencing an inflationary gap, it indicates that the economy is producing more goods and services than it is consuming, leading to a surplus of goods and services. To address this surplus, the government can increase spending to reduce the surplus and stimulate economic growth. At the same time, it can increase taxes to reduce the amount of money in circulation and reduce inflation. This combination of increased spending and increased taxes is likely to be most effective in reducing the inflationary gap."
