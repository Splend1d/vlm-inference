This means that if we start at any vertex and follow the edges in the direction of the circuit, we will end up back at the starting vertex.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. A complete graph with 12 vertices: A complete graph with 12 vertices has 11 edges (since each vertex is connected to every other vertex). An Euler circuit must have exactly 11 edges. Therefore, this graph must have an Euler circuit.\n\nII. A complete graph with 13 vertices: A complete graph with 13 vertices has 12 edges (since each vertex is connected to every other vertex). An Euler circuit must have exactly 12 edges. Therefore, this graph must have an Euler circuit.\n\nIII. A tree with 13 vertices: A tree with 13 vertices is a connected graph with 12 edges (since each vertex is connected to every other vertex). An Euler circuit must have exactly 12 edges. Therefore, this graph must have an Euler circuit.\n\nTherefore, all three graphs must have an Euler circuit.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. I and II"
