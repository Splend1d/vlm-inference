The radius of the inscribed circle in an equilateral triangle is given by $r = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{6}$, where $r$ is the radius of the inscribed circle and $s$ is the side length of the triangle.\n\nGiven that $r = 2$, we can solve for $s$:\n\n\\[2 = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{6}\\]\n\n\\[12 = s\\sqrt{3}\\]\n\n\\[s = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}} = 4\\sqrt{3}\\]\n\nNow that we have the side length $s$, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:\n\n\\[A = \\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{(4\\sqrt{3})^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{48\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 12\\sqrt{3}\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the equilateral triangle is $12\\sqrt{3}$, which corresponds to answer choice C."
