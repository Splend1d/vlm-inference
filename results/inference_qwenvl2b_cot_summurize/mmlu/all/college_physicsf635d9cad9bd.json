The wavelength of the hydrogen lines is longer in the quasar's spectrum than in the laboratory spectrum, indicating that the quasar is moving away from Earth.\n\nThe wavelength of a line in a spectrum is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{c}{v} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength, \\( c \\) is the speed of light, and \\( v \\) is the velocity of the object.\n\nIn this case, the wavelength of the hydrogen lines in the quasar's spectrum is three times longer than in the laboratory spectrum. Therefore, the velocity of the quasar relative to Earth is:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{3c}{c} = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the relative speed of the quasar is 3 times the speed of light, which is:\n\n\\[ 3c \\]\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 2c"
