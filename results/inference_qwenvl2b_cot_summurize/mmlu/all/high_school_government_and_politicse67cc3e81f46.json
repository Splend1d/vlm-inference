Party activists, whose political participation is disproportionate to their numbers, tend to be very conservative.\n\nThis statement is supported by the fact that Republican candidates who tend to be more successful in the primaries often align more closely with the conservative wing of the party. This is because the primary system incentivizes candidates to appeal to the most conservative voters, who are more likely to support them in the general election. Therefore, the more successful candidates are more likely to be conservative because they are more likely to appeal to the party's base."
