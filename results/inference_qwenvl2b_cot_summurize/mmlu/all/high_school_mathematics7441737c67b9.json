This means that the distance Alex walks to place each stone is $3 + 2(2) + 2(3) + \\ldots + 2(50)$.\nThis is an arithmetic series with first term $3$, common difference $2$, and $50$ terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula $S = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a$ is the first term, and $l$ is the last term.\nThe last term of the series is $3 + 2(50) = 3 + 100 = 103$.\nThe number of terms is $50$.\nSo the sum of the series is $S = \\frac{50}{2}(3 + 103) = 25 \\cdot 106 = 2650$.\nAdding the distance Alex walks to place the first stone, which is $3$, we get the total distance Alex walked is $2650 + 3 = 2653$.\nThe answer is: $B$"
