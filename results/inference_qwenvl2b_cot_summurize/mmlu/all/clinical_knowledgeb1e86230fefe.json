Pressure in the root of the neck reduces the impulse\n\nA pulsation in the neck is often caused by an arterial pulsation, which is a wave-like movement of blood in the arteries. This pulsation can be felt as a waggling of the earlobe or a change in the size of the neck veins. However, the presence of a pulsation in the neck does not necessarily indicate that it is caused by an arterial pulsation. Other factors, such as the presence of a heart murmur or the use of certain medications, can also cause a pulsation in the neck."
