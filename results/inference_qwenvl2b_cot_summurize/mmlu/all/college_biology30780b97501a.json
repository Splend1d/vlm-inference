The key feature is that they store CO2 as phosphoglycolate, which is a 5-carbon compound.\n\n2. **CAM Plants**: These plants are adapted to low light conditions and are known for their ability to fix CO2 in the mesophyll and then convert it into glucose through the Calvin cycle. The key feature is that they store CO2 as ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate (Ru5P), which is a 5-carbon compound.\n\nNow, let's compare these two strategies:\n\n- **C4 plants**: Fix CO2 in the mesophyll and convert it into glucose.\n- **CAM plants**: Fix CO2 in the mesophyll and convert it into glucose.\n\nThe correct comparison is:\n\n**C. C4 plants fix CO2 in the bundle sheath but carry out the Calvin cycle in the mesophyll, while CAM plants fix CO2 and carry out the Calvin cycle in the bundle sheath.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
