How does the soap help submerge the leaf disks?\n\nA. The soap molecules enter through the stomata of the leaf and bond to oxygen molecules.\nB. The soap molecules bond to air bubbles on the surface of the leaf and remove them.\nC. The soap molecules decrease the pH of the water, allowing excess H+ to bond to the leaf surface.\nD. The hydrophobic regions of the soap molecules attach to the waxy leaf surface, while the hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules.\n"

The hydrophobic regions of the soap molecules attach to the waxy leaf surface, while the hydrophilic regions form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules.\n\nWhen a drop of soap is added to water, the soap molecules tend to form hydrogen bonds with the water molecules, which helps to create a thin, slippery film on the surface of the water. This film prevents the water from evaporating and allows the leaf disks to be submerged more easily. The soap molecules also have hydrophobic regions that attach to the waxy surface of the leaf, preventing the leaf from sticking to the water."
