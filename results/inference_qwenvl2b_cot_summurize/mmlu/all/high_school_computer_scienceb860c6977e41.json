Lossless compression\n\nHuffman coding is an efficient method for lossless compression, where the frequency of occurrence of each input value is used to determine the length of the code assigned to that value. This allows for the most frequent values to be represented with the shortest codes, while less frequent values are represented with longer codes. This results in a more compact representation of the input data, which can be used to compress the data without losing any information."
