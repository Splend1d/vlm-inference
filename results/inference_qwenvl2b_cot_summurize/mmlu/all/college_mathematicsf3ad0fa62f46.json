The trace of A^2 is nonnegative.\n- The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal entries. For a matrix A, the trace of A^2 is the sum of the squares of its diagonal entries. Since the diagonal entries of A^2 are the squares of the diagonal entries of A, and the squares of non-negative numbers are non-negative, the trace of A^2 is nonnegative.\n\nII. If A^2 = A, then the trace of A is nonnegative.\n- If A^2 = A, then A is the identity matrix. The trace of the identity matrix is 1, which is nonnegative.\n\nIII. The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B.\n- The trace of a product of matrices is the sum of the traces of the matrices. If A and B are n \u00d7 n matrices, then the trace of AB is the sum of the traces of A and B. This is because the trace of a matrix is a linear function of its entries, and the trace of a product of matrices is the sum of the traces of the matrices.\n\nTherefore, the statements that are true are:\n\nI. The trace of A^2 is nonnegative.\nII. If A^2 = A, then the trace of A is nonnegative.\nIII. The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B.\n\nThe correct answer is C."
