The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\nHBr + KOH \u2192 KBr + H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of HBr reacts with 1 mole of KOH to produce 1 mole of KBr and 1 mole of H2O. Therefore, the reaction is 1:1 in stoichiometry.\n\nThe pH of a solution is determined by the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+), which is the conjugate base of H+ in a weak acid. In this case, the weak acid is HBr, so the pH of the solution is determined by the concentration of H+ ions.\n\nThe pH of a solution can be calculated using the following formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\nwhere [H+] is the concentration of H+ ions in moles per liter.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. The concentration of HBr is 0.0025 M, and the concentration of KOH is 0.0023 M. The total volume of the solution is 100 mL (50 mL of HBr + 50 mL of KOH). Therefore, the concentration of H+ ions is:\n\n[H+] = (0.0025 M + 0.0023 M) / (0.100 L) = 0.0038 M\n\nNow we can calculate the pH of the solution:\n\npH = -log[H+] = -log(0.0038) = 1.7\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting mixture is 1.7, which is closest to option A."
