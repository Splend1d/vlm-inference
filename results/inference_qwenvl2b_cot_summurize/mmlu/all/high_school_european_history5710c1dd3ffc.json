Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I. Lenin Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U., November 19,1928\nWhich of the following events was most likely the greatest influence on Lenin in his desire to industrialize his new nation?\n\nA. His exile in Switzerland and other places led him to see how the industrialization of the West was needed in the Soviet Union.\nB. Russia had a large percentage of its population working in factories before the revolution occurred, and he wanted to build on that.\nC. Trotsky was able to lead the Bolshevik revolt in 1917 because he had control of the rail and telegraph stations.\nD. The humiliating defeat of Russia during the First World War had led to his rise to power and he knew another defeat would spell his doom.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which event was most likely the greatest influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize his new nation, let's analyze each option in the context of the given information:\n\n1. **His exile in Switzerland and other places led him to see how the industrialization of the West was needed in the Soviet Union.**\n   - This option suggests that Lenin was influenced by the industrialization efforts of other countries, particularly the West. However, the information provided does not specifically mention any Western influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize.\n\n2. **Russia had a large percentage of its population working in factories before the revolution occurred, and he wanted to build on that.**\n   - This option implies that the industrialization of Russia was already underway before the revolution, and Lenin wanted to continue this trend. However, the information does not provide any details about the industrialization of Russia before the revolution.\n\n3. **Trotsky was able to lead the Bolshevik revolt in 1917 because he had control of the rail and telegraph stations.**\n   - This option suggests that Trotsky's role in the Bolshevik revolution was crucial in gaining control of the rail and telegraph stations, which could have been a significant factor in Lenin's desire to industrialize. However, the information does not provide any specific details about Trotsky's role in this context.\n\n4. **The humiliating defeat of Russia during the First World War had led to his rise to power and he knew another defeat would spell his doom.**\n   - This option implies that the humiliation of Russia during the First World War influenced Lenin's desire to industrialize. However, the information does not provide any specific details about the First World War or its impact on Lenin's desire to industrialize.\n\nGiven the information provided, the most likely influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize was the need to build on the industrialization efforts of the West. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. His exile in Switzerland and other places led him to see how the industrialization of the West was needed in the Soviet Union.**"
