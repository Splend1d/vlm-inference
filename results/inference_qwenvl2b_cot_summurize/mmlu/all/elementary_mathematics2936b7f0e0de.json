When rounding to the nearest 10, we look at the tens digit. If the tens digit is 5 or more, we round up; if it's less than 5, we round down.\n\nGiven that the rounded number is 400, the tens digit is 4. According to the rounding rule, if the tens digit is 5 or more, we round up. Therefore, the actual number of runners must be at least 50 more than 400.\n\nLet's calculate the actual number of runners:\n\n\\[400 + 50 = 450\\]\n\nSo, the actual number of runners could be 450. Among the given options, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 406"
