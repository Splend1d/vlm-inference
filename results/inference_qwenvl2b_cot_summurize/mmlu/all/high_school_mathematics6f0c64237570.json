So, if we consider triangle $ABC$, the sum of angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $180^\\circ$.\n\nWe know that angle $A$ is $110^\\circ$, so the sum of angles $B$ and $C$ is $180^\\circ - 110^\\circ = 70^\\circ$.\n\nSince angle $C$ is opposite to angle $B$, the measure of angle $C$ is equal to the measure of angle $B$, which is $110^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the number of degrees in the measure of angle $C$ is $\\boxed{110}$."
