Each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak as the drought persisted.\n\nDuring prolonged droughts, finches on the island of Daphne Major may have evolved deeper and stronger beaks to better withstand the harsh conditions. This adaptation would have been crucial for their survival, as the beak size would have provided them with the necessary strength to crack open seeds and access food sources in the scarce environment."
