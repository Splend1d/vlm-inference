It is too small to have been hit during the Late Heavy Bombardment\nC. Jupiter's strong gravity attracted the planetesimals more strongly than Io and thus none landed on its surface.\nD. Any craters that existed have been eroded through the strong winds on Io's surface.\n"

Any craters that existed have been eroded through the strong winds on Io's surface.\n\nIo is a moon of Jupiter, and it has a very active surface due to the strong winds and volcanic activity. These strong winds can erode any craters that may have formed on the surface. Therefore, the impact craters on Io are not visible on the surface today."
