                    "text": "The ideal pulley system is a system where the force applied by the person pulling the rope is equal to the force that the rope exerts on the crate. In this case, the force applied by the person pulling the rope is 25 N, and the force that the rope exerts on the crate is 100 N. Therefore, the ratio of the force applied by the person to the force that the rope exerts on the crate is 25 N : 100 N = 1 : 4.\nTo find the length of rope that is pulled down for every 1-m length of rope that is raised, we can use the formula for the ratio of the lengths of the rope that is pulled down to the length of the rope that is raised. This formula is:\nL = L1 / L2\nwhere L is the length of the rope that is pulled down, L1 is the length of the rope that is raised, and L2 is the ratio of the force applied by the person to the force that the rope exerts on the crate.\nPlugging in the values we know, we get:\nL = 1 / 4 = 0.25 m\nTherefore, the length of rope that is pulled down for every 1-m length of rope that is raised is 0.25 m, or 25 cm.\nThe correct answer is A. 25 cm."
