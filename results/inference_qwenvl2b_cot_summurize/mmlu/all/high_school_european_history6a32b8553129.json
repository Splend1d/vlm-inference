One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given?\n\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\nB. Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.\nD. Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which Enlightenment philosopher questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given, let's analyze the context and the core of the quote provided by Voltaire.\n\nThe quote by Voltaire is from 1755 and discusses the devastating effects of the Lisbon earthquake on the human population. Voltaire argues that the destruction caused by the earthquake is a result of the laws of nature, which he finds to be cruel. He compares the destruction to the crushing of ants in an ant hill, which he finds to be a painful and unspeakable experience. He also mentions the ruin of families and businesses in Europe, as well as the fate of the Inquisition palace, which he believes was crushed like others.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\n   - Rousseau's ideas were more about the social and political aspects of society rather than the natural laws and their impact on human life.\n\nB. Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.\n   - Montesquieu's work was more about the principles of government and the need for a fair and just society, rather than the impact of natural laws on human life.\n\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.\n   - Wollstonecraft's work was more focused on women's rights and the subjugation of women, rather than the natural laws and their impact on human life.\n\nD. Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels.\n   - Adam Smith's work was more about the principles of free trade and the role of reason in economic analysis, rather than the impact of natural laws on human life.\n\nGiven the context and the core of the quote, Voltaire is questioning the reliance on reason and the impact of natural laws on human life. This aligns with the ideas of the Enlightenment, which emphasized the importance of reason and the role of human reason in understanding the world.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels."
