Nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction converting an ester to an anhydride.\n\nIn this reaction, the ester (an ester is a compound that contains an alcohol and a carboxylic acid group) is converted into an anhydride, which is a compound that contains a carboxylic acid group and a hydroxyl group (OH group). This reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction, where a nucleophile (a molecule that donates a proton) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester, forming an anhydride. The Rf value of the products (the anhydride) is significantly higher than that of the reactants (the ester), which is a characteristic of this type of reaction."
