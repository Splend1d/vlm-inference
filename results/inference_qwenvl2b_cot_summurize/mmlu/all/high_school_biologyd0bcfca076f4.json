The presence of a notochord in all chordate embryos.\n\nConvergent evolution is the process by which organisms with similar functions or adaptations evolve in similar ways, even though they have different anatomies and environments. The notochord is a structure that is present in all chordate embryos, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. This structure is crucial for the development of the vertebral column and is present in all chordates, which is why it is a good example of convergent evolution."
