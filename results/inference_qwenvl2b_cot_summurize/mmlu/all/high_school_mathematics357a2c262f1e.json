The order in which these teachers speak matters, so we need to consider the permutations of these choices.\n\nThe number of ways to choose one teacher to speak as the opener is 85, the number of ways to choose one teacher to speak as the name-reader is 84, and the number of ways to choose one teacher to speak as the closer is 83.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange these three teachers is the product of the number of ways to choose each teacher, which is $85 \\times 84 \\times 83$.\n\nSo, the number of possible speaking lineups is $85 \\times 84 \\times 83 = 614,126$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{614,126}$.
