The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula \\(P = 2l + 2w\\), where \\(l\\) is the length and \\(w\\) is the width of the rectangle. Given that the total fencing is \\(x\\) feet, we have:\n\n\\[2l + 2w = x\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[l + w = \\frac{x}{2}\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of the rectangle is given by \\(A = l \\times w\\). We can express \\(w\\) in terms of \\(l\\) using the perimeter equation:\n\n\\[w = \\frac{x}{2} - l\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the area formula gives:\n\n\\[A = l \\times \\left(\\frac{x}{2} - l\\right) = \\frac{x^2}{2} - l^2\\]\n\nTo find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(l\\) and set it equal to zero:\n\n\\[\\frac{dA}{dl} = \\frac{x}{2} - 2l = 0\\]\n\nSolving for \\(l\\), we get:\n\n\\[2l = \\frac{x}{2}\\]\n\n\\[l = \\frac{x}{4}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(l\\) back into the area formula gives:\n\n\\[A = \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^2}{16} = \\frac{16x^2 - x^2}{16} = \\frac{15x^2}{16}\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible area of the yard, in terms of \\(x\\), is \\(\\frac{15x^2}{16}\\), which corresponds to option C."
