The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. \n\nThe atomic number of Cr is 24. \n\nNow, let's calculate the number of electrons, neutrons, and protons:\n\n1. **Electrons**: The atomic number of Cr is 24, which means there are 24 electrons in the nucleus of an atom of Cr.\n\n2. **Protons**: The atomic number of Cr is 24, which means there are 24 protons in the nucleus of an atom of Cr.\n\n3. **Neutrons**: The atomic number of Cr is 24, which means there are 24 neutrons in the nucleus of an atom of Cr.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 24 electrons, 24 protons, 24 neutrons"
