If either George enrolls or Harry enrolls.\n2. Then Ira does not enroll.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. (G \u2283 H) \u2228 I\n- This option suggests that if George enrolls, then Ira enrolls. This does not capture the logical implication that if either George or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll.\n\nB.

This captures the logical implication that if either George or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll.\n\nC. (G \u2283 H) \u2228 ~I\n- This option suggests that if George enrolls, then Ira enrolls.
