However, if we assume that the total number of children is 100 (for simplicity), we can calculate the percentage as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{100}{100} \\right) \\times 100 = 100\\% \\]\n\nThis means that 100% of the children reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 98%"
