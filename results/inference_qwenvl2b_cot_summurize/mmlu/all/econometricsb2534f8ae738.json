(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nA standard GARCH(1,1) model captures the following features of financial asset return time-series:\n\ni) Fat tails in the return distribution: The GARCH model allows for the possibility of fat tails in the return distribution, which means that extreme events (such as large positive or negative returns) are more likely to occur than in a normal distribution.\n\nii) Leverage effects: The GARCH model can capture leverage effects, which are the effects of leverage on the volatility of the asset. This means that the volatility of the asset is influenced by its leverage ratio.\n\niii) Volatility clustering: The GARCH model can capture volatility clustering, which is the tendency for volatility to be higher in certain periods than in others. This can be due to factors such as market news, economic events, or other external shocks.\n\niv) Volatility affecting returns: The GARCH model can capture volatility affecting returns, which means that the volatility of the asset affects its returns. This can be due to factors such as the correlation between the asset and other assets, or the volatility of the asset itself.\n\nTherefore, all of these features can be captured by a standard GARCH(1,1) model."
