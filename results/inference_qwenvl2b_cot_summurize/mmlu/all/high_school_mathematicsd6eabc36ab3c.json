We are given that $a=7$ and $b=13$, so $ab = 7 \\times 13 = 91$.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of even positive integers less than $91$. An even number is any integer that is divisible by 2. So, we need to find the number of integers from 1 to 91 that are divisible by 2.\n\nThe number of integers from 1 to 91 that are divisible by 2 is $\\frac{91}{2} = 45.5$. But we are only interested in the number of even integers, so we need to take the floor of this value, which is 45.\n\nTherefore, the number of even positive integers less than $91$ is 45.\n\nThe answer is $\\boxed{45}$."
