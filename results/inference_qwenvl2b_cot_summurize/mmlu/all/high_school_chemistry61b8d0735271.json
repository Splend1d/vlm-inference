The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\n\n\\[ 2Rb + 2Br_2 \\rightarrow 2RbBr \\]\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of rubidium react with 2 moles of bromine to produce 2 moles of rubidium bromide. Therefore, the stoichiometry of the reaction is 2:2:2.\n\nGiven that 1.0 g of rubidium and 1.0 g of bromine are reacted, we can calculate the moles of each reactant:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of Rubidium} = \\frac{1.0 \\text{ g}}{8.0 \\text{ g/mol}} = 0.125 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Moles of Bromine} = \\frac{1.0 \\text{ g}}{80.0 \\text{ g/mol}} = 0.0125 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nSince the stoichiometry of the reaction is 2:2:2, we can determine the moles of each product:\n\n\\[ \\text{Moles of RbBr} = \\frac{2}{2} \\times 0.125 \\text{ mol} = 0.125 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Moles of Br2} = \\frac{2}{2} \\times 0.0125 \\text{ mol} = 0.0125 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the mass of each product:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of RbBr} = 0.125 \\text{ mol} \\times 80.0 \\text{ g/mol} = 10.0 \\text{ g} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Mass of Br2} = 0.0125 \\text{ mol} \\times 180.0 \\text{ g/mol} = 2.25 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nSince the mass of RbBr is 10.0 g and the mass of Br2 is 2.25 g, the total mass of RbBr and Br2 is:\n\n\\[ 10.0 \\text{ g} + 2.25 \\text{ g} = 12.25 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total mass of RbBr and Br2 in the reaction vessel is 12.25 g, which is more than 0.10 mg. The correct answer is:\n\nC. RbBr and Br2 only"
