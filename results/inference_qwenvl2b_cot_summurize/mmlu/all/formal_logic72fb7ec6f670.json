England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\n2. China promotes human rights.\n3. South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.\n\nThe sentence can be symbolized as:\n(E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n- This option suggests that either England's importing beef is necessary for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds. This option captures the essence of the sentence.\n\nB. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2261 C)\n- This option suggests that France's subsidizing agriculture is necessary for England's importing beef, or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds. This option does not capture the essence of the sentence.\n\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (S \u2283 ~C)\n- This option suggests that England's importing beef is necessary for France's subsidizing agriculture, or South Africa doesn't supply diamonds given that China promotes human rights. This option does not capture the essence of the sentence.\n\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2283 C)\n- This option suggests that France's subsidizing agriculture is necessary for England's importing beef, or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds. This option does not capture the essence of the sentence.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A best symbolizes the given sentence.\n\nFinal answer: A. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)"
