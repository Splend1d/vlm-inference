Since the gravitational force is the same for both rocks, the net force is also the same, and therefore the acceleration is the same.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The force due to gravity is the same on each rock.\n This is true, but it is not the reason why the acceleration is the same.\n\nB. Air resistance is always zero in free fall.\n This is not necessarily true. Air resistance can be significant in free fall, especially for objects with high speeds.\n\nC. Inertia of both rocks is the same.\n This is not necessarily true. The inertia of an object is related to its mass, but the acceleration is determined by the net force acting on the object, which is the difference between the gravitational force and any other forces acting on the object. Since the gravitational force is the same for both rocks, the net force is the same, and therefore the acceleration is the same.\n\nD.
