Either England's not importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\n2. Or China promotes human rights if and only if South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. (F \u2283 ~E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n- This option states that if England is not importing beef, then France subsidizing agriculture is a necessary condition. It also states that if China promotes human rights, then South Africa doesn't supply diamonds. This option does not capture the essence of the sentence.\n\nB. (~E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 ~S)\n- This option states that if England is not importing beef, then France subsidizing agriculture is a necessary condition. It also states that if China promotes human rights, then South Africa doesn't supply diamonds. This option does not capture the essence of the sentence.\n\nC. ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2283 C)\n- This option states that if England is not importing beef, then France subsidizing agriculture is not a necessary condition. It also states that if China promotes human rights, then South Africa doesn't supply diamonds. This option does not capture the essence of the sentence.\n\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n- This option states that if England is importing beef, then France subsidizing agriculture is a necessary condition. It also states that if China promotes human rights, then South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.
