It causes pain and tingling in the medial three and half digits\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that occurs when the median nerve is compressed in the carpal tunnel, a small space between the bones of the wrist. It can cause pain and tingling in the median nerve distribution, which includes the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers. Paraesthesia, or tingling or numbness, is more common during the day and can be worse in the morning. It is not caused by rheumatoid arthritis or compression of the ulna nerve."
