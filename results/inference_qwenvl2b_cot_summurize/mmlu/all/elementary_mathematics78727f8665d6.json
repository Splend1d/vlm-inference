To convert this to hours, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ hour} \\times 60 = 30 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSince she spent 30 minutes on science, we can divide this by the number of subjects to find the time spent on each subject:\n\n\\[ \\frac{30 \\text{ minutes}}{\\text{number of subjects}} = 1 \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nSince 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can convert this back to hours:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{1}{60} \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nThis means Keri spent \\(\\frac{1}{60}\\) hour on each subject. Since she spent 3 hours on her homework in total, we can find the number of subjects by dividing the total time by the time spent on each subject:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\text{ hours}}{\\frac{1}{60} \\text{ hour/subject}} = 3 \\times 60 = 180 \\text{ subjects} \\]\n\nTherefore, Keri studied 180 subjects, which corresponds to option D."
