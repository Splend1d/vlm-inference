If A and C are connected, it means that there exists a continuous function \\( f: A \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( f(A) \\) is connected. Since \\( A \\subset B \\) and \\( B \\subset C \\), we can apply the connectedness of \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) to conclude that \\( B \\) must also be connected.\n\n2. **Statement II: If A and C are compact, then B is compact.**\n   - Compactness is a topological property. If A and C are compact, it means that there exists a continuous function \\( f: A \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) such that \\( f(A) \\) is compact. Since \\( A \\subset B \\) and \\( B \\subset C \\), we can apply the compactness of \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) to conclude that \\( B \\) must also be compact.\n\n3. **Statement III: If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.**\n   - Hausdorffness is a topological property. If A and C are Hausdorff, it means that for any two distinct points \\( x, y \\in A \\), there exist disjoint open sets \\( U_x \\) and \\( V_y \\) such that \\( x \\in U_x \\) and \\( y \\in V_y \\). Since \\( A \\subset B \\) and \\( B \\subset C \\), we can apply the Hausdorffness of \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) to conclude that \\( B \\) must also be Hausdorff.\n\nTherefore, the statements that are true are:\n\n**I. If A and C are connected, then B is connected.**\n**II. If A and C are compact, then B is compact.**\n**III. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.**\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n**D.
