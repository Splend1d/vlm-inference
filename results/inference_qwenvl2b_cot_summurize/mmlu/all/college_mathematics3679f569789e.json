There is a rearrangement a_i_k of the terms such that \u2211 a_i_k = 4\" is not necessarily true. The divergence of the series \u2211|a_i| does not necessarily imply that the series \u2211 a_i = 2 will converge or diverge. The rearrangement of the terms a_i_k does not necessarily result in a series \u2211 a_i_k = 4.\n\nStatement 2 is true. The statement \"There exists metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT \u201cclosed and bounded\u201d\" is true. This is because a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y can map a closed and bounded set X to a set that is not closed and bounded. For example, if X is the closed interval [0, 1] and Y is the open interval (0, 1), then f(x) = x for all x in X, and f(X) = (0, 1), which is not closed and bounded.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, False."
