Multiplying both sides by 2 gives \\( 2A^2v = 2\\lambda v \\). This is not necessarily true because \\( 2A^2v \\) is not necessarily equal to \\( 2\\lambda v \\) unless \\( \\lambda \\) is a scalar multiple of 2.\n\n**Option II: \\( v \\) is also an eigenvector of \\( A^2 \\).**\n- If \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A \\), then \\( A^2v = \\lambda v \\). Multiplying both sides by \\( A \\) gives \\( A(A^2v) = A(\\lambda v) = \\lambda A^2v \\). This is not necessarily true because \\( A(A^2v) \\) is not necessarily equal to \\( \\lambda A^2v \\) unless \\( \\lambda \\) is a scalar multiple of 1.\n\n**Option III: \\( v \\) is also an eigenvector of \\( A^{-1} \\).**\n- If \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A \\), then \\( A^{-1}Av = v \\). Multiplying both sides by \\( A^{-1} \\) gives \\( (A^{-1})^2v = (A^{-1})A^2v = v \\). This is necessarily true because \\( (A^{-1})^2v \\) is equal to \\( v \\) if \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. III only**"
