It would rise less quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude\n\nA leverage effect in a model would imply that the impact of a disturbance on the model's output is not symmetric around zero. In other words, the model's output would be more sensitive to negative disturbances than to positive ones of the same magnitude. Therefore, the news impact curve would rise less quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude."
