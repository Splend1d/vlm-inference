This is because the order of the factor group is the smallest positive integer n such that the group operation is well-defined for all elements in the factor group. In this case, the group operation is the direct product of the two cyclic groups Z_11 and Z_15, and the order of the direct product is the product of the orders of the two groups. Since the order of Z_11 is 11 and the order of Z_15 is 15, the order of the direct product is 11 x 15 = 165. However, since the group operation is well-defined for all elements in the factor group, the order of the factor group is the smallest positive integer n such that the group operation is well-defined for all elements in the factor group. In this case, the order of the factor group is 11, because the group operation is well-defined for all elements in the factor group. Therefore, the answer is D. 11."
