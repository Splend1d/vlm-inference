Why?\n\nA. Fluorine has a very high electronegativity; therefore the H-F bond is stronger than any other H-X bond.\nB. HF is smaller than any other H-X molecule; therefore it exhibits stronger London dispersion forces.\nC. The dipoles in a HF molecule exhibit a particularly strong attraction force to the dipoles in other HF molecules.\nD. The H-F bond is the most ionic in character compared to all other hydrogen halides.\n"

Fluorine has a very high electronegativity; therefore the H-F bond is stronger than any other H-X bond.\n\nThe electronegativity of fluorine (F) is much higher than that of hydrogen (H), which means that the F-H bond is more polar and stronger than the H-X bonds for other halogen atoms (X). This is because the electronegativity difference between fluorine and hydrogen is greater than the electronegativity differences between hydrogen and other halogen atoms. As a result, the H-F bond is stronger than the H-X bonds for all other halogen atoms, including those that are gases at the same temperature as HF."
