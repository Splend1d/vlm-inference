This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.\n\u2014John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545\nWhich of the following justifications used by Protestant reformers such as Calvin is alluded to above?\n\nA. They believed that their church should not be subordinate to the state.\nB. The corruption of the Roman Catholic Church and its leaders meant that reform was needed.\nC. Religion was used to challenge the authority of earthly monarchs.\nD. The concept that salvation comes from faith alone rather than through good works is supported.\n"

The justification used by Protestant reformers such as Calvin is alluded to in option D: the concept that salvation comes from faith alone rather than through good works.\n\nCalvin argues that God does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others. This is a justification for the concept of predestination, which holds that God predestines some to salvation while others are destined for damnation. This idea is often associated with the idea that salvation comes from faith alone, rather than through good works.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The concept that salvation comes from faith alone rather than through good works is supported."
