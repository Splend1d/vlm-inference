This is because the government is reducing its borrowing, which reduces the demand for money and lowers interest rates. As a result, businesses and consumers may find it more affordable to borrow money, which can lead to increased spending and economic growth.\n\nHowever, if the government continues to use the surplus to pay down debt without increasing taxes or reducing spending, it could lead to a situation where the government is running a budget deficit again. This could result in higher interest rates and potentially lead to inflation, as the government's ability to print money to finance its deficit could be limited by the supply of money in the economy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. decrease interest rates and risk an inflationary period."
