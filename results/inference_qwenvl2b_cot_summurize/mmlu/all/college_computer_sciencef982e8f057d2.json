They are not designed to be shared across multiple users. Therefore, this option is not necessarily true.\n\n2. **Option II: The program is recursive.**\n   - Recursive programs can be shared across multiple users if they are designed to be shared. Recursive programs can be implemented in a way that allows them to be accessed and modified by multiple users without causing conflicts. This is because recursive programs can be decomposed into smaller, independent tasks that can be executed concurrently. Therefore, this option is likely true.\n\n3. **Option III: The program is reentrant.**\n   - Reentrant programs are those that can be executed in parallel without blocking each other. They are designed to be executed concurrently and can be shared across multiple users without causing conflicts. This is because reentrant programs can be executed in parallel, and each user can execute the program independently without interfering with each other. Therefore, this option is likely true.\n\nGiven this analysis, the options that must be true for a single copy of a program to be shared by several users in a multiprogrammed system are:\n\n- Option II: The program is recursive.\n- Option III: The program is reentrant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
