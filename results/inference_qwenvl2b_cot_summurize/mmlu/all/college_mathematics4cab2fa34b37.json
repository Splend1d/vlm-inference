This is a classic problem of combinations with repetition, which can be solved using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of ways} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the total number of items to choose from, \\(r\\) is the number of items to choose, and \\(n!\\) denotes the factorial of \\(n\\).\n\nIn this case, \\(n = 20\\) (the number of courses) and \\(r = 2\\) (the number of professors). Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of ways} = \\frac{20!}{2!(20-2)!} = \\frac{20!}{2! \\cdot 18!} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{20 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 18!}{2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 18!} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{20 \\cdot 19}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ = 10 \\cdot 19 \\]\n\n\\[ = 190 \\]\n\nSo, the number of different complete assignments of the 10 professors to the 20 courses is 190.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. 20!/2^(10)"
