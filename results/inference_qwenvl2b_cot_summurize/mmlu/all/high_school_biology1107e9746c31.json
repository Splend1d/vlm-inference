Characteristics acquired during an organism's life are generally not passed on through genes.\nB. Spontaneous mutations can result in the appearance of new traits.\nC. Only favorable adaptations have survival value.\nD. Disuse of an organ may lead to its eventual disappearance.\n"

The giraffe's ability to stretch its neck is an example of an acquired trait that is not passed on through genes."
