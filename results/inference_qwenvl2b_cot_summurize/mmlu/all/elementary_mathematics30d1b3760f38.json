Since the number is less than 80 and greater than 70, the tens place must be 7 or 8.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. 71: This is less than 80 and greater than 70, with a ones place of 1.\nB. 73: This is less than 80 and greater than 70, with a ones place of 3.\nC. 77: This is greater than 70 and less than 80, with a ones place of 7.\nD. 79: This is greater than 70 and less than 80, with a ones place of 9.\n\nSince the number must be less than 80 and greater than 70, and considering the options, the only number that fits this criterion is:\n\nC. 77\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 77."
