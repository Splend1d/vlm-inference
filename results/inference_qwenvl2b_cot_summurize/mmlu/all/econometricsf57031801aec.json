Heteroscedasticity refers to the situation where the variance of the errors (the differences between the observed and predicted values) is not constant across different levels of the independent variables. This can occur when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is not linear or when there are other factors influencing the errors that are not accounted for in the model."
