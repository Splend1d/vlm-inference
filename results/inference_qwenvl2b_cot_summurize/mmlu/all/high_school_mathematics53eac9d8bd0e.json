So, when the angle is 110 degrees, it means that the hour hand has moved 110/30 = 3.6666666666666665 hours. Since the hour hand moves 12 hours in a day, the number of hours the hour hand moved is 3.6666666666666665 * 12 = 41.999999999999994 hours. Since the minute hand moves 60 minutes in an hour, the number of minutes the minute hand moved is 41.999999999999994 * 60 = 2519.9999999999994 minutes. Since the minute hand and hour hand move at the same rate, the number of minutes the minute hand moved is the same as the number of minutes the hour hand moved. Therefore, the number of minutes the minute hand moved is 2519.9999999999994 minutes. Since the minute hand and hour hand move at the same rate, the number of minutes the minute hand moved is the same as the number of minutes the hour hand moved.
