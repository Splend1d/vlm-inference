Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide 210 by 7 to find the number of complete weeks and the remainder:\n\n\\[210 \\div 7 = 30\\] weeks with a remainder of \\(0\\).\n\nThis means April 1st is exactly 30 days after February 1st, which is a Monday.\n\nTherefore, the next day of the week after April 1st will be:\n\nA.
