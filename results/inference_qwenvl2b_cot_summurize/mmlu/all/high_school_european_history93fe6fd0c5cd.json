This society is ripe for change. It has long been yearning for it. Any delay in beginning perestroika could have led to an exacerbated internal situation in the near future, which, to put it bluntly, would have been fraught with serious social, economic, and political crises.\nMikhail Gorbachev, Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and the World, 1987\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Gorbachev argued that\n\nA. a restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union was inevitable\nB. a restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union would exacerbate the current situation\nC. a restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union was necessary in order to avoid a crisis\nD. a restructuring of socialist society was necessary in order to avoid the collapse of the Soviet Union\n"

The passage discusses the urgency of perestroika and its necessity to avoid future crises, particularly social, economic, and political ones.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. A restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union was inevitable.\n- This option suggests that perestroika is a natural progression, but the passage does not explicitly state that perestroika is inevitable. It only mentions that any delay could lead to crises.\n\nB. A restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union would exacerbate the current situation.\n- This option implies that perestroika would worsen the current situation, which is not the passage's main argument. The passage argues that perestroika is necessary to avoid future crises.\n\nC. A restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union was necessary in order to avoid a crisis.\n- This option aligns well with the passage. It states that perestroika is necessary to avoid future crises, which is the main argument presented.\n\nD. A restructuring of socialist society was necessary in order to avoid the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n- This option is too broad and does not directly address the passage's focus on avoiding future crises.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the most accurate inference from the passage is:\n\nC. A restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union was necessary in order to avoid a crisis.\n\nFinal answer: C."
