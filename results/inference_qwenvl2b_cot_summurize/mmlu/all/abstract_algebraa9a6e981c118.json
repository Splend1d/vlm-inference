The polynomial is given in the form \\(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), \\(c = 2\\), and \\(d = 2\\).\n\nThe polynomial can be rewritten as:\n\\[x^3 + 2x + 2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\\]\n\nWe need to find the roots of this polynomial modulo 7. Let's try to factorize it or use the factoring method to find the roots.\n\nThe polynomial can be factored as follows:\n\\[x^3 + 2x + 2 \\equiv (x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 1) \\pmod{7}\\]\n\nSince \\(x^2 - 2x + 1\\) is a perfect square (\\(x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2\\)), we can simplify the expression further:\n\\[x^3 + 2x + 2 \\equiv (x + 2)(x - 1)^2 \\pmod{7}\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the roots of \\((x + 2)(x - 1)^2\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\).\n\nSince \\(x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2\\), we can rewrite the polynomial as:\n\\[x^3 + 2x + 2 \\equiv (x + 2)(x - 1)^2 \\pmod{7}\\]\n\nWe need to find the roots of \\((x + 2)(x - 1)^2\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\).\n\nSince \\((x + 2)(x - 1)^2\\) is a product of two polynomials, we can use the factoring method to find the roots. However, since we are working modulo 7, we need to consider the remainders when each factor is divided by 7.\n\nLet's find the remainders when each factor is divided by 7:\n\n1. \\(x + 2 \\pmod{7}\\)\n2. \\((x - 1)^2 \\pmod{7}\\)\n\nWe can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or trial and error to find the remainders.\n\nAfter finding the remainders, we can add them modulo 7 to find the roots of the polynomial in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\).\n\nLet's calculate the remainders:\n\n1. \\(x + 2 \\pmod{7}\\)\n2. \\((x - 1)^2 \\pmod{7}\\)\n\nAfter calculating the remainders, we can add them modulo 7 to find the roots of the polynomial in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\).\n\nAfter performing the calculations, we find that the roots of the polynomial in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\) are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. 2,3"
