The order of a group is the number of elements in the group. \n\nGiven that \\(G\\) contains a subgroup of order 7, we need to determine the possible orders of \\(G\\) based on the condition that no element (other than the identity) is its own inverse.\n\n1. **Identify the possible orders of the subgroup of order 7:**\n   - The subgroup of order 7 must be cyclic (since it's the only subgroup of order 7 and it's cyclic, it must be generated by an element of order 7).\n   - The order of any element in a cyclic group of order 7 is 7.\n   - Therefore, the possible orders of the subgroup of order 7 are 1, 7, and 49 (since 7 * 7 = 49).\n\n2. **Consider the possible orders of the group \\(G\\):**\n   - If the subgroup of order 7 is the only subgroup of order 7, then \\(G\\) must have at least 7 elements.\n   - If the subgroup of order 7 is not the only subgroup of order 7, then \\(G\\) must have more than 7 elements.\n\n3. **Analyze the given options:**\n   - **Option A (27):** This is not possible because the subgroup of order 7 is not the only subgroup of order 7.\n   - **Option B (28):** This is not possible because the subgroup of order 7 is not the only subgroup of order 7.\n   - **Option C (35):** This is not possible because the subgroup of order 7 is not the only subgroup of order 7.\n   - **Option D (37):** This is possible because the subgroup of order 7 is not the only subgroup of order 7, and \\(G\\) must have more than 7 elements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 37**."
