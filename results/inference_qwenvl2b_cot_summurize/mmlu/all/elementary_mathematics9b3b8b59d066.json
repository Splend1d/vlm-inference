We can do this by multiplying his hourly wage by the number of hours he works each week.\n\nPeter earns $7.25 per hour and works 38 hours per week. So, his original weekly gross pay is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Original Weekly Gross Pay} = 7.25 \\times 38 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Original Weekly Gross Pay} = 281 \\]\n\nAfter the raise, his weekly gross pay is $307.80. To find the increase, we subtract his original weekly gross pay from his new weekly gross pay:\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Weekly Gross Pay} = \\text{New Weekly Gross Pay} - \\text{Original Weekly Gross Pay} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Weekly Gross Pay} = 307.80 - 281 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase in Weekly Gross Pay} = 26.80 \\]\n\nSo, the increase in Peter's weekly gross pay is $26.80. The correct answer is:\n\nC. $42.46"
