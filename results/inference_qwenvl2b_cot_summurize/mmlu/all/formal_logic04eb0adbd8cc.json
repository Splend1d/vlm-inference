If something's not being a cookie entails that it doesn't have chocolate chips, then this cookie doesn't have oatmeal. So this cookie doesn't have oatmeal.**\n   - This option directly translates the given predicate logic statement into English.

This aligns with the given statements.\n\nB. **Some cookies have oatmeal. If something is not a cookie and does not have chocolate chips, it doesn't have oatmeal.
