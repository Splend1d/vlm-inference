It is defined as the product of the concentrations of the ions in the solid and aqueous phases. In this case, the Ksp for iron(III) hydroxide is 1.6 \u00d7 10^-39. This means that the solubility of iron(III) hydroxide is very low, and it is almost impossible to dissolve it in water.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 9.4 \u00d7 10^-6 mol/L"
