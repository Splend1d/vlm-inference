The formula for the radius of a circle is:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{distance from the center of the turntable} \\]\n\nGiven that the angular velocity is 0.55, we can solve for the distance from the center of the turntable:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{distance from the center of the turntable} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance from the center of the turntable} = 2 \\times r \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance from the center of the turntable} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{distance from the center of the turntable} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance from the center of the turntable} = \\text{distance from the center of the turntable} \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.024 \\, \\text{m}} \\]\n\nThis matches option A."
