The total number of muffins is 232, and 190 of them were sent to the hotel. So, the number of muffins left is:\n\n\\[232 - 190 = 42\\]\n\nEach box can hold 6 muffins. To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the number of muffins left by the number of muffins each box can hold:\n\n\\[\\frac{42}{6} = 7\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct equation to find the number of boxes, \\(b\\), is:\n\n\\[6 \\times b = 42\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
