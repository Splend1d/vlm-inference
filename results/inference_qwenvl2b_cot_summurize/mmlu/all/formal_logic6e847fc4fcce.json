P\n- This proposition is not necessarily a consequence of the given premises. The premises do not provide any information about P.\n\nB. N \u2283 ~O\n- This proposition is not necessarily a consequence of the given premises. The premises do not provide any information about N or O.\n\nC. O \u2228 Q\n- This proposition is not necessarily a consequence of the given premises. The premises do not provide any information about O or Q.\n\nD. ~P\n- This proposition is a direct consequence of the given premises. The premises state that N is equivalent to ~O, and O is equivalent to Q. Therefore, if N is true, ~O must be true, and if Q is true, O must be true. This means P must be false, which is equivalent to ~P.\n\nTherefore, the proposition that is an immediate consequence of the given premises is:\n\nD. ~P"
