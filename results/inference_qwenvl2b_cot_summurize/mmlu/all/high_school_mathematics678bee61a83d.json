This means the number can be expressed as a product of these prime factors, which are all prime numbers.\n\nThe prime factorization of a number is the product of its prime factors. Since the prime factors are 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31, the number itself is a product of these prime factors.\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\nA. 4: \\(4 = 2^2\\), which is not a product of the prime factors given.\nB. 6: \\(6 = 2 \\times 3\\), which is not a product of the prime factors given.\nC. 10: \\(10 = 2 \\times 5\\), which is not a product of the prime factors given.\nD. 15: \\(15 = 3 \\times 5\\), which is a product of the prime factors given.\n\nTherefore, the number must be a factor of 15.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 15."
