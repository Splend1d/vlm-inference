This is a constant acceleration, meaning that the acceleration will remain the same regardless of the initial velocity of the object. Therefore, if you throw the ball downward, the acceleration will still be 9.8 m/s^2. The only difference is that the initial velocity will be different, but the acceleration will still be the same. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
