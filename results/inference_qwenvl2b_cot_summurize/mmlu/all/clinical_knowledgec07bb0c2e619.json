More prominent in expiration\n\nA pleural friction rub is a type of frictional sound that occurs when the pleural space (the space between the lungs and the chest wall) becomes inflamed or irritated. This can happen due to a variety of factors, including lung disease, pleural effusion (fluid in the pleural space), or pleural pain. The sound is typically more prominent in expiration, when the lungs are more relaxed and the pleural space is more open. It can also alter with coughing, as the coughing motion can cause the pleural space to become inflamed or irritated again. Pleural friction rubs are not typically associated with clubbing, which is a sign of lung disease."
