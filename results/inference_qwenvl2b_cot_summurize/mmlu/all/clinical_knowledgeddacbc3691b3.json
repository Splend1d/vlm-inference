Displaced apex beat; soft first heart sound; pan-systolic murmur; short mid-diastolic murmur\n- This combination suggests a normal first heart sound and a short mid-diastolic murmur, which are not typical of mitral regurgitation. The displaced apex beat and pan-systolic murmur are also not characteristic of mitral regurgitation.\n\nB.
