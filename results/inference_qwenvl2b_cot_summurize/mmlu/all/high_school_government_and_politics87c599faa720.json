When there is a strong front-runner in a state, people in that state are less likely to vote.\n- This statement is true. When there is a strong front-runner, it can create a sense of uncertainty or dissatisfaction among voters, leading to lower turnout.\n\nB. White-collar workers are more likely to vote than are blue-collar workers, with the exception of blue-collar workers who belong to unions.\n- This statement is true. White-collar workers generally have higher levels of education and income, which can lead to higher voter turnout.\n\nC. Voters who are registered as independent are less likely to vote than those who are registered Democrats or Republicans.\n- This statement is true. Independent voters are less likely to be registered with a party, which can result in lower voter turnout.\n\nD. There is no difference in the likelihood of voting among those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees.\n- This statement is false. There is a difference in the likelihood of voting among those with different educational backgrounds. People with postgraduate degrees are more likely to vote than those with undergraduate degrees.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is true EXCEPT is:\n\nD. There is no difference in the likelihood of voting among those with undergraduate degrees and those with postgraduate degrees."
