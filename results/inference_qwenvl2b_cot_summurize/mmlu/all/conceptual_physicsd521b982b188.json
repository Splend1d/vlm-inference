When two protons are removed from the nucleus of neon-20, the atomic number of the resulting nucleus would be:\n\n10 - 2 = 8\n\nThe atomic number of oxygen-18 is 8. Therefore, the element that remains after removing two protons and two neutrons from the nucleus of neon-20 is oxygen-18.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. Oxygen-18"
