The resonance pulls Io in different directions and generates heat.\n\nThe 1:2:4 resonance in the Jupiter's moons system is significant because it creates a stable orbit for Io, which is the largest moon in the system. This resonance causes Io to orbit Jupiter in a 1:2:4 ratio, meaning it takes 2.5 Earth years to orbit Jupiter once, and it takes 4 Earth years to orbit Jupiter twice. This resonance also causes Io to orbit Jupiter in a slightly elliptical orbit, which helps to keep it in a stable orbit. Additionally, the resonance generates heat in Io due to the friction between its surface and the planet's magnetic field."
