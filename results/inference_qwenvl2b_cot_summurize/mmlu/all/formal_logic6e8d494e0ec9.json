It then goes on to mention that the principles governing inheritance traits were described less than 150 years ago. Following this, it notes that around the turn of the twentieth century, the laws of inheritance were rediscovered. Finally, it concludes that even then, the importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"But even then, the importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\"\n- This option directly follows the conclusion that the importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s. It is a direct statement that supports the argument.\n\nB. \"The importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\"\n- This option is a restatement of the conclusion, but it is not as concise as option A.\n\nC. \"From a historical point of view, genetics is a young science.\"\n- This option is a general statement about the age of genetics, which is not directly supported by the argument.\n\nD. \"The principles that govern inheritance traits were described less than 150 years ago.\"\n- This option is a restatement of the argument's initial point, which is not the conclusion.\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, the conclusion of the argument is best captured by option A: \"But even then, the importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s.\"\n\nFinal answer: A. But even then, the importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s."
