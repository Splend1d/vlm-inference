The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nWhen the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, it indicates that the economy is producing less of all goods and services at each price level. This shift leads to a decrease in the equilibrium price level, as the higher cost of production results in a higher price for goods and services. At the same time, the equilibrium quantity of output decreases, as the lower supply of goods and services leads to a lower total output."
