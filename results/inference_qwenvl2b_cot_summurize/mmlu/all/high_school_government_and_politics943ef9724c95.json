I, III, and IV only.\n\nThe power and prestige of the presidency have grown since 1932 due to several factors:\n\n1. **America's Increased Prominence in International Affairs**: The United States has become a global superpower, with significant influence in international affairs. This has led to increased attention and respect for the presidency.\n\n2. **Continually Improved Public Confidence in the Federal Government**: Over time, the federal government has become more trusted and respected by the public. This has contributed to the perception that the presidency holds more power and prestige.\n\n3. **The New Deal and Other Programs that Have Expanded Federal Responsibility**: The New Deal and other programs that expanded federal responsibility have given the presidency more authority and influence in areas such as social welfare, economic policy, and foreign policy.\n\n4. **The President's Increased Visibility, Due to the Development of Mass Media**: The development of mass media has made the presidency more visible and accessible to the public. This has increased the president's influence and prestige.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not account for all the factors that have contributed to the growth of the presidency's power and prestige since 1932."
