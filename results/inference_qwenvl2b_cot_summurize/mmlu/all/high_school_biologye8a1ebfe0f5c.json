The DNA molecules migrate through a gel matrix, which is an agarose or polyacrylamide solution, under the influence of an electric field. The direction of migration depends on the charge of the DNA molecules and the strength of the electric field. The longer the current is running, the farther the DNA will travel, but it does not migrate only when the current is running."
