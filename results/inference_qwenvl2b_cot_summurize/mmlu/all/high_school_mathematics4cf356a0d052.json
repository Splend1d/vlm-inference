                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and possibilities for forming palindromes with the letter M. \n\n1. **Single-letter palindromes**: There are 5 single-letter palindromes: M, M, M, M, M. So, there are 5 palindromes of 1 letter.\n\n2. **Two-letter palindromes**: For a two-letter palindromic arrangement, the first letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes, and the second letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes. This gives us \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) two-letter palindromes.\n\n3. **Three-letter palindromes**: For a three-letter palindromic arrangement, the first letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes, the second letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes, and the third letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes. This gives us \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125\\) three-letter palindromes.\n\n4. **Four-letter palindromes**: For a four-letter palindromic arrangement, the first letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes, the second letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes, the third letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes, and the fourth letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes. This gives us \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 625\\) four-letter palindromes.\n\n5. **Five-letter palindromes**: For a five-letter palindromic arrangement, the first letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes, the second letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes, the third letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes, the fourth letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes, and the fifth letter can be any of the 5 single-letter palindromes. This gives us \\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 3125\\) five-letter palindromes.\n\nAdding these up, we have \\(5 + 25 + 125 + 625 + 3125 = 4000\\) palindromes of 2 letters or more.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the possibility of including the letter M in these arrangements. Since there are 5 single-letter palindromes, and we are considering arrangements of 2 letters or more, we must subtract the 5 palindromes that do not include the letter M. This leaves us with \\(4000 - 5 = 3995\\) palindromes that include the letter M.\n\nTherefore, the number of palindromes of 2 letters or more, containing the letter M, is \\(3995\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **C. 86**."
