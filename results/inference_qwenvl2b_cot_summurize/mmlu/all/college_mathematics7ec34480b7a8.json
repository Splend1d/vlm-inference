If the limit of s_n as n approaches infinity is s, and the limit of t_n as n approaches infinity is t, then the limit of s_nt_n as n approaches infinity is st. This is because the limit of a product of sequences is the product of their limits, and the limit of a sequence is a real number.\n\nStatement 2 is false. The statement \"There exists a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence\" is false. A bounded sequence of real numbers is a sequence where the terms are all non-negative or all non-positive. A sequence with no convergent subsequence means that there is no subsequence that converges to a real number. However, it is possible to construct a sequence that is bounded but has no convergent subsequence. For example, consider the sequence of all positive integers. This sequence is bounded, but it has no convergent subsequence because there is no subsequence that converges to a real number."
