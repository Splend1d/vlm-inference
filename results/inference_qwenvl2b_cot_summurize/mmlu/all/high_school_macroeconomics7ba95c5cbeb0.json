In the short run there is a positive relationship between inflation and unemployment and in the long run the relationship is negative.\n\nThe short-run Phillips curve shows that there is a positive relationship between inflation and unemployment in the short run, meaning that an increase in inflation tends to lead to an increase in unemployment. However, in the long run, this relationship is reversed, and an increase in inflation tends to lead to a decrease in unemployment. This is because the economy has time to adjust to higher inflation, and the unemployment rate tends to fall over time."
