In all cases, a binary search of a sorted list requires fewer comparisons than a linear search.\nB. Generally, the advantage of using a binary search over a linear search increases as the size of the list increases.\nC. A linear search will generally run faster than a binary search because a linear search requires fewer lines of code to implement.\nD. Using a linear search is preferable to using a binary search if there is a chance that the target may not be found in the list.\n"

Generally, the advantage of using a binary search over a linear search increases as the size of the list increases.\n\nBinary search is generally more efficient than linear search for large lists because it reduces the search space by half with each comparison, while linear search doubles the search space with each comparison."
