The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?\n\nA. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\nB. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\nC.

                    "text": "To determine which statement is correct, let's analyze the given information and the theory behind it.\n\nThe theory suggests that the release of starch granules from pollen grains is triggered by osmotic shock due to exposure to water. According to the theory, the starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. **The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.**\n   - Hypotonicity refers to a situation where the interior of a cell is more concentrated than the surrounding environment. This would imply that the starch granules would be more concentrated inside the pollen grains compared to the surrounding air. However, the theory does not specify whether the starch granules were hypotonic or not. Therefore, this statement cannot be confirmed or denied based on the theory alone.\n\nB. **The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.**\n   - Osmotic pressure is the tendency of a solution to retain solutes. If the starch granules were more concentrated inside the pollen grains compared to the surrounding air, the starch granules would have a higher osmotic pressure. This would make it more difficult for water to enter the pollen grains, leading to osmotic shock and the release of starch granules. Therefore, this statement is consistent with the theory.\n\nC. **The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.**\n   - Plasmolysis is a process where the cell membrane of a plant cell becomes permeable to water and other solutes, leading to the collapse of the cell. This would make it easier for water to enter the pollen grains, causing osmotic shock and the release of starch granules. Therefore, this statement is consistent with the theory.\n\nD. **The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.**\n   - Shrinkage of the pollen grains would make it more difficult for water to enter them, leading to osmotic shock and the release of starch granules. Therefore, this statement is consistent with the theory.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n**B. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.**"
