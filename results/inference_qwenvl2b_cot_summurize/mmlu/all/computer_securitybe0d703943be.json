Compositionality of security properties means tested components are secure even if others change\n\nPenetration testing is a process of testing a system or network to determine its security strength. It involves identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a system or network and assessing the potential impact of those vulnerabilities if they were exploited. The benefits of penetration testing include:\n\nA. Results are often reproducible: This means that the same test can be run multiple times and the results will be consistent. This is important for testing the security of a system or network, as it allows for the identification of vulnerabilities that may not be immediately apparent.\n\nB. Full evidence of security: A clean test means a secure system: This means that the test results will indicate whether the system or network is secure or not. This is important for ensuring that the system or network is protected against potential threats.\n\nC. Compositionality of security properties means tested components are secure even if others change: This means that the security of a system or network is not dependent on the security of individual components. This is important for ensuring that the system or network is protected against potential threats, even if individual components are compromised.\n\nD. Makes an adversarial neural network converge more quickly: This is not a benefit of penetration testing. Penetration testing is a process of testing a system or network to determine its security strength, and it does not involve using adversarial neural networks."
