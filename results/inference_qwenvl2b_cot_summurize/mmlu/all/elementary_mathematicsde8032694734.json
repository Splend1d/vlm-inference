The original picture is 4 cm wide and 6 cm long, so the ratio of width to length is 4:6, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that for every 2 units of width, there are 3 units of length.\n\nGiven that the new picture is 10 cm wide, we can set up a proportion to find its length. The proportion is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{10}{x} \\]\n\nWhere \\(x\\) is the length of the new picture. Cross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[ 2x = 3 \\times 10 \\]\n\n\\[ 2x = 30 \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{30}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the new picture is 15 cm, which corresponds to option C."
