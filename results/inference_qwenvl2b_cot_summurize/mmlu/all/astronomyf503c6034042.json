The length of a year is primarily determined by the gravitational force between the Earth and the Sun, which affects the Earth's orbit around the Sun.\n\nIf the Earth's orbit were moved to a three times further away orbit, the gravitational force between the Earth and the Sun would be three times stronger. This would result in a shorter period of time for the Earth to complete its orbit around the Sun.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. about 5.2 times longer"
