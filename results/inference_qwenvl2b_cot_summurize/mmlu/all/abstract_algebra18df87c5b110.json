This is because a homomorphism must preserve the group operation, and if the kernel consists of the identity element alone, then the homomorphism is one-to-one.\n\nStatement 2 is false. The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements. This is because the image of a group under a homomorphism can be any number of elements, depending on the homomorphism and the structure of the group. For example, if the homomorphism is the identity map, the image could be 6 elements. If the homomorphism is not the identity map, the image could be any number of elements, including 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
