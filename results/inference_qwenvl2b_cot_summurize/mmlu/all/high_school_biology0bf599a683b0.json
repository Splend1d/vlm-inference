These plants have a mutualistic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\n\nLegumes, such as beans and peas, are able to grow well in nitrogen-poor soils because they have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can use, which is essential for their growth. This process is known as nitrogen fixation. Without this symbiotic relationship, legumes would not be able to grow in nitrogen-poor soils."
