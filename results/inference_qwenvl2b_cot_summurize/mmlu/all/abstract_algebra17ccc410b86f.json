An ideal in a ring is a subset of the ring that is closed under addition and multiplication by any element of the ring. A subring, on the other hand, is a subset of the ring that is itself a ring under the same operations. Therefore, not every ideal is a subring.\n\nStatement 2: Every subring of every ring is an ideal of the ring.\nThis statement is true. By definition, a subring of a ring is a subset of the ring that is itself a ring under the same operations. Therefore, any subring of a ring is indeed an ideal of the ring.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
