A homomorphism is a function that preserves the group operation, meaning that for any two elements \\(a, b \\in G\\), the operation in \\(G\\) is the same as the operation in \\(G'\\) when applied to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, for any two groups \\(G\\) and \\(G'\\), there exists a homomorphism from \\(G\\) into \\(G'\\).\n\nStatement 2 is false. A homomorphism is a function that preserves the group operation, but it does not necessarily have to be a one-to-one map. A one-to-one map (also known as an injective map) is a function that maps distinct elements to distinct elements, but this is not a requirement for a homomorphism. A homomorphism can map elements to the same element, which is not a one-to-one map.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
