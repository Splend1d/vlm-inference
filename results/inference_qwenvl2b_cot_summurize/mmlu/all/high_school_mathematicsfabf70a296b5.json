                    "text": " To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, where all three cards must be of different suits.\n\nFirst, let's consider the different suits. There are 4 suits in a standard deck: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. So, we need to choose 3 suits out of these 4.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 suits out of 4 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items to choose, and $!$ denotes factorial.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 suits out of 4 is $\\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3 \\times 2}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4$.\n\nNext, we need to consider the different ways to choose 3 cards from each of the 3 chosen suits. For each suit, there are 13 cards in the deck, so the number of ways to choose 3 cards from each suit is $3^3 = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27$.\n\nSince we have chosen 3 suits out of 4, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from the deck is $4 \\times 27 = 108$.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the number of ways to choose 3 cards from the deck. For each way to choose 3 cards from the deck, there are 3 ways to choose the order of the cards. So, we need to divide the total number of ways by 3 to correct for this overcounting.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 cards from the deck, where all three cards must be of different suits, is $\\frac{108}{3} = 36$.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. Let's reevaluate the problem.\n\nWe need to consider the different ways to choose 3 cards from the deck, where all three cards must be of different suits.
