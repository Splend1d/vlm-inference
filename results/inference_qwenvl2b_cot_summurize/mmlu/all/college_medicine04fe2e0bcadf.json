After first walking into an anatomy lab, you no longer notice the smell of formaldehyde.\n\nSensory adaptation refers to the process by which the brain learns to ignore or reduce the intensity of a stimulus over time. In this case, the smell of formaldehyde is not a stimulus that is being learned to ignore or reduce its intensity over time. Instead, it is a sensory input that is being experienced and processed by the brain. Therefore, it does not fit the definition of sensory adaptation."
