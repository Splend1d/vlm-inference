According to the problem, when \\(x\\) is divided by 4, the remainder is 2. This can be represented as:\n\n\\[x = 4k + 2\\]\n\nwhere \\(k\\) is the quotient when \\(x\\) is divided by 4.\n\nWe are given that the answer is 160 with a remainder of 2, so we can substitute these values into our equation:\n\n\\[160 = 4k + 2\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(k\\), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[160 - 2 = 4k\\]\n\\[158 = 4k\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[k = \\frac{158}{4}\\]\n\\[k = 39.5\\]\n\nSince \\(k\\) represents the quotient when \\(x\\) is divided by 4, and we know that \\(k\\) must be an integer (because \\(x\\) is a whole number), we round 39.5 to the nearest whole number, which is 40. Therefore, \\(k = 40\\).\n\nNow, we can find \\(x\\) by substituting \\(k = 40\\) back into our equation:\n\n\\[x = 4k + 2\\]\n\\[x = 4(40) + 2\\]\n\\[x = 160 + 2\\]\n\\[x = 162\\]\n\nSo, the number is 162, which corresponds to option D."
