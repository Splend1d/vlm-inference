Temporary inconsistencies among views of a file by different machines can result\n\nLocal caching of files in a distributed file system can lead to temporary inconsistencies among views of a file by different machines. This can cause problems when multiple machines are accessing the same file simultaneously, as the cached copies of the file may not be synchronized. This can result in temporary inconsistencies, where the cached copy of the file may not be the same as the original file on the server."
