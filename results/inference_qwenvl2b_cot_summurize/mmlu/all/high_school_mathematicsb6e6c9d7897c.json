Therefore, the domain of \\(f(x) = 3\\sin 2x\\) is also all real numbers, because the sine function is periodic and its period is \\(2\\pi\\), so \\(2x\\) will also be periodic and its period is \\(2\\pi\\).\n\nThe range of the function \\(f(x) = \\sin x\\) is \\([-1, 1]\\). The range of \\(f(x) = 3\\sin 2x\\) is also \\([-1, 1]\\), because the range of \\(\\sin 2x\\) is \\([-1, 1]\\) and multiplying by 3 does not change the range.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
