When the sex ratio is imbalanced, the members of the minority sex often receive a greater proportion of care and resources from parents than do the offspring of the majority sex. This imbalance can be due to sexual selection, which is the process by which individuals of one sex are more attractive to the opposite sex, leading to higher mating success and reproductive success for the individuals. Disruptive selection occurs when the majority sex is more successful in competing for resources, leading to a decrease in the reproductive success of the minority sex. Balancing selection occurs when the sex ratio is balanced, and there is no selective advantage for either sex. Frequency-dependent selection occurs when the frequency of a particular sex is influenced by the frequency of the opposite sex, leading to a balance in the sex ratio."
