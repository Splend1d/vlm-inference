This means that the model may not be stable or well-behaved, which can lead to issues with estimation and inference. The BEKK formulation, on the other hand, reduces the dimensionality problem that arises when a number of series are modelled together, making it a more suitable approach for multivariate GARCH modeling. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
