This results in a rightward shift of the demand curve and a leftward shift of the supply curve. The equilibrium price will shift to the right because the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n\n2. **Supply and Demand Shift Leftward (Option B):**\n   - If both supply and demand shift leftward, it means that the supply of corn decreases and the demand for corn increases. This results in a leftward shift of the demand curve and a rightward shift of the supply curve. The equilibrium price will shift to the left because the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n\n3. **Supply Shifts to the Right; Demand Shifts to the Left (Option C):**\n   - If supply shifts to the right and demand shifts to the left, it means that the quantity supplied increases and the quantity demanded decreases. This results in a rightward shift of the demand curve and a leftward shift of the supply curve. The equilibrium price will shift to the right because the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded, leading to a higher equilibrium price.\n\n4. **Supply Shifts to the Left; Demand Shifts to the Right (Option D):**\n   - If supply shifts to the left and demand shifts to the right, it means that the quantity supplied decreases and the quantity demanded increases. This results in a leftward shift of the demand curve and a rightward shift of the supply curve. The equilibrium price will shift to the left because the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied, leading to a lower equilibrium price.\n\nGiven the options, the only one that definitely increases the equilibrium price of corn is:\n\n**Option A: Both supply and demand shift rightward.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A.
