A strictly convex function is one where the line segment between any two points on the graph lies above the graph between those points. This means that the function is concave up.\n\nGiven that $f(x)$ passes through the points $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$, we can infer that $f(x)$ is concave up because the function is strictly convex. This means that as we move from left to right along the x-axis, the value of $f(x)$ increases.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is strictly convex, the function is concave up. This implies that the function is increasing as we move from left to right along the x-axis. Therefore, the function will take on all positive values as $x$ increases from $-2$ to $2$.\n\nGiven that $f(x)$ passes through $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$, and knowing that $f(x)$ is strictly convex, we can conclude that $f(1)$ must be greater than $5$ and less than $9$.\n\nTherefore, the range of all possible values for $f(1)$ is $[5,9)$, which corresponds to option B."
