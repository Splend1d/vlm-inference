                    "text": "A healthy person sitting at rest consciously begins to breathe too fast, which is a condition known as hyperventilation. Hyperventilation occurs when the body tries to compensate for a lack of oxygen in the blood, which can happen during exercise or when the body is stressed.\n\nWhen the body is stressed or exercising, it may not be able to get enough oxygen to the muscles, leading to a decrease in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood. This decrease in CO2 can cause the body to breathe faster to compensate for the lack of oxygen.\n\nAs a result of hyperventilation, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood decreases, which can lead to an increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the blood. This increase in H+ can cause the blood to become more acidic, which can have negative effects on the body's cells and tissues.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. A decrease in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and an increase in concentration of hydrogen ions"
