However, there are some disadvantages associated with these tests:\n\ni) Only one cointegrating relationship can be estimated: This is a limitation of the DF and EG tests, as they only allow for the estimation of a single cointegrating relationship. This means that if there are multiple cointegrating relationships, the tests will not be able to identify them.\n\nii) Particularly for small samples, there is a high chance of the tests suggesting that variables are not cointegrated when they are: This is also a limitation of the DF and EG tests, as they are designed for large samples and may not be robust for small samples.\n\niii) It is not possible to make inferences on the cointegrating regression: This is a limitation of the DF and EG tests, as they do not provide inferences on the cointegrating regression.\n\niv) The procedure forces the researcher to specify which is the dependent variable and which are the independent variables: This is a limitation of the DF and EG tests, as they require the researcher to specify the order of the cointegrating relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
