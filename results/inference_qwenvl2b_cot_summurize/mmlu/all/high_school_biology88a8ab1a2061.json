If a plant has a low number of stomata, it is likely to be adapted to environments with high temperatures and low humidity, such as hot and dry conditions. This is because the stomata are used to exchange gases, and if the plant is not able to exchange gases effectively, it may not be able to survive in such environments. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Hot and dry."
