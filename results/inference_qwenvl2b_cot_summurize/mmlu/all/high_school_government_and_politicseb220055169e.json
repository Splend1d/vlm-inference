Increasing concentration of ownership in the news media\n\nNetwork news coverage has become less diverse in recent years due to increasing concentration of ownership in the news media. This has led to a decline in the number of diverse voices and perspectives being represented in the news. As a result, the news media is becoming more homogenized and less representative of the diverse communities and perspectives that exist in society."
