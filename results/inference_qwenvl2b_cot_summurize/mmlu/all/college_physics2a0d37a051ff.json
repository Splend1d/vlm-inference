Lines in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions of the spectrum reveal primarily the nuclear structure of the sample.\n- C. Absorption spectra can be used to determine which elements are present in distant stars.\n- D. Spectral analysis can be used to identify the composition of galactic dust.\n\nAbsorption spectra are indeed used to identify which elements are present in distant stars, and spectral analysis can be used to identify the composition of galactic dust. However, the wavelengths identified in an absorption spectrum of an element are not necessarily among those in its emission spectrum. The emission spectrum is the spectrum of the radiation emitted by an element when it is excited, while the absorption spectrum is the spectrum of the radiation absorbed by an element when it is excited. Therefore, the correct statement is B."
