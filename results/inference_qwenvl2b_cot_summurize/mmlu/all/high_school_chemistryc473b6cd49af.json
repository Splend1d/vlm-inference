Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent. Step 3. Separated solute and solvent are brought together filling in the spaces.All of the fundamental principles below are important in understanding the formation of solutions except which one?\n\nA. Starting at equilibrium, moving particles apart while in the solid or equilibrium phases requires added energy proportional to the attractive forces.\nB. Bringing particles together releases energy in proportion to their attractive forces.\nC. The total of the energies in steps 1 to 3 indicates if a solution will form.\nD. Molecules with similar molecular masses are required to form solutions.\n"

Molecules with similar molecular masses are required to form solutions.\n\nThis principle is not relevant to the formation of solutions, as the formation of a solution does not depend on the molecular masses of the solute and solvent. The formation of a solution is determined by the ability of the solute to dissolve in the solvent, which is influenced by factors such as solubility, solute-solvent interactions, and the presence of other solutes in the solution."
