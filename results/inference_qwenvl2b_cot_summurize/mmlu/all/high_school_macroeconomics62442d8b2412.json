Increase government spending with a matching decrease in taxes.\n\nThis combination would be most likely to slowly increase real GDP without putting tremendous upward pressure on the price level. By increasing government spending and decreasing taxes, the government is providing more spending power to consumers and businesses, which can stimulate economic growth. However, the decrease in taxes will also reduce the amount of money people have to spend, which can help to moderate inflationary pressures."
