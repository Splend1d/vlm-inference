However, since we are dealing with a single processor and the jobs have different service times, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. **Calculate the total time required to complete all jobs**:\n   - Total time = 25 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 50 time units.\n\n2. **Calculate the average completion time**:\n   - Average completion time = Total time / Number of jobs = 50 / 5 = 10 time units.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the average completion time of these jobs is 10, which corresponds to option D."
