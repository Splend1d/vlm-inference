The heat of solution for cerium(III) sulfate is endothermic.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that cerium(III) sulfate is less soluble in hot water than in cold water. In general, the solubility of a substance is inversely proportional to its temperature. This means that as the temperature increases, the solubility decreases. Therefore, if cerium(III) sulfate is less soluble in hot water than in cold water, it implies that the heat of solution of cerium(III) sulfate is endothermic."
