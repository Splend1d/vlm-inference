Excluding a relevant variable from a linear regression model.\n\nMis-specification of functional form occurs when the functional form used in a statistical model does not accurately represent the relationship between the variables. In this case, excluding a relevant variable from a linear regression model is an example of mis-specification. \n\nOption A is correct because using a linear specification when y scales as a function of the squares of x is an example of mis-specification. \n\nOption B is correct because using a linear specification when a double-logarithmic model would be more appropriate is an example of mis-specification.\n\nOption C is correct because modelling y as a function of x when in fact it scales as a function of 1/x is an example of mis-specification.\n\nOption D is incorrect because excluding a relevant variable from a linear regression model is not an example of mis-specification. It is a common practice to exclude irrelevant variables from a regression model to improve the model's explanatory power and avoid overfitting."
