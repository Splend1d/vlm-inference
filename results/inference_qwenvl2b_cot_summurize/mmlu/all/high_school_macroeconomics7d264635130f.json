If the reserve ratio is .10, it means that banks must hold 10% of their deposits as reserves. If Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account and keeps it as cash in her refrigerator, she is effectively reducing the amount of money in circulation by $1 million. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Decreases it by $1 million."
