How many programming statements the program contains - The number of programming statements can affect the efficiency of the program, but it is not the most critical factor for processing large data sets.\n\nC. How much memory the program requires as it runs - This is a critical factor because a program that requires too much memory can be inefficient and may not be able to handle large data sets efficiently.\n\nD.
