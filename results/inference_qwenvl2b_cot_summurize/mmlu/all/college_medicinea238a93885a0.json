This is because the addition of HCl will consume OH- ions, which are present in the solution, and will also consume H+ ions, which are present in the solution. This will cause the pH of the solution to decrease.\n\nWhen the pH of the solution decreases, the concentration of OH- ions will decrease and the concentration of H+ ions will increase. This will cause the solubility product constant (Ksp) for Mg(OH)2 to increase. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
