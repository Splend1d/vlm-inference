High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass\n\nAn early-successional plant community is characterized by a high rate of primary production, which is often used as a measure of productivity. This is because the community is still in the process of establishing itself and has not yet reached a stable state with a high proportion of standing-crop biomass. Therefore, the community is expected to have a high ratio of primary production to standing-crop biomass."
