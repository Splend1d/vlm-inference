Educated Germans initially claimed a special German mission after World War II.\n  - This is because they were influenced by the idea of a unique German path.\n2. After the collapse of 1945, they criticized Germany's deviation from the West.\n3. Today, the negative view is predominant.\n4. Germany did not differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a \"unique German path.\"\n5. No country on earth ever took what can be described as the \"normal path.\"\n\nFrom these points, we can infer the following:\n\n- Germany's belief in a unique mission was influenced by its defeat in World War II.\n- The belief was discredited by Germany's defeat in World War II.\n- The belief was not unaffected by Germany's defeat in World War II.\n\nTherefore, the correct inference is:\n\nD. was discredited by Germany's defeat in World War II"
