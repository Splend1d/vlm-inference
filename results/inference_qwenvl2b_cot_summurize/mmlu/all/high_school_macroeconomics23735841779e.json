This increase in imports leads to a decrease in the domestic price of steel, as the supply of steel increases relative to the demand. As a result, consumers benefit from lower prices, while domestic steel producers benefit from increased demand and potentially higher profits. This can lead to a decrease in the domestic price of steel and an increase in the quantity of steel imports, which is a consequence of the removal of the protective tariff."
