It is a consensual reflex.\n\nThe pupillary light reflex is a consensual reflex, meaning it is mediated by the brainstem and involves the interaction between the eyes and the brain. The afferent limb of the reflex is carried in the oculomotor nerve, which controls the muscles that move the eyes. The efferent limb is carried in the optic nerve, which carries signals from the brain to the eyes. The inferior colliculi in the midbrain are involved in the initiation of the reflex."
