Congress can indeed pass laws.\n- Option B is true. A proposed amendment must be approved by two-thirds of the delegates in both houses of Congress.\n- Option C is true. Congress can override a presidential veto if two-thirds of the House and Senate agree to do so.\n- Option D is false. While the president has significant power over the bureaucracy, Congress also has significant influence over the bureaucracy, although it is not as significant as the president's power."
