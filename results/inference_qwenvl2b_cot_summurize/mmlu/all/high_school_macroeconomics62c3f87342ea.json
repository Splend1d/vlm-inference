This increase in real GDP also leads to an increase in the price level, as it represents an increase in the quantity of goods and services demanded. However, the increase in real GDP and the increase in the price level do not necessarily lead to an increase in unemployment, as the increase in real GDP may be offset by a decrease in the quantity of labor supplied. Therefore, the unemployment rate may decrease."
