Lower the discount rate risking inflation.\n\nThe crowding-out effect occurs when government spending or fiscal policy increases the demand for money, which in turn leads to higher interest rates and reduced investment. To mitigate this effect, the central bank can lower the discount rate, which encourages borrowing and investment, thereby reducing the demand for money and mitigating the crowding-out effect. However, this policy can also exacerbate inflation if the central bank is not careful to control the money supply."
