Jupiter's greater mass compresses it more thus increasing its density.\n\nSaturn is much smaller than Jupiter despite its larger mass because it has a much smaller radius. This is because the mass of a planet is proportional to its radius cubed, while its density is proportional to its mass. Since Saturn has a smaller radius than Jupiter, it has a greater mass for a given volume, which results in a larger mass-to-volume ratio. This means that Saturn has a greater mass than Jupiter, but its volume is much smaller, so it is much smaller in size."
