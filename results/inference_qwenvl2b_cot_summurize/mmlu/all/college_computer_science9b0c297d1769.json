In two's-complement, the most significant bit (MSB) is used to represent the sign of the number. If the MSB is 0, the number is positive; if it is 1, the number is negative.\n\nLet's analyze each pair:\n\nA. 11111111 (positive) and 00000001 (negative)\n- Adding these numbers will result in a positive number because the MSB is 0, indicating a positive number.\n\nB. 00000001 (negative) and 10000000 (positive)\n- Adding these numbers will result in a positive number because the MSB is 0, indicating a positive number.\n\nC. 11111111 (positive) and 10000001 (negative)\n- Adding these numbers will result in a negative number because the MSB is 1, indicating a negative number.\n\nD. 10000001 (positive) and 10101010 (negative)\n- Adding these numbers will result in a negative number because the MSB is 1, indicating a negative number.\n\nTherefore, the pairs that will result in overflow when added are:\n\nC. 11111111, 10000001\nD. 10000001, 10101010"
