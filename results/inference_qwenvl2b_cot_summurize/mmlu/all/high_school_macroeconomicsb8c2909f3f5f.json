Decrease spending \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Buy government securities\n\nThis combination would likely accomplish the goal of lessening the threat of inflation by reducing aggregate demand, which is a key component of monetary policy. By decreasing spending, the central bank can reduce the money supply and lower interest rates, which can stimulate economic activity and reduce inflation. Buying government securities, on the other hand, is a monetary policy tool that increases the money supply and can help to stabilize the economy by reducing inflationary pressures."
