We can solve it using an integrating factor. The integrating factor is given by:\n\n\\[ \\mu(x) = e^{\\int \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx} = e^{\\ln|x|} = x \\]\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by the integrating factor \\( x \\), we get:\n\n\\[ x \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dx} + y = xe^x \\]\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides with respect to \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ \\int (x \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dx} + y) \\, dx = \\int xe^x \\, dx \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} x^2 \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dx} + y = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 e^x + C \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} \\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 e^x - \\frac{1}{2} x^2 e^x + C \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 e^x - \\frac{1}{2} x^2 e^x = 0 \\]\n\nThis implies that \\( y \\) is a constant function, and we can find its value by setting \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 0 = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 e^x - \\frac{1}{2} x^2 e^x \\]\n\n\\[ 0 = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 e^x \\]\n\n\\[ x^2 e^x = 0 \\]\n\nSince \\( x^2 e^x \\) is not zero for any \\( x \\), we must have \\( e^x = 0 \\). This is not possible since \\( e^x \\) is always positive for all real \\( x \\). Therefore, there must be an error in our approach.
