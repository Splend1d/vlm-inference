These craters contain the only permanently shadowed regions on Mercury\n\nMercury's poles are the only places on the planet where the sun's rays are not directly overhead, which means that the temperature is much cooler than in the equatorial regions. This cooling effect is caused by the planet's thin atmosphere, which is composed mostly of carbon dioxide. As a result, the poles are covered in ice, which is why we look for water-ice in craters at Mercury's pole."
