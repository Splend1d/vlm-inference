In this case, the resistance is 10 \u03a9 and the current is 10 A. Therefore, the voltage across the resistor is:\n\nV = 10 A * 10 \u03a9 = 100 V\n\nSince the voltage across the resistor is 100 V, it is more than 10 V but less than 100 V. Therefore, the correct answer is B. more than 0 but less than 10 V."
