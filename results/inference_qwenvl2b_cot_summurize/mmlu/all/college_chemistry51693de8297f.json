                    "text": "To determine which of the following must be true about a binary liquid mixture that obeys Raoult's law, we need to understand the principles of Raoult's law and how it applies to binary mixtures.\n\nRaoult's law states that the partial pressure of a component in a binary mixture is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the mixture. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\\[ P_i = \\alpha_i \\cdot P_i^* \\]\nwhere \\( P_i \\) is the partial pressure of component \\( i \\), \\( P_i^* \\) is the pure component's vapor pressure at the same temperature, and \\( \\alpha_i \\) is the mole fraction of component \\( i \\).\n\n### Analysis of Each Option\n\n1. **I. The partial pressure of each component at equilibrium is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid mixture.**\n   - This is a direct consequence of Raoult's law. It states that the partial pressure of a component in a binary mixture is proportional to its mole fraction in the mixture.\n\n2. **II. The volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of the volumes of each component before mixing.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. The volume of a binary mixture is not necessarily equal to the sum of the volumes of the pure components. The volume of the mixture depends on the composition and temperature, not just the mole fractions.\n\n3. **III. Intermolecular interactions in the mixture are identical to intermolecular interactions in the pure components.**\n   - This is not necessarily true. Intermolecular interactions in a binary mixture can be different from those in the pure components due to the presence of the other component. For example, the intermolecular forces between the components can be different.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. I only"
