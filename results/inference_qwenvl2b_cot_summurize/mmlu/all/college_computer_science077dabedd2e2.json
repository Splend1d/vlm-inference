The characteristic equation is:\n\nr^2 = r + 1\n\nSolving for r, we get:\n\nr^2 - r - 1 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find:\n\nr = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 4)) / 2 = (1 \u00b1 \u221a5) / 2\n\nSince the roots are complex, we can say that the characteristic equation has no real roots. Therefore, the solution to the recurrence relation is:\n\nf(N) = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2\n\nwhere c1 and c2 are constants.\n\nNow, let's find the best upper bound for f(N) as N approaches infinity. We can use the bound on the logarithm function:\n\nlog N = O(N)\n\nTherefore, the bound on f(N) is:\n\nf(N) = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^2 = c1 * 2^N + c2 * N^"
