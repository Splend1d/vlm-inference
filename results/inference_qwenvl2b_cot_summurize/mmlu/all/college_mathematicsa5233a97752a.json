The slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve \\(y = x + e^x\\) can be found by taking the derivative of the function with respect to \\(x\\), and then evaluating it at \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe derivative of \\(y = x + e^x\\) is:\n\\[y' = 1 + e^x\\]\n\nEvaluating this derivative at \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[y'(0) = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2\\]\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at \\(x = 0\\) is \\(2\\).\n\nNow, using the point-slope form of a line, \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line, we can find the equation of the tangent line. Since we know the slope \\(m = 2\\) and the point \\((0, 1)\\) on the line, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\\[y - 1 = 2(x - 0)\\]\n\\[y - 1 = 2x\\]\n\\[y = 2x + 1\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct equation of the tangent line at \\(x = 0\\) is \\(y = 2x + 1\\), which corresponds to option A."
