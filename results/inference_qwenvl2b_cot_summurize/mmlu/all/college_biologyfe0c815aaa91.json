High parental investment\n\nRodents with small litters are often characterized by high parental investment, as they need to provide extensive care and protection for their young. This is because the small size of the litter suggests that the mother is likely to be the primary caregiver, and the young are likely to be dependent on her for food, shelter, and protection. Therefore, the rodents are most likely to exhibit high parental investment."
