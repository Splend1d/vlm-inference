Divergent selection\n\nDivergent selection is a type of natural selection where two or more populations evolve independently of each other, leading to the development of new traits or variants. In the context of the scenario described, the new variant appears in the population after a few generations and is not produced when the original phenotype is bred with it, but is produced when the new variant is bred with it. This suggests that the new variant has evolved independently of the original population, leading to the development of a new phenotype. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
