Terabyte (2^40 or approximately 10^12 bytes)\n\nThis is because the average number of words per page is 10, which is equivalent to 10^2 bytes. The average number of lines per page is 50, which is equivalent to 50^2 bytes. The average number of pages per book is 400, which is equivalent to 400^2 bytes.
