Yes, the attacker cannot generate a valid tag for any message.\n\nA MAC (Message Authentication Code) is designed to ensure that the message has not been tampered with or altered. In the case of a MAC I = (S,V), where S(k,m) is a 5-bit long tag, the attacker cannot generate a valid tag for any message because the tag is a 5-bit long and the MAC is designed to be 5-bit long. Therefore, the attacker cannot generate a valid tag for any message, making the MAC secure."
