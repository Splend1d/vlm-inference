                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The pressure in the knee is greater than the pressure in the neck because of the increase in pressure head. According to Bernoulli's principle, the pressure in a fluid is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point of minimum pressure (the point of minimum pressure is the point where the fluid is flowing through the capillary). Since the neck is closer to the point of minimum pressure than the knee, the pressure in the neck is greater than the pressure in the knee."
