If banks hold excess reserves, they can lend out more money than they initially deposit, which can lead to an increase in the money supply. However, if banks hold too much reserves, they may not be able to lend out as much money as they hold, which can lead to a decrease in the money supply. Therefore, holding excess reserves is a key factor in the fractional reserve banking system's ability to create money."
