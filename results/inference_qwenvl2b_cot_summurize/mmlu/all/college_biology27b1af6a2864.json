To test this hypothesis, the experiment should focus on the behavior of ants in the absence of these insects. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Remove leaf-feeding insects and measure subsequent ant density.\n\nThis approach isolates the effect of leaf-feeding insects on ant behavior and density, allowing for a clear comparison of the effects of removing these insects versus leaving them in the system."
