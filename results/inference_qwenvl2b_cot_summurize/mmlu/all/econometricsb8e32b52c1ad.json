(i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nVAR (Vector Autoregression) models are advantageous over full structural models in several ways:\n\ni) VARs receive strong motivation from financial and economic theory: This is because VARs are a natural extension of the autoregressive model, which is a cornerstone of financial and economic theory. They allow for the modeling of multiple time series variables simultaneously, which is a common requirement in financial and economic analysis.\n\nii) VARs in their reduced forms can be used easily to produce time-series forecasts: This is because VARs are designed to be used in a reduced form, which means that they can be used to forecast future values of the variables in the model based on past values. This is a powerful feature for time-series forecasting.\n\niii) VAR models are typically highly parsimonious: This is because VARs are designed to be highly parsimonious, meaning that they can capture the relationships between variables with fewer parameters than a full structural model. This makes them easier to interpret and more computationally efficient.\n\niv) OLS can be applied separately to each equation in a reduced form VAR: This is because VARs are designed to be used in a reduced form, which means that they can be used to forecast future values of the variables in the model based on past values. This is a powerful feature for time-series forecasting."
