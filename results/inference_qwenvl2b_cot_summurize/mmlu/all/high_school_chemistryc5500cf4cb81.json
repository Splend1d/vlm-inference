This step is exothermic because it involves breaking the intermolecular forces between the solvent molecules, releasing energy.\n\n2. **Step 2:** Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent. This step is also exothermic because it involves breaking the intermolecular forces between the solute molecules, releasing energy.\n\n3. **Step 3:** Separated solute and solvent are brought together, filling in the spaces.
