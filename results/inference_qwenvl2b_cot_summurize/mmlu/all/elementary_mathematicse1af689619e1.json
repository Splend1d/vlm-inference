Since 1 pint is equal to 2 cups, Erin drinks \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\) cups of juice each day.\n\nTo find out how many days it will take for Erin to drink all 24 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups she drinks each day:\n\n\\[ \\text{Days} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cups}}{\\text{Cups per Day}} = \\frac{24}{24} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, Erin will take 2 days to drink all of the juice she made.
