There will be less precipitation in those clear-cut areas.\n\nClear-cutting tropical rain forests leads to a significant reduction in the amount of rainfall that falls in those areas. This is because the trees and other vegetation that provide shade and moisture are removed, leading to a decrease in the amount of water that can be absorbed by the soil and the air. As a result, the area becomes drier and less conducive to plant growth, which can have negative impacts on the local ecosystem and the local population."
