So, the list is an arithmetic sequence with first term $a_1 = 25$, last term $a_n = 100$, and common difference $d = 1$.\n\nThe formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$. We can use this formula to find the number of terms in the list.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get $100 = 25 + (n - 1) \\cdot 1$. Simplifying this equation gives $100 = 25 + n - 1$, or $100 = 24 + n$. Solving for $n$, we find $n = 76$.\n\nSo, there are 76 numbers in the list. The answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
