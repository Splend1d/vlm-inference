He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.\nThe most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.\nThe circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\nI believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.\nI believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\nI do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.\nAll national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.\nI do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\n\u2014Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason, 1794\u20131795\nPaine's statement in the last sentence, criticizing persecution, was most likely influenced by which of the following?\n\nA. New concepts of legal equity and individual rights expressed by Locke and Rousseau\nB. Europeans gaining a more thorough understanding of the rich cultural diversity through trade and travel\nC. New concepts of a deterministic mechanical universe based upon the discovery of Newton's mathematical laws\nD.

Challenges to the monopoly on truth held by the Roman Catholic Church on multiple fronts\n\nThomas Paine's statement in the last sentence, criticizing persecution, was most likely influenced by the challenges to the monopoly on truth held by the Roman Catholic Church on multiple fronts. Paine was a proponent of the Enlightenment, which emphasized the importance of reason and individual rights, and he was particularly critical of the Catholic Church's role in suppressing dissent and promoting a monopoly on truth."
