Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **Younger politicians who are more comfortable with the media are gradually displacing older politicians.**\n   - This option suggests a natural trend where younger politicians become more comfortable with the media, potentially replacing older politicians. This could imply a positive relationship between the two groups, as younger politicians might be more adept at navigating the media landscape.\n\nB. **Government regulations on interaction between the two groups are very strict.**\n   - This option suggests that there are strict regulations in place that limit the interaction between politicians and political reporters. This could imply a negative relationship, as the regulations might hinder the natural adversarial nature of their relationship.\n\nC. **Each group is dependent on the other to perform its job effectively.**\n   - This option suggests that both groups rely on each other for their effectiveness. This implies a mutual dependency, which could be seen as a positive relationship, as it indicates that both groups are essential for the functioning of the political system.\n\nD. **Very few media outlets will cover a story that is embarrassing to a political leader.**\n   - This option suggests that media outlets are cautious about covering stories that might be embarrassing to political leaders. This could imply a negative relationship, as it might limit the adversarial nature of their relationship by avoiding certain types of coverage.\n\nGiven the context of the problem, the most appropriate option is:\n\n**C. Each group is dependent on the other to perform its job effectively.**\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that both groups are interdependent, which could be seen as a positive relationship."
