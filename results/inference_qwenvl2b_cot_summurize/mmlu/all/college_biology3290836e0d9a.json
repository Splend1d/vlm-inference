Many more geese nest on the beaches than on the cliffs.\n- This option suggests that beach nesting is more common, which could imply that beach nesting is more advantageous. However, it does not directly address the survival rates of geese after hatching.\n\nB. Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.\n- This option suggests that cliff nesting is more advantageous than beach nesting. However, it does not directly address the survival rates of geese after hatching.\n\nC. Chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time.\n- This option suggests that cliff nesting is adaptive because the geese instinctively know when to jump off the cliffs. This would imply that cliff nesting is advantageous because it allows the geese to reach the ocean more quickly and survive the fall.\n\nD. More chicks survive the fall from the cliffs than are killed.\n- This option suggests that cliff nesting is adaptive because it results in more chicks surviving the fall. However, it does not directly address the survival rates of geese after hatching.\n\nGiven the context, option C is the most consistent with the hypothesis that cliff nesting is adaptive in this goose species because it directly addresses the survival rates of geese after hatching, suggesting that cliff nesting is advantageous due to the instinctual behavior of the geese to jump off the cliffs.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent hypothesis is:\n\nC. Chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time."
