The statement \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar, but neither Janet nor Latoya did\" can be translated into predicate logic as follows:\n\n- Let Lm represent \"Ms. Jackson lent you some sugar.\"\n- Let Jl represent \"Janet lent you some sugar.\"\n- Let Ll represent \"Latoya lent you some sugar.\"\n\nThe statement can be translated into predicate logic as:\n\nLm \u2228 ~(Jl \u2228 Ll)\n\nThis means that Lm is true, and neither Jl nor Ll is true.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Lm \u2228 ~(Jl \u2228 Ll)\n- This option is not correct because it does not capture the essence of the original statement.\n\nB. Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2022 Ll)\n- This option is not correct because it does not capture the essence of the original statement.\n\nC. Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2228 Ll)\n- This option is not correct because it does not capture the essence of the original statement.\n\nD. Lm \u2228 ~(Lj \u2022 Ll)\n- This option is correct because it captures the essence of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic is:\n\nD.
