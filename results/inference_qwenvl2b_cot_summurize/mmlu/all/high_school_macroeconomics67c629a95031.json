Therefore, the amount of money that the bank can lend out is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount of money to lend out} = \\text{Deposit} \\times \\text{Reserve requirement} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Amount of money to lend out} = \\$1000 \\times 0.20 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Amount of money to lend out} = \\$200 \\]\n\nThis amount of money is then lent out to other banks, creating new loans.
