The MnO4- : Mn2+ ratio is 3:1.\n\nTo balance the equation, we need to ensure that the number of each type of ion on both sides of the equation is equal. The balanced equation is:\n\nMnO4\u2212 + 4I\u2212 + 6H+ \u2192 3Mn2+ + 2IO3\u2212 + 6H2O\n\nFrom this balanced equation, we can see that the MnO4- : Mn2+ ratio is 3:1."
