The scenario does not provide any evidence of a recent common ancestor or any genetic changes leading to the current distribution of mouse colors.\n\nB. **The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.**\n   - This statement is not supported by the information. The scenario does not mention any mutations or genetic changes leading to the current distribution of mouse colors.\n\nC. **Selection favors some phenotypes over others.**\n   - This statement is supported by the information. The scenario indicates that the color of the mice is influenced by the environment they inhabit. Dark-colored mice are found in the lava formations, which are darker, and light-colored mice are found in the desert, which is lighter. This suggests that the color of the mice is a result of selection pressures from their environment.\n\nD. **Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.**\n   - This statement is supported by the information.
