The pH of a weak acid solution is given by the formula:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\nwhere [H+] is the concentration of hydronium ions in the solution.\n\nWe are given that the pH of the solution is 4.26. We can rearrange the formula to solve for [H+]:\n\n[H+] = 10^-pH\n\nSubstituting the given pH value:\n\n[H+] = 10^-4.26 = 1.68 x 10^-5 M\n\nNow, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pKa of the acid:\n\npKa = -log(Ka)\n\nwhere Ka is the acid dissociation constant. We can use the relationship between the acid dissociation constant and the concentration of hydronium ions to find Ka:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for [A-]:\n\n[A-] = Ka[H+]/[H+]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n[A-] = (1.68 x 10^-5 M)(1.68 x 10^-5 M)/(1.68 x 10^-5 M) = 1.68 x 10^-5 M\n\nNow, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pKa:\n\npKa = -log(Ka)\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\npKa = -log(1.68 x 10^-5 M) = 5.26\n\nTherefore, the pKa of the weak acid is 5.26, which corresponds to option D."
