It shows that an increase in the unemployment rate leads to a decrease in the inflation rate, and vice versa. This relationship is typically represented by a downward-sloping curve, which means that as the unemployment rate increases, the inflation rate decreases, and vice versa. The curve is named after the economist Arthur Okun Phillips, who first described it in the 1950s."
