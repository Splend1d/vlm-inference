Since A = A^(-1), this means that A is its own inverse, which implies that A is invertible and has a non-zero determinant. Therefore, the trace of A is non-zero.\n\nThe trace of a matrix is always non-negative, so the trace of A must be greater than or equal to 0. However, the trace of A is also equal to the sum of the eigenvalues of A. Since A is invertible, it must have at least one eigenvalue of 1 (the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 1 is equal to the number of times it appears in the diagonal of A). Therefore, the trace of A is at least 1.\n\nSince the trace of A is greater than or equal to 0 and at least 1, the only possible value for the trace of A is 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
