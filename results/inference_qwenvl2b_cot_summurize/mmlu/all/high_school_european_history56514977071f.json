The Navigation Acts were designed to regulate the importation of goods into England and other British colonies, primarily to protect English merchants and to prevent the importation of goods from Europe that were cheaper than those produced in England.\n\nLet's break down the key provisions of the Navigation Acts:\n\n1. **Prohibition of imports from Asia, Africa, and America**: The acts prohibited the importation of goods from Asia, Africa, and America, as well as from islands belonging to them, into England or Ireland. This was intended to protect English merchants by preventing them from being undercut by cheaper goods from these regions.\n\n2. **Prohibition of imports from Europe**: The acts also prohibited the importation of goods from Europe, including those from the mainland of Europe, into England or Ireland. This was intended to protect English merchants by preventing them from being undercut by cheaper goods from Europe.\n\n3. **Restrictions on foreign ships and vessels**: The acts restricted the importation of goods into England and Ireland only to ships and vessels that belonged to the people of England or the colonies. This was intended to protect English merchants by preventing them from being undercut by foreign merchants.\n\n4. **Penalties for importing contrary to the act**: The acts imposed penalties on anyone who imported goods contrary to the act, including the loss of goods and the forfeiture of the goods.\n\nGiven these provisions, the Navigation Acts were designed to protect English merchants by preventing them from being undercut by cheaper goods from Europe and Asia, and by restricting the importation of goods from Europe to protect English merchants from foreign competition.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. **To prevent England's colonies from being bombarded with cheap goods manufactured by their mainland European competitors**: This option is not directly addressed by the Navigation Acts. The acts were primarily focused on protecting English merchants and not on preventing the importation of goods from Europe.\n\nB. **To reclaim domination of the slave trade from Portugal in order to meet the growing need for slaves for sugar plantations in the English Caribbean colonies**: This option is not directly addressed by the Navigation Acts. The acts were primarily focused on regulating the importation of goods into England and Ireland, not on the slave trade or the need for slaves for sugar plantations.\n\nC. **To end Dutch domination of maritime trade by limiting their ability to move goods between England and her colonies as well as goods to and from England from other countries**: This option is not directly addressed by the Navigation Acts. The acts were primarily focused on regulating the importation of goods into England and Ireland, not on maritime trade or the need for goods to be moved between England and other countries.\n\nD. **To extricate the French from the Atlantic sea trade as well as the cod and whaling industries which at this time were dominated by the French**: This option is not directly addressed by the Navigation Acts. The acts were primarily focused on regulating the importation of goods into England and Ireland, not on the cod and whaling industries or the need for French goods to be imported.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, it is clear that the Navigation Acts were primarily designed to protect English merchants by preventing them from being undercut by cheaper goods from Europe and Asia, and by restricting the importation of goods from Europe to protect English merchants from foreign competition.\n\nTherefore, the desired outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651 was:\n\n**C. To end Dutch domination of maritime trade by limiting their ability to move goods between England and her colonies as well as goods to and from England from other countries**"
