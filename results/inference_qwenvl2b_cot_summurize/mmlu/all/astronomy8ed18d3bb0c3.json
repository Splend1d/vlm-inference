The presence of an atmosphere allows for the formation of clouds, which can lead to the formation of volcanoes and the release of gases that can affect the planet's atmosphere and climate. Additionally, the presence of an atmosphere can also affect the planet's tectonic activity, as it can influence the movement of tectonic plates and the formation of mountains and valleys."
