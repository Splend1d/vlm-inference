American interest rates fall relative to interest rates in other countries.\n\nWhen American interest rates fall, it becomes cheaper for Americans to borrow money abroad, which can lead to an increase in foreign investment and a depreciation of the dollar. This is because the dollar becomes more attractive to foreign investors as it becomes cheaper to borrow money from abroad. Conversely, when American interest rates rise, it becomes more expensive for Americans to borrow money abroad, which can lead to a depreciation of the dollar."
