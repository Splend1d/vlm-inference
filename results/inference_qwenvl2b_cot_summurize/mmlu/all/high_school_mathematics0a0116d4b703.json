The greatest quotient will be achieved when we choose the largest fraction and the smallest fraction, because the fraction with the smallest denominator will give the greatest quotient.\n\nThe largest fraction is $\\frac{10}{5} = 2$ and the smallest fraction is $\\frac{2}{5}$. Therefore, the greatest possible quotient is $\\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 5"
