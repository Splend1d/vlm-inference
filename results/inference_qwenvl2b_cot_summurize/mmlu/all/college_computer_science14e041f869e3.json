The number of nonterminal nodes is equal to the number of leaves (N-1) because each nonterminal node has exactly one child.\n2. The number of leaves is equal to the number of nodes in the tree, which is N.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the number of nonterminal nodes to the total number of nodes is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{N-1}{N} = 1 - \\frac{1}{N} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{N} - \\frac{1}{N} = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. log_10 (1/N)"
