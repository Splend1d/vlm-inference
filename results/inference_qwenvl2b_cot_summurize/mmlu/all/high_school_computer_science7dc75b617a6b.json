An e-mail indicating that you have won a large sum of money and asking you to enter your bank account number so that the money can be transferred to you is LEAST likely to indicate a phishing attack. Phishing attacks typically involve emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, such as your bank or utility company, and ask you to provide personal information or click on a link. In contrast, a phishing attack is designed to trick you into revealing sensitive information, such as your bank account number or social security number, which can be used to steal your money or identity. Therefore, the answer is D."
