The subgroup \\( HK \\) is not necessarily a subgroup of \\( G \\) if \\( H \\) or \\( K \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\). For example, consider the group \\( G = \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\) (the integers modulo 6) and the subgroups \\( H = \\{0, 2\\} \\) and \\( K = \\{0, 3\\} \\). Here, \\( H \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\) because \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\) and \\( H \\cap K = \\{0\\} \\). However, \\( HK = \\{0, 2, 4\\} \\) is not a subgroup of \\( G \\) because it does not contain the identity element of \\( G \\).\n\nStatement 2: All groups of order \\( p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is prime are Abelian.\n\nThis statement is true. The group \\( G \\) of order \\( p^2 \\) where \\( p \\) is prime is cyclic, and all cyclic groups of prime order are Abelian. For example, the group \\( G = \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) (the integers modulo \\( p \\)) is cyclic and Abelian.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
