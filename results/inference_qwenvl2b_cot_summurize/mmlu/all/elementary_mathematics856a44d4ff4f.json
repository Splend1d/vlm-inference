Let's denote the number of students taking tap lessons as \\(x\\).\n\nAccording to the problem, 4 out of 9 students take tap lessons. This can be represented as:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{x}{72} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), we cross-multiply:\n\\[ 4 \\times 72 = 9 \\times x \\]\n\\[ 288 = 9x \\]\n\nNow, divide both sides by 9 to solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{288}{9} \\]\n\\[ x = 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of students taking tap lessons is 32, which corresponds to option A."
