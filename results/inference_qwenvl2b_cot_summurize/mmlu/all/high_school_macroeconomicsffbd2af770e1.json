If the average price level tripled, the nominal income would triple as well. Since Robin's income increased from $300000 to $600000, the nominal income would also increase by the same amount.\n\n2. **Real Income**: Real income is the income adjusted for inflation. If the average price level tripled, the real income would decrease by the same amount. Since Robin's income increased, the real income would also increase by the same amount.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. (B) Increased \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increased**"
