A baseball player hits baseballs from a tee in order to build muscle memory.\nB. A concert flute player falls short of finishing a piece that has a very complex ending without mistakes\nC. A high school English student submits a paper for review by his professor.\nD. A high diver takes instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move.\n"

A high diver takes instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move.\n\nIn Vygotsky's sociocultural development theory, the zone of proximal development refers to the stage of cognitive development where individuals are capable of learning new skills or concepts but require guidance or support from an adult to achieve them. This is because the individual is not yet capable of performing the task independently. In the case of the high diver, taking instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move is an example of learning that requires guidance, which is within the zone of proximal development."
