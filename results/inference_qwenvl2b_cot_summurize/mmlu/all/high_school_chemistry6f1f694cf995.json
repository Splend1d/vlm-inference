Therefore, the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair in solution is:\n\n[HNO2] = [HNO3] = 10^-pKa = 10^-1.9 = 0.019 M\n\nSince the pH of the solution is 4.2, the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair is:\n\n[HNO2] = [HNO3] = 10^-pH = 10^-4.2 = 0.0019 M\n\nTherefore, the concentration of the conjugate acid/base pair is the same as the concentration of nitrous acid, which is 0.019 M.
