This is because the number of permutations of n elements is given by n factorial (n!), and for n = 10, the maximum possible order is 10! = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3,628,800. However, since we are only considering the maximum possible order for an element of S_n, we need to divide this number by n! to get the maximum possible order for an element of S_n for n = 10. This gives us 3,628,800 / 10! = 3,628,800 / 3,628,800 = 105. Therefore, the maximum possible order for an element of S_n for n = 10 is 105. The correct answer is D."
