The product of two consecutive integers is always even, and the product of two consecutive integers is also divisible by their difference, which is $1990 - 1991 = -1$.\n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n$$1\\times(-1) = -1$$\n\nThe counting number equivalent to the expression is $-1$, which corresponds to option A."
