The scores she earned previously were between 75 and 89.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. The mode will increase.\n   - The mode is the score that appears most frequently. Since Marguerite earned a score of 100 on her next test, which is a unique score, the mode will not increase.\n\nB. The mean will increase.\n   - The mean is the sum of all scores divided by the number of scores. If Marguerite's scores were between 75 and 89, and she earned a score of 100 on her next test, the mean would be higher because the score of 100 is higher than the scores she previously earned.\n\nC. The mean will decrease.\n   - This is not necessarily true. The mean can increase or decrease depending on the distribution of scores. If Marguerite's scores were between 75 and 89 and she earned a score of 100, the mean could increase or decrease, depending on the distribution of the previous scores.\n\nD. The median will decrease.\n   - The median is the middle score when the scores are arranged in order. If Marguerite's scores were between 75 and 89 and she earned a score of 100, the median would be higher because the score of 100 is higher than the scores she previously earned.\n\nGiven the options, the statement that is true is:\n\nB. The mean will increase."
