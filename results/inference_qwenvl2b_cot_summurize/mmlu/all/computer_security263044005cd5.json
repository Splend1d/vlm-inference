This property is particularly useful in scenarios where the encryption key is shared between two parties and is used to encrypt messages that are sent before the key is compromised. In the context of Alice and Bob's concern, if an adversary were to compromise one of their computers today, they would not be able to decrypt messages sent before the encryption key was compromised, as the encryption key would have been used to encrypt those messages."
