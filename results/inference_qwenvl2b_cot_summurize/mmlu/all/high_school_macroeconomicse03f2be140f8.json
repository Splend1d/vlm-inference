If the Fed decreases the money supply, the value of the dollar depreciates.\n\nWhen the Fed decreases the money supply, it reduces the amount of money in circulation, which leads to a decrease in the money supply multiplier. This results in a lower money supply, which in turn leads to a decrease in the value of the dollar."
