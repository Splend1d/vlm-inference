The sum of the degrees of all vertices in a connected graph is always even, because the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a connected graph is equal to twice the number of edges (since each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices). Therefore, \u03a3_{v\u2208V} degree(v) is even.\n\nII. |E| \u2265 |V| \u2212 1.\n   - This statement is also true. The number of edges in a graph is always greater than or equal to the number of vertices minus one. This is because each edge connects two vertices, and there are exactly two edges for each vertex, making the total number of edges equal to the number of vertices minus one.\n\nIII. G has at least one vertex with degree 1.\n   - This statement is false. A graph can have a vertex with degree 1, but it can also have a vertex with degree 2 or more. For example, a complete graph on n vertices (where each vertex is connected to every other vertex) has n vertices with degree 2 and n-1 vertices with degree 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. I and II"
