It can be isomorphic to a non-cyclic group, such as the direct product of two cyclic groups of different orders.\n\nStatement 2: The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12.\n- This statement is false. The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is not isomorphic to D_12. The order of the external direct product of two groups is the product of the orders of the groups, but the structure of the resulting group is not necessarily isomorphic to the direct product of the groups. In this case, the external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12, but it is not isomorphic to D_12.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
