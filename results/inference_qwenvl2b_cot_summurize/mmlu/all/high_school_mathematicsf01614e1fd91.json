According to the problem, we have the equation $x^2 + 85 = (x - 17)^2$.\n\nExpanding the right side of the equation, we get $x^2 + 85 = x^2 - 34x + 289$.\n\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides, we get $85 = -34x + 289$.\n\nSubtracting $289$ from both sides, we get $-204 = -34x$.\n\nDividing both sides by $-34$, we get $x = \\frac{-204}{-34} = 6$.\n\nSo the number is $\\boxed{6}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{6}$."
