This is because the derivative \\(f'(x)\\) is non-positive, indicating that the function is concave down.\n\nSince \\(f(3) = 5\\), and \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing, the function will approach 5 as \\(x\\) approaches 3 from both the left and the right. Therefore, the greatest possible value of \\(f(0)\\) is 5.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 5"
