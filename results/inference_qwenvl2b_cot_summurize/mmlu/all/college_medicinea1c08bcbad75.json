At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher\u2019s observation?\n\nA. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\nD.

Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\n- This option suggests that variable ratio schedules (where the reward is given after a certain number of responses) are more effective in maintaining behavior. However, the teacher's observation is about the behavior change in response to a fixed-ratio schedule (where the reward is given after a fixed number of responses), not the extinction of tardiness.\n\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\n- This option suggests that intrinsic motivation (the intrinsic desire to perform well) is a factor in the behavior change. However, intrinsic motivation is not directly related to the specific schedules used in the reward system.\n\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\n- This option suggests that the fixed-ratio schedule (where the reward is given after a fixed number of responses) is more effective in maintaining behavior. This is consistent with the teacher's observation that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but tardiness has only decreased slightly.\n\nD. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a variable-interval schedule than it was to a fixed-ratio schedule.\n- This option suggests that the variable-interval schedule (where the reward is given after a variable number of responses) is more effective in maintaining behavior. However, the teacher's observation is about the behavior change in response to a fixed-ratio schedule, not the variable-interval schedule.\n\nGiven the teacher's observation that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but tardiness has only decreased slightly, the best explanation is:\n\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
