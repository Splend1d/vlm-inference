This is because the operation of matrix multiplication is associative, the set is closed under multiplication, and the identity matrix and the inverse of any matrix exist.\n\nStatement 2 is false. The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 forms a group under matrix multiplication. This is because the determinant of a matrix is a scalar, and the determinant of the identity matrix is 1. However, the determinant of any non-identity matrix is not necessarily 1, so the set does not form a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
