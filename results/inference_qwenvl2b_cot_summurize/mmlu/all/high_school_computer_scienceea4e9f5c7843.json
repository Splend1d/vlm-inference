The issue is that the procedure is counting the occurrences of val in the list myList, but it is not counting the occurrences of val in the list itself. To fix this, we need to change the statement in line 6 to check if the item is equal to val, instead of checking if the item is equal to the count of val in the list. This will ensure that the procedure correctly counts the occurrences of val in the list itself. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
