                    "text": "To find the area of the square, we first need to rewrite the given equation in a form that allows us to identify the relationship between the circle and the square. The given equation is:\n\n\\[2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\\]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to group the $x$ and $y$ terms:\n\n\\[2x^2 + 12x = -2y^2 - 4y + 20\\]\n\nNow, let's complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms. To do this, we need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of $x$ and $y$ to both sides of the equation. The coefficient of $x$ is 12, so half of it is 6, and its square is 36. The coefficient of $y$ is -4, so half of it is -2, and its square is 4. Adding and subtracting 36 and 4, respectively, to both sides, we get:\n\n\\[2x^2 + 12x + 36 = -2y^2 - 4y + 20 + 36 - 4\\]\n\n\\[2(x^2 + 6x + 36) = -2(y^2 + 2y + 4) + 20 + 36 - 4\\]\n\n\\[2(x + 6)^2 = -2(y + 2)^2 + 40\\]\n\nNow, we can rewrite the equation in the form of a circle equation, which is $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius. Comparing this with our equation, we can see that the center of the circle is at $(-6, -2)$ and the radius is $\\sqrt{40}$.\n\nThe side length of the square is equal to the radius of the circle, which is $\\sqrt{40}$. Therefore, the area of the square is the side length squared, which is:\n\n\\[(\\sqrt{40})^2 = 40\\]\n\nSo, the area of the square is 40, which corresponds to option D."
