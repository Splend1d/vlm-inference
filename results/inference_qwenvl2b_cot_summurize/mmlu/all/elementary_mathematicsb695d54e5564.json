According to the problem, she counted 34 more birds in the morning than in the afternoon, which means she counted \\(x + 34\\) birds in the morning.\n\nThe total number of birds she counted in the afternoon and morning is given as 76. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[x + (x + 34) = 76\\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[2x + 34 = 76\\]\n\nSubtract 34 from both sides:\n\n\\[2x = 42\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\[x = 21\\]\n\nTherefore, Keiko counted 21 birds in the afternoon. The correct answer is:\n\nA. 21 birds"
