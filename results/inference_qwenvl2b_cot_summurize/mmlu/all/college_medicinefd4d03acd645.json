In this scenario, the pedestrian is initially struck by the young woman's wealth and ethnicity, which makes her appear less likeable and deserving of help. \n\nGiven this context, the pedestrian would likely be more likely to help the young woman if she were perceived to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one. This would make her appear more likeable and deserving of assistance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one"
