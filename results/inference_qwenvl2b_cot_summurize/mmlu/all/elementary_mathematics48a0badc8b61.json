Since she earns $5.50 per hour, the total amount she earns in \\(h\\) hours is \\(5.50h\\).\n\nWe know that she needs to earn $132, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[5.50h = 132\\]\n\nTo find \\(h\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 5.50:\n\n\\[h = \\frac{132}{5.50}\\]\n\n\\[h = 24\\]\n\nTherefore, Mai needs to work 24 hours to earn $132. The correct answer is C. 24."
