This is because each divisor appears in the product $n^6$ exactly $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ times (since there are $n$ divisors and each divides $n$ times, and each divisor divides $n-1$ times, and so on, until it divides $1$ times). Therefore, the product of the positive divisors of $n$ is $n^6$.\n\nWe want to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the product of its positive divisors is $n^6$. This means we want to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n^6 = n^6$.\n\nThis equation is true for all positive integers $n$, so the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the condition is $n = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{1}$."
