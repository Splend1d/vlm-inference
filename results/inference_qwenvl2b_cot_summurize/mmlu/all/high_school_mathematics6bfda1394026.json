We are given that $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, and $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\nFrom the first two congruences, we can write $n = 4k + 1$ for some integer $k$.\nSubstituting this into the third congruence, we get $4k + 1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$.\nSimplifying, we have $4k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$.\nMultiplying both sides by the inverse of 4 modulo 5, which is 4 (since $4 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$), we get $k \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$.\nSo $k = 5m + 4$ for some integer $m$.\nSubstituting this back into $n = 4k + 1$, we get $n = 4(5m + 4) + 1 = 20m + 16$.\nSince $n$ is a whole number, $20m + 16$ must be a multiple of 20.\nThe smallest such $m$ is 1, so $n = 20(1) + 16 = 37$.\nTherefore, the smallest whole number that satisfies all three congruences is 37.\nThe answer is: $\\boxed{37}$"
