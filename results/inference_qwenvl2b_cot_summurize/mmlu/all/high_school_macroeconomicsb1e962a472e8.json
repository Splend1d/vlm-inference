The economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n\nThis inference is based on the fact that an expansionary fiscal policy leads to a large increase in real output and a small increase in the price level. In an economy with a small increase in the price level, the increase in real output suggests that the economy is not fully utilized. This implies that there are some unemployed resources in the economy, as the economy is not producing at its full potential. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
