                    "text": "To find the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the 5 rolls, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\n\\[P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(n\\) is the number of trials (in this case, 5 rolls),\n- \\(k\\) is the number of successful outcomes (in this case, getting a 6),\n- \\(p\\) is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, the probability of rolling a 6 on a single roll of the die),\n- \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which calculates the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) successes out of \\(n\\) trials.\n\nFor getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls, we need to calculate the probabilities for getting a 6 exactly 2 times and exactly 3 times, and then sum these probabilities.\n\n1. Probability of getting a 6 exactly 2 times:\n\\[P(X = 2) = \\binom{5}{2} (1/6)^2 (5/6)^3\\]\n\n2. Probability of getting a 6 exactly 3 times:\n\\[P(X = 3) = \\binom{5}{3} (1/6)^3 (5/6)^2\\]\n\nThe total probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls is the sum of these two probabilities:\n\n\\[P(X \\leq 2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3)\\]\n\nLet's calculate these probabilities:\n\n1. \\(\\binom{5}{2} = 10\\)\n2. \\((1/6)^2 = 1/36 = 1/36 = 1/36\\)\n3. \\((5/6)^3 = 5/216 = 5/216\\)\n4. \\(\\binom{5}{3} = 10\\)\n5. \\((1/6)^3 = 1/216 = 1/216\\)\n6. \\((5/6)^2 = 25/324 = 25/324 = 25/324\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities:\n\n1. \\(P(X = 2) = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{36} \\times \\frac{5}{216} = \\frac{10 \\times 5}{36 \\times 216} = \\frac{50}{7560} = \\frac{25}{3780} = \\frac{25}{3780}\\)\n2. \\(P(X = 3) = 10 \\times \\frac{1}{36} \\times \\frac{25}{324} = \\frac{10 \\times 25}{36 \\times 324} = \\frac{250}{11504} = \\frac{250}{11504}\\)\n\nNow, let's add these probabilities:\n\n\\[P(X \\leq 2) = \\frac{25}{3780} + \\frac{250}{11504} = \\frac{25}{3780} + \\frac{250}{11504}\\]\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 11504:\n\n\\[P(X \\leq 2) = \\frac{25 \\times 4}{3780 \\times 4} + \\frac{250 \\times 3}{11504 \\times 3} = \\frac{100}{15120} + \\frac{750}{34512}\\]\n\n\\[P(X \\leq 2) = \\frac{100 + 750}{15120 \\times 3} = \\frac{760}{453600} = \\frac{760}{453600}\\]\n\n\\[P(X \\leq 2) = \\frac{760}{453600} = \\frac{760}{453600} = \\frac{760}{453600}\\]\n\n\\[P(X \\leq 2) = \\frac{760}{453600} = \\frac{760}{453600}\\]\n\n\\[P(X \\leq 2) = \\frac{"
