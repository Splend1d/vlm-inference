A young macaque monkey learning to rinse off food in the ocean from an older monkey, even when the food is not covered in dirt or sand.\n- This example illustrates the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture, as the monkey is learning a new behavior from an older monkey, which is a form of cultural transmission.\n\nII. A child learning the rules of baseball from a parent.\n- This example also illustrates the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture, as the child is learning a new skill from an adult, which is a form of cultural transmission.\n\nIII. A new group of inductees in a military organization experiencing hazing rituals from older students, which they then later carry out on new recruits.\n- This example does not illustrate the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. Instead, it shows a form of cultural transmission where the older students are teaching the younger ones, but it is not a symbolic cultural transmission.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. III only"
