This is because the pressure at the bottom of a pond is determined by the weight of the water, which is proportional to the depth of the pond. The pressure at the bottom of the pond is also affected by the density of the water, which is a function of temperature and other factors. The surface area of the pond does not affect the pressure at the bottom of the pond. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
