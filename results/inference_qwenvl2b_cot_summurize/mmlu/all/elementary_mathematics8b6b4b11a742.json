So, the time he has left to type is 25 minutes.\n\nTo find out how many words he can type in 25 minutes, we divide the total number of words by the time left:\n\n\\[ \\text{Words per minute} = \\frac{\\text{Total words}}{\\text{Time left}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Words per minute} = \\frac{550}{25} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Words per minute} = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, Marshall must type at least 22 words per minute to finish his paper on time.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 22 words per minute."
