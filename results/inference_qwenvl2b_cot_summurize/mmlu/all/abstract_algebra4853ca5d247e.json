This is because the square of an element in a group does not necessarily depend on the group's structure or the specific elements involved. For example, in the group of integers under addition, if a and b are not equal, then a^2 is not equal to b^2, but this is not necessarily true for all groups.\n\nStatement 2 is true. The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup. This is because a dihedral group is a group of symmetries of a regular polygon, and the set of rotations forms a subgroup because it is closed under composition (the composition of two rotations is another rotation), and it contains the identity element (the rotation that leaves the polygon unchanged). Additionally, it is cyclic because it has an infinite number of rotations that can be generated by a single rotation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
