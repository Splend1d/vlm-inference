The rate is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the number of days it took to travel that distance.\n\nFor the humpback whales:\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Days}} = \\frac{2,240 \\text{ miles}}{28 \\text{ days}} = 80 \\text{ miles/day} \\]\n\nFor the gray whales:\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Days}} = \\frac{2,368 \\text{ miles}}{32 \\text{ days}} = 75 \\text{ miles/day} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate how many miles the humpback whales would have traveled in 32 days at their original rate:\n\\[ \\text{Distance in 32 days} = \\text{Rate} \\times \\text{Days} = 80 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 32 \\text{ days} = 2,560 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nFinally, we find out how many more miles the humpback whales would have traveled than the gray whales in 32 days:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = \\text{Distance in 32 days} - \\text{Distance for gray whales in 32 days} = 2,560 \\text{ miles} - 75 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 32 \\text{ days} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 2,560 \\text{ miles} - 2,368 \\text{ miles} = 192 \\text{ miles} \\]\n\nTherefore, the humpback whales would have traveled 192 more miles than the gray whales in 32 days.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 192."
