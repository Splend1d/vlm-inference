Chlorine has a higher dipole moment than fluorine.\nB. The intramolecular bonds in Cl2 are much weaker than those in F2.\nC. The Cl2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the F2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\nD. The mass of chlorine is much greater than the mass of fluorine.\n"

The Cl2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the F2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\n\nThe boiling point of a substance is influenced by the intermolecular forces between the molecules. In this case, the intermolecular forces between the chlorine molecules (Cl2) are stronger than those between the fluorine molecules (F2). This is because the chlorine molecule has a larger atomic radius and a larger dipole moment compared to the fluorine molecule. The larger dipole moment and larger atomic radius of the chlorine molecule result in stronger London forces between the molecules, which in turn lead to a higher boiling point. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
