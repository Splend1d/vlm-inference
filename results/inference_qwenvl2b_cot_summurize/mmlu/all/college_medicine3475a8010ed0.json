H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which results from the crystalline framework that forms due to hydrogen bonds.\n\nThe phase diagram for water shows that water exists in two forms: solid ice (H2O(s)) and liquid water (H2O(l)). The solid phase is denser than the liquid phase due to the hydrogen bonds that form between water molecules. These hydrogen bonds are stronger than the van der Waals forces that hold the liquid together, which is why ice is denser than water. This difference in density causes the solid to form liquid under high pressure conditions, as the hydrogen bonds are stronger under high pressure."
