It is not known whether either P_1 or P_2 can be solved in polynomial time.\n\nThis is because the problem of finding a shortest simple path (P_1) and the problem of finding a longest simple path (P_2) are both NP-hard problems. This means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm that can solve either problem efficiently, and it is not known whether there is a polynomial-time algorithm for either problem. Therefore, we cannot determine whether P_1 or P_2 can be solved in polynomial time based on the given information."
