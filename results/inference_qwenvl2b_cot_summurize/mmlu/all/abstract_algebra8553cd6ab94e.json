In the ring \\(Z_3 \\times Z_3\\), the multiplicative identity is 1, and the additive identity is 0.\n\nLet's check if \\(n \\cdot 0 = 0\\) and \\(n \\cdot 1 = 0\\) for \\(n = 3\\):\n\n- \\(3 \\cdot 0 = 0\\) (since 3 is not divisible by 3, it does not satisfy the condition)\n- \\(3 \\cdot 1 = 3\\) (since 3 is divisible by 3, it satisfies the condition)\n\nTherefore, the characteristic of \\(Z_3 \\times Z_3\\) is 3.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 3."
