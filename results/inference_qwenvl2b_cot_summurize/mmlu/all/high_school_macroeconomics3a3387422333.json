Increase the price of automobiles: This is because the import quota restricts the number of foreign automobiles that can be imported into a country, leading to higher prices for consumers.\n\n2. Protect domestic producers: The import quota is designed to protect domestic producers by limiting the number of foreign automobiles that can be imported, thus ensuring that domestic producers have a competitive advantage.\n\n3. Protect domestic consumers: The import quota is expected to protect domestic consumers by preventing foreign producers from entering the market and competing with domestic producers. This can lead to higher prices for consumers, as domestic producers are able to charge more for their products due to the protectionist measures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. increase the price of automobiles and protect domestic producers at the expense of consumers."
