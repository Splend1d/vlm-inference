Their internal heat sources exert a pressure against the sides of the planets.\n\nJovian planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, have a thick, icy atmosphere that is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. This atmosphere is supported by the gravitational pull of the planet's large mass, which causes the atmosphere to bulge around the equator. The pressure of the atmosphere causes the planet's surface to bulge outward, creating a \"squashed\" appearance. This is similar to how a balloon would bulge when inflated with air."
