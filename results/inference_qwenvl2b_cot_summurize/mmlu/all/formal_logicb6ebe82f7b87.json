However, if ~F is true, then G must be true (from the second premise). Therefore, E \u2283 F is not necessarily true.\n\nB. F \u2283 G\n- This is not necessarily true. We need to consider the implications of the given premises. If F is true, then ~F must be false (from the first premise). However, if ~F is true, then G must be true (from the second premise).
