The streamlined body has a selective advantage in that environment.\n\nThe streamlined body shape of tuna, sharks, and dolphins is a result of natural selection, which has favored these animals to have a streamlined body to reduce drag and increase efficiency in their respective environments. This adaptation allows them to swim faster and more efficiently through the water, which is crucial for their survival in the ocean."
