Display the average.\n\nTo reduce the number of operations, we can change the order of the operations. Instead of adding value to sum and then dividing by count, we can add value to sum and then divide by count directly. This will eliminate the need for the division operation in line 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct change is:\n\nC. Interchanging line 6 and line 7"
