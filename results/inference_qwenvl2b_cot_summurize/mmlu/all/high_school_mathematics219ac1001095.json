To find the smallest positive integer with factors of 16, 15, and 12, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.\n\nThe LCM of 16, 15, and 12 is the smallest number that is divisible by all three numbers. \n\nFirst, we find the LCM of 16 and 15. The prime factorization of 16 is $2^2 \\cdot 3$ and the prime factorization of 15 is $3 \\cdot 5$. The LCM of 16 and 15 is $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 60$.\n\nNext, we find the LCM of 60 and 12. The prime factorization of 60 is $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$ and the prime factorization of 12 is $2^2 \\cdot 3$. The LCM of 60 and 12 is $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2 = 120$.\n\nFinally, we find the LCM of 120 and 12. The prime factorization of 120 is $2^4 \\cdot 3$ and the prime factorization of 12 is $2^2 \\cdot 3$. The LCM of 120 and 12 is $2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 96$.\n\nSo, the smallest positive integer with factors of 16, 15, and 12 is 96.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{96}$."
