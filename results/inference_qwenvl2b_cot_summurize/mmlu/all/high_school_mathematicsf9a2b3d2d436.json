So there are 5 choices for each of the 5 integers.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 integers from 5 choices is $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 5 integers from 5 choices with different tens digits is the number of ways to choose 5 integers from 5 choices, which is $\\binom{5}{5} = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the 5 integers have different tens digits is $\\frac{\\text{Number of ways to choose 5 integers with different tens digits}}{\\text{Total number of ways to choose 5 integers}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the probability that they each have a different tens digit, which is the probability that the 5 integers have different tens digits and the 5 integers have different hundreds digits. This is the product of the probabilities that each of the 5 integers has a different tens digit and a different hundreds digit.\n\nThe probability that the 5 integers have different tens digits is $\\frac{1}{5}$, and the probability that the 5 integers have different hundreds digits is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the 5 integers have different tens digits and different hundreds digits is $\\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the probability that they each have a different tens digit, which is the probability that the 5 integers have different tens digits. This is the reciprocal of the probability that they each have a different tens digit, which is $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{25}} = \\frac{25}{1} = 25$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
