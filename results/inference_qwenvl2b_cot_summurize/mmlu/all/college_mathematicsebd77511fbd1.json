For example, 10 modulo 7 equals 3, because 10 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 3.\n\n2. **Understanding the week**: The week has 7 days, and it repeats every 7 days. This means that if we add 7 to any day of the week, we will get the next day of the week.\n\n3. **Calculating the remainder**: We need to calculate 10^(10^(10)) modulo 7. This means we need to find the remainder when 10^(10^(10)) is divided by 7.\n\n4. **Calculating the remainder**: Let's calculate 10^(10^(10)) modulo 7:\n   - 10^1 = 10\n   - 10^2 = 100\n   - 10^3 = 1000\n   - 10^4 = 10000\n   - 10^5 = 100000\n   - 10^6 = 1000000\n   - 10^7 = 10000000\n   - 10^8 = 100000000\n   - 10^9 = 1000000000\n   - 10^10 = 10000000000\n\n   Now, let's find the remainder when 10^10 is divided by 7:\n   - 10^10 = 10000000000\n   - 10000000000 modulo 7 = 3\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The remainder when 10^(10^(10)) is divided by 7 is 3. This means 10^(10^(10)) is equivalent to 3 modulo 7. \n\n6. **Finding the day of the week**: Since 3 is equivalent to 3 modulo 7, it means that 10^(10^(10)) days from now will be the same day of the week as today. \n\nTherefore, the day of the week 10^(10^(10)) days from now will be **Wednesday**.\n\nThe correct answer is D. Wednesday."
