The sum of two elements \\(u \\in U\\) and \\(v \\in V\\) is \\(u + v \\in U \\cup V\\), where \\(U \\cup V\\) is the set of all elements that are in either \\(U\\) or \\(V\\) or both. This sum is not necessarily an element of \\(U\\) or \\(V\\) alone, so it is not necessarily an ideal of \\(R\\).\n\n2. **Statement II:**\n   - This statement involves the product of elements from two ideals, \\(u \\in U\\) and \\(v \\in V\\). The product \\(uv\\) is not necessarily an element of \\(U \\times V\\), which is the set of all possible products of elements from \\(U\\) and \\(V\\). Therefore, \\(uv\\) is not necessarily an element of \\(U \\times V\\), and thus it is not necessarily an ideal of \\(R\\).\n\n3. **Statement III:**\n   - This statement involves the intersection of elements from two ideals, \\(u \\in U\\) and \\(x \\in V\\). The intersection \\(x \\in U \\cap V\\) is an element of \\(U \\cap V\\), which is the set of all elements that are in both \\(U\\) and \\(V\\). This intersection is an ideal of \\(R\\) because it satisfies the definition of an ideal: it is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of \\(R\\).\n\nTherefore, the statement that must also be an ideal of \\(R\\) is **III.** \n\nThe correct answer is **B. III only**."
