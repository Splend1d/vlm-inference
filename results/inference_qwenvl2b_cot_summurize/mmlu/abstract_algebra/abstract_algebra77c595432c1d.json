                    "text": "Statement 1 is false. A group with an element of order 15 must have at least 8 elements of order 15 because the order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(a^n = e\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element of the group. If the order of an element is 15, then \\(a^{15} = e\\), and since \\(a\\) is an element of order 15, \\(a^{15}\\) must be the identity element \\(e\\). Therefore, \\(a^{15} = a^{15}\\), which implies that \\(a\\) must be the identity element \\(e\\), and thus the group must have at least 8 elements of order 15.\n\nStatement 2 is false. A group with more than 8 elements of order 15 must have at least 16 elements of order 15. This is because if the group has more than 8 elements of order 15, then the smallest possible order of an element in the group is 16 (since the order of an element cannot be a divisor of the order of the group). Therefore, the group must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nThe correct answer is B. False, False."
