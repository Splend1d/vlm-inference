This is a fundamental property of vector spaces.\n\nStatement 2 is False. The cardinality of a basis (the number of vectors in the basis) is not necessarily equal. For example, in a vector space of dimension 2, the basis could consist of two vectors, one of which is the zero vector, and the other is a linear combination of the zero vector. In this case, the basis has two vectors, but the dimension of the vector space is 2, not 1. Therefore, the cardinality of the basis is not equal to the dimension of the vector space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
