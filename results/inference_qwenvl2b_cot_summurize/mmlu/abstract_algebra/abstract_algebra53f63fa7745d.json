If \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\), then \\( aH \\) is also a subgroup of \\( G \\) because the operation in \\( G \\) is closed under the operation in \\( H \\). The operation in \\( H \\) is closed under the operation in \\( G \\), so \\( aH \\) is closed under the operation in \\( G \\). Therefore, \\( aH \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\).\n\nStatement 2: If \\( H \\) is normal of \\( G \\) and \\( a \\) belongs to \\( G \\), then \\( ah = ha \\) for all \\( h \\) in \\( H \\).\n\nThis statement is false. If \\( H \\) is normal of \\( G \\), it means that \\( H \\) is a subgroup of \\( G \\) that is invariant under conjugation by any element of \\( G \\). However, the statement \\( ah = ha \\) for all \\( h \\) in \\( H \\) does not necessarily hold. For example, if \\( H \\) is the subgroup of \\( G \\) consisting of all elements of order 2, and \\( a \\) is an element of order 3, then \\( a \\) is not in \\( H \\), and \\( ah \\) is not equal to \\( ha \\) for any \\( h \\) in \\( H \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
