In this case, the base field is Q and the extension field is Q(sqrt(2)).\n\nThe square root of 2 is an irrational number, which means it cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. Therefore, the extension field Q(sqrt(2)) is infinite.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 1.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 1."
