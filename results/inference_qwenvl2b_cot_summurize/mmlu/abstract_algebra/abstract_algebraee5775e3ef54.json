A permutation is a function that maps each element of a set to a unique element of the same set, but it does not necessarily have to be one-to-one. For example, the permutation (1, 2, 3) is a permutation of the set {1, 2, 3}, but it is not one-to-one because it maps 1 to 2 and 2 to 1.\n\nStatement 2: Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.\n- This statement is false. A function is a special type of permutation where the domain and codomain are the same set. However, a function is not necessarily one-to-one. For example, the function f(x) = x^2 is a function but not one-to-one because it maps 1 to 1 and 2 to 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
