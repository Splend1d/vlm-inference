This statement is true because \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) is the set of integers, and any polynomial with integer coefficients is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) if it cannot be factored into polynomials of lower degree with integer coefficients. This is because the only way to factor a polynomial with integer coefficients is by using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \\(4x - 2\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). This statement is also true. The rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) are the set of all numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers. Any polynomial with rational coefficients can be factored into polynomials of lower degree with rational coefficients. This is because the only way to factor a polynomial with rational coefficients is by using the rational root theorem, which states that if a polynomial has a rational root, then it must be a rational root.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True"
