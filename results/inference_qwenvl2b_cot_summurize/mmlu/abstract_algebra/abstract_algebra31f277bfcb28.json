The image of a group under a homomorphism can be any number of elements, not necessarily 12. The number of elements in the image depends on the homomorphism and the structure of the groups involved.\n\nStatement 2: There is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.\n- This statement is true. A homomorphism exists between groups of 6 and 12 elements, as the group of 6 elements can be mapped to the group of 12 elements through a homomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
