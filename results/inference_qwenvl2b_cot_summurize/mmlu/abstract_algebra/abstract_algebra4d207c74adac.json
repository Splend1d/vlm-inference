Specifically, it does not hold for all elements in a group, including the identity element 1, which is the only element that has an inverse.\n\nStatement 2: In a group (ab)^n = a^nb^n is true. This is a correct statement. The exponentiation rule (ab)^n = a^n * b^n holds for all elements in a group, including the identity element 1, and it is a fundamental property of exponentiation in groups.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD.
