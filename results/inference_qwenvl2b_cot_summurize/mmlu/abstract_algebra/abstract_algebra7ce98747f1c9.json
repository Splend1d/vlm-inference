A homomorphic image of a group \\( G \\) is a group \\( H \\) that is isomorphic to \\( G \\) and such that \\( H \\) is a homomorphic image of \\( G \\). A factor group, on the other hand, is a group that is isomorphic to the quotient group of \\( G \\) by a subgroup \\( H \\). While it is true that the homomorphic images of a group are isomorphic to the factor groups of the group, the converse is not necessarily true. For example, the group \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) (the integers under addition) is a homomorphic image of the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) (the integers under addition modulo 2), but \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) is not a homomorphic image of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\nStatement 2 is true. The homomorphic images of a group \\( G \\) are indeed the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of \\( G \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
