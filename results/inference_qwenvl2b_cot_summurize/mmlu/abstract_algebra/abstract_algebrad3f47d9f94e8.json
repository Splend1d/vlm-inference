In the case of the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_12 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_8\\), the identity element is \\((0, 0)\\).\n\nLet's examine the element \\((4, 2)\\) in this group:\n\n1. \\(4 \\times 12 = 48\\) (mod 12) is not equal to 0, so \\(4\\) is not the identity element.\n2. \\(4 \\times 8 = 32\\) (mod 12) is not equal to 0, so \\(4\\) is not the identity element.\n3. \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\) (mod 12) is not equal to 0, so \\(2\\) is not the identity element.\n4. \\(2 \\times 8 = 16\\) (mod 12) is not equal to 0, so \\(2\\) is not the identity element.\n\nSince \\((4, 2)\\) is not the identity element, it must have an order greater than 1. The smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\((4, 2)^n = (0, 0)\\) is the order of \\((4, 2)\\).\n\nLet's calculate \\((4, 2)^n\\) for \\(n = 1, 2, 3, 4\\):\n\n- \\((4, 2)^1 = (4, 2)\\)\n- \\((4, 2)^2 = (8, 4)\\)\n- \\((4, 2)^3 = (12, 8)\\)\n- \\((4, 2)^4 = (16, 16)\\)\n\nSince \\((4, 2)^4 = (16, 16)\\), the order of \\((4, 2)\\) is 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 4"
