If \\(G\\) is a cyclic group and \\(H\\) is a homomorphic image of \\(G\\), then \\(H\\) is also cyclic because the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is itself cyclic.\n\nStatement 2: The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian.\n- This statement is false. The homomorphic image of an Abelian group is not necessarily Abelian. For example, consider the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}\\) and its homomorphic image under the group operation modulo 4. This group is Abelian, but its homomorphic image under addition modulo 4 is not Abelian because the operation modulo 4 is not commutative.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
