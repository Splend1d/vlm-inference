The maximum order of a 3-tuple is 3! = 6, because there are 3 choices for the first element, 2 choices for the second element, and 1 choice for the third element.\n\nHowever, since we are working with a 3-tuple, we need to multiply the order of each element together. So, the maximum order of the 3-tuple is 6 * 6 * 6 = 216.\n\nBut we are working with Z_8 x Z_10 x Z_24, which means we are working with 8 x 10 x 24 = 1600 elements. To find the maximum possible order of an element, we need to divide the total number of elements by the maximum order of a 3-tuple.\n\nSo, the maximum possible order of an element in Z_8 x Z_10 x Z_24 is 1600 / 216 = 7.555555556.\n\nSince the order of an element cannot be a fraction, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum possible order for some element of Z_8 x Z_10 x Z_24 is 8."
