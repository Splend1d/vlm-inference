It is possible for a subgroup H of G to contain elements that are not in H, and thus the subgroup generated by a (aH) may not be a subgroup of G.\n\nStatement 2 is true. The statement \"If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H\" is true. This is because if aH = bH, then for any element c in H, we have ac = bc. Since H is a subgroup of G, the operation of G is associative, so if aH = bH, then (ab)c = (ac)b. Therefore, ab must be in H.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
