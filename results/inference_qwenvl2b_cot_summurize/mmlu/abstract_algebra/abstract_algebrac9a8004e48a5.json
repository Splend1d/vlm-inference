A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is trivial (i.e., {0}). This is because a ring homomorphism preserves the addition and multiplication operations, and the kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements that are mapped to the zero element under the homomorphism.\n\nStatement 2: Q is an ideal in R. This statement is true. A ring is an ideal if and only if it is closed under addition and contains the zero element. In the context of a ring R, if Q is a subset of R and satisfies these properties, then Q is indeed an ideal in R.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
