The polynomial ring R[x] over a ring R is not necessarily an integral domain. For example, if R is the ring of integers, then R[x] is not an integral domain because it contains the element x^2 + 1, which is not a unit in R[x].\n\nStatement 2: If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg (f(x)g(x)) = deg f(x) + deg g(x).\n- This statement is true. The degree of the product of two polynomials in R[x] is indeed equal to the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. This is a fundamental property of polynomial rings and can be proven using the binomial theorem or by direct computation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. False, True"
