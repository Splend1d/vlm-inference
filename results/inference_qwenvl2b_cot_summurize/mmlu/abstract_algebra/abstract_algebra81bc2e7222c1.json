A finite group \\( G \\) of order \\( n \\) does not necessarily contain a subgroup of order \\( d \\) for every positive divisor \\( d \\) of \\( n \\). For example, the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\) (the integers modulo 6) has order 6, but it does not contain a subgroup of order 2 (since 2 is not a divisor of 6). Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2: If \\( a \\) belongs to a finite group \\( G \\), then \\( |a| \\) divides \\( |G| \\).\n\nThis statement is true. The order \\( |a| \\) of an element \\( a \\) in a finite group \\( G \\) divides the order \\( |G| \\) of the group \\( G \\) because the order of an element and the order of the group are related by the concept of Lagrange's theorem. Specifically, if \\( a \\) has order \\( d \\) in \\( G \\), then \\( d \\) divides \\( |G| \\). Therefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nThe correct answer is D."
