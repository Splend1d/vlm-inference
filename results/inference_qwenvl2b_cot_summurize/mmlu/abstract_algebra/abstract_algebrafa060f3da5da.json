This means that if you have two vectors, say \\( \\mathbf{v}_1 \\) and \\( \\mathbf{v}_2 \\), they are linearly independent if there is no scalar \\( c \\) such that \\( c\\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{v}_2 \\) or \\( c\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{v}_1 \\).\n\nStatement 2 is true. If \\( V = \\operatorname{span}(v_1, \\ldots, v_k) \\) and \\( \\{v_1, \\ldots, v_k\\} \\) are linearly independent, then the dimension of \\( V \\) is equal to \\( k \\). This is because the dimension of a vector space is the number of linearly independent vectors in the basis of the space."
