For example, the integers and the rational numbers are integral domains with characteristic 0, and they are finite.\n\nStatement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.\n- This statement is false. Integral domains with prime characteristic are not necessarily finite. For example, the integers with prime characteristic 2 are finite, but the integers with prime characteristic 3 are infinite.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. False, False"
