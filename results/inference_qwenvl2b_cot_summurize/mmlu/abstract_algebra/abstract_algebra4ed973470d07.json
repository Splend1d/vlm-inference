The symmetric group \\(S_n\\) is Abelian for all \\(n \\geq 3\\), meaning that for any three elements \\(a, b, c\\) in \\(S_n\\), the operation \\(ab = bc\\). This is a fundamental property of the symmetric group.\n\nStatement 2: If a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is a permutation that is an n-cycle, then |ab| = lcm(m,n). This statement is also false. The product of two permutations, \\(ab\\), does not necessarily result in a cycle of length \\(m + n\\). The length of the cycle depends on the specific permutations \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the product of their cycles may not be a cycle of length \\(m + n\\). For example, if \\(a\\) is a cycle of length 3 and \\(b\\) is a cycle of length 4, then \\(ab\\) will result in a cycle of length 7, not 11.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
