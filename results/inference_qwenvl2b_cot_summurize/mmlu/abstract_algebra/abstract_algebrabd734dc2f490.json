For a group of order 45, the possible orders of its subgroups are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45. Since 10 is not one of these, it cannot be a subgroup of order 10 in any abelian group of order 45.\n\nStatement 2: A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if thenumber of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.\n\nThis statement is false. A subgroup H of a group G is normal if and only if the conjugate of every element of H by every element of G is equal to H itself. This means that the number of left cosets of H is not necessarily equal to the number of right cosets of H. For example, in the group of integers under addition, the subgroup of integers of order 2 is a normal subgroup, but the number of left cosets of this subgroup is not equal to the number of right cosets of this subgroup.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
