                    "text": "Statement 1 is false. The statement \"If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G, then |aH| = |Ha|\" is false because the order of an element in a subgroup is not necessarily equal to the order of the element in the group itself. For example, consider the group \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}_6\\) (the integers modulo 6 under addition) and the subgroup \\(H = \\{0, 2\\}\\). If \\(a = 3\\), then \\(|3H| = 6\\) (since \\(3 \\cdot 2 = 6\\)), but \\(|3H| \\neq |H \\cdot a| = 3\\) (since \\(3 \\cdot 2 = 6\\) and \\(3 \\cdot 3 = 9\\), and \\(H \\cdot a\\) is not a subgroup of \\(G\\)).\n\nStatement 2 is false. The statement \"If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH and Hb are identical or disjoint\" is false because the intersection of two subgroups \\(aH\\) and \\(Hb\\) is not necessarily the empty set or the entire group \\(G\\). For example, consider the group \\(G = \\mathbb{Z}_6\\) and the subgroups \\(H = \\{0, 2\\}\\) and \\(K = \\{0, 3\\}\\). If \\(a = 3\\) and \\(b = 4\\), then \\(aH = \\{0, 2\\}\\) and \\(Hb = \\{0, 3\\}\\), but \\(aH \\cap Hb = \\{0\\}\\), which is not the empty set.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
