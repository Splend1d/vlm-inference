For a group of order 42, the possible orders of its subgroups are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. The only subgroup of order 7 that is normal in the group of order 42 is the subgroup of order 7 itself. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nThis statement is also false. The order of a group is the number of elements in the group. For a group of order 42, the possible orders of its subgroups are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. The only subgroup of order 8 that is normal in the group of order 42 is the subgroup of order 8 itself. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nThe correct answer is B. False, False."
