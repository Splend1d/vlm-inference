A prime ideal, on the other hand, is an ideal that is not contained in any other ideal that contains it. While every maximal ideal is a prime ideal, not every prime ideal is a maximal ideal. For example, in the ring of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), the ideal \\(\\langle 2 \\rangle\\) is a prime ideal but not a maximal ideal.\n\nStatement 2: If \\(I\\) is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring \\(R\\), then \\(R/I\\) is a field.\nThis statement is true. If \\(I\\) is a maximal ideal, then \\(I\\) is a prime ideal. Since \\(R\\) is a commutative ring, the quotient ring \\(R/I\\) is a field because it is a quotient of a field (the original ring \\(R\\)) by a prime ideal (the maximal ideal \\(I\\))."
