An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, but it is not necessarily a partial-ordering relation. A partial-ordering relation is a relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, but it is not necessarily an equivalence relation.\n\nB. Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\n- This statement is false. The number of relations from set A to set B is 2^3 = 8, not 64.\n\nC. Empty relation _ is reflexive.\n- This statement is false. The empty relation _ is not reflexive because it does not satisfy the reflexive property.\n\nD. Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.\n- This statement is true. A symmetric relation is one in which if (x, y) is in the relation, then (y, x) is also in the relation. An un-symmetric relation is one in which if (x, y) is in the relation, then (y, x) is not necessarily in the relation. These two properties are indeed negative of each other.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is true is D."
