                    "text": "Statement 1: For n > 1, the set {1,2, ..., n-1} is a group under multiplication modulo n. This statement is false. A group under multiplication modulo n is a set equipped with an operation that satisfies the following properties:\n1. Closure: The product of any two elements is also in the set.\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, and c in the set, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).\n3. Identity: There exists an element e such that for all a in the set, e*a = a and a*e = a.\n4. Inverses: For each a in the set, there exists an element b such that a*b = e and b*a = e.\n\nFor the set {1,2, ..., n-1}, it is not closed under multiplication modulo n because the product of any two elements in this set is not necessarily in the set. For example, 2*3 = 6, which is not in the set {1,2, ..., n-1} for any n > 1.\n\nStatement 2: There is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1. This statement is true. The statement 63x mod 100 = 1 means that 63x is congruent to 1 modulo 100. This is equivalent to saying that 63x is a multiple of 100 plus 1. The smallest such integer x is 1, because 63*1 = 63, which is a multiple of 100 plus 1. Therefore, there is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. True, True"
