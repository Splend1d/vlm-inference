                "text": "To find the pump work, we need to calculate the work done by the pump on the water as it moves from the ground level to the top floor of the building. The pump work is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ W' = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 g h \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (1000 kg/m\u00b3)\n- \\( V \\) is the volume of water moved by the pump per unit time\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s\u00b2)\n- \\( h \\) is the height of the water column moved by the pump\n\nFirst, we need to find the volume of water moved by the pump per unit time. The flow rate is given as 10 kg/s, and the density of water is 1000 kg/m\u00b3. The volume of water moved per unit time is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{10 \\text{ kg/s}}{1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3} = 0.01 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the water column moved by the pump. The pressure at the ground level is 600 kPa, and the pressure at the top floor is 200 kPa. The difference in pressure is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = 600 \\text{ kPa} - 200 \\text{ kPa} = 400 \\text{ kPa} \\]\n\nThe height of the water column is:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{\\Delta P}{g} = \\frac{400 \\text{ kPa}}{9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2} \\approx 40.4 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nNow we can calculate the pump work:\n\n\\[ W' = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 \\text{ kg/m}^3 \\times (0.01 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{s})^2 \\times 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\times 40.4 \\text{ m} \\approx 7.3 \\text{ MW} \\]\n\nTherefore, the pump work is approximately 7.3 MW, which corresponds to option B."
