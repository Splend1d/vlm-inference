                "text": "To determine the minimum gage pressure required inside the hose to reach the garden, we need to consider the pressure drop due to the diameter difference between the hose and the nozzle. The pressure drop can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{P_1 - P_2}{2} \\]\n\nwhere \\( P_1 \\) is the pressure at the nozzle exit and \\( P_2 \\) is the pressure at the hose exit.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_1 = 0 \\) (since the nozzle exit pressure is considered to be 0)\n- \\( P_2 = 125 \\) ft (since the distance from the nozzle exit to the garden is 125 ft)\n\nThe diameter of the hose is 0.625 inches, and the diameter of the nozzle is 0.375 inches. The ratio of these diameters is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.625 \\text{ in}}{0.375 \\text{ in}} = \\frac{5}{3} \\]\n\nThis ratio is used to calculate the pressure drop:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\frac{0 - 125}{2 \\times \\frac{5}{3}} = \\frac{-125}{\\frac{10}{3}} = \\frac{-125 \\times 3}{10} = -37.5 \\text{ lbf/ft}^2 \\]\n\nSince the pressure drop is negative, it indicates that the pressure is higher at the nozzle exit than at the hose exit. Therefore, the minimum gage pressure required inside the hose to reach the garden is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Minimum gage pressure} = 125 \\text{ ft} - 37.5 \\text{ ft} = 87.5 \\text{ ft} \\]\n\nTo convert this to pounds per square inch (psi), we use the conversion factor:\n\n\\[ 87.5 \\text{ ft} = 87.5 \\times 12 \\text{ in} = 1050 \\text{ in} \\]\n\n\\[ 1050 \\text{ in} \\times 1440 \\text{ psi/in} = 15,9600 \\text{ psi} \\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum gage pressure required inside the hose to reach the garden is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3600 \\text{ lbf/ft}^2} \\]\n\nThis is option B."
