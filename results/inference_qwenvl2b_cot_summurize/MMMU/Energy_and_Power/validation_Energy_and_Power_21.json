                "text": "To estimate the absolute pressure at the nose of the blimp, we can use the principle of conservation of energy. The blimp is traveling at a speed of 75 miles per hour (mi/h) through standard air, which has a standard atmospheric pressure of 14.7 psi (pounds per square inch). The blimp is also experiencing a differential pressure of 950 Pa between the nose and the side of the blimp.\n\nThe energy equation for the blimp can be written as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Energy} = \\text{Initial Energy} + \\text{Change in Energy} \\]\n\nThe initial energy is the energy of the blimp at sea level, which is 0. The change in energy is the energy difference between the nose and the side of the blimp. We can calculate this difference using the differential pressure and the speed of the blimp:\n\n\\[ \\text{Change in Energy} = \\text{Differential Pressure} \\times \\text{Speed} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Change in Energy} = 950 \\, \\text{Pa} \\times 75 \\, \\text{mi/h} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Change in Energy} = 7,125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nNow we can calculate the absolute pressure at the nose of the blimp:\n\n\\[ \\text{Absolute Pressure} = \\text{Initial Pressure} + \\text{Change in Energy} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Absolute Pressure} = 14.7 \\, \\text{psi} + 7,125 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Absolute Pressure} = 110,000 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nTherefore, the absolute pressure at the nose of the blimp is 110,000 Pa. The correct answer is:\n\nA. 110,000 Pa"
