                "text": "To estimate the mass flow rate (m) in kg/s, we can use the Bernoulli equation and the continuity equation. The Bernoulli equation relates the pressure, velocity, and density of a fluid, while the continuity equation relates the mass flow rate to the velocity and cross-sectional area.\n\nGiven:\n- The centerline pressure at section (1) is 110 kPa.\n- The jet exits from a nozzle with a diameter of 4 cm.\n- The jet strikes a stagnation tube with a height of 4 cm.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the velocity of the jet at section (1). The Bernoulli equation can be used to relate the pressure and velocity:\n\n\\[ \\frac{p_1}{\\rho} + \\frac{v_1^2}{2} = \\frac{p_2}{\\rho} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( p_1 \\) is the pressure at section (1),\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of the fluid,\n- \\( v_1 \\) is the velocity at section (1),\n- \\( p_2 \\) is the pressure at section (2), which is the stagnation pressure.\n\nSince the jet exits from a nozzle with a diameter of 4 cm, the velocity at section (1) can be estimated using the formula for the velocity of a jet exiting a nozzle:\n\n\\[ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2gD}{\\rho}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2),\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the nozzle (4 cm),\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of the fluid.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 9.8 \\times 4}{1000}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{39.2}{1000}} = \\sqrt{0.0392} \\approx 0.063 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the stagnation pressure at section (2). The stagnation pressure is the pressure at the point where the jet strikes the stagnation tube. The stagnation pressure can be estimated using the Bernoulli equation again:\n\n\\[ \\frac{p_2}{\\rho} + \\frac{v_2^2}{2} = \\frac{p_1}{\\rho} + \\frac{v_1^2}{2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( p_2 \\) is the stagnation pressure,\n- \\( v_2 \\) is the velocity at section (2),\n- \\( v_1 \\) is the velocity at section (1).\n\nSince the jet strikes the stagnation tube, the velocity at section (2) is zero. Therefore, the stagnation pressure is equal to the centerline pressure at section (1):\n\n\\[ p_2 = p_1 = 110 \\, \\text{kPa} \\]\n\nNow, we can use the continuity equation to relate the mass flow rate to the velocity and cross-sectional area:\n\n\\[ m = \\rho v \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( m \\) is the mass flow rate,\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of the fluid,\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity.\n\nSince the jet strikes the stagnation tube, the velocity at section (2) is zero. Therefore, the mass flow rate is equal to the velocity at section (1):\n\n\\[ m = v_1 = 0.063 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nFinally, we can estimate the mass flow rate in kg/s:\n\n\\[ m = 0.063 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m} = 6.3 \\, \\text{kg/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the mass flow rate is approximately 6.3 kg/s, which corresponds to option C."
