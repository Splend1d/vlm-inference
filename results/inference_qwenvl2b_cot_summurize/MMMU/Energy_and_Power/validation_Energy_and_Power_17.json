                "text": "To find the length \\( L \\) of the porous bed that will completely absorb the storm water, we need to calculate the time it takes for the water to flow through the bed and then determine the distance it travels during that time.\n\n1. **Calculate the time it takes for the water to flow through the bed:**\n\nThe water flows over the outfall at a uniform vertical velocity of 8 mm/s. The depth of the water in the system is 5 m, and the initial depth is 40 cm (or 0.4 m). The initial velocity of the water is 2 m/s.\n\nThe time it takes for the water to flow through the bed can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Velocity}} \\]\n\nFirst, convert the initial depth to meters:\n\n\\[ 40 \\text{ cm} = 0.4 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nThen, calculate the distance the water needs to travel:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Initial depth} + (\\text{Initial velocity} \\times \\text{Time}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 0.4 \\text{ m} + (2 \\text{ m/s} \\times \\text{Time}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{0.4 \\text{ m} + 2 \\text{ m/s} \\times \\text{Time}}{8 \\text{ mm/s}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{0.4 + 2 \\times 0.08}{8} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{0.4 + 0.16}{8} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{0.56}{8} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = 0.06875 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the distance the water travels during the time it takes to flow through the bed:**\n\nThe distance the water travels is equal to the initial depth times the time it takes to flow through the bed:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 0.4 \\text{ m} \\times 0.06875 \\text{ s} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 0.0275 \\text{ m} \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the length \\( L \\) of the bed:**\n\nThe length \\( L \\) is the distance the water travels divided by the uniform vertical velocity of the water:\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Uniform vertical velocity}} \\]\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{0.0275 \\text{ m}}{8 \\text{ mm/s}} \\]\n\n\\[ L = 0.0033125 \\text{ m} \\]\n\n\\[ L = 3.3125 \\text{ cm} \\]\n\nSince the question asks for the length in meters, we convert it to meters:\n\n\\[ L = 3.3125 \\text{ cm} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ m}}{100 \\text{ cm}} \\]\n\n\\[ L = 0.033125 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the length \\( L \\) of the bed that will completely absorb the storm water is approximately 0.033125 meters, which is equivalent to 3.3125 cm. The closest answer to this value is:\n\nC. 90 m"
