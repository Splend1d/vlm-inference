The forward feed evaporator is the first stage in the setup, and it is connected to the condenser and the feed.\n\n1. **Steam Flow**: Steam enters the forward feed evaporator (E1) and exits through the condenser.\n2. **Condensate Flow**: Condensate flows from the condenser and exits through the feed.\n\nSince the steam enters the forward feed evaporator and exits through the condenser, the steam flow is not directly related to the capacity of the forward feed evaporator. However, the condensate flow from the condenser is directly related to the capacity of the forward feed evaporator.\n\nThe condensate flow from the condenser is directed to the feed, which means that the condensate flow is not directly related to the capacity of the forward feed evaporator. Therefore, the condensate flow is not the capacity of the forward feed evaporator.\n\nThe steam flow is not the capacity of the forward feed evaporator. The condensate flow is the capacity of the forward feed evaporator.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. E1"
