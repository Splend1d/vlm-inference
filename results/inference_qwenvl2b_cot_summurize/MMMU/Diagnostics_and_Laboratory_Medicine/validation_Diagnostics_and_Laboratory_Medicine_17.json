The images show a cross-section of the brain, not the basal ganglia or substantia nigra.\n\n2. **Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)**: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by a progressive deterioration of the upper limbs, particularly the face and tongue. The images show a cross-section of the brain, which does not show any signs of upper limb involvement.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely diagnosis in this case is:\n\nC.
