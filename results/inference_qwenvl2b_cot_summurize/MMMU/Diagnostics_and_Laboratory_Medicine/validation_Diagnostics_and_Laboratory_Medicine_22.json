                "text": "To determine the type of tumor shown in the image, let's analyze the characteristics of the cells and their arrangement:\n\n1. **Cell Shape and Size**: The cells in the image appear to be irregular in shape and vary in size. Some cells are larger and more prominent, while others are smaller and less visible.\n\n2. **Nuclei**: The nuclei are irregularly shaped and contain multiple nucleoli, which are visible in some cells. This suggests that the tumor may have a high mitotic activity, which is common in some types of tumors.\n\n3. **Nucleolus**: The nucleoli are prominent and can be seen in some cells, indicating that the tumor may have a high mitotic activity.\n\n4. **Cellularity**: The cells are densely packed, which is characteristic of some types of tumors, such as gliomas.\n\nGiven these observations, the tumor in the image most closely resembles a glioma, which is a type of brain tumor. Gliomas are often associated with seizures and may be intraventricular in children.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. is often associated with seizures"
