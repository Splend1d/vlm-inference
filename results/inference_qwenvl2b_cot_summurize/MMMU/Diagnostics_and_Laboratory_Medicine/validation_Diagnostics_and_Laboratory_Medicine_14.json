Syringomyelia is a condition where there is a communication between the spinal cord and the ventricles of the brain, leading to the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the spinal canal. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including back pain, weakness, and sensory loss. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Syringomyelia"
