The liver cells in acromegaly may show similar enlarged and abnormal nuclei.\n   - **Incidental Findings**: This is a term used to describe a lesion that is found in a routine examination, such as a liver biopsy.\n   - **Reticulin Stain**: This is a staining technique used to highlight collagen fibers in the tissue. It can help differentiate between normal and abnormal liver tissue.\n   - **Non-Functioning Tumor**: This is a term used to describe a tumor that does not produce any hormones or other substances.\n   - **Mass Effect**: This refers to the presence of a mass or abnormal growth that can cause pressure on surrounding tissues.\n\nGiven these observations, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. can be seen in a patient with acromegaly**"
