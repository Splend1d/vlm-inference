Ventricular preexcitation syndrome**: This is characterized by a preexcited QRS complex, which is not present in this ECG.\n   - **B. Ventricular fibrillation**: This is characterized by a chaotic, irregular rhythm with no discernible pattern.\n   - **C. Sustained ventricular tachycardia**: This is characterized by a rapid, irregular rhythm with frequent ventricular extrasystoles.\n   - **D. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm**: This is characterized by a regular rhythm with a faster than normal ventricular rate.\n\nGiven the regular rhythm and absence of arrhythmia, the most likely rhythm diagnosis is:\n\n**D. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm**."
