The mass appears to be partially resected, suggesting it is a surgically treated lesion.\n\n2. **Image 2**: This is a coronal MRI scan showing the brain in a more lateral view. The mass lesion is located in the occipital region, consistent with the findings in Image 1.\n\nGiven the clinical history of occipital headaches and the presence of a partially resected mass lesion, the most likely diagnosis is **Pilocytic astrocytoma**.\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Pilocytic astrocytoma** is a benign tumor that typically occurs in the brain and spinal cord. It is characterized by its low-grade malignancy and slow growth rate.\n- **Occipital headaches** are common in patients with pilocytic astrocytoma, as the tumor can press on the brainstem and cause symptoms.\n- **Partial resection** suggests that the tumor has been surgically removed, which is typical for pilocytic astrocytoma.\n\nTherefore, the correct diagnosis is **Pilocytic astrocytoma**."
