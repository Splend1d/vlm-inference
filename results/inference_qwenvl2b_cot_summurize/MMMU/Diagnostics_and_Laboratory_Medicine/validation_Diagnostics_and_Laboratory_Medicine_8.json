Placental tissue is typically pinkish in color due to the presence of blood vessels and other components.\n\n2. **Developmental Stage: Post-partum in pre-term (< 34 weeks gestational age) infant**\n   - The image shows a section of tissue with a pinkish hue, which is characteristic of a placenta. Placental tissue is typically pinkish in color due to the presence of blood vessels and other components.\n\n3. **Developmental Stage: Post-partum in term infant**\n   - The image shows a section of tissue with a pinkish hue, which is characteristic of a placenta. Placental tissue is typically pinkish in color due to the presence of blood vessels and other components.\n\n4. **Developmental Stage: 1st trimester in utero**\n   - The image shows a section of tissue with a pinkish hue, which is characteristic of a placenta. Placental tissue is typically pinkish in color due to the presence of blood vessels and other components.\n\nGiven the characteristics of the tissue in the image, the most likely developmental stage is:\n\n**D. 1st trimester in utero**\n\nThis is because the pinkish hue is characteristic of placental tissue, which is typically found in the first trimester of pregnancy."
