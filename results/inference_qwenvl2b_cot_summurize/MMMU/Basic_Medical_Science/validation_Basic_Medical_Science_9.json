The graph shows a gradual increase in membrane potential, which is not a threshold response.\n\n2. **B. Depolarization**: Depolarization is the process where the membrane potential becomes more positive. The graph shows a gradual increase in membrane potential, which is consistent with depolarization.\n\n3. **C. Action potential**: An action potential is a sudden increase in membrane potential that propagates along a neuron. The graph shows a sharp increase in membrane potential, which is characteristic of an action potential.\n\n4. **D. Repolarization**: Repolarization is the process where the membrane potential returns to its resting value. The graph shows a gradual decrease in membrane potential, which is consistent with repolarization.\n\nGiven these observations, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Action potential**"
