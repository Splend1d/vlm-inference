Signals angular acceleration.**\n   - The image shows a cross-section of the inner ear, specifically the cochlea. The cochlea is responsible for converting sound waves into neural signals. This is not directly related to angular acceleration.\n\n2. **B. Is important for conjugate eye movements.**\n   - The cochlea is not involved in the control of eye movements. The cochlea is part of the inner ear and is responsible for hearing, not vision.\n\n3. **C. Signals orientation with respect to gravity.**\n   - The cochlea is involved in the conversion of sound waves into neural signals, which is related to hearing. However, it does not directly signal orientation with respect to gravity.\n\n4. **D. Is bathed with perilymph.**\n   - The cochlea is bathed with perilymph, which is a fluid that surrounds the cochlea and helps in the transmission of sound waves. This is a correct answer.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. Is bathed with perilymph.**"
