Therefore, the pattern of inheritance is as follows:\n- **Parent 1**: Recessive allele (colorblind)\n- **Parent 2**: Recessive allele (colorblind)\n- **Child 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9**: Recessive allele (colorblind)\n\nThus, the pattern of inheritance for colorblindness in this pedigree is consistent with the recessive inheritance pattern.\n\n**Final Answer: A. True**"
