They are not present in the image.\n\nB. **Bergman gliosis**: This is a type of gliosis that occurs in the brain and is characterized by the presence of Bergmann glia, which are large, round cells with a central nucleus. The image shows a similar structure, but it is not Bergman gliosis.\n\nC. **Corpora amylacea**: These are small, round, and eosinophilic bodies that are found in the brain and are associated with various neurological conditions. They are not present in the image.\n\nD. **Eosinophilic granular body**: These are small, round, and eosinophilic bodies that are found in the brain and are associated with various neurological conditions. They are not present in the image.\n\nE. **Eosinophilic granular body**: These are small, round, and eosinophilic bodies that are found in the brain and are associated with various neurological conditions. They are not present in the image.\n\nGiven the characteristics of the structure in the image, the most likely answer is:\n\n**D. Eosinophilic granular body**\n\nThe structure in the image is most consistent with an eosinophilic granular body, which is a small, round, and eosinophilic body found in the brain and is associated with various neurological conditions."
