The cell has a large, round nucleus with a prominent nucleolus.\n2. The cell is surrounded by a halo of greenish-blue granules, which are characteristic of eosinophils.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the cell in the image is most likely an eosinophil.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Eosinophil"
