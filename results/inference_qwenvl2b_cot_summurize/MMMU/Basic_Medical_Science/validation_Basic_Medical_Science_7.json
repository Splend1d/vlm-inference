Physical examination reveals: Clear lung sounds; Erythematous, edematous nasal turbinates with clear discharge; Erythematous oropharynx without exudate. A rapid diagnostic immunoassay of nasal secretions reveals antigens from a segmented RNA virus.

RSV is a common respiratory virus that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, and respiratory symptoms. The clinical presentation matches the symptoms described, and the rapid diagnostic immunoassay confirms the presence of RSV antigens in the nasal secretions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. respiratory syncytial virus"
