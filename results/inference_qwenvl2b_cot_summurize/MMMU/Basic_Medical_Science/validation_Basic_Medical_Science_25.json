The nucleus in question is labeled with a yellow arrow.\n\n1. **Muscles of pharynx and larynx**: The pharynx and larynx are part of the respiratory system and are innervated by the pharyngeal plexus, which includes the nucleus ambiguus. The axons of the nucleus ambiguus terminate in the muscles of the pharynx and larynx.\n\n2. **Postganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies**: The postganglionic parasympathetic neurons are responsible for the release of parasympathetic neurotransmitters, which are involved in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system. The nucleus ambiguus does not directly innervate postganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies.\n\n3. **Smooth muscle of viscera**: Smooth muscle in the viscera is innervated by the autonomic nervous system, including the parasympathetic system. The nucleus ambiguus does not directly innervate smooth muscle in the viscera.\n\nGiven the labeled structure in the image, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Muscles of pharynx and larynx."
