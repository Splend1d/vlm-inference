This is evident from the image, which shows a microscopic view of the adenohypophysis, which is a part of the pituitary gland. The tuberoinfundibular tract is a pathway that carries nerve impulses from the hypothalamus to the adenohypophysis, which is responsible for producing hormones like adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and oxytocin. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
