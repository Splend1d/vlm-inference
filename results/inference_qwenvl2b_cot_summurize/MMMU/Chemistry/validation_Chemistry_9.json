The major product has the bromine atom bonded to the less highly substituted carbon atom.\n\nThis indicates that the bromine atom addition occurs from the less substituted carbon atom to the more substituted carbon atom. This is characteristic of a non-Markovnikov orientation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Non-Markovnikov orientation."
