The Lewis structure shows ten valence electrons which is not the correct number.\nB. The Lewis structure shows the electrons as distributed evenly between the carbon and oxygen but they are not.\nC. The Lewis structure should show the intermolecular forces present, but it does not.\nD. The Lewis structure shows the bond between carbon and oxygen as a triple bond but the real bond is actually a double bond.\nE. The Lewis structure shows that the molecule has a linear shape but it is actually a bent/v-shape substance.\n"
