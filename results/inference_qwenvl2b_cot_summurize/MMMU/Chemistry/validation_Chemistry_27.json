In this case, the charges are the ionic radii of the anions, and the distance is the distance between the anions in water molecules. The larger the ionic radius, the stronger the electrostatic interaction. Therefore, $S^{2-}$ has the largest ionic radius among the given ions, making it the most likely to have the strongest interactions with nearby water molecules."
