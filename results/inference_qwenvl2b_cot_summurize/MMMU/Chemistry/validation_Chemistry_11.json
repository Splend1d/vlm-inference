The curve starts at a pH of 1, which is the pH of a strong acid.\n2. As the titration progresses, the pH increases, reaching a peak at around 50.\n3. After the peak, the pH decreases again, approaching the starting point of 1.\n\nGiven these observations, the correct match is:\n\nA. A strong acid is titrated into a weak base."
