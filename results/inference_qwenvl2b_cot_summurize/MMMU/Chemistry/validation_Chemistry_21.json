The glycinium cation is a cation, which means it has a positive charge.\n\n1. **Electron Pair Analysis**:\n   - The glycinium cation has a positive charge at the nitrogen atom.\n   - The glycinium cation has two lone pairs on the nitrogen atom.\n   - The glycinium cation has two lone pairs on the carbon atoms.\n\n2. **Geometric Considerations**:\n   - The glycinium cation has two lone pairs on the nitrogen atom.\n   - The glycinium cation has two lone pairs on the carbon atoms.\n   - The lone pairs on the nitrogen atom and the carbon atoms are not directly bonded to each other.\n\nGiven these points, the glycinium cation has a planar geometry around the nitrogen atom due to the lone pairs. The lone pairs do not interfere with the planarity of the molecule.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. The geometry around the N atom is planar."
