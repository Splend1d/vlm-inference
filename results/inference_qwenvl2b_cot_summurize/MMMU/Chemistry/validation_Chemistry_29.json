The methyl group at the 2-position is the most hindered group, and the other groups are less hindered.\n\n2. **Structure (b)**: This is the second most stable isomer because it has a methyl group at the 2-position, which is less hindered than the methyl group at the 3-position.\n\n3. **Structure (c)**: This is the least stable isomer because it has a methyl group at the 2-position, which is the most hindered group.\n\n4. **Structure (d)**: This is the second least stable isomer because it has a methyl group at the 2-position, which is less hindered than the methyl group at the 3-position.\n\nTherefore, the most stable isomer is:\n\n**A. <image 1>**"
