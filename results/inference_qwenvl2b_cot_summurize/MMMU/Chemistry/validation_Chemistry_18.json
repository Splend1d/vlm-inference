Five different samples of $CaCO_3$(s) of known mass react with an excess of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq) in identical sealed, rigid reaction vessels. The pressure of the gas produced is measured with a pressure gauge attached to the reaction vessel. Since the reaction is exothermic, the reaction system is cooled to its original temperature before the pressure is recorded. The experimental data are used to create the calibration line below. <image 1> The experiment is repeated with an eggshell sample, and the experimental data are recorded in the table below. <image 2> Which of the following modifications will increase the rate of the reaction the most? \n\nA.

                "text": "To determine which modification will increase the rate of the reaction the most, we need to consider the factors that affect the rate of a chemical reaction. The rate of a reaction is influenced by the concentration of the reactants, the temperature, and the surface area of the reactants.\n\n1. **Concentration of Reactants**: The concentration of the reactants (CaCO\u2083(s)) will directly affect the rate of the reaction. A higher concentration of reactants will generally lead to a faster reaction.\n\n2. **Temperature**: The temperature of the reaction will also affect the rate of the reaction. A higher temperature will generally increase the rate of the reaction.\n\n3. **Surface Area of Reactants**: The surface area of the reactants will also affect the rate of the reaction. A larger surface area will generally lead to a faster reaction.\n\nGiven the information provided:\n\n- The mass of the eggshell sample is 0.200 g.\n- The mass of CaCO\u2083(s) in the original experiment is 0.100 g.\n- The mass of CaCO\u2083(s) in the modified experiment is 0.100 g.\n\nSince the mass of CaCO\u2083(s) is the same in both experiments, the only factor that could potentially affect the rate of the reaction is the concentration of the reactants.\n\n- **Using 2.0 M $CH_3COOH$(aq) instead of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq)**: This would increase the concentration of the reactants (CaCO\u2083(s)) and thus increase the rate of the reaction.\n- **Cooling the $HCl$(aq) to a lower temperature than it was in the original experiment**: This would decrease the temperature of the reaction, which would decrease the rate of the reaction.\n- **Reducing the volume of the reaction vessel**: This would decrease the surface area of the reactants, which would decrease the rate of the reaction.\n- **Using eggshells that are more finely powdered than those used in the original experiment**: This would increase the surface area of the reactants, which would increase the rate of the reaction.\n\nGiven that the mass of CaCO\u2083(s) is the same in both experiments, the only factor that could potentially affect the rate of the reaction is the concentration of the reactants.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Using 2.0 M $CH_3COOH$(aq) instead of 2.0 M $HCl$(aq)"
