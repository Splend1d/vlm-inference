The solid phase is represented by the solid lines, and the liquid phase is represented by the dashed lines.\n\nFrom the phase diagram, we can see the following:\n- At point (A), the substance is in the solid phase.\n- At point (B), the substance is in the solid phase.\n- At point (C), the substance is in the solid phase.\n- At point (D), the substance is in the solid phase.\n- At point (E), the substance is in the solid phase.\n\nTherefore, the substance represented by the phase diagram will be solely in the solid phase at equilibrium at point (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E).\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA.
