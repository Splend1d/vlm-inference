Women taking OC had an increased risk of pulmonary, cerebral, and coronary thrombosis or embolism.A larger case-control study was conducted in the United States between 1976-1978 by Shapiro et al. to explore the relationship between OC use and myocardial infarction(MI) in women under 50 years of age.The age distribution of the MI and control groups and OC exposure among MI patients and controls in each age group were shown in the table below.<image 1> The 95% CI for OR in 25-29 years was\n\nA.

                "text": "To determine the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio (OR) in the age group of 25-29 years, we need to look at the data provided in the table and calculate the OR for each group and then find the 95% CI for the OR.\n\nThe table shows the following data:\n- MI group: 6 (2.6)\n- Control group: 286 (16.4)\n- OC exposure: MI: 4 (66.7)\n- OC exposure: Control: 62 (21.7)\n\nFirst, we calculate the OR for each group:\n- MI group: OR = 6 / 286 = 0.0219\n- Control group: OR = 286 / 62 = 4.68\n\nNext, we calculate the 95% CI for the OR:\n- For the MI group: 0.0219 \u00b1 1.96 * (0.0219 / \u221a286)\n- For the Control group: 4.68 \u00b1 1.96 * (4.68 / \u221a62)\n\nLet's calculate the CI for the MI group:\n- Lower bound: 0.0219 - 1.96 * (0.0219 / \u221a286) \u2248 0.000\n- Upper bound: 0.0219 + 1.96 * (0.0219 / \u221a286) \u2248 0.040\n\nLet's calculate the CI for the Control group:\n- Lower bound: 4.68 - 1.96 * (4.68 / \u221a62) \u2248 3.48\n- Upper bound: 4.68 + 1.96 * (4.68 / \u221a62) \u2248 22.56\n\nNow, we find the 95% CI for the OR:\n- Lower bound: 0.000 - 0.040 = -0.040\n- Upper bound: 0.040 + 0.2256 = 0.2256\n\nThe 95% CI for the OR in the age group of 25-29 years is approximately (-0.040, 0.2256). Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. (3.48~22.56)"
