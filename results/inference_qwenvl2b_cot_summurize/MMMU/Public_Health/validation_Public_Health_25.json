Specificity refers to the proportion of individuals who do not have the disease who test negative for the test.\n\nFrom the table, we can see the following:\n- Positive test result: A (Group with disease)\n- Negative test result: C (Group without disease)\n\nThe total number of individuals who tested positive is A + C, and the total number of individuals who tested negative is B + D.\n\nThe specificity is calculated as the number of individuals who tested negative (who do not have the disease) divided by the total number of individuals who tested negative (who do not have the disease) plus the number of individuals who tested negative (who do not have the disease).\n\nSo, the calculation is:\n\\[ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{\\text{B} + \\text{D}}{\\text{B} + \\text{D} + \\text{C} + \\text{D}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{\\text{B} + \\text{D}}{\\text{N}} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD.
