The food with the highest ratio of people who got sick to people who ate it is the most likely cause.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Cold chicken: 34 people got sick out of 86 people who ate it.\n- Potato salad: 38 people got sick out of 54 people who ate it.\n- Egg sandwiches: 40 people got sick out of 76 people who ate it.\n- Fruit pie and cream: 12 people got sick out of 32 people who ate it.\n- Cheese: 12 people got sick out of 48 people who ate it.\n\nThe food with the highest ratio of people who got sick to people who ate it is egg sandwiches, with a ratio of 40 (people who got sick) to 76 (people who ate it). Therefore, the most likely cause of the outbreak of food poisoning is egg sandwiches.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. Egg sandwiches"
