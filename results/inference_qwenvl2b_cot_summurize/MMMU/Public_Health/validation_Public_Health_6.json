The total number of patients in each hospital is also provided.\n\n- **Hospital A**:\n  - Infection: 16\n  - No Infection: 237\n  - Total: 253\n\n- **Hospital B**:\n  - Infection: 27\n  - No Infection: 594\n  - Total: 621\n\nWe are interested in comparing the proportion of patients who developed an infection between the two hospitals. This is a binary outcome (infection/no infection) and the data is categorical.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\nA. **Independent samples t test**: This test is used to compare the means of two independent groups. It is not appropriate for comparing proportions.\n\nB. **Fisher's Exact test**: This test is used when the sample sizes are small and the expected frequencies in each cell are less than 5. It is not suitable for comparing proportions.\n\nC. **Kappa**: This is a measure of agreement between two raters or measures. It is not appropriate for comparing proportions.\n\nD. **McNemar's test**: This test is used to compare the proportions of two related samples. It is appropriate for comparing proportions.\n\nGiven that we are comparing the proportions of patients who developed an infection between the two hospitals, McNemar's test is the most appropriate statistical test.\n\n**Final Answer: D. McNemar's test**"
