                "text": "To calculate the odds ratio (OR), we need to determine the probability of lung cancer in smokers compared to the probability of lung cancer in non-smokers. The odds of lung cancer in smokers is the number of lung cancer patients among smokers divided by the number of non-lung cancer patients among smokers. Similarly, the odds of lung cancer in non-smokers is the number of lung cancer patients among non-smokers divided by the number of non-lung cancer patients among non-smokers.\n\nLet's calculate the odds of lung cancer in smokers and non-smokers:\n\n1. Odds of lung cancer in smokers:\n   - Number of lung cancer patients among smokers = 150\n   - Number of non-lung cancer patients among smokers = 50\n   - Odds of lung cancer in smokers = (Number of lung cancer patients among smokers) / (Number of non-lung cancer patients among smokers) = 150 / 50 = 3\n\n2. Odds of lung cancer in non-smokers:\n   - Number of lung cancer patients among non-smokers = 100\n   - Number of non-lung cancer patients among non-smokers = 200\n   - Odds of lung cancer in non-smokers = (Number of lung cancer patients among non-smokers) / (Number of non-lung cancer patients among non-smokers) = 100 / 200 = 0.5\n\nNow, we can calculate the odds ratio (OR):\n\nOR = Odds of lung cancer in smokers / Odds of lung cancer in non-smokers = 3 / 0.5 = 6\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. OR."
