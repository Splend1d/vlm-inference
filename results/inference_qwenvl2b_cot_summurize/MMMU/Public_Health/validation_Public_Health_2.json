The past alcohol consumption of the study subjects was investigated, along with variables such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI>24 as overweight). Considering that body mass index may be a potential confounder when analysing the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension, it needs to be analysed and judged. The following table presents unstratified information on the relationship between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive disorders. <image 1> The cOR between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive is\n\nA. 1.70\nB. 2.50\nC. 3.20\nD. 4.80\n"

The OR measures the strength of the association between two variables, in this case, drinking alcohol and hypertension.\n\nThe OR is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ OR = \\frac{p_{cases|drink}}{p_{control|drink}} \\times \\frac{p_{cases|no drink}}{p_{control|no drink}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( p_{cases|drink} \\) is the probability of having hypertension given that the subject drinks alcohol.\n- \\( p_{control|drink} \\) is the probability of having hypertension given that the subject does not drink alcohol.\n- \\( p_{cases|no drink} \\) is the probability of having hypertension given that the subject does not drink alcohol.\n- \\( p_{control|no drink} \\) is the probability of having hypertension given that the subject does not drink alcohol.\n\nFrom the table:\n- \\( p_{cases|drink} = 73/275 = 0.274 \\)\n- \\( p_{control|drink} = 202/583 = 0.359 \\)\n- \\( p_{cases|no drink} = 81/462 = 0.182 \\)\n- \\( p_{control|no drink} = 381/583 = 0.654 \\)\n\nNow, we can calculate the OR:\n\\[ OR = \\frac{0.274}{0.359} \\times \\frac{0.182}{0.654} \\]\n\n\\[ OR = \\frac{0.274}{0.359} \\times \\frac{0.182}{0.654} \\approx 0.74 \\]\n\nThe OR is approximately 0.74, which is closest to 2.50.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. 2.50"
