                "text": "To determine the relationship between systolic blood pressure (tr) and body mass index (tb), we need to analyze the data provided in the table. The table shows the systolic blood pressure and body mass index for 10 men aged 35-45 years.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the correlation coefficient (r) between systolic blood pressure (tr) and body mass index (tb). The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. A positive correlation coefficient indicates a positive linear relationship, while a negative correlation coefficient indicates a negative linear relationship.\n\nThe correlation coefficient can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ r = \\frac{n(\\sum xy) - (\\sum x)(\\sum y)}{\\sqrt{[n\\sum x^2 - (\\sum x)^2][n\\sum y^2 - (\\sum y)^2]}} \\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of data points, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the variables, and \\(\\sum\\) denotes the sum of the values.\n\nHowever, since we are given the correlation coefficient as a percentage, we can use the following approximation for the correlation coefficient:\n\\[ r \\approx \\frac{100}{n} \\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of data points.\n\nGiven the data:\n- Number of data points (\\(n\\)) = 10\n- Correlation coefficient (\\(r\\)) = 0.8\n\nNow, let's calculate the correlation coefficient:\n\\[ r \\approx \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\]\n\nSince the correlation coefficient is approximately 10, which is greater than 0, it indicates a positive linear relationship between systolic blood pressure (tr) and body mass index (tb).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. tr<tb"
