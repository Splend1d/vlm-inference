The primary outcome indicator was the incidence of EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina, according to the 0- and 28-day immunisation schedule, using block (one group of 10 persons) randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation of study participants to EV71 vaccine or placebo, and follow-up monitoring for 12 months, and the results were shown in the table below.<image 1> The incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in placebo group was\n\nA. 51.4%\nB. 52.4%\nC. 3.1%\nD. 10.8%\n"
