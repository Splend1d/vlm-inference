Instead, we can use the information provided to calculate the rate of return directly.\n\nGiven:\n- Stock A: $P_0 = 90$, $Q_0 = 100$, $P_1 = 95$, $Q_1 = 100$\n- Stock B: $P_0 = 50$, $Q_0 = 200$, $P_1 = 45$, $Q_1 = 200$\n- Stock C: $P_0 = 100$, $Q_0 = 200$, $P_1 = 110$, $Q_1 = 200$, $P_2 = 100$, $Q_2 = 400$\n\nWe need to calculate the rate of return for Stock C, which splits two for one in the last period. This means we need to calculate the rate of return for the period from $t=1$ to $t=2$ for Stock C.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the ending value for Stock C after the split:\n- $P_2 = 100$, $Q_2 = 400$\n\n\\[ \\text{Ending Value} = \\frac{P_2 \\times Q_2}{2} = \\frac{100 \\times 400}{2} = 20000 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the rate of return for the period from $t=1$ to $t=2$:\n\\[ \\text{Rate of Return} = \\left( \\frac{20000}{100} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate of Return} = \\left( 200 \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate of Return} = \\sqrt{200} - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate of Return} = \\sqrt{200} - 1 \\approx 14.47 - 1 = 3.47 \\]\n\nTherefore, the rate of return for the second period ($t=1$ to $t=2$) is approximately 3.47%.\n\nThe closest answer to this calculation is:\nD. 3.57%"
