The variance of a random variable is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean. The variance of a random variable with probability distribution is given by:\n\nVariance = \u03a3 (Probability * (Value - Mean)^2)\n\nwhere:\n\nVariance is the variance of the random variable\nProbability is the probability of the random variable taking on the value\nValue is the value of the random variable\nMean is the expected value of the random variable\n\nIn this case, the mean of the random variable is:\n\nMean = (0 * 0.25) + (1 * 0.25) + (2 * 0.50) = 1.00\n\nThe variance of the random variable is:\n\nVariance = (0 * 0.25) + (1 * 0.25) + (2 * 0.50) = 1.00\nVariance = 1.00 / 3 = 0.3333333333333333\n\nThe standard deviation of the random variable is the square root of the variance:\n\nStandard deviation = \u221a0.3333333333333333 = 0.5656565656565657\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of the random variable q is approximately 0.5657, which is closest to 0.5656565656565657. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 0.8194."
