Interest expense\n5. Tax\n\nFirst, let's calculate the net income:\n\nNet income = Net sales - Cost of goods sold - Selling, general, and administrative expenses - Depreciation - Interest expense\n\nGiven:\n- Net sales = $500,343\n- Cost of goods sold = $373,396\n- Selling, general, and administrative expenses = $95,981\n- Depreciation = $10,529\n- Interest expense = $2,178\n\nNet income = $500,343 - $373,396 - $95,981 - $10,529 - $2,178\nNet income = $18,259\n\nNext, let's calculate the EBIT:\n\nEBIT = Net income + Depreciation + Interest expense\n\nEBIT = $18,259 + $10,529 + $2,178\nEBIT = $21,066\n\nNow, let's calculate the EVA:\n\nEVA = EBIT - (Cost of goods sold + Selling, general, and administrative expenses + Tax)\n\nEVA = $21,066 - ($373,396 + $95,981 + $6,204)\nEVA = $21,066 - $384,571\nEVA = -$363,505\n\nSince the EVA is negative, it indicates that the company is not generating enough economic value for its shareholders. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $6,340"
