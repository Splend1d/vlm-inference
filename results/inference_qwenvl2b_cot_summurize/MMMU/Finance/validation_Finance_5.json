                "text": "To determine the cost of the share offer for the acquisition of Denham, we need to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of Denham, including the forecast earnings per share, dividend per share, and the number of shares. The cost of the share offer is the present value of these cash flows divided by the number of shares.\n\nGiven data:\n- Corton Inc. forecast earnings per share: $5.00\n- Corton Inc. forecast dividend per share: $3.00\n- Denham Inc. forecast earnings per share: $1.50\n- Denham Inc. forecast dividend per share: $0.80\n- Number of shares: 1,000,000\n- Stock price: $90\n- Stock price: $20\n\nFirst, calculate the present value of the forecast earnings per share:\n\\[ \\text{PV of earnings} = \\frac{\\$5.00}{(1 + 0.06)^1} + \\frac{\\$5.00}{(1 + 0.06)^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{\\$5.00}{(1 + 0.06)^{10}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{PV of earnings} = \\$4.50 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the present value of the forecast dividend per share:\n\\[ \\text{PV of dividend} = \\frac{\\$3.00}{(1 + 0.06)^1} + \\frac{\\$3.00}{(1 + 0.06)^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{\\$3.00}{(1 + 0.06)^{10}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{PV of dividend} = \\$2.00 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the present value of the forecast earnings per share and the forecast dividend per share:\n\\[ \\text{PV of earnings} + \\text{PV of dividend} = \\$4.50 + \\$2.00 = \\$6.50 \\]\n\nFinally, calculate the cost of the share offer:\n\\[ \\text{Cost of offer} = \\frac{\\text{PV of earnings} + \\text{PV of dividend}}{\\text{Number of shares}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of offer} = \\frac{\\$6.50}{1,000,000} = \\$0.00065 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of offer} = \\$0.0065 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of offer} = \\$0.065 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of offer} = \\$65,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the share offer would be $65,000, which is closest to option A.
