The equivalent annual cost is calculated by dividing the total annual cost by the number of years the project will be in operation.\n\nFor Alternative I:\n- Annual Cost = First Cost + Annual Maintenance Cost + Service Life * Annual Maintenance Cost\n- Annual Cost = 75,000 + 3,000 + 15 * 3,000\n- Annual Cost = 75,000 + 3,000 + 45,000\n- Annual Cost = 123,000\n\n- Equivalent Annual Cost = Annual Cost / Service Life\n- Equivalent Annual Cost = 123,000 / 15\n- Equivalent Annual Cost = 8,2000\n\nFor Alternative II:\n- Annual Cost = First Cost + Annual Maintenance Cost + Service Life * Annual Maintenance Cost\n- Annual Cost = 125,000 + 2,000 + 15 * 2,000\n- Annual Cost = 125,000 + 2,000 + 30,000\n- Annual Cost = 177,000\n\n- Equivalent Annual Cost = Annual Cost / Service Life\n- Equivalent Annual Cost = 177,000 / 15\n- Equivalent Annual Cost = 11,8000\n\nComparing the equivalent annual costs:\n- EUAW1 = $123,000\n- EUAW2 = $11,8000\n\nTherefore, the preferred alternative is Alternative I, with an equivalent annual cost of $123,000. The equivalent annual cost for Alternative II is $11,8000.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. EUAW1=$18,444, EUAW2=$15,730"
