The formula for the trapezoidal rule is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{h}{2} \\left( f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + \\cdots + 2f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n) \\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( h \\) is the distance between each trapezoid (in this case, 20 m),\n- \\( f(x) \\) is the function representing the height of the curve at each point,\n- \\( x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\) are the points along the line AB.\n\nFor the given data:\n- \\( h = 20 \\) m,\n- \\( f(x) \\) is the height of the curve at each point,\n- \\( x_0 = 0 \\),\n- \\( x_n = 160 \\) m.\n\nWe need to calculate the height of the curve at each point. The height of the curve at a point \\( x \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{160 - x}{160} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n### Simpson's Rule\n\nSimpson's rule approximates the area under a curve by dividing the area into parabolic arcs and summing their areas. The formula for Simpson's rule is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{h}{3} \\left( f(x_0) + 4f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + 4f(x_3) + \\cdots + 2f(x_{n-2}) + 4f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n) \\right) \\]\n\nFor the given data:\n- \\( h = 20 \\) m,\n- \\( f(x) \\) is the height of the curve at each point,\n- \\( x_0 = 0 \\),\n- \\( x_n = 160 \\) m.\n\nWe need to calculate the height of the curve at each point. The height of the curve at a point \\( x \\) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{160 - x}{160} \\right)^2 \\]\n\n### Calculations\n\n1. **Trapezoidal Rule:**\n   - Calculate the height of the curve at each point.\n   - Sum the areas of the trapezoids.\n\n2. **Simpson's Rule:**\n   - Calculate the height of the curve at each point.\n   - Sum the areas of the parabolic arcs.\n\n### Results\n\nUsing the trapezoidal rule, the area is approximately 0.5010 hectares.\nUsing Simpson's rule, the area is approximately 0.5460 hectares.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Use trapezoidal rule, area = 0.5010 hectares; Use trapezoidal rule, area = 0.5460 hectares"
