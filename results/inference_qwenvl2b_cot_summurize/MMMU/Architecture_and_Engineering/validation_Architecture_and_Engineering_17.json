The volume of a prism is given by the formula: Volume = base area * height. The base area of each prism is a rectangle with length equal to the difference between the contour levels and width equal to the difference between the height of the reservoir and the contour level. The height of each prism is the difference between the contour level and the reservoir level. Therefore, the volume of water impounded when the water level reaches 700 m is: Volume = (700 m - 660 m) * (700 m - 660 m) * (700 m - 660 m) = 29.293 * 106 $m^{3}$. Therefore, the answer is B."
