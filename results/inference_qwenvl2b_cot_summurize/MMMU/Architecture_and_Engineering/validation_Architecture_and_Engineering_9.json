The height of the embankment is the difference between the formation level and the ground level, which is 107.00 - 104.8 = 2.2 m. The width of the embankment is the distance between the formation level and the ground level, which is 400 m. Using the prismoidal rule, the volume of earthwork can be calculated as follows:\n\nVolume = (Height x Width x Length) / 10000\n\nVolume = (2.2 x 400 x 400) / 10000\n\nVolume = 14583 m^3\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 14583 m^3."
