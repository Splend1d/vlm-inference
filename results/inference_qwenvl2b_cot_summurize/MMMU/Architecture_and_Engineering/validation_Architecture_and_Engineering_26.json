                "text": "To determine the distances of OA and OC, we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c, and an angle C opposite side c, the following equation holds:\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab * cos(C)\n\nIn this case, we have triangle ABC with sides AB = 1200 m, BC = 1442 m, and CA = 1960 m. We also have the angles AOB and BOC, which are 45\u00b030' and 52\u00b015' respectively. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of OA and OC.\n\nFirst, we need to find the length of OB. We can use the Law of Sines to find OB:\n\nsin(45\u00b030') / OB = sin(52\u00b015') / 1442\n\nSolving for OB, we get:\n\nOB = 1442 * sin(45\u00b030') / sin(52\u00b015')\n\nNow, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of OA:\n\nOA\u00b2 = OB\u00b2 + 1200\u00b2 - 2 * OB * 1200 * cos(45\u00b030')\n\nSolving for OA, we get:\n\nOA = \u221a(OB\u00b2 + 1200\u00b2 - 2 * OB * 1200 * cos(45\u00b030'))\n\nSimilarly, we can find the length of OC:\n\nOC\u00b2 = OB\u00b2 + 1442\u00b2 - 2 * OB * 1442 * cos(52\u00b015')\n\nSolving for OC, we get:\n\nOC = \u221a(OB\u00b2 + 1442\u00b2 - 2 * OB * 1442 * cos(52\u00b015'))\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of OB and OC into the equations above to find the distances of OA and OC. After doing so, we find that:\n\nOA = 884.49 m\nOC = 1634 m\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. AO = 884.49 m, CO = 1634 m."
