                "text": "To find the width of the river, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The triangles ABE and CDE are similar because they are both right triangles and share the angle at E. Therefore, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal.\n\nLet's denote the width of the river as BC. We can set up the following proportion:\n\n\\[ \\frac{BE}{CD} = \\frac{AB}{BC} \\]\n\nWe know that BE = 60 m, AB = 80 m, and CD = 60 m. We also know that FG = EF, so we can use the fact that the triangles ABE and CDE are similar to find the length of AB in terms of BC.\n\nSince AB is parallel to CD, we can use the property of similar triangles to find the ratio of AB to BC. We can set up the following proportion:\n\n\\[ \\frac{AB}{BC} = \\frac{BE}{CD} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{80}{BC} = \\frac{60}{60} \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{80}{BC} = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, BC = 80 m.\n\nHowever, we are asked to find the width of the river, which is BC. So, the width of the river is 80 m.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 120 m"
