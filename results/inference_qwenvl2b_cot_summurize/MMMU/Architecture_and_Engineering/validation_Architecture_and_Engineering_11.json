This is often referred to as the \"optimum moisture content\" or \"optimum moisture ratio.\"\n\nFrom the given data, we can see the bulk density values for each sample. We can then plot these values against the moisture content to find the point where the bulk density is at its minimum.\n\nFrom the plot, we can see that the bulk density is at its minimum at a moisture content of approximately 8%. Therefore, the optimum moisture content is 8%.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. 8%."
