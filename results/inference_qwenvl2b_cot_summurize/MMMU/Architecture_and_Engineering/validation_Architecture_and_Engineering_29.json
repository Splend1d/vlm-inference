                "text": "To determine the gradient (slope) from point P to point Q, we need to use the formula for the gradient of a line given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):\n\n\\[ \\text{Gradient} = \\frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1} \\]\n\nHowever, we only have the vertical angles and staff readings, not the x and y coordinates of the points P and Q. We can use the information provided to find the gradient indirectly.\n\nFrom the table, we have:\n- The bearing from R to P is 130\u00b032' and the vertical angle from R to P is +10\u00b032'.\n- The bearing from R to Q is 220\u00b0 and the vertical angle from R to Q is +5\u00b006'.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the bearing angles from degrees to radians because the gradient formula requires angles in radians. We can use the conversion factor \\( \\pi/180 \\) radians per degree:\n\n- \\( 130\u00b032' = 130\u00b032' \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = 1.999 \\) radians\n- \\( 220\u00b0 = 220\u00b0 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = 3.999 \\) radians\n\nNow, we can calculate the gradient using the vertical angles:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gradient} = \\frac{3.999 - 1.999}{3.999 - 1.999} = \\frac{2.000}{2.000} = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the gradient from point P to point Q is 1 in 35.95 m fall.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. Gradient = 1 in 35.95 m fall"
