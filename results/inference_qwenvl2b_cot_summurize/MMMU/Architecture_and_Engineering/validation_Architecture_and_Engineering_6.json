                "text": "To determine the scale of the photographs and the length of the air base, we need to use the information provided in the image and apply the principles of photography and optics.\n\n1. **Scale of the Photographs:**\n   - The size of the prints is 250 mm x 250 mm.\n   - The size of the prints is 250 mm x 250 mm.\n   - The scale of the photographs is given by the ratio of the size of the prints to the size of the ground.\n   - The ground is 250 m above the mean sea level.\n   - The scale of the photographs is \\( \\frac{250 \\, \\text{mm}}{250 \\, \\text{m}} = 1 \\, \\text{cm} \\).\n\n2. **Length of the Air Base:**\n   - The overlap between the two consecutive photographs is exactly 60%.\n   - The overlap is 60% of the total distance between the two photographs.\n   - The total distance between the two photographs is \\( 0.4L + 0.6L = 1.0L \\).\n   - The overlap is 60% of \\( 1.0L \\).\n   - The overlap is \\( 0.6L \\).\n   - The length of the air base is the distance between the two photographs minus the overlap.\n   - The length of the air base is \\( 1.0L - 0.6L = 0.4L \\).\n\nTherefore, the scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 62.5 m, and the length of the air base is 625 m.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. The scale of the photographs is 1 cm = 62.5 m; Air base = 625 m"
