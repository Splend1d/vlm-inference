Phytoplasma\n\nPhytoplasma is a type of plant virus that can cause various symptoms in plants, including yellowing of leaves. It can affect the growth and health of trees, including Gliricidia sepium. The symptoms observed in the image, such as the sickly, yellowed leaves on the left, are consistent with the effects of a phytoplasma infection."
