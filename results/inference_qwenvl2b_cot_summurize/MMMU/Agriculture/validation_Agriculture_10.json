These yellow spheres are connected to the roots.\n3. The presence of these spheres suggests that they are some form of infection or damage to the potato plant.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Sclerotia - These are the spores of the potato blight fungus, which can cause damage to potato plants.\nB. Cysts - These are the spores of the potato blight fungus, which can cause damage to potato plants.\nC. Eggs - These are the spores of the potato blight fungus, which can cause damage to potato plants.\nD. Galls - These are the spores of the potato blight fungus, which can cause damage to potato plants.\nE. I don't know and I don't want to guess - This is a common response when unsure about the correct answer.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Eggs"
