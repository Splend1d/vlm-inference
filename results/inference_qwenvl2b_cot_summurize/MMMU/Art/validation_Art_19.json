The negative space is the empty space between the people and the path, which adds depth and interest to the image.\n- **Photo 2**: This image shows a series of cylindrical lights with a pattern of holes. The negative space is the empty space between the lights, which creates a sense of depth and draws the viewer's eye to the lights.\n- **Photo 3**: This image shows a series of stacked, geometric shapes. The negative space is the empty space between the shapes, which creates a sense of rhythm and balance in the composition.\n\nAmong these options, **Photos 2 & 3** both feature strong use of negative space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Photos 2 & 3"
