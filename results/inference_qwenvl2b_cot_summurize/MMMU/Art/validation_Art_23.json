Egg tempera - This is a traditional medium used for painting, particularly in the Middle Ages.\nB. Watercolour - This medium is known for its fluidity and versatility, often used for detailed and expressive paintings.\nC. Ink - Ink is a traditional medium used for painting, but it is not as fluid as watercolour.\nD. Oil paint - This medium is known for its rich texture and depth, often used for detailed and realistic paintings.\n\nGiven the context of the painting, which features a child in a garden with a pig and a parrot, it is more likely to be a watercolour painting due to its fluidity and the way it captures the light and shadow in the scene.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Watercolour"
