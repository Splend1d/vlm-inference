The statue's muscular build and the way the body is rendered are indicative of Archaic Greek art.\n\n2. **Imperial Roman**: This period is known for its grandeur and the use of classical themes. The statue's grandeur and the presence of a draped garment are typical of Imperial Roman art.\n\n3. **Persian**: This period is known for its intricate and detailed art, often featuring human figures in dynamic poses. The statue's pose and the draped garment are more reminiscent of Persian art.\n\n4. **Egyptian New Kingdom**: This period is characterized by the use of hieroglyphics and the depiction of deities and figures in a more stylized and abstract manner. The statue's style is more abstract and less detailed compared to the others.\n\nGiven these observations, the statue most closely resembles the style of Archaic Greek art.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Archaic Greek"
