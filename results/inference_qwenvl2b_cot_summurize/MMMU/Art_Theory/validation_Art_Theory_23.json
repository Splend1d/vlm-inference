The sculpture is made of metal, which is a common material in modern and contemporary art.\n2. The geometric shapes and angular forms suggest a modernist or abstract style.\n3. The use of metal and the abstract form are reminiscent of the works created in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nGiven these observations, the work most likely dates from the 1960s.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. 1960's"
