                "text": "To determine the density of totally amorphous polypropylene, we need to consider the relationship between the density of the material and its crystallinity. The density of a material is inversely proportional to its crystallinity. This means that as the crystallinity decreases, the density of the material increases.\n\nGiven data:\n- Density of polypropylene with 62.8% crystallinity: 0.904 g/cm\u00b3\n- Density of polypropylene with 54.4% crystallinity: 0.895 g/cm\u00b3\n\nSince the density of the material is inversely proportional to its crystallinity, we can set up the following equation to find the density of the totally amorphous polypropylene:\n\n\\[ \\text{Density of amorphous polypropylene} = \\frac{\\text{Density of crystalline polypropylene}}{\\text{Crystallinity of crystalline polypropylene}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Density of amorphous polypropylene} = \\frac{0.904 \\, \\text{g/cm\u00b3}}{62.8\\%} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Density of amorphous polypropylene} = \\frac{0.904}{0.628} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Density of amorphous polypropylene} \\approx 1.43 \\, \\text{g/cm\u00b3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the density of totally amorphous polypropylene is approximately 1.43 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nThe closest option to this value is:\n\nC. 0.946 g/cm\u00b3"
