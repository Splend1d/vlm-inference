The force applied to the handle is 120 N, and the force at the pin A is the reaction force that opposes this force.\n\nThe force at the pin A can be calculated using the principle of moments, which states that the sum of the clockwise moments about the pin A must equal the sum of the counterclockwise moments about the pin A.\n\nThe clockwise moment about the pin A is the product of the force at the pin A and the distance from the pin A to the point of application of the force (which is 100 mm in this case).\n\nThe counterclockwise moment about the pin A is the product of the force applied to the handle (120 N) and the distance from the pin A to the point of application of the force (which is 300 mm in this case).\n\nThe sum of the clockwise moments and the sum of the counterclockwise moments must be equal to zero for the system to be in static equilibrium.\n\nLet \\( F_A \\) be the force at the pin A. Then, we have:\n\n\\[ F_A \\times 100 = 120 \\times 300 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( F_A \\):\n\n\\[ F_A = \\frac{120 \\times 300}{100} \\]\n\n\\[ F_A = \\frac{36000}{100} \\]\n\n\\[ F_A = 360 \\]\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the reactive force at the pin A is 360 N.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 1.19 kN"
