                "text": "To determine the required cross-sectional area of member BC, we need to analyze the forces and moments acting on the truss. The truss is a simple truss, and we can use the principle of moments to find the required cross-sectional area.\n\nFirst, let's identify the forces and moments:\n\n1. **Forces:**\n   - The force at point A is 800 lb.\n   - The force at point B is 400 lb.\n   - The force at point C is 400 lb.\n   - The force at point D is 400 lb.\n\n2. **Moments:**\n   - The moment at point A is the sum of the moments of the forces acting on it.\n   - The moment at point B is the sum of the moments of the forces acting on it.\n   - The moment at point C is the sum of the moments of the forces acting on it.\n   - The moment at point D is the sum of the moments of the forces acting on it.\n\n3. **Equations:**\n   - The moment at point A is:\n     \\[\n     M_A = 800 \\, \\text{lb} \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} = 4800 \\, \\text{ft-lb}\n     \\]\n   - The moment at point B is:\n     \\[\n     M_B = 400 \\, \\text{lb} \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} = 2400 \\, \\text{ft-lb}\n     \\]\n   - The moment at point C is:\n     \\[\n     M_C = 400 \\, \\text{lb} \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} = 2400 \\, \\text{ft-lb}\n     \\]\n   - The moment at point D is:\n     \\[\n     M_D = 400 \\, \\text{lb} \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} = 2400 \\, \\text{ft-lb}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Equation for the truss:**\n   - The sum of the moments of the forces acting on the truss should be zero:\n     \\[\n     M_A + M_B + M_C + M_D = 0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solving for the cross-sectional area:**\n   - The cross-sectional area of member BC is:\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{M_B}{F_B \\times \\sin(60^\\circ)}\n     \\]\n   - Where \\( F_B \\) is the force at point B and \\( \\sin(60^\\circ) \\) is the sine of 60 degrees.\n\n   - \\( F_B = 400 \\, \\text{lb} \\)\n   - \\( \\sin(60^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866 \\)\n\n   - \\( A = \\frac{2400 \\, \\text{ft-lb}}{400 \\, \\text{lb} \\times 0.866} \\approx 0.556 \\, \\text{in}^2 \\)\n\nTherefore, the required cross-sectional area of member BC is approximately 0.556 in^2.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. 0.0556 in^2"
