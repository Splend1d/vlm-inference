A 500-lb load applied along the centroidal axis of the member.\n2. A 500-lb force acting at an angle of 30 degrees from the centroidal axis.\n\nThe resultant force in the member can be found by summing the forces acting on the member. The resultant force can be resolved into a normal force and a shear force.\n\n1. **Resolve the 500-lb load into a normal force and a shear force:**\n\n   - The normal force (N) is the component of the load perpendicular to the section a-a.\n   - The shear force (V) is the component of the load parallel to the section a-a.\n\n   The normal force (N) is given by:\n   \\[\n   N = 500 \\text{ lb} \\times \\cos(30^\\circ) = 500 \\text{ lb} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 354.3 \\text{ lb}\n   \\]\n\n   The shear force (V) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V = 500 \\text{ lb} \\times \\sin(30^\\circ) = 500 \\text{ lb} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 250 \\text{ lb}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Resolve the 500-lb force into a normal force and a shear force:**\n\n   - The normal force (N) is the component of the force perpendicular to the section a-a.\n   - The shear force (V) is the component of the force parallel to the section a-a.\n\n   The normal force (N) is given by:\n   \\[\n   N = 500 \\text{ lb} \\times \\cos(30^\\circ) = 500 \\text{ lb} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 354.3 \\text{ lb}\n   \\]\n\n   The shear force (V) is given by:\n   \\[\n   V = 500 \\text{ lb} \\times \\sin(30^\\circ) = 500 \\text{ lb} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 250 \\text{ lb}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum the normal and shear forces:**\n\n   The resultant normal force (Na) is the sum of the normal forces acting on the member:\n   \\[\n   Na = N + N = 354.3 \\text{ lb} + 354.3 \\text{ lb} = 708.6 \\text{ lb}\n   \\]\n\n   The resultant shear force (Va) is the sum of the shear forces acting on the member:\n   \\[\n   Va = V + V = 250 \\text{ lb} + 250 \\text{ lb} = 500 \\text{ lb}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the resultant internal normal force (Na) is approximately 708.6 lb, and the resultant internal shear force (Va) is 500 lb.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC.
