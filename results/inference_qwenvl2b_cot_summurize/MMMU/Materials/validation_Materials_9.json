                "text": "To determine the average shear stress developed in the 6-mm diameter pin B that is subjected to double shear, we need to consider the forces acting on the pin and the geometry of the structure.\n\n1. **Identify the forces acting on the pin:**\n   - The vertical force P = 1500 N is applied at the top of the pin.\n   - The horizontal force is the sum of the forces in the two arms of the bell crank, which is \\(2 \\times 300 \\, \\text{mm} \\times \\sin(45^\\circ) = 300 \\, \\text{mm} \\times \\sqrt{2}/2 = 150 \\, \\text{mm}\\).\n\n2. **Calculate the shear force:**\n   - The shear force is the sum of the vertical and horizontal forces acting on the pin.\n   - Shear force \\(V = P + 150 \\, \\text{mm} = 1500 \\, \\text{N} + 150 \\, \\text{mm} = 1515 \\, \\text{mm}\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the shear stress:**\n   - The shear stress \\(\\tau\\) is given by the formula \\(\\tau = \\frac{V}{A}\\), where \\(A\\) is the area of the pin.\n   - The area \\(A\\) of the pin is \\(6 \\, \\text{mm} \\times 6 \\, \\text{mm} = 36 \\, \\text{mm}^2\\).\n   - Shear stress \\(\\tau = \\frac{1515 \\, \\text{mm}}{36 \\, \\text{mm}^2} = 42.5 \\, \\text{MPa}\\).\n\nTherefore, the average shear stress developed in the 6-mm diameter pin B is approximately 42.5 MPa.\n\nThe correct answer is **C. 40.5 MPa**."
