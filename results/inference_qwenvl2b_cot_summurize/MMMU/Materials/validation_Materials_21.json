The forces are distributed along the length of the beam, and the reactions at the supports are vertical.\n\n1. **Determine the reactions at the supports:**\n   - The reactions at supports A and B are vertical, so they are equal and opposite.\n   - The reactions at supports A and B are:\n     - \\( R_A = R_B = 0 \\) kip\n\n2. **Calculate the internal forces at point D:**\n   - The internal forces are distributed along the length of the beam.\n   - The internal forces at point D are:\n     - \\( N_D = 0 \\) kip (since the reactions are vertical)\n     - \\( V_D = 0 \\) kip (since the reactions are vertical)\n     - \\( M_D = 36.0 \\) kip\u00b7ft (since the reactions are vertical)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.
