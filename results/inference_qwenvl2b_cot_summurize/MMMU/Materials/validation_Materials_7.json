The displacement of plate A can be found by considering the displacement of the two blocks of rubber bonded to the plates.\n\nThe displacement of the two blocks can be found using the principle of superposition. The displacement of each block can be found using the formula:\n\n$$\\delta = \\frac{P}{2bhG}$$\n\nwhere $\\delta$ is the displacement of the block, $P$ is the applied load, $b$ is the width of the block, $h$ is the height of the block, and $G$ is the shear modulus of the rubber.\n\nSince the displacement of the two blocks is the same, the displacement of plate A can be found by adding the displacements of the two blocks:\n\n$$\\delta_{A} = \\delta + \\delta = \\frac{P}{2bhG} + \\frac{P}{2bhG} = \\frac{P}{bhG}$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
