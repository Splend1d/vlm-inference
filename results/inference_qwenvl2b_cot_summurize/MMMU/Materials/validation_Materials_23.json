                "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of moments and the concept of average normal stress. The average normal stress in a cable is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{avg} = \\frac{F}{A} \\]\n\nwhere \\( F \\) is the force applied and \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the cable.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the force applied by each cable. The force \\( F \\) is the weight of the pipe, which is 2 Mg (or 2000 N).\n\nFor cable AB:\n- The angle between the cable and the horizontal is 30 degrees.\n- The angle between the cable and the vertical is 45 degrees.\n- The force \\( F \\) is the weight of the pipe, which is 2000 N.\n\nThe force \\( F \\) can be calculated using the formula for the force in a triangle:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nThe base is the length of the cable, and the height is the distance from the center of the pipe to the point where the cable is attached. Since the pipe is suspended from cables AB and AC, the distance from the center of the pipe to the point where the cable is attached is the same for both cables.\n\nLet's denote the length of cable AB as \\( L \\). The distance from the center of the pipe to the point where the cable is attached is \\( L \\sin 30^\\circ \\), and the distance from the center of the pipe to the point where the cable is attached is \\( L \\sin 45^\\circ \\).\n\nThe force \\( F \\) is:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{1}{2} \\times L \\times (L \\sin 30^\\circ + L \\sin 45^\\circ) \\]\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{1}{2} \\times L \\times (0.5L + 0.707L) \\]\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{1}{2} \\times L \\times 1.207L \\]\n\n\\[ F = 0.6035L^2 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the force \\( F \\) for cable AC:\n\n- The angle between the cable and the horizontal is 45 degrees.\n- The force \\( F \\) is the weight of the pipe, which is 2000 N.\n\nThe force \\( F \\) can be calculated using the formula for the force in a triangle:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]\n\nThe base is the length of cable AC, and the height is the distance from the center of the pipe to the point where the cable is attached. Since the pipe is suspended from cables AB and AC, the distance from the center of the pipe to the point where the cable is attached is the same for both cables.\n\nLet's denote the length of cable AC as \\( L \\). The distance from the center of the pipe to the point where the cable is attached is \\( L \\sin 45^\\circ \\).\n\nThe force \\( F \\) is:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{1}{2} \\times L \\times (L \\sin 45^\\circ) \\]\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{1}{2} \\times L \\times 0.707L \\]\n\n\\[ F = 0.3535L^2 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the diameter of cable AB such that the average normal stress developed in this cable is the same as in the 10-mm diameter cable AC. The average normal stress in a cable is given by:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{avg} = \\frac{F}{A} \\]\n\nFor cable AB, the force \\( F \\) is:\n\n\\[ F = 0.6035L^2 \\]\n\nFor cable AC, the force \\( F \\) is:\n\n\\[ F = 0.3535L^2 \\]\n\nThe average normal stress in cable AB is:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{avg, AB} = \\frac{0.6035L^2}{\\pi r^2} \\]\n\nThe average normal stress in cable AC is:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{avg, AC} = \\frac{0.3535L^2}{\\pi r^2} \\]\n\nSince the average normal stress is the same for both cables, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.6035L^2}{\\pi r^2} = \\frac{0.3535L^2}{\\pi r^2} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( r \\), we get:\n\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.6035}{0"
