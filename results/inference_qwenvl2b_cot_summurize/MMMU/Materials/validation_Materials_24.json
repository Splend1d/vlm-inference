This suggests a cubic lattice with a lattice constant \\(a\\).\n\n2. **Determine the type of lattice**: The lattice vectors are not parallel to each other, which indicates that the lattice is not simple cubic (SC) or body-centered cubic (BCC). The lattice vectors are not parallel to the \\(a\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(a\\sqrt{3}\\) directions, which suggests it is not FCC.\n\n3. **Check the possible unit cell planes**: The unit cell plane can be either {100}, {110}, or {111} depending on the type of lattice.\n\n- **{100}**: This is a simple cubic lattice, which has a lattice constant \\(a\\).\n- **{110}**: This is a body-centered cubic lattice, which has a lattice constant \\(a\\).\n- **{111}**: This is a face-centered cubic lattice, which has a lattice constant \\(a\\).\n\nGiven the lattice vectors and the unit cell shape, the correct unit cell plane is:\n\n**H.
