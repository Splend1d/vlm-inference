The density of the second material is 1.343 g/cm3, and its percent crystallinity is 31.2%.\n\nThe percent crystallinity of a material is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percent Crystallinity} = \\frac{\\text{Density of the material}}{\\text{Density of the reference material}} \\times 100 \\]\n\nLet's calculate the percent crystallinity for the specimen with a density of 1.382 g/cm3:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percent Crystallinity} = \\frac{1.382}{1.408} \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percent Crystallinity} = 0.95 \\times 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percent Crystallinity} = 95\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percent crystallinity of the specimen having a density of 1.382 g/cm3 is 95%, which corresponds to option D."
