The gel is made of polyacrylamide, which is negatively charged.\n2. The samples are placed in the wells, which are positively charged.\n3. The buffer is neutral, so it does not affect the charge of the gel.\n\nGiven this setup, the negatively charged gel will attract the positively charged samples. Therefore, the positively charged wells will be attracted to the negatively charged gel, causing the samples to move towards the anode.\n\nIn the image, the anode is labeled as \"B.\"\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nB.
