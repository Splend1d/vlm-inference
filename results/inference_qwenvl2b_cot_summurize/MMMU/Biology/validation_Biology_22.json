The coefficient of relatedness (CoR) is a measure of the probability that two individuals are related by descent, given that they share a common ancestor.\n\nIn a family tree, the CoR is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{CoR} = \\frac{\\text{Number of shared ancestors}}{\\text{Total number of ancestors}} \\]\n\nIn the given family tree, individuals A and B share a common ancestor (A's mother and B's father). Therefore, the number of shared ancestors is 2.\n\nThe total number of ancestors is the sum of the number of ancestors for each individual:\n\n- A's ancestors: 2 (A's mother and A's father)\n- B's ancestors: 2 (B's mother and B's father)\n\nSo, the total number of ancestors is \\(2 + 2 = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of relatedness between individuals A and B is:\n\n\\[ \\text{CoR} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nThe correct answer is D."
