Dish A was wrapped completely in an opaque cover to exclude all light. Dish B was not wrapped. The dishes were placed equidistant from a light source set to a cycle of 14 h of light and 10 h of dark. All other conditions were the same for both dishes. The dishes were examined after seven days, and the opaque cover was permanently removed from dish A. Both dishes were returned to the light and examined again at 14 days. The following data were obtained: <image 1> What best describes the usefulness of the yellow-leaved phenotype as a variation subject to natural selection?\n\nA. The yellow-leaved phenotype can germinate in environments without light.\nB. The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is unaffected by light intensity.\nC. The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is accelerated as compared to the green-leaved phenotype.\nD. The yellow-leaved phenotype cannot germinate in environments with light.\n"

                "text": "To determine the usefulness of the yellow-leaved phenotype as a variation subject to natural selection, we need to consider the data provided in the table. The yellow-leaved phenotype is characterized by a shorter mean stem length below the first set of leaves compared to the green-leaved phenotype.\n\n1. **Germination and Seedling Development:**\n   - Dish A: Yellow-leaved seeds germinated at 12 days, while green-leaved seeds germinated at 14 days.\n   - Dish B: Yellow-leaved seeds germinated at 20 days, while green-leaved seeds germinated at 20 days.\n\n2. **Stem Length:**\n   - Dish A: Yellow-leaved seedlings had a mean stem length of 6 mm, while green-leaved seedlings had a mean stem length of 9 mm.\n   - Dish B: Yellow-leaved seedlings had a mean stem length of 5 mm, while green-leaved seedlings had a mean stem length of 3 mm.\n\nFrom the data, we can see that the yellow-leaved phenotype has a shorter mean stem length compared to the green-leaved phenotype. This suggests that the yellow-leaved phenotype is more likely to survive and grow in environments with less light, which is consistent with the idea that it is a variation subject to natural selection.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the usefulness of the yellow-leaved phenotype as a variation subject to natural selection is:\n\nC. The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is accelerated as compared to the green-leaved phenotype."
