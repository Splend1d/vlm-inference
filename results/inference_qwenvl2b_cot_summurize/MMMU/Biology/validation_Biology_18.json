Note: As shown in <image 1>, the dephosphorylated pRB protein is active in G1 phase. pRB binds to the transcription factor E2F and prevents E2F mediated G1->S transition. The Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex produced during G1, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates pRB. This allows the cell to enter S phase. The p16 protein inhibits the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex. In which process are the proteins encoded by the target genes of E2F most likely to function? \n\nA. DNA replication\nB. RNA stabilization\nC. Splicing\nD. Transcription\nE. Translation\n"
