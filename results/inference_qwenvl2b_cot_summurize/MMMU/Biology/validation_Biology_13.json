The graph shows a range of 0.8 mg/ml to 1.8 mg/ml, which is within the normal range.\n\n2. **Glucagon is released at points A and C.** - The graph shows a peak at point A and a trough at point C, which are typical points of glucagon release.\n\n3. **The individual eats a meal at point D.** - The graph shows a trough at point D, which is a point of insulin release, indicating that the individual has eaten a meal.\n\n4. **Insulin is being released at points B and E.** - The graph shows a peak at point B and a trough at point E, which are typical points of insulin release.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are:\n- I. Normal homeostatic mechanisms maintain a glucose concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml.\n- II. Glucagon is released at points A and C.\n- IV. Insulin is being released at points B and E.\n\nThe correct answer is C. I and IV only."
