Organism 3 is directly below organism 1, indicating a direct common ancestor.\n\nNow, let's analyze the branches:\n\n- Organism 1 has branches leading to organisms A and B.\n- Organism 3 has branches leading to organisms C and D.\n\nSince organism 3 is directly below organism 1, the MRCA of organisms 1 and 3 is organism 1 itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Organism A"
