The average temperature (left-hand y-axis) and the abundance of the three tree species (right-hand y-axis) are shown against the altitude (x-axis).\n\n1. **Species 1**: The curve for Species 1 shows a peak at around 500m, indicating that it is most abundant at this altitude.\n2. **Species 2**: The curve for Species 2 shows a peak at around 1000m, indicating that it is most abundant at this altitude.\n3. **Species 3**: The curve for Species 3 shows a peak at around 1500m, indicating that it is most abundant at this altitude.\n\nGiven this information, the species that is/are found below an altitude of 500m is Species 1, as it has a peak at this altitude.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Species 1 only"
