However, the mahogany/red heterozygote is mahogany if male and red if female. Here is a pedigree for an Ayrshire family that is of great interest to Farmer MacDonald. (In the pedigree, open circles and squares indicate the mahogany phenotype; filled indicate red.) Although Elmer has long ago become a huge pile of Big Macs, Farmer MacDonald has frozen a good supply of Elmer's semen and has used it to artificially inseminate Elmira. What is the probability that Elmira will produce a mahogany female calf?\n\nA. 1/2\nB. 1/4\nC. 3/4\nD. 1/8\nE. 1/16\n"

                "text": "To determine the probability that Elmira will produce a mahogany female calf, we need to consider the genetic inheritance of the mahogany allele in the family.\n\n1. **Elmer's Genotype**: Since Elmer has a red phenotype, he is a heterozygote for the mahogany allele. This means he has one red allele and one mahogany allele.\n\n2. **Elmer's Sperm**: Elmer's semen was used to artificially inseminate Elmira. Since he is a heterozygote, he has a 50% chance of passing on the red allele to Elmira (since he has one red allele and one mahogany allele).\n\n3. **Elmira's Genotype**: Elmira is a red phenotype, which means she is a homozygote for the red allele. Since she is homozygous, she will pass on the red allele to her offspring.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**: Since Elmira is a red homozygote, she will pass on the red allele to her offspring. Therefore, the probability that Elmira will produce a mahogany female calf is 0.\n\nThe correct answer is **D. 1/8**."
