You freshly purified plasmid from overnight bacterial culture using extraction kit, also known as miniprep. You confirmed the quality of plasmids by checking DNA and protein ratio (A260/280) and running them on a DNA agarose gel. They looked pure as they should be. You would now like to digest this vector for gene manipulation (molecular cloning) to generate vectors suitable for molecular cloning. If you cut the above plasmid with restriction enzyme called HindIII, the form of DNA will be changed from _________\n\nA. Linear to supercoiled\nB. Nicked to linear\nC. Nicked to supercoiled\nD.

                "text": "To determine the form of DNA after cutting the plasmid with HindIII, we need to consider the orientation of the DNA and the specific sites of the enzyme.\n\nHindIII is a restriction enzyme that cuts at the following sites:\n- 5' to the T7 promoter\n- 3' to the lacI promoter\n\nThe T7 promoter is located 5' to the HindIII site, and the lacI promoter is located 3' to the HindIII site. Therefore, when HindIII cuts the plasmid, it will cut at the T7 promoter site and the lacI promoter site, resulting in nicking of the DNA.\n\nThe nicked DNA will then be supercoiled due to the presence of the T7 promoter and lacI promoter sequences, which are known to form supercoils.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Nicked to supercoiled"
