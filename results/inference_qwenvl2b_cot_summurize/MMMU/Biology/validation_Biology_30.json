This is a fundamental feature of the developing embryo and is already established at this stage.\n\n2. **Limb Placement**: The limbs are clearly visible and positioned correctly. This is another fundamental feature of the developing embryo and is already established at this stage.\n\n3. **Type of Symmetry**: The symmetry of the embryo is evident, with a clear distinction between the left and right sides. This is a fundamental feature of the developing embryo and is already established at this stage.\n\nGiven these observations, the correct answer is:\n\n**H. type of symmetry and head-tail orientation**"
