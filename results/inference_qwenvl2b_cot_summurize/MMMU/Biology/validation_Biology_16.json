These elements have a full outer electron shell (8 electrons) and do not form ionic bonds.\n- Group 14 (alkali earth metals) consists of elements like lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K). These elements also have a full outer electron shell (8 electrons) and do not form ionic bonds.\n- Group 17 (alkali metals) consists of elements like lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K). These elements have a full outer electron shell (8 electrons) and do not form ionic bonds.\n- Group 18 (alkali metals) consists of elements like lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K). These elements have a full outer electron shell (8 electrons) and do not form ionic bonds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Group 1 and Group 18"
