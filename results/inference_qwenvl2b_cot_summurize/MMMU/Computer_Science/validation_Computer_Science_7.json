Linear probing uses the next available slot in the table if the current slot is occupied, and then moves one slot to the right.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- The first value inserted is 46.\n- The second value inserted is 42.\n- The third value inserted is 34.\n- The fourth value inserted is 52.\n- The fifth value inserted is 23.\n- The sixth value inserted is 33.\n- The seventh value inserted is 52.\n- The eighth value inserted is 46.\n- The ninth value inserted is 33.\n\nNow, let's check the order of insertion:\n\n1. 46 is inserted first.\n2. 42 is inserted second.\n3. 34 is inserted third.\n4. 52 is inserted fourth.\n5. 23 is inserted fifth.\n6. 33 is inserted sixth.\n7. 52 is inserted seventh.\n8. 46 is inserted eighth.\n9. 33 is inserted ninth.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of insertion is:\n\nC. 46, 34, 42, 23, 52, 33"
