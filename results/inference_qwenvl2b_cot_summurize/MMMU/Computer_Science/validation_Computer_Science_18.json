In a DFS, we start at a vertex and explore all the vertices in the graph that are connected to it. We then move to the next vertex in the sequence and repeat the process until all vertices have been visited.\n\nIn the given graph, we can see that the DFS starts at vertex V1 and explores the vertices in the order V1, V5, V4, V7, V6, and V2. Therefore, the correct answer is A. V1,V5,V4,V7,V6,V2,V3."
