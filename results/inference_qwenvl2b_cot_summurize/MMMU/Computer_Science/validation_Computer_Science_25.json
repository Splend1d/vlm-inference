In this case, we have two classes of data points, represented by blue and red dots.\n\nThe complexity of a curve can be measured by the number of parameters needed to describe it. In this case, the number of parameters needed to describe the curve is the number of parameters needed to describe the two classes of data points.\n\nSince we have two classes of data points, we need two parameters to describe each class. Therefore, the total number of parameters needed to describe the curve is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the ideal complexity of the curve is quadratic, as it requires 4 parameters to describe the two classes of data points.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. Quadratic"
