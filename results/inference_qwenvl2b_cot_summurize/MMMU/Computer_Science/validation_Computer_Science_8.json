This algorithm works by finding augmenting paths from the source to the sink and increasing the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nIn this case, the source is v1 and the sink is v6. The maximum flow from v1 to v6 is the maximum flow that can be found along any augmenting path.\n\nLet's start by finding the augmenting paths from v1 to v6:\n\n1. From v1 to v2: 6 + 2 = 8\n2. From v2 to v3: 2 + 4 = 6\n3. From v3 to v4: 4 + 5 = 9\n4. From v4 to v5: 4 + 4 = 8\n5. From v5 to v6: 4 + 2 = 6\n\nThe maximum flow from v1 to v6 is the maximum flow along any of these paths. In this case, the maximum flow is 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 11"
