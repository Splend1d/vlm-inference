The order of edges added is determined by the number of edges added to the tree, not by the number of edges in the graph.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. (a-b),(d-f),(b-f),(d-c),(d-e)\n- This sequence adds edges in the order of their weights (a-b, d-f, b-f, d-c, d-e). Since the MST is constructed by adding edges in order of their weights, this sequence is valid.\n\nB. (a-b),(d-f),(d-c),(b-f),(d-e)\n- This sequence adds edges in the order of their weights (a-b, d-f, d-c, b-f, d-e). Since the MST is constructed by adding edges in order of their weights, this sequence is valid.\n\nC. (d-f),(a-b),(d-c),(b-f),(d-e)\n- This sequence adds edges in the order of their weights (d-f, a-b, d-c, b-f, d-e). Since the MST is constructed by adding edges in order of their weights, this sequence is valid.\n\nD.
