This means that the model will be less influenced by the coefficients and more influenced by the data points. As a result, the coefficients w1 and w2 will decrease in magnitude.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct option is:\n\nB. First, w1 becomes zero, and then w2 becomes zero\n\nWhen C is increased, the model will start to penalize the coefficients more heavily, leading to a decrease in their magnitude."
