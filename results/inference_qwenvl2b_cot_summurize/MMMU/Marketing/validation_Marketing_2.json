Each row represents a team, and each column represents a different team. The entries in the table are the mean goals scored per game for each team.\n\nThe degrees of freedom (df) for a chi-squared test are calculated as the number of rows minus 1 (for the numerator) and the number of columns minus 1 (for the denominator). In this case, since there are four teams and four columns (each representing a different team), the df for the numerator is:\n\n\\[ \\text{df}_{\\text{numerator}} = \\text{number of rows} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 3"
