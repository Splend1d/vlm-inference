The conditional probability \\( P(x < 3.5 | x < 4) \\) is the probability that a random variable \\( X \\) is less than 3.5 given that \\( X \\) is less than 4. \n\nFirst, we need to find the probability that \\( X \\) is less than 4. This can be calculated using the formula for the probability of a continuous random variable:\n\n\\[ P(X < 4) = \\frac{1}{4.5} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that \\( X \\) is less than 3.5 given that \\( X \\) is less than 4. This can be calculated using the formula for conditional probability:\n\n\\[ P(X < 3.5 | X < 4) = \\frac{P(X < 3.5 \\cap X < 4)}{P(X < 4)} \\]\n\nThe intersection of \\( X < 3.5 \\) and \\( X < 4 \\) is the probability that \\( X \\) is less than 3.5 and less than 4. This can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ P(X < 3.5 \\cap X < 4) = P(X < 3.5) \\times P(X < 4) \\]\n\n\\[ P(X < 3.5 \\cap X < 4) = \\frac{1}{4.5} \\times \\frac{1}{4.5} = \\frac{1}{18.25} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the conditional probability:\n\n\\[ P(X < 3.5 | X < 4) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{18.25}}{\\frac{1}{4.5}} = \\frac{1}{18.25} \\times \\frac{4.5}{1} = \\frac{4.5}{18.25} \\approx 0.244 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.625"
