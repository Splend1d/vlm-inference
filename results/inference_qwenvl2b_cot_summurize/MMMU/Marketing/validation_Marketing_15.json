As a part of a feasibility study, the company conducts research into the types of fries sold across the country to determine if the type of fries sold is independent of the area of the country. The results of the study are shown in Table 11.43. Conduct a test of independence. At the 5% significance level, what can you conclude?\n\nA. There is insufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.\nB. There is sufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.\nC. Not certain.\n"

The test of independence is used to determine if there is a relationship between two categorical variables.\n\nThe table provided shows the sales figures for different types of fries across different regions. We need to calculate the expected frequencies for each cell under the null hypothesis of independence. The expected frequency for each cell is calculated as:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{(row_1 \\times col_1)}{total} \\]\n\nwhere \\( E \\) is the expected frequency, \\( row_1 \\) is the number of rows (fries sold), \\( col_1 \\) is the number of columns (regions), and \\( total \\) is the total number of observations.\n\nLet's calculate the expected frequencies:\n\n1. **Northeast vs. Skinny fries:**\n   - \\( row_1 = 70 \\)\n   - \\( col_1 = 50 \\)\n   - \\( total = 70 + 50 = 120 \\)\n   - \\( E = \\frac{(70 \\times 50)}{120} = \\frac{3500}{120} = 29.1667 \\)\n\n2. **Northeast vs. Curly fries:**\n   - \\( row_1 = 70 \\)\n   - \\( col_1 = 60 \\)\n   - \\( total = 70 + 60 = 130 \\)\n   - \\( E = \\frac{(70 \\times 60)}{130} = \\frac{4200}{130} = 133.333 \\)\n\n3. **Northeast vs. Steak fries:**\n   - \\( row_1 = 70 \\)\n   - \\( col_1 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( total = 70 + 40 = 110 \\)\n   - \\( E = \\frac{(70 \\times 40)}{110} = \\frac{2800}{110} = 25.4545 \\)\n\n4. **South vs. Skinny fries:**\n   - \\( row_2 = 50 \\)\n   - \\( col_1 = 50 \\)\n   - \\( total = 50 + 50 = 100 \\)\n   - \\( E = \\frac{(50 \\times 50)}{100} = \\frac{2500}{100} = 25 \\)\n\n5. **South vs. Curly fries:**\n   - \\( row_2 = 50 \\)\n   - \\( col_1 = 60 \\)\n   - \\( total = 50 + 60 = 110 \\)\n   - \\( E = \\frac{(50 \\times 60)}{110} = \\frac{3000}{110} = 27.2727 \\)\n\n6. **South vs. Steak fries:**\n   - \\( row_2 = 50 \\)\n   - \\( col_1 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( total = 50 + 40 = 90 \\)\n   - \\( E = \\frac{(50 \\times 40)}{90} = \\frac{2000}{90} = 22.2222 \\)\n\n7. **Central vs. Skinny fries:**\n   - \\( row_3 = 20 \\)\n   - \\( col_1 = 50 \\)\n   - \\( total = 20 + 50 = 70 \\)\n   - \\( E = \\frac{(20 \\times 50)}{70} = \\frac{1000}{70} = 14.7826 \\)\n\n8. **Central vs. Curly fries:**\n   - \\( row_3 = 20 \\)\n   - \\( col_1 = 60 \\)\n   - \\( total = 20 + 60 = 80 \\)\n   - \\( E = \\frac{(20 \\times 60)}{80} = \\frac{1200}{80} = 15 \\)\n\n9. **Central vs. Steak fries:**\n   - \\( row_3 = 20 \\)\n   - \\( col_1 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( total = 20 + 40 = 60 \\)\n   - \\( E = \\frac{(20 \\times 40)}{60} = \\frac{800}{60} = 13.33"
