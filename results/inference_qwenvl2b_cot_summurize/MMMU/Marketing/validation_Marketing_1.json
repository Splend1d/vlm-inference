This is a common approach in ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to determine the variability due to the group factor.\n\nThe overall mean of all groups is the sum of all group means divided by the number of groups. The mean of the group means is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Overall Mean} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{Group Mean}}{\\text{Number of Groups}}\n\\]\n\nThe mean of the group means is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Overall Mean} = \\frac{216 + 198 + 240 + 187 + 176}{5} = \\frac{1037}{5} = 207.4\n\\]\n\nThe mean of the group means is 207.4. The mean square factor (MSF) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{MSF} = \\frac{\\sum (\\text{Group Mean} - \\text{Overall Mean})^2}{\\text{Number of Groups} - 1}\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the MSF:\n\n\\[\n\\text{MSF} = \\frac{(216 - 207.4)^2 + (198 - 207.4)^2 + (240 - 207.4)^2 + (187 - 207.4)^2 + (176 - 207.4)^2}{5 - 1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{MSF} = \\frac{(8.6)^2 + (-19.4)^2 + (122.6)^2 + (-20.7)^2 + (-30.6)^2}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{MSF} = \\frac{73.9361 + 379.36 + 15580.36 + 450.441 + 929.769}{4}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{MSF} = \\frac{17355.44}{4} = 4338.86\n\\]\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. 2,328.1"
