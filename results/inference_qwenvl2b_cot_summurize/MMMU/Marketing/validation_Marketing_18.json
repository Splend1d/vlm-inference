The binomial distribution is used when there are two possible outcomes (in this case, working after or without breakfast) and a fixed number of trials (in this case, the number of work hours).\n\nThe formula for the binomial distribution is:\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\cdot p^k \\cdot (1-p)^{n-k} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (work hours),\n- \\( k \\) is the number of successes (time to work after breakfast),\n- \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (time to work without breakfast),\n- \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient, which calculates the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) successes out of \\( n \\) trials.\n\nFor this scenario:\n- \\( n = 10 \\) (work hours),\n- \\( k = 7 \\) (time to work after breakfast),\n- \\( p = 5/6 \\) (time to work without breakfast).\n\nFirst, calculate the binomial coefficient:\n\\[ \\binom{10}{7} = \\frac{10!}{7!(10-7)!} = \\frac{10!}{7!3!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120 \\]\n\nNext, calculate the probability of observing 7 successes (time to work after breakfast) out of 10 trials (work hours):\n\\[ P(X = 7) = \\binom{10}{7} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^7 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 = 120 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^7 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^3 \\]\n\n\\[ P(X = 7) = 120 \\cdot \\frac{5^7 \\cdot 1^3}{6^7 \\cdot 6^3} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{78125 \\cdot 1}{6^7 \\cdot 6^3} \\]\n\n\\[ P(X = 7) = 120 \\cdot \\frac{78125}{6^7 \\cdot 6^3} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{78125}{6^7 \\cdot 6^3} \\]\n\n\\[ P(X = 7) \\approx 0.0004 \\]\n\nTherefore, the p-value is approximately 0.0004.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 0.0004"
