The table used to place bets contains of 38 numbers, and each number is assigned to a color and a range.

There are 10 pairs of numbers that touch each other on the table:\n\n- 10-11\n- 10-12\n- 10-13\n- 11-12\n- 11-13\n- 12-13\n- 13-14\n- 14-15\n- 15-16\n- 16-17\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose two numbers that touch each other is:\n\n\\[10\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning the type of bets you described is:\n\n\\[P = \\frac{\\text{Number of ways to choose 2 numbers that touch each other}}{\\text{Total number of ways to choose 2 numbers}} = \\frac{10}{259} = \\frac{10}{38}\\]\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB. 2/38"
