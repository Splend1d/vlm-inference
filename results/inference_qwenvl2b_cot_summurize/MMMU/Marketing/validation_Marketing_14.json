                "text": "To find the probability \\( P(Y) \\) of landing on yellow, we need to know the total area of the color wheel and the area of the yellow section.\n\nThe total area of the color wheel is the sum of the areas of all sections. Since each section is equal in area, we can calculate the total area as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total area} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\text{Area of one section} \\]\n\nLet's assume the area of one section is \\( A \\). Then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total area} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times A \\]\n\nThe yellow section is one of the sections, so its area is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\times A \\).\n\nThe probability \\( P(Y) \\) of landing on yellow is the ratio of the area of the yellow section to the total area:\n\n\\[ P(Y) = \\frac{\\text{Area of yellow section}}{\\text{Total area}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8} \\times A}{\\frac{1}{8} \\times A} = 1 \\]\n\nSince the probability of landing on yellow is 1, it means that landing on yellow is certain. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 0.625"
