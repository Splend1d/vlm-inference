The table shows the number of goals scored by teams in the Western and Eastern conferences.\n\n1. **Western Conference:**\n   - Los Angeles: 9 goals\n   - FC Dallas: 3 goals\n   - Chivas USA: 4 goals\n   - Real Salt Lake: 3 goals\n   - Colorado: 4 goals\n   - San Jose: 4 goals\n\n2. **Eastern Conference:**\n   - D.C. United: 9 goals\n   - Chicago: 8 goals\n   - Columbus: 7 goals\n   - New England: 6 goals\n   - MetroStars: 5 goals\n   - Kansas City: 3 goals\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the number of goals scored by teams in both conferences is not uniformly distributed. Instead, the distribution appears to be skewed, with some teams scoring more goals than others.\n\nGiven this information, the most appropriate distribution for the hypothesis test is the **uniform distribution**. The uniform distribution is characterized by all values being equally likely, which is not the case here. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. the uniform distribution"
