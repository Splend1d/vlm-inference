Calculate the total fixed costs for 800 clients:\n   - Total fixed costs = $265,000\n   - Fixed cost per client = $265,000 / 800 = $337,500\n\n2. Calculate the total variable costs for 800 clients:\n   - Total variable costs = $180,000\n   - Variable cost per client = $180,000 / 800 = $225,000\n\n3. Calculate the total cost per 800 clients:\n   - Total cost per client = Total fixed costs + Variable costs per client\n   - Total cost per client = $337,500 + $225,000 = $562,500\n\nTherefore, the total cost per 800 clients is $562,500.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. $424,000"
