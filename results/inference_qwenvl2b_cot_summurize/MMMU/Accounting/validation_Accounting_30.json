Year 0:\n\\[ PV_0 = \\frac{\\$9,400}{(1 + 0.10)^1} = \\frac{\\$9,400}{1.10} = \\$8,524.54 \\]\n\n2.

Year 2:\n\\[ PV_2 = \\frac{-\\$3,100}{(1 + 0.10)^1} = \\frac{-\\$3,100}{1.10} = -\\$2,827.27 \\]\n\n4. Year 3:\n\\[ PV_3 = \\frac{-\\$2,400}{(1 + 0.10)^1} = \\frac{-\\$2,400}{1.10} = -\\$2,182.73 \\]\n\n5.
