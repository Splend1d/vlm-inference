The NPV is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ NPV = -C_0 + \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( C_0 \\) is the initial cash flow,\n- \\( C_t \\) is the cash flow at time \\( t \\),\n- \\( r \\) is the required rate of return (rf),\n- \\( n \\) is the number of periods.\n\nGiven cash flows and the required rate of return, we can calculate the NPV. However, since the question asks for the highest possible beta estimate, we will assume that the project's beta is 3.31 (the closest value to 3.31 that is greater than 3.31 and less than 3.47).\n\nLet's calculate the NPV with a beta of 3.31:\n\n\\[ NPV = -40 + \\frac{15}{(1 + 0.08)^1} + \\frac{15}{(1 + 0.08)^2} + \\frac{15}{(1 + 0.08)^3} \\]\n\n\\[ NPV = -40 + \\frac{15}{1.08} + \\frac{15}{1.08^2} + \\frac{15}{1.08^3} \\]\n\n\\[ NPV = -40 + 13.87 + 11.85 + 6.94 \\]\n\n\\[ NPV = 15.66 \\]\n\nSince the NPV is positive, the project's beta estimate is less than 3.31. Therefore, the highest possible beta estimate for the project before its NPV becomes negative is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. 3.47} \\]\n\nThis is the closest value to 3.31 that is greater than 3.31 and less than 3.47."
