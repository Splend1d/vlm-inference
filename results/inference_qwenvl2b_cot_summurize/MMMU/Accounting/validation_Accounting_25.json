The beta of portfolio X is 1.00, which is greater than 1, indicating that it is more volatile than the risk-free rate. This suggests that portfolio X is not fairly priced.\n\n2. **Portfolio Y:**\n   - Expected return: 12%\n   - Beta: 0.25\n   - Risk-free rate: 8%\n\n   The expected return of portfolio Y is lower than the risk-free rate, indicating that it is underpriced. The beta of portfolio Y is 0.25, which is less than 1, indicating that it is less volatile than the risk-free rate. This suggests that portfolio Y is fairly priced.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Are both fairly priced."
