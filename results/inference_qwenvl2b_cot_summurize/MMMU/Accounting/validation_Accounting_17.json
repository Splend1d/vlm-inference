The physical count shows $2,150 remaining. Therefore, the adjustment is $2,150 - $5,000 = -$2,850. This means the balance of the Supplies account is $5,000 - $2,850 = $2,150.\n\n- **Taxes Payable**: The normal balance is $3,850. The adjustment is $3,850 - $3,850 = $0.\n\nNow, we add the adjustments to the normal balance of the Accounts Payable account:\n\n- Accounts Payable: $10,075\n- Adjustments: -$2,850 (Supplies) + $0 (Taxes Payable) = -$2,850\n\nThe balance of the Accounts Payable account is:\n\n$10,075 - $2,850 = $10,075 - $2,850 = $7,225\n\nTherefore, the balance of the Accounts Payable account is $7,225.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. $116,350"
