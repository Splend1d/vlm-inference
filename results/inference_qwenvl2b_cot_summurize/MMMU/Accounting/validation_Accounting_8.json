Finally, we divide the total fixed costs by the total contribution margin to find the sales price per composite unit.\n\n1. Calculate the contribution margin per unit for each product:\n   - Junior: Sales price - Variable cost = $50 - $15 = $35\n   - Adult: Sales price - Variable cost = $75 - $25 = $50\n   - Expert: Sales price - Variable cost = $110 - $60 = $50\n\n2. Sum the contributions to get the total contribution margin:\n   - Total contribution margin = $35 + $50 + $50 = $135\n\n3. Calculate the sales price per composite unit:\n   - Sales price per composite unit = Total fixed costs / Total contribution margin\n   - Sales price per composite unit = $114,750 / $135\n   - Sales price per composite unit = $750\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $750."
