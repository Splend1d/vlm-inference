They are typically characterized by a strong desire to achieve results and are often seen as the \"shaper\" or \"co-ordinator\" roles.\n2. **Social-oriented roles**: These roles are focused on relationships and communication. They are often seen as the \"resource investigator\" or \"monitor evaluator\" roles.\n3. **Thinking roles**: These roles are focused on problem-solving and decision-making. They are often seen as the \"completer-finisher\" or \"specialist\" roles.\n\nThe model suggests that each person tends to have a 'preferred role,' a 'manageable role,' and a 'least preferred role.' When you understand your team members' preferred roles and align them with the team, you can take full advantage of your team's strengths.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. **Action-oriented role**: This role is typically associated with the 'shaper' or 'co-ordinator' roles, which are action-oriented.\nB. **Thought role**: This role is associated with the 'resource investigator' or 'monitor evaluator' roles, which are thought-oriented.\nC. **Social-oriented role**: This role is associated with the 'completer-finisher' or 'specialist' roles, which are social-oriented.\nD. **Catering to customer personas**: This role is not explicitly mentioned in Belbin's model. It could be considered a social-oriented role, but it is not a specific role type.\n\nGiven the analysis, the option that is wrong is:\n\nD. Catering to customer personas\n\nCatering to customer personas is not a specific role type mentioned in Belbin's model."
