The model is divided into three main categories: Information Technology Practices Capability, Information Management Practices Capability, and Information Behaviors and Values Capability.\n2. Each of these categories is further divided into subcategories:\n   - Information Technology Practices Capability: Sensing, Processing, Maintaining, Organizing, Collecting\n   - Information Management Practices Capability: Sensing, Processing, Maintaining, Organizing, Collecting\n   - Information Behaviors and Values Capability: Proactiveness, Sharing, Transparency, Control, Formality, Integrity\n\n3. The options provided are:\n   - A. Information collection and integration\n   - B. IT practices\n   - C. Information management\n   - D. Information Behavior and Values\n\nFrom the analysis, it is clear that the ability \"Information collection and integration\" is not included in the options provided. The model does not include this capability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Information collection and integration"
