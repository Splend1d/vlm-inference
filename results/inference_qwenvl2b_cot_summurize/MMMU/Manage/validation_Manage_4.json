To project future occupancy, management would like to determine the mathematical trend of guest registration. This estimate will help the hotel determine whether future expansion will be needed. Given the following time-series data, develop a regression equation relating registrations to time (e.g., a trend equation). Then forecast year 11 registrations.

Let's analyze the given data:\n\nYear 1: 17\nYear 2: 16\nYear 3: 16\nYear 4: 21\nYear 5: 20\nYear 6: 20\nYear 7: 23\nYear 8: 25\nYear 9: 24\n\nFrom the data, we can see that the registrations are increasing by 1 each year. Therefore, the trend equation can be written as:\n\nRegistrations = a + b * Time\n\nWhere:\n- a is the intercept (the number of registrations when Time = 0)\n- b is the slope (the rate of increase in registrations per year)\n\nTo find the intercept (a), we can use the first data point:\n17 = a + b * 1\n\nSolving for a:\na = 17 - b\n\nTo find the slope (b), we can use the second data point:\n21 = a + b * 2\n\nSolving for b:\nb = 21 - 2a\n\nNow, we can find the intercept (a) and the slope (b) using the first two data points:\na = 17 - b\na = 17 - (21 - 2a)\na = 17 - 21 + 2a\na = 4 + 2a\na = 4\n\nb = 21 - 2a\nb = 21 - 2(4)\nb = 21 - 8\nb = 13\n\nNow we have the intercept (a) and the slope (b):\na = 4\nb = 13\n\nThe trend equation is:\nRegistrations = 4 + 13 * Time\n\nTo forecast year 11 registrations, we substitute Time = 11:\nRegistrations = 4 + 13 * 11\nRegistrations = 4 + 143\nRegistrations = 270\n\nTherefore, the forecasted year 11 registrations is 270, which corresponds to option A."
