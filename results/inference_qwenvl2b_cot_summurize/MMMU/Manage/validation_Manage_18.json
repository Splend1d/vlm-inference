The image shows a soldier giving a lecture on a diagram of the Battle of Passchendaele.\n2. The diagram illustrates a mismatch between the abstract strategy Mintzberg is presenting and the actual battlefield conditions.\n3. The soldier is pointing to a hole in the ground, which represents the actual terrain of the battlefield.\n4. The diagram shows a mismatch between the strategic plan and the actual combat situation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the mismatch is between the abstract strategy presented by the soldier and the actual battlefield conditions depicted in the diagram.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. Mismatch between abstract thinking and experience"
