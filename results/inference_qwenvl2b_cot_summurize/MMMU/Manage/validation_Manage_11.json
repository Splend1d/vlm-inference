Stakeholder theory is primarily concerned with the relationships and interactions between stakeholders and the organization, not with the multidimensionality of stakeholders themselves.\n\nTherefore, the option that is not considered by critics of stakeholder theory to be a benefit to stakeholders is:\n\nD. multidimensional"
