                "text": "To determine the difference between the brains of tortoises and rabbits, let's analyze the image and the question step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the type of logical reasoning involved**: The question is about understanding the difference in brain function between tortoises and rabbits, which involves comparing their cognitive abilities.\n\n2. **Carefully read the image**: The image shows a hare and a tortoise. The hare is running towards a carrot, while the tortoise is walking. The question asks about the difference in brain function between these two animals.\n\n3. **Analyze the options**:\n   - **A. calculating**: This option suggests that rabbits are better at calculating, which is not necessarily true. Rabbits are known for their quick reflexes and adaptability, not necessarily for calculating.\n   - **B. analytical**: This option suggests that rabbits are better at analytical thinking, which is also not necessarily true. Rabbits are known for their quick reflexes and adaptability, not necessarily for analytical thinking.\n   - **C. category dependent**: This option suggests that the difference lies in their ability to categorize or classify, which is not necessarily true. Rabbits and tortoises are not necessarily better at categorizing or classifying.\n   - **D. synthetic**: This option suggests that rabbits are better at synthesizing information, which is not necessarily true. Rabbits are known for their quick reflexes and adaptability, not necessarily for synthesizing information.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The image does not provide enough information to definitively determine the difference in brain function between rabbits and tortoises. However, based on the image alone, it is not possible to definitively conclude which brain function is more developed in rabbits or tortoises.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**C. category dependent**."
