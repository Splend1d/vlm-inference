The slope of the regression line indicates the rate of change in the number of injuries and illnesses over time.\n\nThe dotted line connects the points for 2003 and 2011, representing the average rate of change in reported injuries and illness over the eight-year period. This line is used to predict future trends.\n\nTo determine which regression line is least successful at predicting the number of injuries and illnesses, we need to consider the slope of the regression line and the direction of the trend.\n\nThe slope of the solid line is negative, indicating a decreasing trend in the number of injuries and illnesses over time. The slope of the dotted line is also negative, but it is closer to zero, indicating a slower rate of change.\n\nTherefore, the least-squares regression line is least successful at predicting the number of injury and illness reports in 2003.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. 2003"
