The figure suggests that the process of divergence and convergence is sequential, with divergence leading to convergence.\n\n- **Option A: No need to diverge**\n  - This option suggests that divergence is unnecessary. However, the figure shows that divergence precedes convergence, indicating that divergence is necessary for innovation.\n\n- **Option B: Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent**\n  - This option implies that disagreement is a waste of time and effort. The figure shows that divergence leads to convergence, suggesting that divergence is productive and valuable.\n\n- **Option C: Convergence proceeds too slowly**\n  - This option suggests that convergence is slow. The figure shows that divergence leads to convergence, indicating that convergence is not necessarily slow.\n\n- **Option D: The process of divergence-convergence is of little significance**\n  - This option suggests that the process of divergence-convergence is unimportant. The figure shows that divergence leads to convergence, indicating that the process is significant.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most accurate option is:\n\n**B. Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent**\n\nThis option aligns with the idea that divergence precedes convergence, suggesting that disagreement is a waste of time and effort."
