The line of best fit, represented by the solid line, is a straight line that passes through the data points.\n\n1. Identify the points where the 3-year and 5-year returns are equal.\n2. Count the number of such points.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the points where the 3-year and 5-year returns are equal are located at the following points:\n- (5%, 5%)\n- (10%, 10%)\n- (15%, 15%)\n\nThese points are marked with diamonds.\n\nTherefore, the number of funds that have equal 3-year and 5-year returns is 3.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nC. 3"
