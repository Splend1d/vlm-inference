The tongue has four main taste buds, which are located in the following areas:\n\n1. Tip of tongue (4)\n2. Front part of tongue (3)\n3. Back part of tongue (2)\n4. Back part of tongue (4)\n\nThe areas 2 and 4 are the most sensitive to taste. Therefore, a loss of taste would be expected in areas 2 and 4.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nC. 3 and 4"
