The image shows a significant amount of blood and tissue damage, which is consistent with prolonged immobilization.\n\n2. **Inhalation of inorganic dusts**: This is a less common cause of sudden death in individuals who have been immobilized for an extended period. The image does not show any signs of inhalation.\n\n3. **Prolonged immobilization**: This is a well-known risk factor for sudden death in individuals who have been immobilized for an extended period. The image shows significant tissue damage, which is consistent with prolonged immobilization.\n\n4. **Bronchopneumonia**: This is a common cause of sudden death in individuals who have been immobilized for an extended period. The image does not show any signs of pneumonia.\n\nGiven these observations, the most likely risk factor for the woman's immediate cause of death is:\n\n**C. Prolonged immobilization**"
