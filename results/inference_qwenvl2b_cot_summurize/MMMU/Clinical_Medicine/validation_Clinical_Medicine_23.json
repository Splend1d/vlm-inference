They appear as two round, dense structures on either side of the spine.\n\n2. **Small Intestines**: The small intestines are located in the abdominal cavity, extending from the stomach to the rectum. They appear as a series of loops and are typically visible as a series of curved, tubular structures.\n\n3. **Liver**: The liver is located on the right side of the abdomen, just below the rib cage. It appears as a large, round organ with a distinct outline.\n\n4. **Spine**: The spine is visible as a series of vertebrae running down the center of the image. It is not typically enlarged in a normal abdominal radiograph.\n\nFrom the analysis, the organs that appear abnormally large in the abdominal radiograph are:\n\n- Kidneys\n- Small Intestines\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Kidneys"
