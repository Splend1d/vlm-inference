They are not described in the image.\n2. **Seborrheic keratoses**: These are common benign skin lesions that appear as small, raised, scaly patches. They are not described in the image.\n3. **Fibroepithelial polyps**: These are benign skin lesions that appear as small, raised, scaly patches.

They are not described in the image.\n5. **Epidermal inclusion cysts**: These are benign skin lesions that appear as small, raised, scaly patches. They are not described in the image.\n\nGiven the description of the skin lesions in the image, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**B. Seborrheic keratoses**\n\nSeborrheic keratoses are common benign skin lesions that appear as small, raised, scaly patches. They are not described in the image, but they are a common condition that can be seen in the context of the patient's history of skin lesions not increasing in size since childhood.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B.
