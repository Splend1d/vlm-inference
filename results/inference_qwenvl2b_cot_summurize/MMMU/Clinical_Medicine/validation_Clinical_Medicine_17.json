This scenario is repeated on multiple occasions over the next 6 weeks. On physical examination she has no abnormal findings. A transbronchial biopsy is performed after she is hospitalized with respiratory distress. The microscopic appearance of the biopsy is shown here.

The image shows a significant number of these particles, which is consistent with influenza.\n\n2. **Hypersensitivity pneumonitis**: This is a type of lung inflammation caused by an allergic reaction to airborne particles. The image does not show any particles that would indicate an allergic reaction.\n\n3. **Diffuse alveolar damage**: This is a condition characterized by the destruction of alveolar walls, leading to the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli. The image shows a significant number of alveoli filled with fluid, which is consistent with diffuse alveolar damage.\n\n4. **Miliary tuberculosis**: This is a form of tuberculosis characterized by the presence of multiple small, discrete tubercles. The image does not show any tubercles, which are characteristic of miliary tuberculosis.\n\nGiven the microscopic appearance of the biopsy, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**C. Diffuse alveolar damage**\n\nThis is supported by the presence of significant numbers of alveoli filled with fluid, which is characteristic of diffuse alveolar damage."
