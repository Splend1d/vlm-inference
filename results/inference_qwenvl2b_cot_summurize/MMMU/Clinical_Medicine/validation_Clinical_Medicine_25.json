On physical examination there is a firm, well-circumscribed, non-tender nodule to the right of midline in her neck. She undergoes thyroidectomy and the microscopic appearance of the lesion is shown here. Which of the following statements regarding her disease is most appropriate? <image 1> \n\nA. The serum TSH is probably increased\nB. She will probably survive for at least 10 years\nC. Anti-microsomal and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are detectable\nD.

The lesion appears to be a thyroid nodule.\n\n2. **Serum TSH**: The serum TSH level is not provided in the image, so we cannot determine if it is increased.\n\n3. **Survival**: The image does not provide information about the patient's survival rate.\n\n4. **Anti-microsomal and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies**: The image does not show any antibodies, so we cannot determine if they are detectable.\n\n5. **Dietary Iodine Deficiency**: The image does not show any signs of iodine deficiency, so we cannot determine if it is a dietary iodine deficiency.\n\n6. **Relative with Similar Condition**: The image does not show any relatives with a similar condition, so we cannot determine if the patient has relatives with a similar condition.\n\nGiven the information provided in the image, the most appropriate statement regarding the disease is:\n\n**C. Anti-microsomal and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are detectable**\n\nThis statement is supported by the microscopic appearance of the lesion, which shows a thyroid nodule with a well-circumscribed, non-tender appearance."
