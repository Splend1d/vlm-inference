A girl infant is born at 32 weeks gestation and is markedly icteric. The microscopic appearance of the placenta is shown here. Laboratory studies show the baby has a Hct of 18%, and an exchange transfusion is performed. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated and resulted in the birth of a normal girl at term. Which of the following immunologic mechanisms is most likely to produce these findings? <image 1> \n\nA. Anti-receptor antibody\nB. Immune complex formation\nC. Complement mediated cell destruction\nD. Delayed type hypersensitivity\nE. Loss of self tolerance\n"

                "text": "The microscopic appearance of the placenta shown in the image indicates a condition known as hydrops fetalis, which is characterized by excessive fluid accumulation in the fetus. This condition is often associated with immune-mediated processes, particularly in the context of maternal immune responses to fetal antigens.\n\nAmong the options provided, the most likely mechanism is:\n\nB. Immune complex formation\n\nImmune complex formation is a type of immune response where antibodies bind to antigens on the surface of the fetus, leading to the formation of immune complexes. These complexes can then bind to complement proteins, leading to complement activation and cell destruction. This process is a common mechanism in the pathogenesis of hydrops fetalis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Immune complex formation"
