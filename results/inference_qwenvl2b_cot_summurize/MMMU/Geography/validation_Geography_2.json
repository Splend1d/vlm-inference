The diagram shows a joint rose, which is a graphical representation of the joints in a rock formation.\n2. The length of the straight line segment that projects from the center of the semicircle in the radial direction is likely to represent the joint dip angle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Joint dip angle"
