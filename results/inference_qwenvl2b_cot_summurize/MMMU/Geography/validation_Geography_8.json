                "text": "To determine the pore water pressure at point G, we need to consider the flow network and the equipotential lines. The flow network shows the water head gradient and the equipotential lines, which are lines of equal water head.\n\n1. **Identify the Equipotential Lines**: The equipotential lines are evenly spaced and divide the flow network into segments. The number of equipotential lines is given as 22.\n\n2. **Determine the Water Head Gradient**: The water head gradient is the difference in water head between two consecutive equipotential lines. In this case, the gradient is 11.5m.\n\n3. **Calculate the Water Head at Point G**: The water head at point G is 11.5m above the ground level. Since the flow network is evenly divided into 22 equipotential lines, the water head at point G is 11.5m / 22 = 0.524m.\n\n4. **Calculate the Pore Water Pressure**: The pore water pressure is the difference between the water head at point G and the water head at the ground level. The water head at the ground level is 0m.\n\n5. **Calculate the Pore Water Pressure**: The pore water pressure is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pore Water Pressure} = \\text{Water Head at Point G} - \\text{Water Head at Ground Level}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Pore Water Pressure} = 0.524m - 0m = 0.524m\n   \\]\n\n6. **Round to the Nearest kPa**: The pore water pressure is 0.524m, which is approximately 52.4kPa.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to the pore water pressure at point G is **D. 145kPa**."
