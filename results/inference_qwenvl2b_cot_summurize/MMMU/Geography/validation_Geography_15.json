Siltstone is composed of silt particles that are cemented together.\n\nB. **Shale is Clay, breaking easily into flat flakes and plates**: This is correct. Shale is composed of clay minerals that break easily into flat flakes and plates.\n\nC. **Chert is Silica, a microcrystalline form of quartz**: This is correct. Chert is composed of silica, a microcrystalline form of quartz.\n\nD. **None**: This is incorrect. The given information includes examples of each rock type, such as sandstone, siltstone, shale, and mudstone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
