The international standard thermometers typically have a scale that ranges from -100\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, which is represented by the orange scale on the bottom thermometer.\n\nThe top thermometer in the image has a scale that ranges from -100\u00b0F to 212\u00b0F, which is represented by the blue scale.\n\nSince the international standard thermometers have a scale that ranges from -100\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, the bottom thermometer is the one that represents the international standard.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. The bottom one"
