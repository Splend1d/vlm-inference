                "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use Ohm's Law, which states that the current through a resistor is directly proportional to the voltage across it. In this circuit, the voltage across the resistor is the sum of the voltage across the 1A resistor and the voltage across the 0.5A resistor.\n\nLet's denote the voltage across the 1A resistor as \\( V_1 \\) and the voltage across the 0.5A resistor as \\( V_2 \\). Then, we have:\n\n\\[ V_1 = 1A \\times 1.5V \\]\n\\[ V_2 = 0.5A \\times 1.5V \\]\n\nAdding these two voltages gives us the total voltage across the resistor:\n\n\\[ V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 \\]\n\\[ V_{total} = 1A \\times 1.5V + 0.5A \\times 1.5V \\]\n\\[ V_{total} = 1.5V + 0.75V \\]\n\\[ V_{total} = 2.25V \\]\n\nNow, we can use Ohm's Law to find the current through the resistor:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{V_{total}}{R} \\]\n\\[ I = \\frac{2.25V}{1A} \\]\n\\[ I = 2.25A \\]\n\nHowever, this result doesn't match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nThe problem states that the current through the 1A resistor is 1A and the current through the 0.5A resistor is 0.5A. The total current through the circuit is the sum of these two currents:\n\n\\[ I_{total} = I_1 + I_2 \\]\n\\[ I_{total} = 1A + 0.5A \\]\n\\[ I_{total} = 1.5A \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1A, and 1.5A"
