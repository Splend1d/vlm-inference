This method is specifically designed to measure the density and compactness of soil samples, including crushed stone fill. The SPT involves driving a penetrometer into the soil sample and measuring the penetration resistance, which is inversely proportional to the density of the soil.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
