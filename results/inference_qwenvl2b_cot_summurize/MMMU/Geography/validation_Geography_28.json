It is not shown in the image.\n\n2. **Capillary water**: This type of water is held around soil particles by capillary tension. It is shown in the image, where excess water is no longer flowing downward and is available to plants.\n\n3. **Hygroscopic water**: This type of water is held by adhesion and is not available to plants. It is shown in the image, where water held by adhesion is not available to plants.\n\nBased on the image and the description, the type of water located on the surfaces of individual soil particles and largely unavailable to plants is:\n\nC.
