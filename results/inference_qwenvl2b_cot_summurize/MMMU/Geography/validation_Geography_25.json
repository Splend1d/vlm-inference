However, the image shows a vertical arrangement of the waterproof layer, which is not consistent with the upstream surface placement.\n\n2. **Option B: The roll waterproof layer is laid on the back surface of the external wall**\n   - This option suggests laying the waterproof layer on the back surface of the wall. However, the image shows a horizontal arrangement of the waterproof layer, which is not consistent with the back surface placement.\n\n3. **Option C: The outer wall roll adopts the empty laying method**\n   - This option suggests laying the outer wall roll without any additional materials. However, the image shows a horizontal arrangement of the waterproof layer, which is not consistent with the empty laying method.\n\n4. **Option D: When laying double layer coils, the two layers of coils are perpendicular to each other**\n   - This option suggests laying the waterproof layer in a specific pattern. However, the image shows a horizontal arrangement of the waterproof layer, which is not consistent with the perpendicular arrangement.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct method for constructing the waterproofing layer of the basement exterior wall with coiled materials is:\n\n**Option B: The roll waterproof layer is laid on the back surface of the external wall**\n\nThis option aligns with the horizontal arrangement of the waterproof layer shown in the image."
