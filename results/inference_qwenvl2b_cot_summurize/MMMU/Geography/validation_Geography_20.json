                "text": "To determine the natural pore ratio of the cohesive soil, we need to understand the concept of pore ratio and how it relates to the natural water content of the soil.\n\nThe natural pore ratio of a soil is defined as the ratio of the volume of the pores to the total volume of the soil. In the context of the given diagram, the natural pore ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the volume of the soil:\n   - The volume of the soil is the area of the base (2m x 4m) times the height (2.4m).\n   - Volume of soil = 2m x 4m x 2.4m = 19.2m\u00b3.\n\n2. Calculate the volume of the water:\n   - The volume of water is the product of the natural water content (60%) and the volume of the soil.\n   - Volume of water = 60% x 19.2m\u00b3 = 11.52m\u00b3.\n\n3. Calculate the volume of the pores:\n   - The volume of the pores is the difference between the volume of the soil and the volume of the water.\n   - Volume of pores = Volume of soil - Volume of water = 19.2m\u00b3 - 11.52m\u00b3 = 7.68m\u00b3.\n\n4. Calculate the natural pore ratio:\n   - Natural pore ratio = Volume of pores / Volume of soil = 7.68m\u00b3 / 19.2m\u00b3 = 0.39.\n\n5. Convert the natural pore ratio to a percentage:\n   - Natural pore ratio = 0.39 x 100% = 39%.\n\nTherefore, the natural pore ratio of the cohesive soil is closest to 39%, which corresponds to option D."
