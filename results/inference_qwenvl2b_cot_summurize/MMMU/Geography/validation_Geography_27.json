Cohesive soils are typically classified as either plastic or soft plastic.\n\n- **Plastic:** The soil is pliable and can be molded into a shape without breaking. The cone settlement measurement would be less than 10mm.\n- **Soft Plastic:** The soil is more plastic than a plastic soil but less than a soft plastic soil. The cone settlement measurement would be between 10mm and 20mm.\n\nGiven the depth of penetration (6mm) and the fact that the cone settlement measurement is less than 10mm, the soil belongs to the category of **soft plastic**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. Soft plastic"
