They are typically formed by the erosion of the rock by wind and water. In the image, the aretes are the prominent, steep ridges that extend from the main mountain massif.\n\n2. **B. eskers**: Eskers are long, narrow, and steeply sloping ridges that extend from the main massif of a mountain. They are formed by the erosion of the rock by meltwater from glaciers. In the image, the eskers are the long, narrow, and steeply sloping ridges that extend from the main mountain massif.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n\nA. aretes\nB. eskers"
