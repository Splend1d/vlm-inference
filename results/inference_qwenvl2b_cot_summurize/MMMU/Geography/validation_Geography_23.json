It does not exhibit oblique bending or torsion.\n\n2. **Channel Steel**: The channel steel has a rectangular cross-section with a straight line of action for the force \\(P\\). It does not exhibit oblique bending or torsion.\n\n3. **I-Beam**: The I-beam has a rectangular cross-section with a curved line of action for the force \\(P\\). It does not exhibit oblique bending or torsion.\n\n4. **Equilateral Angle Steel**: The equilateral angle steel has a triangular cross-section with a curved line of action for the force \\(P\\). It does not exhibit oblique bending or torsion.\n\nGiven the options, the only cross-section that exhibits both oblique bending and torsion is the **I-beam**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC.
