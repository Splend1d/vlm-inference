The balls are not arranged in any specific pattern or order.\n\n2. **Picture (b)**: The jar is empty, and the balls are scattered around the table. The balls are not arranged in any specific pattern or order.\n\nBoth pictures show a lack of order, with the balls scattered around the table. However, the first picture (a) has a slightly more organized arrangement because the balls are not in a single, continuous line or pattern, while the second picture (b) shows a more random distribution of the balls.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. a"
