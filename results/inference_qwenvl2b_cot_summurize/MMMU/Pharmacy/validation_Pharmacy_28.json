The compound has a central carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms and two carbon atoms.\n2. The central carbon atom is bonded to two oxygen atoms, which indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n\nGiven this information, the compound is a ketone, specifically a ketonic carbonyl group.\n\nNow, let's match this with the options provided:\n\nA. -OH, ethanol.\nB. one oxygen attached to two alkyl groups, diethyl ether.\nC. ketonic carbonyl, propane-2-one.\nD. -COOH, acetic acid.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. ketonic carbonyl, propane-2-one"
