This is because the carbon atom that forms the new bond is bonded to the same carbon atom as the leaving group (the carbonyl group in this case), which is a characteristic of 6-endo-tet cyclizations.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. The cyclisation is defined as 6-exo-tet and is allowed by Baldwin's rules.\n- This is incorrect because the cyclization is not 6-exo-tet, but rather 6-endo-tet.\n\nB. The cyclisation is defined as 6-exo-trig and is allowed by Baldwin's rules.\n- This is incorrect because the cyclization is not 6-exo-trig, but rather 6-endo-tet.\n\nC. The cyclisation is defined as 6-endo-tet and is allowed by Baldwin's rules.\n- This is correct because the cyclization is 6-endo-tet.\n\nD. The cyclisation is defined as 6-endo-trig and is allowed by Baldwin's rules.\n- This is incorrect because the cyclization is not 6-endo-trig, but rather 6-endo-tet.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nC.
