It is a rod-shaped bacterium with a single polar flagellum.\n\n2. **Chlamydia trachomatis**: This is a bacterium that causes trachoma and other eye infections. It is also a rod-shaped bacterium with a single polar flagellum.\n\n3. **Treponema pallidum**: This is a type of bacterium that causes syphilis. It is a spiral-shaped bacterium with a single polar flagellum.\n\n4. **Haemophilis ducreyi**: This is a bacterium that causes a rare form of meningitis. It is a rod-shaped bacterium with a single polar flagellum.\n\nThe microbe in the image appears to be a spiral-shaped bacterium with a single polar flagellum. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Treponema pallidum"
