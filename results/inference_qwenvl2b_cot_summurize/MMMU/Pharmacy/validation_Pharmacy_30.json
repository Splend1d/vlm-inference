The conversion factor for calories per gram is calculated as follows:\n\nCalories per gram = Calories per serving / Serving size\nCalories per gram = 160 / 30\nCalories per gram = 5.33 Calories/g\n\nb. To calculate the mass in kilograms for 20 servings, we multiply the mass in grams by the conversion factor:\n\nMass in kilograms = Mass in grams / 1000\nMass in kilograms = 20 * 5.33\nMass in kilograms = 106.6 kg\n\nc. The mass of protein in micrograms for one serving is calculated as follows:\n\nProtein in micrograms = Calories from fat * 6g protein / Calories per gram\nProtein in micrograms = 20 * 6 / 5.33\nProtein in micrograms = 28.05 micrograms\n\nd. The number of significant figures for the answer in item a is 7.2, as it is a whole number and the conversion factor is a decimal number."
