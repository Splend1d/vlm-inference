The data points are plotted on a graph with a linear relationship.\n3. The slope of the line indicates the ratio of mass of iron to mass of oxygen.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the ratio of mass of iron to mass of oxygen is approximately 2.25 for the first sample, 2.3 for the second sample, 2.2 for the third sample, and 2.3 for the fourth sample.\n\nSince the ratio of mass of iron to mass of oxygen is the same for all four samples, it suggests that all four samples are the same compound.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. True"
