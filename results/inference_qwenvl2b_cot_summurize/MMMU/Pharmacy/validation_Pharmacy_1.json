The equation given is:\n\n\\[ 4NH_3(g) + 3O_2(g) \\rightarrow 2N_2(g) + 6H_2O(l) \\]\n\nFrom the equation, we can see that:\n\n- 4 moles of ammonia react with 3 moles of oxygen.\n- 2 moles of nitrogen are produced from 4 moles of ammonia.\n- 6 moles of water are produced from 3 moles of oxygen.\n\nGiven that there are 3.0 moles of oxygen, we can determine the number of moles of ammonia and nitrogen as follows:\n\n1. **Moles of ammonia:**\n   - From the equation, 4 moles of ammonia react with 3 moles of oxygen.\n   - Therefore, the number of moles of ammonia is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) moles.\n   - Given that there are 3.0 moles of oxygen, the number of moles of ammonia is \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\times 3.0 = 4.0 \\) moles.\n\n2. **Moles of nitrogen:**\n   - From the equation, 2 moles of nitrogen are produced from 4 moles of ammonia.\n   - Therefore, the number of moles of nitrogen is \\( \\frac{4}{2} \\) moles.\n   - Given that there are 3.0 moles of ammonia, the number of moles of nitrogen is \\( \\frac{4}{2} \\times 3.0 = 6.0 \\) moles.\n\n3. **Moles of water:**\n   - From the equation, 6 moles of water are produced from 3 moles of oxygen.\n   - Therefore, the number of moles of water is \\( \\frac{6}{3} \\) moles.\n   - Given that there are 3.0 moles of oxygen, the number of moles of water is \\( \\frac{6}{3} \\times 3.0 = 6.0 \\) moles.\n\nSo, the number of moles of all remaining reactants and products is:\n\n- 4.0 moles of ammonia\n- 6.0 moles of water\n- 6.0 moles of nitrogen\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 4.0 mol of NH3,2.0 mol of N2,6.0 mol of H2O**"
