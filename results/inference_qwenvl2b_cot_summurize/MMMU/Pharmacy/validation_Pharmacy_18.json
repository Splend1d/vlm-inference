Graph 3.\n\nGraph 3 shows a curve that starts at a high AUC/Dose ratio, then decreases, and finally levels off, which is characteristic of a pharmacokinetic phenomenon where the absorption of a drug is initially rapid but then slows down as the drug accumulates in the body. This is often seen in transdermal absorption, where the drug is absorbed through the skin and then transported into the bloodstream."
