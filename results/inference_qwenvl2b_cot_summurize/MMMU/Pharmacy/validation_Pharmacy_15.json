In a hydrogen evolution reaction, the anode is where hydrogen is produced.\n   - In this case, the current flows out of the solution, indicating that hydrogen is being produced at the anode.\n\n2. **Cathode (B):**\n   - The cathode is the electrode where the current flows into the solution. In a hydrogen evolution reaction, the cathode is where hydrogen is consumed.\n   - In this case, the current flows into the solution, indicating that hydrogen is being consumed at the cathode.\n\nSince the current flows out of the solution at the anode, hydrogen is produced at the anode.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA.
