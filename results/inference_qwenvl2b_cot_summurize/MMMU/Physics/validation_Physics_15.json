                "text": "To determine the film thickness for maximum constructive interference between the incident beam and the reflected beam, we need to consider the condition for constructive interference, which is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ n_1 \\lambda = n_f \\lambda \\]\n\nwhere \\( n_1 \\) is the index of refraction of the film, \\( n_f \\) is the index of refraction of the film, and \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the light.\n\nGiven that \\( n_1 < n_f \\), we can rearrange the equation to solve for \\( n_f \\):\n\n\\[ n_f = \\frac{n_1 \\lambda}{\\lambda} \\]\n\n\\[ n_f = n_1 \\]\n\nThis means that the index of refraction of the film is equal to the index of refraction of the film itself. This condition is only satisfied when the film is a perfect mirror, which is not the case here. However, the question asks for the condition for constructive interference, which is when the film is a perfect mirror, \\( n_f = n_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. $\\lambda / 4$"
