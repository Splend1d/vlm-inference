                "text": "To determine the speed of light in the plastic, we need to consider the behavior of the light ray at point P. The speed of light in a medium is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{c}{n} \\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 299,792,458 meters per second) and \\( n \\) is the refractive index of the medium.\n\nIn this case, the light ray enters the plastic at an angle of 53 degrees and exits at an angle of 37 degrees. The angle of incidence (\\( i \\)) is the angle between the incident ray and the normal to the interface between the plastic and air. The angle of refraction (\\( r \\)) is the angle between the refracted ray and the normal to the interface.\n\nThe angle of incidence (\\( i \\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ i = 90^\\circ - \\text{angle of refraction} \\]\n\n\\[ i = 90^\\circ - 37^\\circ \\]\n\n\\[ i = 53^\\circ \\]\n\nThe angle of refraction (\\( r \\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ r = 90^\\circ - \\text{angle of incidence} \\]\n\n\\[ r = 90^\\circ - 53^\\circ \\]\n\n\\[ r = 37^\\circ \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the refractive index (\\( n \\)) using the formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{sin(i)}{sin(r)} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{sin(53^\\circ)}{sin(37^\\circ)} \\]\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{sin(53^\\circ)}{sin(37^\\circ)} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator, we find:\n\n\\[ n \\approx 1.13 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the speed of light in the plastic using the refractive index:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{c}{n} \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}}{1.13} \\]\n\n\\[ v \\approx 2.69 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the plastic is approximately 2.69 x 10^8 meters per second, which corresponds to option C."
