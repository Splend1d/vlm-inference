                "text": "To determine the minimum thickness of the glass that gives the reflected light an orange-like color, we need to consider the condition for the reflection of light at a glass-air interface. The condition for the reflection of light at a glass-air interface is given by Snell's Law:\n\n\\[ n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) \\]\n\nwhere \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\) are the indices of refraction of the glass and air, respectively, and \\( \\theta_1 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 \\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this case, the angle of incidence \\( \\theta_1 \\) is 0 (since the light ray is incident normal to the glass-air interface), and the angle of refraction \\( \\theta_2 \\) is the angle at which the light ray is reflected. The wavelength of the light is given as \\( \\lambda \\) (air) orange light = 600nm.\n\nFirst, we need to find the index of refraction \\( n_2 \\) of the glass. The index of refraction of glass is typically between 1.33 and 1.50, depending on the specific glass. For simplicity, let's assume \\( n_2 = 1.50 \\).\n\nNow, we can use Snell's Law to find the minimum thickness of the glass that gives the reflected light an orange-like color:\n\n\\[ 1.00 \\sin(0) = 1.50 \\sin(\\theta_2) \\]\n\nSince \\( \\sin(0) = 0 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ 0 = 1.50 \\sin(\\theta_2) \\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\sin(\\theta_2) \\):\n\n\\[ \\sin(\\theta_2) = 0 \\]\n\nThis means that the angle of refraction \\( \\theta_2 \\) is 0 degrees, which means that the light ray is reflected directly back into the air. Therefore, the minimum thickness of the glass that gives the reflected light an orange-like color is 0 nanometers.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimum thickness of the glass that gives the reflected light an orange-like color. Since the light ray is incident normal to the glass-air interface, the minimum thickness of the glass that gives the reflected light an orange-like color is 0 nanometers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 50 nm"
