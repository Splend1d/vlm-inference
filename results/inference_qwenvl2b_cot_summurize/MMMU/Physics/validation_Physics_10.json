                "text": "To determine which of the given options is true for both spheres, we need to analyze the motion of each sphere.\n\n### For Sphere 1 (Spring-mass system):\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The sphere is released from rest at its equilibrium position.\n2. **Motion**: The sphere undergoes simple harmonic motion due to the spring force.\n3. **Kinetic Energy**: The maximum kinetic energy is attained when the sphere reaches its equilibrium position. This is because the spring force is maximum at this point, and the sphere has the maximum velocity at this position.\n\n### For Sphere 2 (Simple Pendulum):\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The sphere is released from rest at its equilibrium position.\n2. **Motion**: The sphere undergoes simple harmonic motion due to the gravitational force.\n3. **Potential Energy**: The minimum gravitational potential energy is attained as the sphere reaches its equilibrium position. This is because the gravitational force is maximum at this point, and the sphere has the minimum potential energy at this position.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Option A**: The maximum kinetic energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.\n- **Option B**: The minimum gravitational potential energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.\n- **Option C**: The maximum gravitational potential energy is attained when the sphere reaches its point of release.\n- **Option D**: The maximum total energy is attained only as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A**."
