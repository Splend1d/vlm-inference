                "text": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the forces and torques acting on the uniform rod. The rod is held in place by a rope and a wall, and we know the weight of the rod. We can use the concept of torques to find the force exerted by the rope.\n\nThe torque about a point is given by the formula:\n\nTorque = Moment of Inertia \u00d7 Torque about the Point\n\nThe moment of inertia of a uniform rod about an axis through its center of mass is given by:\n\nMoment of Inertia = (1/12) * (length of rod)\u00b2 * (weight of rod)\n\nIn this case, the moment of inertia is:\n\nMoment of Inertia = (1/12) * (length of rod)\u00b2 * (weight of rod)\n\nThe force exerted by the rope is the torque divided by the moment of inertia:\n\nForce = Torque / Moment of Inertia\n\nSubstituting the values we know:\n\nForce = (Torque) / ((1/12) * (length of rod)\u00b2 * (weight of rod))\n\nSince we don't know the exact values of the torque and the moment of inertia, we can't determine the exact force exerted by the rope. However, we can say that the force exerted by the rope is a function of the torque and the moment of inertia, and it will be a constant value for a given torque and moment of inertia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nE. 1, 2, or 3"
