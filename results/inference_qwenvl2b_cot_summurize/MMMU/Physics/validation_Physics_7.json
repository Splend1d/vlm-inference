An eccentricity of 0 indicates a perfect circle, while an eccentricity greater than 1 indicates an elongated ellipse, and an eccentricity less than 1 indicates a compressed ellipse.\n\n2. **Points on the orbit**: Points A, B, C, and D are on the elliptical orbit.\n\n3. **Position of the Sun**: The diagram does not provide enough information to determine the exact position of the sun relative to the points A, B, C, and D.\n\nGiven the options:\n- **A. the eccentricity of the orbit is less than zero**: This is incorrect because the eccentricity of an ellipse cannot be less than zero.\n- **B. the eccentricity of the orbit is greater than 1**: This is correct because the eccentricity of an ellipse is greater than 1.\n- **C. the sun might be at point C**: This is incorrect because the diagram does not provide enough information to determine the position of the sun relative to points A, B, C, and D.\n- **D. the sun might be at point D**: This is incorrect because the diagram does not provide enough information to determine the position of the sun relative to points A, B, C, and D.\n- **E. the sun might be at point B**: This is incorrect because the diagram does not provide enough information to determine the position of the sun relative to points A, B, C, and D.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\n**B. the eccentricity of the orbit is greater than 1**."
