                "text": "To determine the approximate work function of the material, we need to understand the relationship between the work function (W) and the maximum kinetic energy (E_{km}) of the photoelectrons in the photoelectric effect. The relationship is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ E_{km} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} - W \\]\n\nwhere \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the photons.\n\nFrom the graph, we can see that the maximum kinetic energy \\(E_{km}\\) is directly proportional to the frequency \\(f\\) of the photons. This suggests that the work function \\(W\\) is constant for a given material and does not change with the frequency of the photons.\n\nGiven the data points on the graph, we can calculate the work function \\(W\\) for each frequency \\(f\\). The work function is the intercept of the line with the \\(E_{km}\\) axis when \\(f = 0\\).\n\nFor \\(f = 2 \\times 10^{14}\\) Hz:\n\\[ E_{km} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} - W \\]\n\\[ E_{km} = \\frac{(6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s})}{\\lambda} - W \\]\n\nFor \\(f = 4 \\times 10^{14}\\) Hz:\n\\[ E_{km} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} - W \\]\n\\[ E_{km} = \\frac{(6.63 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s})}{\\lambda} - W \\]\n\nSince the work function \\(W\\) is constant, we can set the two expressions for \\(E_{km}\\) equal to each other and solve for \\(W\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} - W = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} - W \\]\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ W = 0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the work function of the material is 0 eV, which means the material has no work function. This is not possible in reality, as the work function is a fundamental property of the material that determines the threshold energy for photoelectric effect.\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1.5 eV"
