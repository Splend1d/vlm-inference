The triangle is symmetric about the time axis, meaning it passes through the origin (0,0) at the midpoint of the base.\n\nThe time at which the velocity graph intersects the x-axis is at the midpoint of the base, which is at \\( t = \\frac{1}{2} \\) seconds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1 s"
