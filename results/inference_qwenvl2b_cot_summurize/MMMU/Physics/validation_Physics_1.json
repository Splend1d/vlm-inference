The current in this wire is coming out of the plane of the page, so the magnetic field it creates is to the right.\n\n2. **Wire 2**: The wire on the right is labeled P. Since P is to the right of the wire labeled 4A, the magnetic field created by P will be to the left of the wire labeled 4A.\n\n3. **Wire 3**: The wire on the right is labeled 4A. The current in this wire is coming out of the plane of the page, so the magnetic field it creates is to the right.\n\n4. **Wire 4**: The wire on the left is labeled 4A. The current in this wire is coming out of the plane of the page, so the magnetic field it creates is to the right.\n\nSince the magnetic fields from wires 1 and 4 are to the right, and the magnetic field from wire 2 is to the left, the net magnetic field from these wires is to the left.\n\nTherefore, the direction of the total magnetic force on the wire labeled P that is caused by the other wires is:\n\nA.
