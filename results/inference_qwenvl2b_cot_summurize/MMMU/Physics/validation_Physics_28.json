The picture is suspended by two strings, each with a tension force \\( T \\).\n\n1. The tension force \\( T \\) acts vertically downward on the picture.\n2. The tension force \\( T \\) acts horizontally on each string, which creates an upward force on the picture.\n\nThe upward force on the picture due to the tension force \\( T \\) on each string is \\( T \\cos \\theta \\), where \\( \\theta \\) is the angle between the string and the horizontal.\n\nSince there are two strings, the total upward force on the picture is \\( 2 \\times T \\cos \\theta \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 2T sin \u03b8"
