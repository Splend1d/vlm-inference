This means that the circuit is complete, and the voltage is applied to the bulbs.\n\n2. **Bulb #1**: The circuit is complete, and the voltage is applied to bulb #1. Since bulb #1 is connected to the circuit, it will also be illuminated.\n\n3. **Bulb #2**: The circuit is complete, and the voltage is applied to bulb #2. Since bulb #2 is connected to the circuit, it will also be illuminated.\n\n4. **Bulb #3**: The circuit is complete, and the voltage is applied to bulb #3. Since bulb #3 is connected to the circuit, it will also be illuminated.\n\nTherefore, when the switch is closed, all bulbs (bulb #1, bulb #2, and bulb #3) will become brighter.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nD. Bulbs #1, #2, and #3"
