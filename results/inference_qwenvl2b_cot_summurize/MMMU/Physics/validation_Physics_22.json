                "text": "To determine the effect of the transition from the \\(n=3\\) to the \\(n=1\\) level on the emitted light, we need to consider the energy levels and the corresponding wavelengths of light.\n\nIn the Bohr model, the energy levels of an atom are represented by \\(n\\), where \\(n=1\\) corresponds to the ground state, \\(n=2\\) to the first excited state, and so on. The energy of an electron in an atom is inversely proportional to its distance from the nucleus. As the electron moves from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, it gains energy and moves closer to the nucleus.\n\nThe wavelength of light emitted when an electron transitions from one energy level to another is inversely proportional to the energy difference between the two levels. This relationship is given by the Planck-Einstein equation:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m_e E}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the emitted light,\n- \\(h\\) is Planck's constant (approximately \\(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\) J\u00b7s),\n- \\(m_e\\) is the mass of an electron,\n- \\(E\\) is the energy difference between the two energy levels.\n\nWhen the electron transitions from the \\(n=3\\) to the \\(n=1\\) level, the energy difference is:\n\n\\[ E_{3 \\rightarrow 1} = E_{3} - E_{1} \\]\n\nThe wavelength of the emitted light would be:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_{3 \\rightarrow 1} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m_e (E_{3} - E_{1})}} \\]\n\nIf the transition were from the \\(n=3\\) to the \\(n=2\\) level instead, the energy difference would be:\n\n\\[ E_{3 \\rightarrow 2} = E_{3} - E_{2} \\]\n\nThe wavelength of the emitted light would be:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_{3 \\rightarrow 2} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m_e (E_{3} - E_{2})}} \\]\n\nComparing the two expressions, we see that the energy difference is the same for both transitions, but the wavelength of the emitted light is inversely proportional to the energy difference. Therefore, if the transition were from the \\(n=3\\) to the \\(n=2\\) level instead, the emitted light would have a longer wavelength.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nB. longer wavelength"
