The voltmeter in this circuit is connected between points Q and U, which are connected to the same point P.\n\nThe voltmeter has a very high resistance, which means it will not affect the current flow through the circuit. Therefore, the voltmeter will not change the voltage across any point in the circuit.\n\nSince the voltmeter is connected between points Q and U, and the circuit has the same resistance for all resistors, the voltage across the voltmeter will be the same as the voltage across the resistor R at point Q. Since the voltmeter has a very high resistance, it will not affect the voltage across the resistor R at point Q.\n\nTherefore, the voltmeter will read zero between points Q and U.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA.
