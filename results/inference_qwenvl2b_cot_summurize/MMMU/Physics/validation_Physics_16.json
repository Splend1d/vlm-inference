The average velocity is the displacement per unit time, which is the change in position divided by the change in time.\n\nDuring the time interval from point P to point Q, the particle moves from point P to point Q. Since the particle moves counterclockwise, the displacement from P to Q is in the direction of the positive x-axis (assuming the circular path is in the first quadrant).\n\nThe average velocity is the change in position divided by the change in time. Since the particle moves from P to Q, the change in position is from P to Q, and the change in time is the time interval during which the particle moves from P to Q.\n\nThe change in position is from P to Q, which is a straight line from P to Q. The change in time is the time interval during which the particle moves from P to Q, which is the distance from P to Q divided by the speed of the particle.\n\nThe speed of the particle is constant and positive, as the particle moves in a counterclockwise direction. Therefore, the average velocity is also positive.\n\nTherefore, the direction of the average velocity during this time interval is rightward.\n\nThe correct answer is A."
