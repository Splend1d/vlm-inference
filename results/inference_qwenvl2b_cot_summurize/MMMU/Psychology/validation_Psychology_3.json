The shaded area represents the intermediate recall level, which is higher than the primacy and lower than the recency recall levels. This suggests that elaborative rehearsal can improve recall, as evidenced by the higher intermediate recall compared to the primacy and recency recall levels. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
