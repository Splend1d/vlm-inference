At the end of the dual-task presentation, the students were tested both for their memory of the passage and their memory of the photographs. To establish a baseline for this dual-task condition, the same students also were tested for their memory when each of the component tasks was presented alone. The following graph shows the results. <image 1> In a study of the effectiveness of divided attention, it is most important that the experimental design include\n\nA. a counterbalance of the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions\nB. a consistent order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions\nC. an equal number of men and women as participants\nD. verification that participants believe themselves capable of dividing attention\n"

The graph shows the results of two conditions: dual-task condition and baseline condition. The dual-task condition involves listening to a passage and inspecting photographs simultaneously, while the baseline condition involves listening to the passage alone.\n\nThe key to the effectiveness of the dual-task condition is to ensure that the participants are equally able to divide their attention between the two tasks. This is crucial because if the participants are not equally able to focus on both tasks, the results may not be reliable.\n\nTherefore, the most important aspect of the experimental design in this study is to ensure that the participants are equally able to divide their attention between the two tasks. This can be achieved by using a counterbalance of the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. a counterbalance of the order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions"
