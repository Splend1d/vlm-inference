The blue region is located on the right side of the brain, which is the side opposite to the left side.\n2. The blue region appears to be a part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord.\n3. The spinal cord is a part of the brain that connects the brain to the spinal column.\n\nGiven these observations, the blue region is most likely the spinal cord.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. spinal cord"
