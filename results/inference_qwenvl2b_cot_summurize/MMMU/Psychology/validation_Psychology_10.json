It is responsible for hearing and speech.\n2. **Occipital lobe**: This is the largest lobe on the back of the brain and is responsible for vision.\n3. **Parietal lobe**: This is the largest lobe on the side of the brain opposite the temporal lobe. It is responsible for motor functions and spatial awareness.\n4. **Frontal lobe**: This is the largest lobe on the front of the brain and is responsible for cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and problem-solving.\n\nTherefore, the correct labels are:\n- 1: Temporal lobe\n- 2: Occipital lobe\n- 3: Parietal lobe\n- 4: Frontal lobe\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. Temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, frontal lobe"
