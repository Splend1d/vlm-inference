                "text": "One of the central questions in language is of linguistic determinism. Language is an important component of one's ability to comprehend numbers and quantities. Counting takes many forms depending on culture. Researchers have not yet found a language that does not represent numbers. Some cultures use body parts to count or forms of recursion using a small numerical base. Gumulgal South Sea Islanders count utilizing a recursive binary system. The Piraha are a monolingual population (< 200 population) that have rejected assimilation with the Brazilian culture. A predominantly hunter-gatherer population, the Piraha live in villages of between 10 and 20 people on the banks of the Maici River in Brazil's Lowland Amazonia region. The Piraha counting system consists of what is termed the \"one-two-many\" system. Quantities beyond two are described as many, in this system of counting. A researcher visited the Piraha tribe to test the impact of counting systems on the ability to estimate quantity. Members of the Piraha tribe were given a visual counting task to test the impact of numerical systems on visual estimation. Each tribe member was allowed to inspect a group of nuts for a few seconds. The nuts were placed in an opaque can, so the quantity could not be viewed. For each trial, a nut was removed from the can, and the tribe member was asked to tell the researcher if the can still contained nuts. Tribe members who were able to estimate the quantity of nuts in the can would be able to tell when there were none left. Figure 1 shows the proportion of correct responses averaged for each target number of nuts over all trials. Figure 1: Results for the Piraha tribe members' trials averaged for each target number (n = 63). For each trial, each tribe member estimated the number of nuts left in the can (target). The proportion of correct responses is shown (the first and last nut were excluded). <image 1> Which theory would support the viewpoint: the Piraha have not needed a counting system that uses numbers beyond two and when a better numbering system is necessary, their language will create it?\n\nA.

                "text": "To determine which theory would support the viewpoint that the Piraha have not needed a counting system that uses numbers beyond two and when a better numbering system is necessary, we need to analyze the given information and compare it with the theories listed.\n\n1. **Piaget's Theory**: This theory focuses on the development of cognitive abilities, particularly the acquisition of symbolic representations. It suggests that children develop a system of counting based on their experiences and the development of symbolic representations. However, it does not specifically address the necessity of a counting system beyond two.\n\n2. **Vygotsky's Theory**: This theory emphasizes the role of social interaction and the development of cognitive abilities through the use of tools and symbols. It suggests that the Piraha's counting system is a result of their social interactions and the development of a system that allows them to count beyond two.\n\n3. **Whorfian Theory**: This theory suggests that language shapes thought and that the meaning of language is determined by the culture in which it is used. It does not address the necessity of a counting system beyond two.\n\n4. **Weak Linguistic Determinism**: This theory suggests that language is not the sole determinant of thought and that other factors, such as culture and social interaction, play a role in cognitive development. It does not specifically address the necessity of a counting system beyond two.\n\nGiven the information in the figure, it shows that the Piraha were able to estimate the number of nuts in the can when the target was two or less, but they were unable to estimate the number of nuts when the target was greater than two. This suggests that the Piraha have not needed a counting system that uses numbers beyond two and that when a better numbering system is necessary, their language will create it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
