All groups were given the same set of questions in an exam, but the exam began with a brief introductory statement that differed for each group, establishing differing expectations for student performance, as follows: Group A: The introduction stated that most students are expected to pass the exam. Group B: The introduction stated that most students are expected to fail the exam. Group C: The introduction included statistics that showed female students performing worse than male students on similar exams. Group D: The introduction contained no information on expected performance. The results of the experiment are given in the bar graph below: <image 1> What phenomenon best explains the performance differences between Groups A and B?\n\nA. Social facilitation\nB.

                "text": "To determine the phenomenon that best explains the performance differences between Groups A and B, let's analyze the given information and the bar graph:\n\n1. **Group A and Group B**: Both groups were given the same set of questions, but the introduction to the exam differed. Group A stated that most students are expected to pass the exam, while Group B stated that most students are expected to fail the exam. This difference in expectations likely influenced the students' performance.\n\n2. **Social facilitation**: This phenomenon occurs when individuals perform better in front of others, which can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, the introduction in Group B stated that most students are expected to fail, which might have discouraged students from attempting the exam.\n\n3. **Group polarization**: This occurs when a group's initial attitudes or beliefs become more extreme as the group becomes more cohesive. In this case, the introduction in Group B might have polarized the group's expectations, leading to a more negative attitude towards the exam.\n\n4. **Self-serving bias**: This occurs when individuals tend to attribute their success to themselves rather than to external factors. However, the introduction in Group B did not explicitly mention self-serving bias.\n\n5. **Unstable attribution**: This occurs when individuals are unable to attribute their success to external factors, such as luck or external factors. The introduction in Group B did not explicitly mention unstable attribution.\n\n6. **The Pygmalion effect**: This occurs when positive expectations for a person lead to positive behavior. The introduction in Group B might have had a positive effect on Group B's performance, but it does not explain the performance differences between Groups A and B.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most plausible explanation for the performance differences between Groups A and B is:\n\n**B. Group polarization**"
