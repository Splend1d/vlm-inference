                "text": "Researchers studying vision use various methods to investigate human perceptual experience. Research on spectral sensitivity of the rod receptors (scattered throughout the retina) and cone visual receptors (mainly concentrated in the fovea area of the retina) highlights the relationship between perception and physiology. Signal detection methods have been used to measure the differences in how perception adjusts to low-light environments. Participant responses can be plotted based on sensitivity versus length of time in the dark. The dark adaptation curve can be plotted showing how rods and cones differ in their sensitivity to light over time. The following graph shows a plot of three calculated dark adaptation curves. <image 1> Which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. Rods are responsible for color vision, which explains color sensitivity under low-light conditions.\nB. Cones are responsible for color vision, which explains greater color sensitivity under low-light conditions.\nC. Rods do not respond preferentially to wavelengths in the light spectrum, which explains why colors are not detectable in low-light conditions.\nD. Both rods and cones respond to specific colors in the light spectrum; loss of color vision in dark conditions is the result of fewer photons of light.\n"

                "text": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze the dark adaptation curves and the information provided:\n\n1. **Rod Adaptation Curve**: The rod adaptation curve shows a rapid decrease in sensitivity over time, which is typical for rods. Rods are responsible for low-light vision, and their sensitivity decreases as the light level decreases.\n\n2. **Cone Adaptation Curve**: The cone adaptation curve shows a slower decrease in sensitivity over time, which is typical for cones. Cones are responsible for high-light vision, and their sensitivity increases as the light level increases.\n\n3. **Color Sensitivity**: The graph does not provide information about color sensitivity. It only shows the decrease in sensitivity over time.\n\n4. **Photons and Color Vision**: The graph does not discuss the relationship between color vision and the number of photons. It only shows the decrease in sensitivity over time.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct statement is:\n\nA. Rods are responsible for color vision, which explains color sensitivity under low-light conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. Rods are responsible for color vision, which explains color sensitivity under low-light conditions."
