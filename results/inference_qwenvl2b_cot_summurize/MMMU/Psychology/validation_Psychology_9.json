The study involves a psychological study on authority and behavior.\n2. Participants must be available for five 30-minute sessions during the fall semester.\n3. The study involves some use of confederates (participants who are not directly involved in the study).\n4. The responses to different kinds of authority will be assessed.\n\nGiven these points, the independent variable is likely the perception of authority, as it is the variable manipulated by the confederates to assess the participants' responses.\n\nTherefore, the most likely independent variable is:\n\nA.
