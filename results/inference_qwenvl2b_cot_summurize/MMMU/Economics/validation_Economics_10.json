                "text": "To determine what would drive the market toward the equilibrium when the actual price in the market is above the equilibrium price, we need to consider the concept of excess supply and excess demand.\n\n1. **Excess Supply**: This occurs when the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded at the current price. In other words, the market is oversupplied.\n2. **Excess Demand**: This occurs when the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied at the current price. In other words, the market is undersupplied.\n\nGiven the data:\n- At $4, the quantity demanded is 135 pizzas and the quantity supplied is 26 pizzas.\n- At $5, the quantity demanded is 104 pizzas and the quantity supplied is 53 pizzas.\n- At $6, the quantity demanded is 81 pizzas and the quantity supplied is 81 pizzas.\n- At $7, the quantity demanded is 68 pizzas and the quantity supplied is 98 pizzas.\n- At $8, the quantity demanded is 53 pizzas and the quantity supplied is 110 pizzas.\n- At $9, the quantity demanded is 39 pizzas and the quantity supplied is 121 pizzas.\n\nFrom the data, we can see that at $8, the quantity demanded is 53 pizzas and the quantity supplied is 110 pizzas. This means there is an excess supply of 57 pizzas (110 - 53).\n\nTherefore, if the actual price in this market were above the equilibrium price of $8, the market would drive toward the equilibrium by reducing the quantity supplied to match the quantity demanded, which would result in excess supply.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. excess supply"
