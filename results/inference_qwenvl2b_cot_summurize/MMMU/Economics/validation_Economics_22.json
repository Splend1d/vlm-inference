The supply curve is vertical at a high interest rate, indicating that the supply of money is fixed at a high level.\n\n2. **Aggregate Supply and Demand:**\n   - The graph on the right shows the aggregate supply and demand curves. The aggregate supply curve is horizontal, indicating that the aggregate demand (AD) curve is horizontal as well.\n\n3. **Central Bank Actions:**\n   - The central bank increases the money supply, which shifts the aggregate supply curve to the right.\n\n4. **Effect on GDP and Price Level:**\n   - The increase in money supply shifts the aggregate supply curve to the right, indicating that the economy has more money available to spend. This leads to an increase in aggregate demand (AD), which in turn shifts the aggregate supply curve to the right.\n   - The shift in the aggregate supply curve to the right causes the price level (PL) to rise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. GDP and the price level rise."
