It shows the relationship between real GDP and the price level at that specific point.\n\n2. **LRAS2 (Red Color):** This curve represents the LRAS for Brazil at a different point in time, which could be due to a change in the economy's conditions or policies.\n\nGiven the options:\n- **A. Increase in capital.**\n- **B. Decrease in labor.**\n- **C. Decrease in human capital.**\n\nNone of these options directly relate to the LRAS curve. However, if we consider the context of the graph, it is likely that the LRAS curve shifts due to changes in the economy's conditions or policies, such as changes in capital, labor, or human capital.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. Increase in capital.**"
