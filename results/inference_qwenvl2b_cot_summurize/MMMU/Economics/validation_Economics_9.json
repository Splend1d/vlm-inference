                "text": "To determine the long-run effect of increasing the money supply growth rate on the economy, we need to analyze the relationship between inflation and unemployment rates depicted in the graph.\n\n1. **Identify the initial point (B)**: The economy starts at point B on the graph, which represents an unemployment rate of 6% and an inflation rate of 3%.\n\n2. **Analyze the relationship between unemployment and inflation**:\n   - **Curve 1**: This curve shows the relationship between unemployment and inflation. It is downward-sloping, indicating that as unemployment increases, inflation tends to decrease.\n   - **Curve 2**: This curve is not shown in the graph, but it is assumed to be similar to Curve 1, as it is a straight line with a negative slope.\n\n3. **Effect of increasing the money supply growth rate**:\n   - If the money supply growth rate increases, it typically leads to a decrease in inflation. This is because an increase in the money supply leads to a decrease in interest rates, which in turn reduces the demand for money and leads to a decrease in inflation.\n\n4. **Long-run effect**:\n   - As the money supply growth rate increases, the economy moves along Curve 1, which is a downward-sloping line. This movement is expected to decrease the unemployment rate and increase the inflation rate.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. moves to C."
