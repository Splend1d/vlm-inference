The unemployment rate is typically associated with the intersection of the AD and AS curves, where the AD curve is below the AS curve.\n\nFrom the table, we can see the following:\n- At a price level of 50, the AD curve intersects the AS curve at a point where the AD curve is above the AS curve.\n- At a price level of 60, the AD curve intersects the AS curve at a point where the AD curve is below the AS curve.\n- At a price level of 70, the AD curve intersects the AS curve at a point where the AD curve is above the AS curve.\n- At a price level of 80, the AD curve intersects the AS curve at a point where the AD curve is below the AS curve.\n- At a price level of 90, the AD curve intersects the AS curve at a point where the AD curve is above the AS curve.\n\nSince the AD curve is always above the AS curve, the intersection of the AD and AS curves will occur at a price level where the AD curve is above the AS curve. This means that the unemployment rate will be relatively low, as the AD curve is above the AS curve.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. the unemployment rate for this economy is low"
