In the given graph, the SRAS curve shifts to the right, indicating an increase in the supply of labor. This shift is represented by the movement from point A to point B on the SRAS curve.\n\nTo return to the long-run equilibrium, wages must adjust to reflect the new level of output and employment. If wages are flexible, they will adjust to the new equilibrium level of output and employment. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wages will rise."
