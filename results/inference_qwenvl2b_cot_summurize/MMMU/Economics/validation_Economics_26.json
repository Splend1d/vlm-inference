The consumption function is typically represented as \\(C = a + bY\\), where \\(a\\) is the initial consumption level and \\(b\\) is the marginal propensity to consume. An increase in \\(a\\) (the initial consumption level) would shift the consumption function upwards, as it would shift the entire line upwards without changing the slope.\n\n2. **(2) b rises**: This would imply an increase in the marginal propensity to save (\\(s\\)). The consumption function is also represented as \\(C = a + bY\\), where \\(s\\) is the marginal propensity to save. An increase in \\(b\\) (the marginal propensity to save) would shift the consumption function downwards, as it would shift the entire line downwards without changing the slope.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\nA. C shifts upwards."
