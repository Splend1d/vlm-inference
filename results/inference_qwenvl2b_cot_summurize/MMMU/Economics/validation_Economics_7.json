It is upward-sloping and shows the relationship between the price level and the level of output that can be produced.\n\n2. **Identify the SRAS curve**: The SRAS curve represents the relationship between the price level and real GDP. It is downward-sloping and shows the relationship between the price level and the level of output that can be produced.\n\n3. **Find the intersection point**: The short-run equilibrium occurs where the AD curve intersects the SRAS curve. This point represents the level of real GDP where the economy is producing at its maximum output given the current price level.\n\nFrom the graph:\n- The AD curve is labeled as \"AD.\"\n- The SRAS curve is labeled as \"SRAS.\"\n\nThe intersection point of these two curves is at approximately 450 billion.\n\nTherefore, the size of real GDP in the short-run equilibrium is:\nB. 450"
