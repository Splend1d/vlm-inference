                "text": "To determine which economic condition was most important in creating the global trade network illustrated by the two diagrams, let's analyze the data provided:\n\n1. **Western Europe's Import and Re-export of Silver:**\n   - Western Europe imported 158 tons of silver.\n   - Western Europe re-exported 110 tons of silver.\n   - This suggests a significant flow of silver between Western Europe and other regions.\n\n2. **The Pacific Route:**\n   - The Pacific route had a flow of 34 tons of silver.\n\n3. **The Americas:**\n   - The Americas exported 302 tons of silver.\n   - The Americas used 66 tons of silver.\n\n4. **Southern African Route:**\n   - The Southern African route had a flow of 16 tons of silver.\n\n5. **East and South Asia:**\n   - East and South Asia imported 109 tons of silver.\n   - East and South Asia used 193 tons of silver.\n\n6. **Japan:**\n   - Japan imported 59 tons of silver.\n   - Japan used 59 tons of silver.\n\nFrom the data, it is clear that the flow of silver between Western Europe and other regions, particularly the Americas and the Pacific route, was crucial in creating the global trade network. This flow of silver facilitated the exchange of goods and resources across different regions, leading to the development of a global trade network.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Western European demand for industrial raw materials and American and South Asian supply of cash crops"
