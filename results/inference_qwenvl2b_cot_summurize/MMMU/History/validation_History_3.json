The Atlantic slave trade\n\nThe image depicts a Maroon resistance fighter, which was a group of enslaved African Americans who fought against British colonial authorities in Jamaica during the 18th century. The Atlantic slave trade was a significant historical development that led to the formation of the society associated with the image, as it resulted in the displacement of many people from their homes and forced them into slavery. This forced migration contributed to the formation of the Maroons, who fought against British colonial authorities to regain their freedom."
