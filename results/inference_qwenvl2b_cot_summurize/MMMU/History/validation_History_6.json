The poster is from the Soviet Union during World War II, and it reads: \"Young Men and Women, Defend the Freedom, Motherland, and Honor that was Won by your Fathers.\"\n\n2. The poster depicts soldiers holding weapons and the year 1917, which is significant as it marks the beginning of the Russian Revolution.\n\n3. The text emphasizes the importance of defending the freedom, motherland, and honor that were won by the fathers, suggesting a strong sense of national pride and a commitment to defending one's country.\n\n4. The poster does not explicitly state that communism is the ideology being promoted, but it does convey a sense of nationalistic fervor and a sense of duty to defend one's country.\n\nGiven this analysis, the poster most closely aligns with the Soviet Union's view of nationalist fervor, which is often associated with a strong sense of national pride and a commitment to defending one's country.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The Soviet Union saw communism as being fully realized by 1917, while Marx predicted the proletariat revolt to occur much later"
