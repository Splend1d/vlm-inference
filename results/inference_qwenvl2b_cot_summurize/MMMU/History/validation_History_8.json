The map shows a voyage from Lisbon to Calicut, which is a significant distance, indicating long-distance travel.\n2. The voyage includes stops in Africa, India, and Asia, suggesting a focus on trade and exploration.\n3. The map does not explicitly state that Portugal was primarily interested in exploration of the African and Asian coasts, nor does it mention Vasco de Gama's voyage.\n4. The map does not provide information about economic opportunities or mass migrations.\n\nGiven these observations, the most directly supported conclusion is:\n\nC. European nations began to look outward for economic opportunities\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the map's depiction of a voyage that includes trade and exploration, which were key economic activities during the early sixteenth century."
