As a result, the darker shaded areas record the most heavily traveled routes. Which of the following conclusions could be drawn from the evidence provided by this map?\n\nA. British ships did not sail along the west coast of Africa during this period.\nB. British ships did not sail the Atlantic Ocean during this period.\nC. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.\nD. British ships did not sail in the Indian Ocean during this period.\n"

The map shows a series of lines connecting various locations, indicating the routes taken by British ships.\n2. The darker shaded areas represent the most heavily traveled routes.\n3. The map does not show any specific routes that are entirely black, indicating that not all routes were heavily traveled.\n\nGiven this information, the conclusion that can be drawn is:\n\nD. British ships did not sail in the Indian Ocean during this period.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that the map shows a lighter shaded area in the Indian Ocean, indicating that it was not heavily traveled by British ships during this period."
