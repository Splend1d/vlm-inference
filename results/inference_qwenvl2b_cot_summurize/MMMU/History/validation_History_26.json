This suggests that Catholic regions were more likely to expel Jewish people than Protestant regions.\n\n2. **Muslim Regions**: The map shows that Muslim regions, such as the Ottoman Empire, did not have significant Jewish expulsions. This indicates that Muslim regions were less likely to expel Jewish people than Catholic regions.\n\n3. **Economic Prosperity**: The map does not provide direct information about economic prosperity. However, it is common for Jewish migration and expulsion to occur in regions with economic challenges, such as wars, political instability, or economic downturns.\n\nGiven these observations, the correct statement is:\n\nC. Catholic regions were more likely to expel Jewish people than other regions."
