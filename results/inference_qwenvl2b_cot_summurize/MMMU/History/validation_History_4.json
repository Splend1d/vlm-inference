The spread of the bubonic plague by the Mongol invasions**: This is a historical event that occurred in the 1300s and 1400s, which would not have affected the data from 400 to 500 C.E.\n- **B. Migrations to Christian population centers in the Mediterranean**: This could explain the decrease in depopulation, but it does not explain the overall trend across all regions.\n- **C. Forced migration of populations by the Roman government**: This is a historical event that occurred in the 200s and 300s, which would not have affected the data from 400 to 500 C.E.\n- **D. Invasions by Germanic and Central Asian peoples**: This could explain the decrease in depopulation, but it does not explain the overall trend across all regions.\n\nThe overall trend shows a decrease in depopulation across all regions, which is best explained by the spread of Christianity and the resulting decrease in the need for rural populations to support the Roman Empire.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation is:\n\n**D. Invasions by Germanic and Central Asian peoples**."
