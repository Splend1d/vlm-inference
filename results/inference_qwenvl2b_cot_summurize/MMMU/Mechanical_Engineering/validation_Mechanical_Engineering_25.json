The forces acting on the bar are the reaction at A, the weight of the bar, and the force due to the temperature change.\n\n1. **Reaction at A:**\n   - The reaction at A is the force that balances the weight of the bar.\n   - The weight of the bar is given by the formula: \\( W = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{length} \\times \\text{density} \\times \\text{temperature change} \\).\n   - The density of aluminum is approximately 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, and the temperature change is \\( \\Delta T = 20^\\circ F = 111^\\circ C \\).\n   - The length of the bar is \\( L = 3 \\) ft = \\( 3 \\times 12 \\) in = \\( 36 \\) in.\n   - The weight of the bar is: \\( W = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 36 \\times 2.7 \\times 111 \\approx 1537.8 \\) lbs.\n\n2. **Reactions at C:**\n   - The reactions at C are the forces that balance the force due to the temperature change.\n   - The force due to the temperature change is given by: \\( \\delta_{B} = \\alpha \\times b_1 \\times L \\times \\Delta T \\).\n   - The coefficient of thermal expansion (\\(\\alpha\\)) is \\( 13 \\times 10^{-6}/^\\circ F \\).\n   - The length of the bar is \\( L = 3 \\) ft = \\( 3 \\times 12 \\) in = \\( 36 \\) in.\n   - The force due to the temperature change is: \\( \\delta_{B} = 13 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 2 \\times 36 \\times 111 \\approx 1537.8 \\) lbs.\n\n3. **Equilibrium of Forces:**\n   - The sum of the reactions at A and C must equal the weight of the bar.\n   - Therefore, \\( R_{A} + R_{C} = W \\).\n   - Substituting the values, we get: \\( R_{A} + R_{C} = 1537.8 \\).\n\n4. **Calculating Reactions:**\n   - Since the reactions at A and C are equal, we can find one of them and then calculate the other.\n   - Let's assume \\( R_{A} = R_{C} \\).\n   - Then, \\( R_{A} + R_{C} = 1537.8 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( R_{A} \\), we get: \\( R_{A} = \\frac{1537.8}{2} \\approx 768.9 \\) kips.\n\nTherefore, the reactions at A and C are approximately \\( R_{A} = 768.9 \\) kips and \\( R_{C} = 768.9 \\) kips, respectively.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. \\( R_{A} = R_{C} = -2.429kips \\)**."
