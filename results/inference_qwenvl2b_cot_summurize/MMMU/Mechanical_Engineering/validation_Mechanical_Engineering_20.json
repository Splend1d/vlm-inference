                "text": "To determine the test load at which the frame will experience initial yielding according to the maximum-normal-stress theory, we need to calculate the yield stress of the steel material. The yield stress is the stress at which the material begins to deform plastically.\n\nThe yield stress can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{y} = \\frac{F}{A} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\sigma_{y} \\) is the yield stress,\n- \\( F \\) is the applied force,\n- \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the material.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the cross-sectional area of the steel material. Since the frame is made of steel, we can assume that the cross-sectional area is the same for both points a and b. Therefore, we can use the same cross-sectional area for both points.\n\nThe cross-sectional area \\( A \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{F}{\\sigma_{y}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( F \\) is the applied force,\n- \\( \\sigma_{y} \\) is the yield stress.\n\nFor point a, the force \\( F \\) is 4 kN, and the yield stress \\( \\sigma_{y} \\) is 100 MPa. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{4 \\text{ kN}}{100 \\text{ MPa}} = 0.04 \\text{ m}^2 \\]\n\nFor point b, the force \\( F \\) is 4 kN, and the yield stress \\( \\sigma_{y} \\) is -100 MPa. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{4 \\text{ kN}}{-100 \\text{ MPa}} = -0.04 \\text{ m}^2 \\]\n\nSince the cross-sectional area is the same for both points, we can use the same cross-sectional area for both points. Therefore, we can use the cross-sectional area for point a, which is 0.04 m^2.\n\nNow, we can calculate the yield stress \\( \\sigma_{y} \\) using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{y} = \\frac{F}{A} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma_{y} = \\frac{4 \\text{ kN}}{0.04 \\text{ m}^2} = 100 \\text{ MPa} \\]\n\nTherefore, the yield stress of the steel material is 100 MPa.\n\nNow, we can use the maximum-normal-stress theory to determine the test load at which the frame will experience initial yielding. According to the maximum-normal-stress theory, the test load \\( F_{y} \\) at which the frame will experience initial yielding is given by:\n\n\\[ F_{y} = \\frac{A \\sigma_{y}}{S_{y}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( F_{y} \\) is the test load,\n- \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the material,\n- \\( \\sigma_{y} \\) is the yield stress of the material,\n- \\( S_{y} \\) is the yield strength of the material.\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n\\[ F_{y} = \\frac{0.04 \\text{ m}^2 \\times 100 \\text{ MPa}}{400 \\text{ MPa}} = 0.01 \\text{ m}^2 \\]\n\n\\[ F_{y} = 10 \\text{ kN} \\]\n\nTherefore, the test load at which the frame will experience initial yielding according to the maximum-normal-stress theory is 10 kN. The correct answer is:\n\nA. 5kN"
