                "text": "To determine the minimum required value of initial preload to prevent loss of compression of the plates, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. The bolt is made from cold-drawn steel, which means it has a high stiffness (kb).\n2. The clamped steel plates have a stiffness (kc) six times the bolt stiffness (kb).\n3. The load fluctuates continuously between 0 and 8000 lb.\n4. The bolt and the clamped plates are of the same length.\n\nGiven that the bolt stiffness (kb) is much greater than the stiffness of the plates (kc), the bolt will be the dominant factor in preventing loss of compression of the plates. Therefore, the minimum required value of initial preload to prevent loss of compression of the plates is the bolt's stiffness (kb).\n\nFor part (b), we need to find the minimum force in the plates for the fluctuating load when the preload is 8500 lb.\n\n1. The bolt stiffness (kb) is 8000 lb.\n2. The stiffness of the plates (kc) is 6 times the bolt stiffness (kb), so kc = 6kb = 6 * 8000 lb = 48000 lb.\n3. The load fluctuates between 0 and 8000 lb.\n4. The bolt and the clamped plates are of the same length.\n\nThe minimum force in the plates can be found using the formula for the force in a cantilever beam, which is:\n\nF = (1/2) * k * x^2\n\nwhere F is the force, k is the stiffness, and x is the distance from the load point to the support.\n\nIn this case, the load fluctuates between 0 and 8000 lb, so the minimum force in the plates occurs when the load is at its minimum value of 0 lb. In this case, the minimum force in the plates is:\n\nF_min = (1/2) * k * x^2 = (1/2) * 48000 lb * x^2 = 24000 lb * x^2\n\nSince the load fluctuates between 0 and 8000 lb, the minimum force in the plates occurs when the load is at its minimum value of 0 lb. In this case, the minimum force in the plates is:\n\nF_min = 24000 lb * x^2 = 24000 lb * (8000 lb / 8000 lb)^2 = 24000 lb * (1) = 24000 lb\n\nTherefore, the minimum force in the plates for the fluctuating load when the preload is 8500 lb is 24000 lb.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nD. 6857lb,1728lb"
