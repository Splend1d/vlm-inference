The Routh-Hurwitz criterion is used to determine the stability of a system based on its transfer function.\n\nThe transfer function of the system is given by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{K(s+1)}{s(s+2)(s+3)} \\]\n\nThe Routh-Hurwitz criterion involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Find the poles of the transfer function**:\n   - The poles are found by setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for \\( s \\):\n     \\[ s(s+2)(s+3) = 0 \\]\n     \\[ s = 0, -2, -3 \\]\n\n2. **Construct the Routh array**:\n   - The Routh array is constructed by placing the poles in the first row and the roots of the denominator in the second row. The roots of the denominator are \\( s = 0, -2, -3 \\).\n\n3. **Apply the Routh-Hurwitz criterion**:\n   - The Routh-Hurwitz criterion states that if the determinant of the Routh array is positive, the system is stable. The determinant of the Routh array is:\n     \\[ \\text{Det} = (0)(-2)(-3) - (-2)(-3)(-3) + (0)(-3)(-2) \\]\n     \\[ \\text{Det} = -18 + 18 = 0 \\]\n\nSince the determinant is zero, the system is not stable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.
