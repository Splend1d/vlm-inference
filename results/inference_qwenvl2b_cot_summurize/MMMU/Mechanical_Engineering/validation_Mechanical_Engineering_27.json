                "text": "To find the force \\( F \\) just sufficient to keep the gate from opening, we need to consider the forces acting on the gate. The gate is a quarter circle with a radius of 8 feet, and it is hinged at B. The gate is uniform and weighs 3000 lbf.\n\nThe force \\( F \\) is the sum of the weight of the gate and the force of the water acting on the gate. The force of the water acting on the gate is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the gate. The weight of the water displaced by the gate is given by the volume of water displaced times the density of water.\n\nThe volume of water displaced by the gate is equal to the area of the gate times the distance from the hinge to the center of the gate. The distance from the hinge to the center of the gate is the radius of the gate, which is 8 feet.\n\nThe area of the gate is given by the formula for the area of a circle, \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. In this case, \\( r = 8 \\) feet, so the area of the gate is \\( A = \\pi (8)^2 = 64\\pi \\) square feet.\n\nThe force of the water acting on the gate is therefore \\( F = \\text{weight of the gate} + \\text{volume of water displaced} \\times \\text{density of water} \\).\n\nThe weight of the gate is 3000 lbf, and the density of water is approximately 62.46 lb/ft\u00b3. The volume of water displaced by the gate is the area of the gate times the distance from the hinge to the center of the gate, which is \\( 64\\pi \\) square feet times 8 feet, or \\( 512\\pi \\) cubic feet.\n\nThe force of the water acting on the gate is therefore \\( F = 3000 + 512\\pi \\) lbf.\n\nTo find the force \\( F \\), we need to convert the force from pounds to newtons, since the answer choices are in newtons. There are 4.448 newtons in a pound, so \\( F = 3000 + 512\\pi \\) lbf = \\( 3000 + 512\\pi \\) newtons.\n\nNow, we can calculate the force \\( F \\) using the formula for the force of a force in newtons:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{F}{4.448} \\]\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{3000 + 512\\pi}{4.448} \\]\n\n\\[ F \\approx 7479.9 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the force \\( F \\) is approximately 7480 newtons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \\( F = 7480 \\) lbf."
