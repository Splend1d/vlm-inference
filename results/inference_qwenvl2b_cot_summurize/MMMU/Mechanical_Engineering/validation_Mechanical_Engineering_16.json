The block will experience a force due to gravity and the spring force.\n\n1. **Gravity Force:**\n   - The block's weight is \\( W = 5.0 \\, \\text{N} \\).\n   - The gravitational force acting on the block is \\( F_g = W = 5.0 \\, \\text{N} \\).\n\n2. **Spring Force:**\n   - The spring force is given by \\( F_s = k \\cdot \\Delta x \\), where \\( k \\) is the spring constant and \\( \\Delta x \\) is the displacement of the spring.\n   - The spring constant \\( k \\) is \\( 90 \\, \\text{N/m} \\).\n   - The maximum shortening of the spring occurs when the spring force is equal to the gravitational force. Therefore, \\( \\Delta x = \\frac{F_g}{k} = \\frac{5.0 \\, \\text{N}}{90 \\, \\text{N/m}} = \\frac{1}{18} \\, \\text{m} \\).\n\n3. **Maximum Shortening of the Spring:**\n   - The maximum shortening of the spring is \\( \\Delta x = \\frac{1}{18} \\, \\text{m} \\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum shortening of the spring due to the impact is \\( \\boxed{314.64 \\, \\text{mm}} \\).\n\nThe correct answer is C."
