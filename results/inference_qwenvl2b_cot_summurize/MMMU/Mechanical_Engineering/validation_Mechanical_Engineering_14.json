                "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the kinetic energy of the system and the additional brake torque required to bring the system to rest.\n\n(a) Kinetic energy of the system:\n\nThe mass of the system is 1000 kg, and the drum has a radius of gyration of 250 mm. The drum's weight is 2.5 kN. The radius of the drum is 550 mm. The radius of gyration of the drum is:\n\n```\nk = (r^2) / (2R) = (550 mm)^2 / (2 * 250 mm) = 112.5 mm\n```\n\nThe kinetic energy of the system is:\n\n```\nKE = (1/2) * m * v^2 = (1/2) * 1000 kg * (4 m/s)^2 = 20000 J\n```\n\n(b) Additional brake torque required to bring the system to rest:\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the system is 20000 J. The initial torque is:\n\n```\nT_i = m * g * r = 1000 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 * 550 mm = 5.25 * 10^5 N\u22c5m\n```\n\nThe initial angular momentum is:\n\n```\nL_i = I * \u03c9_i = (1/2) * m * r^2 * \u03c9_i = (1/2) * 1000 kg * (550 mm)^2 * (4 m/s) = 1.125 * 10^6 N\u22c5m\n```\n\nThe final angular momentum is:\n\n```\nL_f = I * \u03c9_f = (1/2) * m * r^2 * \u03c9_f = (1/2) * 1000 kg * (550 mm)^2 * (0 m/s) = 0 N\u22c5m\n```\n\nThe additional brake torque required to bring the system to rest is:\n\n```\nT_f = L_f - L_i = 0 N\u22c5m - 1.125 * 10^6 N\u22c5m = -1.125 * 10^6 N\u22c5m\n```\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the torque is in the opposite direction of the initial torque. Therefore, the additional brake torque required is:\n\n```\nT_f = -1.125 * 10^6 N\u22c5m = -1.125 * 10^6 N\u22c5m\n```\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the torque is in the opposite direction of the initial torque. Therefore, the additional brake torque required is:\n\n```\nT_f = -1.125 * 10^6 N\u22c5m = -1.125 * 10^6 N\u22c5m\n```\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 5723J,2218N\u22c5m"
