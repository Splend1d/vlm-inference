                "text": "To find the side length $s$ of the equilateral convex hexagon $APQCRS$ within the square $ABCD$, we can use the properties of equilateral triangles and the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nGiven that $APQCRS$ is an equilateral convex hexagon, each of its sides is equal to the side length of the square, which is $1$. Therefore, $AP = AQ = CR = CS = 1$.\n\nThe hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles, each with side length $s$. The side length of each of these triangles is $s$, and since the hexagon is equilateral, each of these triangles is also an equilateral triangle with side length $s$.\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by the formula $\\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$. Therefore, the area of one of these triangles is $\\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nSince the hexagon is composed of six of these triangles, the total area of the hexagon is $6 \\times \\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{3s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nHowever, we know that the area of the hexagon is also equal to the area of the square $ABCD$, which is $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nSetting the two expressions for the area equal to each other gives us:\n\n$$\\frac{3s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = 1$$\n\nSolving for $s$:\n\n$$s^2\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\n$$s^2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\div \\sqrt{3}$$\n\n$$s^2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\n$$s^2 = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$$\n\n$$s = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\n$$s = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\n$$s = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\n$$s = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}$$\n\n$$s = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\n$$s = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\n$$s = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nTherefore, the side length $s$ of the equilateral convex hexagon $APQCRS$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe correct answer is E. $\\frac{2}{3}$."
