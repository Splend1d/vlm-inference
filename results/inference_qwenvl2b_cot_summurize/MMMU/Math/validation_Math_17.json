The total speed of the man is the sum of his rowing speed and his walking speed, which is 1.5 + 3 = 4.5 miles per hour.\n\nThe distance to reach point Q is the diameter of the lake, which is 2 miles. The time required to reach point Q can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{2}{4.5} \\approx 0.444 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nTo minimize the time, the man should row at the speed of 1.5 miles per hour. The time required to row 1.5 miles at 1.5 miles per hour is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{1.5}{1.5} = 1 \\text{ hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, the angle $\\theta$ to the diameter PQ that the man should row in order to minimize the time required to reach Q is $\\theta = \\pi / 2$.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. $\\theta = \\pi / 2$"
