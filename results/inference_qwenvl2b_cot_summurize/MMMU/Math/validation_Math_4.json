This suggests that the function is periodic with a period of 4.\n\nThe general form of a cosine function is $y = A\\cos(Bx - C)$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $B$ affects the period, and $C$ affects the phase shift.\n\nGiven the graph, the amplitude $A$ is 1, the period is 4, and the phase shift is 0 (since the graph starts at the origin).\n\nThe general form of the cosine function with these parameters is $y = \\cos(Bx)$, where $B$ affects the period. Since the period is 4, we have $B = 2$.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the graph is $y = \\cos(2x)$.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nA. $y=\\cos 2\\pix$"
