The edges are as follows:\n   - (1, 4)\n   - (1, 5)\n   - (1, 6)\n   - (1, 7)\n   - (1, 8)\n   - (2, 3)\n   - (2, 4)\n   - (2, 5)\n   - (2, 6)\n   - (2, 7)\n   - (2, 8)\n   - (3, 4)\n   - (3, 5)\n   - (3, 6)\n   - (3, 7)\n   - (3, 8)\n   - (4, 5)\n   - (4, 6)\n   - (4, 7)\n   - (4, 8)\n   - (5, 6)\n   - (5, 7)\n   - (5, 8)\n   - (6, 7)\n   - (6, 8)\n   - (7, 8)\n\n2. **Find the minimum spanning tree**: The minimum spanning tree is the smallest set of edges that connects all vertices in the graph while minimizing the total weight of the edges.
