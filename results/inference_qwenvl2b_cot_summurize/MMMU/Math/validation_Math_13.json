                "text": "To find the area of quadrilateral \\(A B C D\\), we can use the fact that the area of a regular polygon can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Perimeter} \\times \\text{Side Length} \\]\n\nFor a regular hexagon, the perimeter is \\(6 \\times 4 = 24\\) units, and for a regular octagon, the perimeter is \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\) units. Therefore, the area of the octagon is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of octagon} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 32 \\times 4 = 64 \\]\n\nSince the octagon is divided into two congruent triangles by the line segment \\(A B\\), the area of the hexagon is also divided into two triangles. The area of each triangle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of each triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 64 = 32 \\]\n\nThe area of the quadrilateral \\(A B C D\\) is the area of the hexagon minus the area of the two triangles:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of quadrilateral} = 64 - 2 \\times 32 = 64 - 64 = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation is incorrect because we should not subtract the area of the two triangles from the area of the hexagon. The correct approach is to recognize that the quadrilateral is composed of two triangles, each of which is a right triangle with legs of length 4 units (half the side length of the octagon). The area of a right triangle is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\n\nFor a right triangle with base and height of 4 units, the area is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 4 = 8 \\]\n\nSince there are two such triangles, the total area of the quadrilateral \\(A B C D\\) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area of quadrilateral} = 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\(16+16 \\sqrt{2}-16 \\sqrt{3}\\)"
