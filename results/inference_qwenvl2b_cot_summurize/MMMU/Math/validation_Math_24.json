The right circular cylinder that can be inscribed in the cone will have its axis parallel to the base of the cone and its height equal to the height of the cone.\n\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a cylinder is given by the formula \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the base of the cylinder and \\( h \\) is the height of the cylinder.\n\nFor the cylinder to be inscribed in the cone, the cylinder's axis must be parallel to the base of the cone. This means that the cylinder's radius \\( r \\) must be equal to the radius \\( R \\) of the cone's base.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the right circular cylinder of maximum volume that can be inscribed in the cone are:\n\n\\( r = R \\)\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\( r = R/3 \\)"
