                "text": "To solve this problem using the simplex method, we need to find the smallest number of attendants who can supervise all rooms. Let's denote the rooms as follows:\n\n- Room 1\n- Room 2\n- Room 3\n- Room 4\n- Room 5\n- Room 6\n\nWe need to find the smallest number of attendants (let's call them A) such that each room is supervised by at least one attendant.\n\nThe problem can be formulated as an integer programming problem:\n\nObjective: Minimize the number of attendants A\n\nConstraints:\n1. Each room must be supervised by at least one attendant.\n2. The number of attendants cannot exceed the number of rooms.\n\nLet's denote the number of attendants as A. We can represent the problem as follows:\n\n- A = number of attendants\n- Each room must be supervised by at least one attendant, so A >= 1 for each room.\n- The number of attendants cannot exceed the number of rooms, so A <= number of rooms.\n\nNow, let's use the simplex method to solve this problem. The simplex method involves the following steps:\n\n1. Write the objective function: Minimize A\n2. Write the constraints: A >= 1 for each room, A <= number of rooms\n3. Set up the initial simplex tableau\n4. Perform the simplex iterations until the solution is reached\n\nLet's start by setting up the initial simplex tableau:\n\n| A | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n\nNow, we need to perform the simplex iterations. Let's start with the first iteration:\n\n1. Choose the variable with the smallest pivot element (in this case, A).\n2. Perform the pivot operation to eliminate the variable from the pivot row.\n3. Update the pivot row and the pivot column.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the solution is reached.\n\nAfter performing the first iteration, we get the following tableau:\n\n| A | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n\nAfter the first iteration, we have the following tableau:\n\n| A | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n\nAfter the first iteration, we have the following tableau:\n\n| A | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | "
