                "text": "To find the length of $\\overline{P S}$, we can use the properties of tangents and secants to a circle. Specifically, we can use the fact that the product of the lengths of the two segments of a tangent from a point to a circle is equal to the square of the radius of the circle.\n\nIn the given diagram, $\\overline{P S}$ is a tangent to circle $O$ at point $S$. This means that $\\overline{PS}$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{OP}$, and $\\overline{PS}$ is equal in length to the radius of the circle, which we'll call $r$.\n\nSimilarly, $\\overline{P Q}$ is a secant, which means that it intersects the circle at two points, $P$ and $Q$. The length of $\\overline{P Q}$ is given as $3$.\n\nWe are also given that $\\overline{P R}$ is a secant, which intersects the circle at two points, $P$ and $R$. The length of $\\overline{P R}$ is given as $x + 18$.\n\nWe can use the fact that the product of the lengths of the two segments of a tangent from a point to a circle is equal to the square of the radius of the circle to find the length of $\\overline{P S}$.\n\nLet's denote the length of $\\overline{P S}$ as $x$. Then, we have:\n\n\\[PS \\cdot PS = r^2\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n\\[x \\cdot x = r^2\\]\n\n\\[x^2 = r^2\\]\n\n\\[x = r\\]\n\nSince we know that $\\overline{P S}$ is a tangent to circle $O$ at point $S$, and $\\overline{PS}$ is equal in length to the radius of the circle, we can conclude that $\\overline{P S}$ is equal to the radius of the circle, which is $r$.\n\nTherefore, the length of $\\overline{P S}$ is $r$, which is equal to $3$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3"
