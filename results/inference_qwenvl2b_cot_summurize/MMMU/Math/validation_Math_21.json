                "text": "To determine the convergence of the Newton-Raphson iteration for the given function $f_1(x) = x e^{-x}$, we need to find the derivative of the function and set it equal to zero to find the critical points.\n\nThe derivative of $f_1(x)$ is:\n\\[f_1'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x e^{-x}) = e^{-x} - xe^{-x} = e^{-x}(1 - x)\\]\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\\[e^{-x}(1 - x) = 0\\]\n\nThis gives us two critical points:\n\\[1 - x = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 1\\]\n\\[e^{-x} = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0\\]\n\nSince we are looking for convergence, we need to consider the behavior of the function near these critical points. The function $f_1(x)$ is defined for all $x \\neq 0$ and $x \\neq 1$.\n\nFor $x = 0$, the function is undefined because the exponential term $e^{-x}$ is not defined for $x = 0$. Therefore, $x = 0$ is not a valid solution.\n\nFor $x = 1$, the function is:\n\\[f_1(1) = 1 \\cdot e^{-1} = e^{-1}\\]\n\nSince $e^{-1} < 1$, the function is decreasing for $x > 1$ and increasing for $x < 1$. Therefore, the function will converge to $x = 1$ as $x$ approaches 1 from both sides.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\nB. When $x_0$ is equal to 1"
