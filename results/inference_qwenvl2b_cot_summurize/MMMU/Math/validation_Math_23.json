                "text": "To find the height of the tower, we can use the kinematic equations of motion. The rocket's motion can be described by the following equations:\n\nx = x0 + v0t + 1/2at^2\ny = y0 + v0t - 1/2gt^2\n\nwhere:\nx0 is the initial position (0 ft),\nv0 is the initial velocity (0 ft/s),\na is the acceleration (0 ft/s^2),\nt is the time (5 s),\ny0 is the initial position (0 ft),\ny is the final position (3h ft),\ng is the acceleration due to gravity (32 ft/s^2).\n\nWe can use the first equation to find the horizontal distance (x) the rocket travels:\n\nx = 0 + v0t + 1/2at^2\nx = 0 + 0 + 1/2(0)(5)^2\nx = 0 ft\n\nThis means the rocket travels a horizontal distance of 0 ft. We can use the second equation to find the vertical distance (y) the rocket travels:\n\ny = y0 + v0t - 1/2gt^2\ny = 0 + 0 - 1/2(32)(5)^2\ny = 110 ft\n\nTherefore, the height of the tower is 110 ft. The correct answer is C."
