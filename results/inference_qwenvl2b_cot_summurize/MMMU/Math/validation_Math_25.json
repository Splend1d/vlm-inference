                "text": "To find the angle $\\theta$ between the path of the object and the ground at the instance the object hits the ground, we need to determine the vertical component of the object's velocity at that time. The vertical component of the velocity is given by the derivative of the vertical position with respect to time, which is $y'(t) = -9.8t$.\n\nAt the instant the object hits the ground, the vertical position $y(t)$ is 0 meters. Therefore, we can find the time $t$ when $y(t) = 0$ by setting $y'(t) = 0$ and solving for $t$:\n\n$$0 = -9.8t$$\n$$t = 0$$\n\nThis means the object hits the ground at $t = 0$. Now, we can find the vertical component of the velocity at this time:\n\n$$y'(0) = -9.8(0) = 0$$\n\nSince the vertical component of the velocity is 0, the object is momentarily at rest vertically. However, the horizontal component of the velocity is given as $x'(t) = 1.4$ meters per second. This means the object is moving horizontally at a constant speed of 1.4 meters per second.\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ between the path of the object and the ground can be found using the tangent function, which relates the sine and cosine of an angle:\n\n$$\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{adjacent}} = \\frac{y'(0)}{x'(0)} = \\frac{0}{1.4} = 0$$\n\nSince $\\tan(\\theta) = 0$, $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians. However, the question asks for the angle in the range $0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which corresponds to $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. $\\theta = 1.570$"
