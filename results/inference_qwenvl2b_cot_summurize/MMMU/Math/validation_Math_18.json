This is the correct sequence for constructing a breadth-first spanning tree.\n\nIn diagram (b), the process starts with a complete graph and then selects a node, removes it, and connects the remaining nodes in a new graph. However, the process does not follow the correct sequence of selecting a node, removing it, and then connecting the remaining nodes. Therefore, diagram (b) does not illustrate the construction of a breadth-first spanning tree.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. a"
