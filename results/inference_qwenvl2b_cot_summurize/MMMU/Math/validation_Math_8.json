The basic data are given below for the two types of available boats. The company will make an estimated seasonal profit of $4,000 for each boat of Type 1 and $7,000 for each boat of Type 2.

The feasible region is the area where the objective function is non-negative.\n2. The constraints are:\n   - 25,000 + 80,000 \u2264 200,000\n   - 1,2000 + 2,0000 \u2264 200,000\n   - 1,2000 + 2,0000 \u2264 200,000\n   - 2,0000 + 6,0000 \u2264 200,000\n\n3. The feasible region is the area where the objective function is non-negative, which is the triangle with vertices (1, 0), (0, 0), and (0, 6).\n\n4. The objective function is:\n   - f(x) = 4,000x1 + 7,000x2\n\n5. To maximize profit, we need to find the point in the feasible region that maximizes the objective function.\n\n6. The feasible region is a triangle with vertices (1, 0), (0, 0), and (0, 6).\n\n7. The optimal solution will be at one of the vertices of the triangle.\n\n8. The vertices of the triangle are:\n   - (1, 0)\n   - (0, 0)\n   - (0, 6)\n\n9. The optimal solution will be at the vertex (0, 6).\n\n10. The value of the objective function at the vertex (0, 6) is:\n   - f(0, 6) = 4,000(0) + 7,000(6) = 4,000 + 4,2000 = 8,2000\n\nTherefore, the company should use 0 boats of Type 2 and 6 boats of Type 1 to maximize profit.\n\nThe correct answer is D."
