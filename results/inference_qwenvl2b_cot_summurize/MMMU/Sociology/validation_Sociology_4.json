This led to a shift in values and beliefs, which in turn influenced the development of organic solidarity.\n\n5. **Division of Labor**: The division of labor, which is a key concept in the Enlightenment, involves the division of tasks and responsibilities among individuals based on their skills and abilities. This can lead to a more complex form of solidarity where individuals are connected through shared values and practices.\n\nGiven these points, the most plausible cause of the shift from mechanical to organic solidarity is:\n\n**C. Division of labor**\n\nDivision of labor is a key concept in the Enlightenment that led to the development of organic solidarity, where individuals and groups are connected through shared values and practices."
