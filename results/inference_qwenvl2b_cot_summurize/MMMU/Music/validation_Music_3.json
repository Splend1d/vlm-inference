In the image, the interval between the first and second notes is 2 semitones, and the interval between the second and third notes is 2 semitones. Therefore, the interval between the first and third notes is also 2 semitones.\n\n2. **Major Interval**: This is an interval where the distance between the two notes is an integer multiple of the interval between the first and second notes. In the image, the interval between the first and second notes is 2 semitones, and the interval between the second and third notes is 2 semitones. Therefore, the interval between the first and third notes is also 2 semitones.\n\n3. **Diminished Interval**: This is an interval where the distance between the two notes is an integer multiple of the interval between the first and second notes, but the interval between the second and third notes is not an integer multiple of the interval between the first and second notes. In the image, the interval between the first and second notes is 2 semitones, and the interval between the second and third notes is 3 semitones. Therefore, the interval between the first and third notes is not an integer multiple of the interval between the first and second notes.\n\n4. **Augmented Interval**: This is an interval where the distance between the two notes is an integer multiple of the interval between the first and second notes, but the interval between the second and third notes is not an integer multiple of the interval between the first and second notes. In the image, the interval between the first and second notes is 2 semitones, and the interval between the second and third notes is 3 semitones. Therefore, the interval between the first and third notes is not an integer multiple of the interval between the first and second notes.\n\nBased on the analysis, the intervals in the image are:\n\n- Perfect: between the first and third notes\n- Major: between the first and second notes\n- Diminished: between the first and third notes\n- Augmented: between the first and second notes\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\nA. perfect\nB. major\nC. diminished\nD. augmented"
