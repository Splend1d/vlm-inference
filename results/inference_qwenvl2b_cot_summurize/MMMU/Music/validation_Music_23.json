Compound time is a time signature that consists of two numbers, such as 4/4, which means 4 beats per measure with a quarter note (4 beats) and a half note (2 beats).\n\nSimple time, on the other hand, is a time signature that consists of one number, such as 2/4, which means 2 beats per measure with a quarter note (2 beats) and a half note (1 beat).\n\nThe given bar in compound time has a time signature of 4/4, which means 4 beats per measure with a quarter note and a half note.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. This option has a time signature of 4/4, which matches the given bar.\nB. This option has a time signature of 3/4, which is not the same as the given bar.\nC. This option has a time signature of 3/4, which is not the same as the given bar.\nD. This option has a time signature of 2/4, which is not the same as the given bar.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. box 1."
