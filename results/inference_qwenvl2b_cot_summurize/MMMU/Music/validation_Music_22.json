The key signature is in the key of G major.\n2. The notes involved are G, A, and Bb.\n\nThe seventh chord in a key signature is typically a minor seventh chord in third inversion. This is because the seventh chord in a key signature is the one that completes the circle of fifths, which is a minor seventh chord in third inversion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Major/minor seventh in third inversion"
