It contains a major third (the third note of the chord).\n2. It contains a minor seventh (the seventh note of the chord).\n3. It has both a close and an open voicing.\n\nLet's analyze each chord:\n\nA. BD - This chord contains a minor third (B) and a minor seventh (D). It has a close voicing (B) and an open voicing (D).\n\nB. CD - This chord contains a major third (C) and a minor seventh (D). It has a close voicing (C) and an open voicing (D).\n\nC. BC - This chord contains a major third (B) and a minor seventh (C). It has a close voicing (B) and an open voicing (C).\n\nD. AB - This chord contains a major third (A) and a minor seventh (B). It has a close voicing (A) and an open voicing (B).\n\nBased on the characteristics of the chords, the chord that fits the description of a major-minor seventh chord with both close and open voicings is:\n\nB.
