Preface - This term refers to a preface or introduction to a book, which is not the focus of the illustration.\nD. Omniscient - This term refers to an illustration that is omniscient, meaning it has knowledge of all events in the story.\n\nGiven the context of the image, the illustration facing the title page is most likely intended to establish the tone and entice the reader to begin the story. Therefore, the correct term is:\n\nB. Frontispiece"
