Science Fiction - This term refers to a genre of science fiction, which is not related to biology or the study of living organisms.\n\nB. Biological Science - This term refers to the scientific study of living organisms and the laws and phenomena that relate to them. It encompasses various fields such as genetics, ecology, and evolutionary biology.\n\nC. Physical Science Or Natural Science - This term refers to the scientific study of the physical world and natural phenomena, which includes biology but also encompasses other natural sciences like physics, chemistry, and geology.\n\nD. Applied Science - This term refers to the application of scientific knowledge to solve practical problems or to improve human life, which is not related to the study of living organisms.\n\nGiven the context of the image, which shows a detailed diagram of a flower, the term that best describes the field that deals with living organisms and the laws and phenomena that relate to them is:\n\nB.
