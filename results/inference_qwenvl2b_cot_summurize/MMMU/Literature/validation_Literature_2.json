Biography Series - This term refers to a series of books about a single person.\nD. Secondary Themes - This term refers to themes that are less explicit or less widely discussed in the book.\n\nGiven the context of the figure, the theme of lesser importance to the book but of significance to the lives of specific readers is likely the \"explicit themes\" because these are the themes that are explicitly stated and are likely to be of interest to readers who are familiar with the book's content.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Explicit Themes"
