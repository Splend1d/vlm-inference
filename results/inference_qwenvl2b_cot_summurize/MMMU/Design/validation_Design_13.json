The mosaic is detailed and organized.\n   - **B. model the anatomy of the figures naturalistically**: This option implies that the mosaic is realistic in its depiction of human anatomy, which is not the case. The mosaic is a representation of a historical event, not a detailed anatomical study.\n   - **C. modify and transport the composition easily**: This option suggests that the mosaic can be easily modified and transported, which is not the case. The mosaic is a single, large piece that cannot be easily modified or transported.\n   - **D. reduce the figures into abstract forms**: This option suggests that the mosaic reduces the figures to abstract forms, which is not the case. The mosaic is a detailed representation of a historical event, not an abstract form.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. modify and transport the composition easily**"
