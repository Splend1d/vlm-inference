However, when two objects are tied together by a string, they move as a single unit under the combined force of gravity. When one object is released, the other is pulled along at the same rate as the first object because the string acts like a rope that stretches out in front of both objects.\n\nTherefore, the acceleration of the system is not zero, but rather it is equal to the acceleration of either object if it were freefalling without any external forces acting upon it. The net force on each object will be the tension in the string plus the gravitational force downward, so:\n\n\\[\nF_{net} = T + mg\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is the tension in the string, \\(m\\) is the mass of each object, and \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nSince \\(m_1 = m_2\\) for both objects, we can simplify this equation to:\n\n\\[\nF_{net} = T = mg\n\\]\n\nThus, the acceleration of the system is \\(g\\), which means the answer is C. g."
