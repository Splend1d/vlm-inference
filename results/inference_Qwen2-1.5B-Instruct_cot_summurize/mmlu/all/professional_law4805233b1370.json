One week before the start of the fall term, at a party to celebrate the law student's acceptance to the school, his father announced to the law student, in the presence of the partygoers, \"Son, it's your obligation to uphold the family tradition for excellence at the school. In this regard, if you promise to study a minimum of five hours a day, I shall pay you $1,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your first year; $2,500 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your second year; and $5,000 for each \u0080\u0098A' you achieve during your third year. \"The most accurate statement concerning the father's promise to reward the law student for achieving \"A's\" would be that\n\nA. the promise constituted an unenforceable, conditional gift.\nB. the promise would not be legally binding, since it was non-detrimental.\nC. the promise would be enforceable if a bargained-for exchange was so intended.\nD. the promise constituted a voidable proposal.\n"

The promise would be enforceable if a bargained-for exchange was so intended.\n\nA conditional gift refers to a promise to give something as long as certain conditions are met. In this case, the father promises to pay money based on the student's performance in exams. This is not a conditional gift because the payment is dependent on the student's performance, which is uncertain until after the exam results are known.\n\nA non-detrimental promise means that the promise does not harm the promisor or the promisee in any way. In this case, the promise does not harm either the father or the student.\n\nA voidable proposal means that the offer can be rescinded by one of the parties if they do not agree with its terms. However, this is not applicable here because the offer is unconditional and cannot be rescinded.\n\nTherefore, the only option that matches the description given is C. The promise would be enforceable if a bargained-for exchange was so intended."
