Voters increasingly vote based on a party's platform.\n\nSince the 1970s, there has been a trend towards voters becoming more politically polarized and identifying with specific political parties rather than voting based solely on an individual candidate or a particular issue. This shift can be seen in how voters select presidential candidates and support them over time. In some cases, voters may prioritize party loyalty over personal preferences for a particular candidate, while others may prioritize issues and policies over partisanship. Overall, the role of the media in shaping public opinion and influencing voter behavior continues to evolve, but it does not necessarily lead to increased focus on individual candidates or less emphasis on party platforms."
