The two statements in the disjunctive syllogism must be logically connected to each other using a conjunction (and) or a disjunction (or). \n\nFor example:\nIf it rains, then I will stay inside. \nEither it rained yesterday, or it didn't rain yesterday.\nThis is a valid disjunctive syllogism because the first statement can be either true or false, while the second statement can also be either true or false. However, this does not necessarily mean that the premises are true or false, only that they can be either true or false.\n\nOn the other hand, a categorical syllogism presents a universal truth (e.g., \"All men are mortal\") or a universal denial (e.g., \"No man is immortal\"), while a conditional syllogism presents an implication of some kind (e.g., \"If it rains, then I will stay inside\"). A hypothetical syllogism presents a situation where something has happened (the hypothesis), and asks whether it follows from certain premises (the antecedents).\n\nTherefore, a valid disjunctive syllogism meets the criteria of having two mutually exclusive statements that cannot both be true, which makes it a valid logical form."
