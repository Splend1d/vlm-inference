A solid waste processor sued the city in federal court claiming that the ordinance discriminated based on local economic protectionism. The city responded that the ordinance did not discriminate because it does not differentiate solid waste due to geographic origin. All solid waste, regardless of origin, must be processed and made environmentally safe at the transfer station before it leaves town. Will the federal court rule that the flow control ordinance is a discriminatory law against the free flow of interstate commerce?\n\nA. Yes, because it allows only the favored operator to process waste that is within the limits of the town, to the exclusion of outside processors who might be interested in getting some of the business.\nB. Yes, because it requires processors to come into the state to be allowed to do processing instead of being able receive the waste at their out-of-state location.\nC. No, because the city did not discriminate against anyone's waste, if it was in the city limits the state from where the material originated did not come into consideration.\nD. No, because the city simply wanted to assure that the solid waste leaving the area was not environmentally harmful.\n"

No, because the city did not discriminate against anyone's waste, if it was in the city limits, the state from where the material originated did not come into consideration.\n\nThe city's flow control ordinance required all solid waste within its limits to be transported to a local facility for processing before it could be sent to other states for further disposal. This means that the city had a preference for certain operators over others based on their ability to comply with the ordinance. However, the ordinance did not discriminate against any particular type of waste or any individual's waste based solely on where it came from. The city simply wanted to ensure that the solid waste leaving the area was not environmentally harmful.\n\nTherefore, the flow control ordinance does not discriminate based on local economic protectionism and should not be considered a discriminatory law against the free flow of interstate commerce."
