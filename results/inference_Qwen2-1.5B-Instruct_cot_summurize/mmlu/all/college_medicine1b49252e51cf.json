A five month old male infant raised in a safe, stable environment is most likely to attach to a male psychologist, previously unknown to the child, in the course of a psychological study. This is because infants tend to develop a stronger bond with their biological parents and may not form attachments to strangers as easily. Additionally, the fact that the infant is only five months old suggests that they have not yet developed a strong sense of self or identity, making them more receptive to the idea of forming an attachment to a stranger."
