Reduced cost of plant seeds\n\nThe development and use of genetically modified (GM) plants have the potential to reduce costs associated with obtaining seed for planting, as GM plants can be produced more efficiently and at lower production costs compared to traditional methods. This can lead to lower prices for farmers, which could potentially benefit consumers by making food more affordable.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the impact of GM crops on agricultural practices and economics is complex and multifaceted, and there may be both benefits and drawbacks depending on various factors such as crop yield, environmental impacts, and public policy considerations. It's also worth noting that patents on genetically modified crops are not universally applicable or consistent across different countries, so there can be differences in how these technologies are regulated and used globally."
