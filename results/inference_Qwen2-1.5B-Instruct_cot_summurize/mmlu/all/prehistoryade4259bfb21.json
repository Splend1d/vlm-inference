This discovery is significant because it provides direct evidence of the earliest known ancestors of modern humans. \n\nThe second option (B) is not accurate as there is no evidence that anatomically modern humans evolved simultaneously in Africa and Europe. The Omo I cranium was found in Ethiopia, which is part of the Afro-Asian region where many early human remains have been found.\n\nOption C is also incorrect as the Omo I cranium does not demonstrate the development of a larger brain prior to the first evidence for tool making. While the cranium shows signs of increased brain size, this does not necessarily mean that anatomically modern humans had a larger brain before they began using tools.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A."
