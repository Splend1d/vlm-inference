It is likely that between 79% and 85% of the population use grocery coupons.\n\nThis statement indicates that there is a margin of error of 3% around the percentage of people who use grocery coupons, which means that it is likely that some households may have used coupons, while others may have stopped using them. The range given (79% to 85%) suggests that this is a reasonable estimate based on the results of the survey."
