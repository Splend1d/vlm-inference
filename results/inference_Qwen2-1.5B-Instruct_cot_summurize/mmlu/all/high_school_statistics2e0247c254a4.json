                    "text": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Original prices:\n   - A small kiosk at the Atlanta airport carries souvenirs in the price range of $3.99 to $29.99, with a mean price of $14.75.\n\n2. Increased rent charge: \n   - The airport authorities decide to increase the rent charged for a kiosk by 5 percent. \n\n3. Price increase: \n   - The kiosk owner decides to increase the prices of all items by 50 cents.\n\nNow let's analyze the changes:\n\n- **Mean price**: If we assume that the original mean price is $14.75 (which seems reasonable considering the given price range), increasing it by 50 cents would make it $14.75 + $0.50 = $15.25. So, the mean price increases by 50 cents.\n\n- **Range of prices**: Since there's no information about how much the prices vary from one item to another, we cannot directly calculate the change in the range without additional data. However, if we consider that the original prices ranged from $3.99 to $29.99, an increase of 50 cents on each item would make the new range from $3.99 to $29.99 + $0.50 to $30.499. This means the range does not change by 50 cents.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis above, the correct answer is **D**. The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same."
