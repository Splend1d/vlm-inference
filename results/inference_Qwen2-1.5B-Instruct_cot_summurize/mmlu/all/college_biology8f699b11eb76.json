The larger size of DNA allows it to settle at the bottom of the centrifuge tube, while the smaller size of RNA allows it to move towards the top of the tube.\n\nNuclei and secretory vesicles cannot be separated by low-speed centrifugation because their sizes and densities are similar. Secretory vesicles are typically much smaller than nuclei, so they would not settle to the bottom of the centrifuge tube.\n\nGolgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum can also be separated by low-speed centrifugation, but they do not form a single cell membrane compartment like lysosomes or endosomes. Lysosomes and endosomes are composed of a double membrane structure that is not easily separated by centrifugation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. DNA and mRNA."
