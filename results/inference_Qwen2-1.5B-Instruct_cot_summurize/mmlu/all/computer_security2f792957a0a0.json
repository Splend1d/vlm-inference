Active scanning involves attempting to interact with the target system by sending requests and receiving responses. Interactive scanning combines passive and active techniques to try to compromise the target system while also observing its behavior.\nServer-side scanning refers to the process of identifying vulnerabilities on a server by examining its configuration files, logs, and other system resources. Client-side scanning involves examining the user interface of a web application to identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\nNetwork scanning involves examining the network infrastructure to identify potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited for attack purposes. This can include checking for open ports, weak passwords, and misconfigured firewalls."
