If this were not the case, then option A (90% of students who study receive high grades) would not be valid because it assumes a perfect relationship between study hours and GPA.\n\nSimilarly, option B (90% of students who receive high grades study a lot) does not make sense if the relationship between study hours and GPA is not linear.\n\nOption D (81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day) is also incorrect because it suggests that only 81% of the variance in GPAs is due to study hours, while the other 19% is due to other factors such as genetics, environment, and luck.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate conclusion is that 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day."
