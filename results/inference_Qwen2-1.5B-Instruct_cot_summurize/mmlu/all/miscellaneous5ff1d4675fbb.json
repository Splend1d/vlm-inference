The answer should be related to how much the multiplier changes as MPC increases.\n\nC. A given change in government spending would have had a more powerful effect in year 1 than in year 2: This depends on the specific details of the economy and its behavior during those years. It's difficult to determine without additional information.\n\nD. The marginal propensity to save increased from year 1 to year 2: This statement is false because the MPC only affects consumption, not savings. The MPC does not affect savings or the multiplier.\n\nThe correct answer is B."
