This was a direct result of the First Opium War, which was fought between Britain and China from 1839 to 1842. As a result of the war, China was forced to open its ports to foreign trade, which allowed British merchants to establish trading posts and sell opium to Chinese consumers. This led to significant economic and social changes in China, including increased foreign influence and the decline of traditional Chinese customs and institutions."
