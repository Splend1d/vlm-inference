It also helps with the uptake of amino acids (protein building blocks) from the bloodstream into muscle cells for repair and growth. \n\nAdrenaline and cortisol, which are stress hormones, do not directly promote the uptake of glucose or amino acids in muscle cells. Glycogen, found in the liver and muscles, serves as an energy reserve but does not have this specific function.\n\nCortisol, on the other hand, plays a role in regulating metabolism and can increase blood sugar levels, but it doesn't specifically promote the uptake of glucose or amino acids in muscle cells."
