However, if someone plagiarizes their essay or writes it under false pretenses, such as by using a pre-written template, then they have committed plagiarism, which is considered a form of theft and dishonesty.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct - both the scenario where the essay is well written and received a high score, and the scenario where the person makes sushi from a prize goldfish, involve clear violations of moral standards regarding honesty and respect for intellectual property rights."
