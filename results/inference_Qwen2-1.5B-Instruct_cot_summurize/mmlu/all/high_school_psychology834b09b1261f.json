Which of the following research method choices (and the rationale for the choice) is the most appropriate?\n\nA. Experiment-the most convenient and ethical way to study online bullying is to randomly assign half of the participants to a group who experiences the independent variable (online bullying).\nB. Correlation-it would be unethical to purposefully expose middle school students to bullying behaviors, so Professor Ek should examine variables that correlate with existing instances of online bullying.\nC. Naturalistic observation-observing instances of online bullying by monitoring middle school students' social networking behavior would provide the most accurate data and not raise important privacy concerns, because social networks are considered \"public\" space.\nD. Survey-self-reports about online bullying behaviors and responses to these behaviors would likely provide the most accurate descriptions of bullying and its impact.\n"

Self-reports allow researchers to gather information directly from the individuals being studied, providing more accurate and detailed descriptions of their experiences with online bullying.\n2. Surveys can be easily administered and analyzed statistically, making it easier to compare results across different groups or populations.\n3. Self-reports also minimize potential biases introduced by third-party observations or interpretations of the situation, as they come from the individual themselves.\n4. In this case, there are no obvious ethical issues with exposing middle school students to the independent variable (online bullying), given the context of a research study on this topic. Therefore, conducting a survey self-report is an ethical choice."
