It's important for professionals like psychologists who are experiencing personal issues to seek help from others when needed. This can be done by consulting with a mental health professional or by taking time off work to focus on their well-being. Plunging deeper into work may not be productive during this challenging time. Explaining the situation to clients could also be beneficial but it might not solve the immediate problem of depression and alcohol consumption. Referring clients to other therapists may be appropriate if the current therapist is unable to provide effective treatment."
