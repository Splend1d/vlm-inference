Mostly price competition.\n\nMonopolistic competition is characterized by some degree of price competition among firms, as well as barriers to entry and exit that prevent significant market share changes. The profit maximizing output level for each firm will be determined by the inverse demand curve at its price, which in turn is equal to marginal revenue (MR) divided by marginal cost (MC). However, since the industry is not perfectly competitive (i.e., there are non-price competition mechanisms such as advertising), the inverse demand curve shifts upward relative to the pure monopoly case, leading to higher average total costs and lower profits for firms. Therefore, option C (mostly price competition) is correct. Options A (P > MC), B (efficiency), and D (P = MR) do not accurately describe the characteristics of monopolistic competition."
