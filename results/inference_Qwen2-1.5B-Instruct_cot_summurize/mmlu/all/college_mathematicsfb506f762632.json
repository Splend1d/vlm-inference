A polynomial function has no local extrema (local maxima or minima) if its derivative vanishes identically.\n\nTo find the critical points of $f$, we need to compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 + 3y$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 + 3x$$\n\nSetting these equal to zero gives us the critical points:\n$$3x^2 + 3y = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 - y = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 = y$$\n$$3y^2 + 3x = 0 \\Rightarrow y^2 - x = 0 \\Rightarrow y^2 = x$$\n\nThese equations represent two lines: $x^2 = y$ and $y^2 = x$. The intersection of these lines corresponds to the critical points $(a,a^2)$ and $(b,b^2)$, where $a$ and $b$ are the solutions to the equation $a^2 = b$.\n\nFor $a^2 = b$, we have two cases:\n\n1. If $a = b$, then $a = b = c$ for some constant $c$. This means both critical points are the same.\n2. If $a \\neq b$, then the critical points are distinct.\n\nIn either case, since the function's second derivative is always positive (since it's a sum of cubes), we can conclude that the function has no local extrema (maxima or minima).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **none of the above**."
