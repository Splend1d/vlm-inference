This doesn't necessarily mean that reproductive cloning is always wrong or that it has anything to do with the morality of cloning in general. It could just be a personal preference or belief system that differs from others'. Ultimately, whether or not someone feels strongly about reproductive cloning is subjective and depends on individual perspectives and values."
