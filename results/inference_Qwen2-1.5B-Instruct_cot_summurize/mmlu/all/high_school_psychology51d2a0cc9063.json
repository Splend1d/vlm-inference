This method involves using rewards or tokens that can be exchanged for larger rewards, such as money or material items, in order to encourage desirable behavior. In this case, Max earned stickers for behaving well at school, which he could exchange for a reward from his parents. This type of system is designed to provide positive reinforcement, encouraging desired behaviors while avoiding negative consequences."
