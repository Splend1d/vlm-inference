Deceiving participants may lead them to feel manipulated or deceived, which can have negative psychological effects on them. Additionally, if the deception is not properly justified or is used for unethical purposes, such as to manipulate outcomes or control others, it may also undermine trust in research and undermine the integrity of the field as a whole. Therefore, while the other options listed (making it harder to access certain populations, making personal data inaccessible, and making records anonymous) are all potential disadvantages of deceiving participants, they are not directly related to the ethical disadvantage you mentioned."
