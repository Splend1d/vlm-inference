The equation for a logistic curve is P(t) = K / (1 + e^(-r * t)), where P(t) is the population at time t, K is the carrying capacity, and r is the intrinsic growth rate.\n\nIf the mosquito population is maintained at a point corresponding to the midpoint of its logistic curve, it will not exceed the maximum sustainable population size (K). This ensures that there is enough food for the mosquitoes to thrive without overpopulating the area, and reduces the risk of disease transmission.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. maintain the population at a point corresponding to the midpoint of its logistic curve."
