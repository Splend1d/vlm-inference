Stone tablets and monumental works (such as statues and temples) also played important roles in representing the wealth and status of rulers and their subjects, but they are not as directly associated with the state societies themselves as pyramids. Irrigation canals were also significant in ancient civilizations such as those in Mesopotamia and China, but they do not have the same level of direct symbolic significance as pyramids or monuments."
