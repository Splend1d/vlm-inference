A model whose dependent variable has recently exhibited a structural change.\n\nWhen a model's dependent variable exhibits a structural change, it means that there has been a significant change in the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable over time. This can happen due to changes in economic conditions or other factors. By including this new information in the model, we can improve its forecasting accuracy by capturing the effects of these changes.\n\nOn the other hand, models based on financial theory may not be able to capture the dynamic effects of structural changes in the economy, leading to less accurate predictions. Similarly, models containing many variables may be prone to overfitting, which can also result in lower out-of-sample forecast accuracy. Finally, models that are entirely statistical in nature with no room for judgmental modification of forecasts may be too rigid and unable to adapt to changing economic conditions."
