Some of the things included in M2 are not as liquid as the things in MI.\n\nM2 (money multiplier) refers to the total amount of money held by households, businesses, and governments in the form of cash, checks, savings deposits, and certificates of deposit. It includes both liquid assets such as cash and CDs, which can be easily converted into cash or sold quickly on the market, and less liquid assets like savings accounts, which may have restrictions on withdrawal and may take longer to convert into cash.\n\nOn the other hand, MI (money supply index) measures the total money supply in an economy, including all types of monetary instruments. It does not necessarily include liquid assets like cash and CDs, but rather includes more general categories of financial assets like stocks, bonds, and derivatives.\n\nTherefore, while some elements of M2 might be less liquid than those of MI, it is incorrect to say that M2 is smaller than MI, nor is it accurate to claim that M2 is backed by gold or that the biggest component of M2 is currency."
