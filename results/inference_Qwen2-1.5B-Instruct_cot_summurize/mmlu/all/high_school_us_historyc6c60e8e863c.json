It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nIn what way did the actions of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 contradict Douglass's sentiments in the excerpt above?\n\nA. Lincoln promoted the freedom of settlers within territories to determine the slave status of their new state.\nB. Lincoln passed the Homestead Act to give free land to all western settlers.\nC. Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from any of the new territories.\nD. Lincoln enacted the policy of giving newly freed slaves \"forty acres and a mule.\"\n"
