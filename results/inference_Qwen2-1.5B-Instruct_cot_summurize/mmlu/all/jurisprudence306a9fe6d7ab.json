You must act according as if your values apply to everyone.\n\nKant's Categorical Imperative, also known as the \"impossible maxim,\" states that one should always act in such a way that it would be a universal law for all rational beings, regardless of their desires or intentions. This means that one's actions should always be guided by principles that are applicable to everyone and do not depend on personal feelings or preferences. The key idea behind this principle is that one's actions should be consistent with what one would want others to do in similar situations."
