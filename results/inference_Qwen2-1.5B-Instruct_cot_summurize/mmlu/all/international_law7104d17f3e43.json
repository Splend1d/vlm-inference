Recognition requires that the constitution of the recognized State includes sufficient human rights guarantees.\n\nThe constitutive theory of recognition, also known as the theory of positive law, argues that states can only be recognized by other states if they meet certain criteria set forth in their constitutions. Specifically, these criteria include the existence of a written constitution and the inclusion of sufficient human rights guarantees.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer."
