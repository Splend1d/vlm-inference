This implies that the group must have at least one identity element.\n- The order of an element is the smallest positive integer n such that (a^n) = e, where a is the element and e is the identity element.\n- For any group G with elements a and b, if a^2 = b and b^2 = a, then a and b commute, meaning ab = ba.\n- Therefore, for any element a in a group G with order 1, 2, or 5, there exists another element b in G such that a * b = b * a = e, where e is the identity element. Thus, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2:\n- An element of order 2 in a group means that the element raised to any power other than itself equals the identity element.\n- An element of order 3 in a group means that the element raised to any power other than itself equals the identity element.\n- However, these two conditions do not necessarily imply that the element raised to the power of 6 equals the identity element. For example, consider the cyclic group Z_6 under addition modulo 6, which has an element of order 2 (the number 4), but does not have an element of order 6.\n- Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nThe correct answer is **D**. False, True."
