This movement emphasized the importance of maintaining traditional values and institutions, such as the monarchy and the aristocracy, and opposed radical or revolutionary changes. The excerpt provided does not explicitly state which political party or ideology was responsible for the reaction, but it suggests that the reaction was conservative rather than liberal or nationalist. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Conservatism."
