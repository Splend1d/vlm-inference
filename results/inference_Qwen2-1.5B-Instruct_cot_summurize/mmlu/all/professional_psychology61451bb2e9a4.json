Therefore, the therapist's role is to understand the family's structure and then use techniques such as boundary clarification, conflict resolution, and support for the family to help them adapt to new ways of functioning.\n\nSo, while all of the options listed may be relevant depending on the specific situation, the correct answer would depend on the specific circumstances of the case being worked on. However, option C seems like the most appropriate choice given the focus on understanding and modifying the family's structure rather than addressing individual family members or specific issues."
