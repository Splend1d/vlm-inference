This is because the spending multiplier refers to the ratio of the change in output (GDP) to the change in aggregate demand, which is typically expressed as 1 + M/D where M is the amount of new money created and D is the amount of new demand. If M/D = 1 + M/D, then GDP will increase by the same percentage as the increase in aggregate demand. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The spending multiplier."
