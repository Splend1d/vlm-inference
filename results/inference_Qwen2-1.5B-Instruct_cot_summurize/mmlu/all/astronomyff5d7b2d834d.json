The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n\nIf the angular separation between two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of our eyes, then we cannot resolve them as separate entities. Therefore, they appear as a single point of light or \"point source\" in the sky. This is known as a \"synthetic star\". It's important to note that this effect is only visible when the stars are very close together and have similar brightness. If one star is much brighter than the other, it can still be resolved as two separate objects even if their separation is small compared to the angular resolution of our eyes."
