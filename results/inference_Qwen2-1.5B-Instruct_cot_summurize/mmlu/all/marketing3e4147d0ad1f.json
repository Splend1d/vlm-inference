While turnover can be an important factor in understanding organizational characteristics, it is not always a reliable indicator of overall organization health and performance. Other factors such as employee satisfaction, productivity, and leadership style can also play significant roles in shaping an organization's character. Therefore, while turnover may provide some insights into organizational dynamics, it should not be considered the sole basis for segmentation."
