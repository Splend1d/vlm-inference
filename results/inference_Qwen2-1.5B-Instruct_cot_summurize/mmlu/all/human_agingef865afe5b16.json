They may also help with conditions such as depression, anxiety, and even improve cognitive function in older adults (option D). However, it's important to note that omega-3s should not be used as a substitute for medical treatment or advice from a healthcare professional, especially when considering their potential risks and side effects. It is always advisable to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen."
