In March, the retiree planted his annual tobacco crop, which he usually harvested in early October. In September, the retiree sold his farm to a tobacco grower for $100,000. At the time the retiree conveyed the property to the grower, the tobacco crop was well developed and quite mature. When the retiree and the grower entered into their land-sale agreement, there was no mention of the status or ownership of the tobacco crop. In early October, after the grower took possession of the property, the retiree contacted him and requested permission to harvest and remove the tobacco crop. The grower refused to allow the retiree to re-enter the property. The retiree brings suit against the grower seeking to re-enter the property and remove the tobacco crop that he had planted. Which of the following is correct regarding the respective rights of the parties?\n\nA. The retiree is entitled to remove the tobacco crop, but he must pay the grower a reasonable value to enter the property, thus gaining access to the crop.\nB. The retiree is entitled to remove the tobacco crop and is not required to pay the grower for entering the property, thus gaining access to the crop.\nC. The retiree is not entitled to remove the tobacco crop and, thus, is not entitled to re-enter the property.\nD. The retiree and the grower each have a colorable title to the tobacco crop, and consequently, there should be an equitable division of the proceeds from the sale of the crop between both parties.\n"

The retiree is entitled to remove the tobacco crop and is not required to pay the grower for entering the property, thus gaining access to the crop.\n\nUnder common law principles, when a person sells real estate without conveying any specific interest in the land or its improvements (such as crops), they retain a possessory right to remain on the property until the sale is completed. This possessory right allows the seller to occupy the land while the buyer is paying off the debt or making payments on the purchase price. If the buyer does not complete the transaction within a reasonable period, such as three months, the seller retains possession of the land and may remove it at any time. However, if the buyer completes the transaction, the seller must vacate the property.\n\nIn this case, the retiree retained a possessory right over the tobacco crop, even though the crop itself did not pass to the grower under the sale contract. Therefore, the retiree is entitled to remove the tobacco crop and is not required to compensate the grower for doing so."
