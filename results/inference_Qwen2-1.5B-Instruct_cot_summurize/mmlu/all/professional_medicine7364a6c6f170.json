It works by reducing inflammation and stimulating the immune system to fight off bacteria. It may also help to relieve pain and improve digestion. However, it should only be prescribed under the guidance of a healthcare professional due to its potential side effects, especially if taken long-term.\n\nAzathioprine and Infliximab are immunosuppressive medications commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. They work by suppressing the body's immune response and reducing inflammation.\n\nLubiprostone is a prescription medicine that is often used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It helps to reduce bloating and cramping associated with IBS by relaxing the muscles in the digestive tract.\n\nPlease note that this information is based on general knowledge and should not replace the advice of a medical professional.
