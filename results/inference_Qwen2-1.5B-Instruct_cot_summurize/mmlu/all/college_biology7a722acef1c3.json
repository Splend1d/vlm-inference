Therefore, the second base in the complementary sequence is T.\n- The third base is Guanine (G), so the fourth base should be Cytosine (C). Therefore, the fourth base in the complementary sequence is C.\n- The fifth base is Thymine (T), so the sixth base should be Adenine (A). Therefore, the sixth base in the complementary sequence is A.\n- The sixth base is Cytosine (C), so the seventh base should be Guanine (G). Therefore, the seventh base in the complementary sequence is G.\n\nThus, the complementary sequence is 5\u2032 TGC TTA 3\u2032.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032."
