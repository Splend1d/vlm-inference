Maintains alveoli in an open state\n\nSurfactant plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs within the lungs that exchange gases with the bloodstream. Surfactants help to reduce the surface tension between the airway passages and the lining of the alveoli, making it easier for gases to diffuse from the air into the bloodstream.\n\nIn NRDS, premature babies often do not produce enough surfactant or have poor quality surfactant due to a lack of adequate nutrition or other factors. This can lead to difficulties in breathing and increasing the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), as the alveoli become closed off, making it difficult for gas exchange to occur effectively. The goal of therapy in cases of NRDS is to restore sufficient levels of surfactant to allow proper gas exchange to occur, which ultimately helps improve the baby's overall health."
