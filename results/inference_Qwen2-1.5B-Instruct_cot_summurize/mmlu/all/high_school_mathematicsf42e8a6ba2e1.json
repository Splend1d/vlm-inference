This means that doubling the $y$-coordinate (which represents the value of $f(x)$ at the shifted point) effectively doubles the $y$-value for any given $x$-value, because the entire graph has been horizontally compressed by $2$ units.\n\nTherefore, for any point $(x, y)$ on the original graph, the corresponding point after shifting and stretching will have coordinates $(x+2, 2y)$.\n\nSince the original point was $(0, 0.1)$, which corresponds to $(2, 0.2)$ under the transformation, we can deduce that the transformed point would be $(4, 0.4)$, and thus $f(10) = 0.4$. \n\nHence, the correct answer is **D. 3.2**."
