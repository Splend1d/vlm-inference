                    "text": "The most accurate statement about writs of certiorari is:\n\nA. Fewer than 5% of petitions for writs of certiorari are granted by the Supreme Court.\n\nThis is because the Supreme Court has established that fewer than 5% of cases are selected to be heard on appeal, which means that less than 250 cases are granted each year. Additionally, the Supreme Court typically grants only one or two petitions per term, so even fewer cases have a chance at being decided. Therefore, option A is the correct answer. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the Supreme Court does not grant writs of certiorari based solely on whether there is a \"circuit split.\" Instead, the Court considers various factors in deciding whether to grant a writ of certiorari, including the importance of the issue, the potential impact on future cases, and the likelihood of reversal if the case were decided differently by another court. Option B also assumes that the lower court's ruling is overturned if the Supreme Court denies a writ of certiorari, but this is not necessarily true. In some cases, the Supreme Court may decide not to hear an appeal if it believes that the lower court's decision was well-reasoned and supported by precedent. Therefore, option B is not entirely accurate. \n\nOption C is also incorrect because the Supreme Court does not overturn a lower court's ruling simply by denying a writ of certiorari. While the Court may consider the merits of the case and its impact on future cases, it ultimately decides whether to grant review based on the particular circumstances of the case. Therefore, option C is not the correct answer. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the Solicitor General is not the only party that can file a petition for a writ of certiorari. Any party that believes that their case presents an important legal question that should be reviewed by the Supreme Court can file a petition. Therefore, option D is not the correct answer."
