Dendrochronology (the study of tree rings) provides information about the climate and environment during the time of an artifact's growth, while coins from ancient shipwrecks can give insight into trade routes and cultural exchanges. Written records can also offer valuable insights into the history and chronology of artifacts. However, it is important to note that a combination of these methods may be necessary to obtain the most accurate results."
