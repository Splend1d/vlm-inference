The patient's cancer was diagnosed six months later, based on the same X-ray, when the patient sought a second opinion. In the interim, the cancer had spread. Fact and expert discovery have been completed in the action. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. In support of its motion, the hospital has submitted a memorandum identifying facts that it claims are not in dispute. It has also cited and attached supporting exhibits, including a report from the hospital's radiologist, who found no signs of cancer on the X-ray. What is the best way for the patient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact?\n\nA. Submit a report from the patient's expert radiologist contradicting the findings in the report of the hospital's radiologist.\nB. Submit an affidavit from the patient's attorney detailing his conversations with the patient's expert radiologist.\nC. Submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist.\nD. Submit the patient's medical records showing the patient's current cancer diagnosis.\n"

                    "text": "The best way for the patient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact is by submitting evidence that contradicts the findings of the hospital's radiologist or other experts involved in the case. This could include:\n\n- A report from the patient's own expert radiologist who disagrees with the findings of the hospital's radiologist.\n- An affidavit from the patient's attorney detailing any discussions with the patient's expert radiologist.\n- An affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist.\n\nWhile submitting an affidavit from the patient's attorney detailing conversations with the patient's expert radiologist may be relevant to the legal proceedings, it does not directly address the issue of whether the patient's cancer was diagnosed correctly based on the initial X-ray. Similarly, while submitting an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist may be useful, it does not provide direct evidence of the patient's current cancer diagnosis. Finally, while submitting the patient's medical records showing the patient's current cancer diagnosis may be relevant to the case, it does not address the specific factual disputes raised by the hospital's motion for summary judgment. Therefore, option C (submitting an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist) is the most appropriate choice for raising a genuine dispute of material fact in this situation."
