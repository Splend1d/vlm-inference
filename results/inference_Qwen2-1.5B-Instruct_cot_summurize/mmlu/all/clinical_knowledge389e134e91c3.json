During these contractions, muscles generate a large amount of energy by contracting against the opposing gravitational force. This requires a significant amount of energy, and muscle cells rely on their ATP stores to provide this energy. When muscles contract, they use up ATP, which then needs to be replenished through processes such as glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation in order to regenerate sufficient levels of ATP to continue generating energy during subsequent contractions."
