Baking soda\n\nBaking soda is a natural deodorizer and can help absorb the ink stain by absorbing excess moisture, which may be helping to spread the ink further into the fabric. It's also effective at neutralizing odors and cleaning up spills. However, it's not recommended to use baking soda directly on the ink stain as it can cause permanent damage if left too long."
