After the property was sold at sheriff's sale for $50,000, the bank sent the consumer due notice of a deficiency still owing of $10,000. The original note, however, had limited bank's recourse to $50,000 or higher. There was no response and the bank entered a deficiency judgment for $10,000. When it started execution proceedings to collect the $10,000, the defendants entered a defense, arguing that the bank was limited to recourse of $50,000 or higher. The judgment for $10,000 was therefore void and unenforceable. Will the court allow enforcement of the deficiency judgment for $10,000?\n\nA. Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because the limitation in the original note is voidable, due to the mortgagors' breach of the mortgage terms.\nB. Yes, the court will enforce the judgment because advance notice to the mortgagors is all that is required to disregard a limitation in an original note.\nC. No, the court will preclude the entrance of the deficiency judgment because the limitation clause is still enforceable and is supported by public policy generally against deficiency judgments.\nD. No, the judgment will not be enforced because deficiency judgments have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n"

This ensures that lenders do not exploit borrowers who may have fallen behind on their payments but were unable to default before being foreclosed upon. By limiting the amount of money a lender can recover from a borrower, this prevents lenders from unfairly exploiting their position and seeking excessive damages. Therefore, even though the limitation clause in the original note is deemed voidable due to the borrower's breach of the mortgage terms, the deficiency judgment cannot be enforced as it goes against the fundamental fairness and equity principles of debt collection law."
