The person with a Level 4 rating on the Rancho Los Amigos Scale of Cognitive Functioning is functioning at an intellectual level that is superior for their age, education, and demographic background.\n\nThe other options do not accurately reflect the cognitive function of someone with a Level 4 rating. A non-responsive individual would not be able to respond to visual or auditory stimuli, and they would likely be in a state of deep sleep. Confused and incoherent behavior suggests a lack of awareness or understanding of one's surroundings, which is typical of individuals with cognitive impairments. Unable to care for oneself indicates a severe degree of cognitive decline. On the other hand, functioning at an intellectual level above average does not necessarily indicate normal cognitive function; it could also suggest compensatory mechanisms or advanced training in certain areas."
