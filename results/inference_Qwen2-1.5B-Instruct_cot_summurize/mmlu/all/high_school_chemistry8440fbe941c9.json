An atom of calcium has 20 protons in its nucleus, which gives it a positive charge of +20e. Calcium also has 12 neutrons distributed evenly throughout its nucleus, resulting in a total mass number (number of protons plus neutrons) of 32. The remaining electron is found on the outermost shell, where it can move freely around the nucleus. \n\nOption A states that the calcium atom contains 20 protons and neutrons, but this is incorrect because calcium is an element with a single isotope, which means it does not have multiple stable isotopes with different numbers of neutrons.\n\nOption B incorrectly states that the calcium atom contains 20 protons and 20 electrons, as there is only one electron per atom for calcium. This would result in a total of 40 electrons, which is not possible given the fact that calcium has only two valence electrons.\n\nOption D is incorrect because all atoms of calcium do not necessarily have a mass of 40.078 u, although most naturally occurring calcium isotopes have a mass within this range. The exact mass of calcium depends on the specific isotope used, and the difference between the observed mass and the theoretical mass from nuclear decay can be quite large."
