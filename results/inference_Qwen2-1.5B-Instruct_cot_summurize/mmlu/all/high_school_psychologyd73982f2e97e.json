Self-serving bias refers to the tendency to overestimate one's own abilities and underestimate others' abilities, which can lead to inaccurate judgments about others based on limited information or expectations. In this scenario, Sal may have formed an incorrect impression of Petunia's personality based on her temporary happiness after winning the lottery, rather than considering her overall character or past behavior. This is an example of self-serving bias, where individuals tend to interpret events in ways that support their existing beliefs or preferences."
