An easement appurtenant grants an exclusive right to use land to another person who is benefited from the use, but does not own any part of the land that they use. In this case, the citrus grower has a right of way across the grapefruit grove, which allows him to cross it on foot, bike, or car. This right of way is an easement appurtenant because it benefits only one party and is tied to that party's possession of the land."
