Information\n\nIn a postindustrial economy, information is often seen as the most important resource for increasing productivity because it allows businesses and organizations to make informed decisions about how best to allocate their resources and compete in the marketplace. Information can come from various sources such as data analysis, research studies, and expert opinions, and it is crucial for making strategic decisions that drive growth and innovation.\n\nWhile energy and labor are also important resources in many industries, they may not be as critical as information in driving productivity in a postindustrial economy. Specialization refers to the ability of individuals or organizations to focus on specific tasks or processes, but it does not necessarily lead to increased productivity without access to adequate information."
