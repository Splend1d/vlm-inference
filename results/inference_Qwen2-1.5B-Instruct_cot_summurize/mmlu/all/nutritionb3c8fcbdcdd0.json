Adaptive thermogenesis\n\nAdaptive thermogenesis refers to the body's ability to adjust its metabolic rate in response to changes in dietary intake, such as under-nutrition or over-nutrition, to maintain homeostasis and minimize energy imbalances. This process helps the body conserve energy by reducing unnecessary metabolic activity when there is an excess of nutrients available compared to what the body needs for growth, repair, and maintenance."
