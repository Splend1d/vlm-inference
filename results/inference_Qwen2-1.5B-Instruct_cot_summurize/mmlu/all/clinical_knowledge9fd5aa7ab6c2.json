One way this is achieved is through the process of phosphocreatine (PCr) resynthesis. PCr is a high-energy phosphate molecule that can be rapidly converted into ATP when it is depleted.\n\nHowever, if there is a lack of oxygen available for PCr resynthesis to occur, it will not be able to regenerate sufficient amounts of ATP in order to meet the demands of the body's activities. This can lead to fatigue and reduced performance after exercise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: a lack of oxygen."
