An oscillator is a device that produces a constant or stable output signal regardless of external conditions such as temperature, voltage, or load resistance. It plays a crucial role in many electronic circuits, including amplifiers, filters, oscillators, and time-keeping devices. To ensure the stability of an oscillator, it must be designed with high-quality components, properly connected, and subjected to rigorous testing and calibration procedures."
