The unemployment rate rises.\n\nWhen the unemployment rate rises, it means that there are more people looking for work than available jobs. This can lead to decreased productivity and output in the economy, as workers may be less productive or choose not to work due to job insecurity or low wages. As a result, the potential GDP (the sum of all possible outputs at different levels of production) will decrease because fewer goods and services will be produced overall. \n\nOn the other hand, if the unemployment rate falls, the potential GDP will increase. If there are more jobs available, workers may have higher incomes and be more likely to work, which could lead to increased productivity and economic growth. However, this depends on various factors such as technological advancements, changes in consumer demand, and government policies. So while a lower unemployment rate could potentially boost the economy's potential GDP, it's not guaranteed."
