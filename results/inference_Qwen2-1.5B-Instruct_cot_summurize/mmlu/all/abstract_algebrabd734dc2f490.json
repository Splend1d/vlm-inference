The subgroup of order 10 corresponds to the subgroup generated by one element of order 3 and another element of order 5. This subgroup has exactly two elements (the identity and its inverse) and therefore has order 10.\n\nTherefore, the first statement is true.\n\nFor the second statement, let's consider a group \\(G\\) with a subgroup \\(H\\). We want to show that the number of left cosets of \\(H\\) equals the number of right cosets of \\(H\\).\n\nConsider any element \\(g \\in G\\). Since \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\), there exists an element \\(h \\in H\\) such that \\(gh = h^{-1}g\\). This means that every element in \\(H\\) commutes with every element in \\(G\\), which implies that \\(H\\) acts transitively on the set of all left cosets of \\(H\\).\n\nSimilarly, for any \\(h' \\in H\\), we have \\(h'h = hh'\\). Again, this implies that every element in \\(H\\) commutes with every element in \\(G\\), so \\(H\\) also acts transitively on the set of all right cosets of \\(H\\).\n\nSince both sets have the same cardinality (the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets), it follows that the number of left cosets of \\(H\\) equals the number of right cosets of \\(H\\).\n\nTherefore, the second statement is also true.\n\nThe correct answer is D. False, True."
