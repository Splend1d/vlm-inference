An equatorial wind speed of more than 900 miles per hour.\n\nSaturn and Jupiter have very similar atmospheric compositions, with both having a majority of hydrogen and helium. They also share many similarities in terms of their belts zones and storms, as well as the presence of significant \"shear\" between bands of circulation at different latitudes. However, Saturn has a slower equatorial wind speed compared to Jupiter."
