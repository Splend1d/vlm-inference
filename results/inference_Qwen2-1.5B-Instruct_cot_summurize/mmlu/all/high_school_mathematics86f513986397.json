The LCM of 360, 450, and 540 can be found by prime factorization:\n\n- \\(360 = 2^3 \\times 3^2\\)\n- \\(450 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5\\)\n- \\(540 = 2^2 \\times 3^3 \\times 5\\)\n\nTaking the highest power of each prime that appears in any of the factorizations gives us the LCM: \\(2^2 \\times 3^3 \\times 5 = 4 \\times 27 \\times 5 = 180 \\times 5 = 900\\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum positive number of days before all three planets are in the exact same location again is 900 days, which corresponds to option C."
