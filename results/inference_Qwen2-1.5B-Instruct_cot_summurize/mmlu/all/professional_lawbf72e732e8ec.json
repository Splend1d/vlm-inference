It can only be admitted if it falls under one of the recognized exceptions, such as when the declarant is unavailable or incompetent to testify, or when the statement is necessary to explain or explain the contents of other evidence. In this case, there is no recognized exception that would allow the testimony of the woman to be admitted.\n\nFurthermore, the woman's testimony is not relevant for the limited purpose of proving that the convenience store owner retained control over the sidewalk where the accident occurred. The woman's testimony is about what someone else said, which does not relate to the facts of the case at all.\n\nTherefore, the woman's testimony cannot be admitted as evidence."
