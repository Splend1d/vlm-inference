III and IV only.\n\nExplanation:\nU.S. GDP includes the market value of goods and services produced within the United States, as well as the trade of those goods and services with other countries. In this case, option I (movies made in Africa) would not be included because it does not meet the criteria of being produced or traded within the United States. Option II (olive oil sold in the United States) also does not meet the criteria because it involves a transaction between two non-U.S. entities rather than production within the United States. Option III (blue jeans made in the United States and sold in Japan) would not be included because it involves a transaction between two non-U.S. entities rather than production within the United States. Option IV (wine made in the United States by Canadian citizens) would not be included because it involves a transaction between a non-U.S. citizen and an entity located outside the United States. Therefore, only options III and IV are included in U.S. GDP."
