The demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm's product will be downward sloping because as the price decreases, more consumers will purchase the product, leading to an increase in quantity demanded. This means that the demand curve will be equal to the market demand curve, which is the total quantity of the product sold at each price level. \n\nOption B (perfectly elastic) is incorrect because perfectly elastic demand implies that when the price is increased, the quantity demanded remains unchanged, but this is not the case in a perfectly competitive market. Option C (perfectly inelastic) is also incorrect because perfectly inelastic demand implies that when the price is decreased, the quantity demanded increases, but this is not the case in a perfectly competitive market either. Finally, option D (kinked at the going market price) is incorrect because a perfectly competitive firm's demand curve is a straight line that slopes downward from left to right."
