In this case, we know that the MPL of the third worker is 10, meaning that producing one more unit of output requires one more unit of labor.\n\nGiven that the firm has hired two workers already, it means that they have used 2 units of labor to produce their output. To determine if hiring more labor would increase or decrease the Marginal Revenue Product per Labor (MRPL), let's calculate the total revenue generated by the firm:\n\n- Output from the first worker: 2 units * $3 = $6\n- Output from the second worker: 1 unit * $3 = $3\n\nTotal output: $6 + $3 = $9\n\nNow, let's find the MRPL for both scenarios:\n\n1. Scenario 1: The firm hires another worker and uses 3 units of labor to produce output. Total revenue: $6 + $3 = $9.\n   - MRPL: ($9 / 3) = $3\n\n2. Scenario 2: The firm does not hire any more workers but still uses all three units of labor to produce output. Total revenue: $6 + $3 = $9.\n   - MRPL: ($9 / 3) = $3\n\nBoth scenarios result in an MRPL of $3, indicating that increasing the number of workers or not increasing the number of workers at all would lead to no change in the MRPL.\n\nTherefore, none of the given options A, B, C, or D are correct. The most accurate statement is that there would be no impact on the MRPL regardless of whether the firm hires more or less labor."
