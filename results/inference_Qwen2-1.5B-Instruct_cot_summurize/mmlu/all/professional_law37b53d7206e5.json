A grocery store owner purchased discounted food stamps from an undercover agent, and was arrested for violating the statute. At trial, the store owner claimed that the government must prove that he had the specific intent to commit a crime. The government contended it only had to show that he knowingly acquired food stamps, and that this was not a specific intent crime. The trial judge adopted the government's interpretation, and the store owner was convicted. His appeal made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Will the Court likely reverse or affirm the conviction and why?\n\nA. Conviction reversed, because a store owner is exempt from the statute, which applies only to consumers who use food stamps illegally.\nB. Conviction reversed, because the better interpretation is that mens rea is included, and the owner must know his conduct is in violation of the criminal laws.\nC. Conviction affirmed, because the meaning of knowingly does not connote that there must be specific knowledge by the actor that what he is doing is illegal.\nD. Conviction affirmed, because the modern trend of the law is to recognize criminal liability without mens rea or specific criminal intent.\n"

Conviction affirmed, because the meaning of knowingly does not connote that there must be specific knowledge by the actor that what he is doing is illegal.\n\nIn the case at hand, the store owner knowingly acquired food stamps in a manner not authorized by the statute or the regulations. This means that he understood that his actions were against the law, but still did them anyway. Therefore, he would not need to have specific knowledge that what he was doing was illegal to be found guilty under the statute.\n\nThe government argued that the store owner should have known that his actions were illegal, but the court agreed with the government's interpretation of \"knowingly.\" The court held that the modern trend of the law is to recognize criminal liability without mens rea or specific criminal intent. So, even though the store owner may not have been aware that his actions were illegal, the fact that he knew they were against the law could still make him liable under the statute."
