Therefore, they are already ordered from least to greatest.\n\nB. 10, 354, 10, 600, 104, 321, 106, 213\n\nThis list starts with the smallest number (10) and then increases by multiples of 10 until it reaches the largest number (106213). However, this order is not strictly increasing; for example, 10600 is greater than 10354 but smaller than 106213. Therefore, this list is not strictly ordered from least to greatest.\n\nC. 160, 233, 171, 116, 455, 116, 33\n\nIn this case, we can easily see that the first number is the smallest, followed by the second number, and so on. This list is also ordered from least to greatest.\n\nD. 12, 209, 12, 902, 12, 546, 12, 544\n\nAgain, we can see that the first number is the smallest, followed by the second number, and so on. This list is also ordered from least to greatest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C**."
