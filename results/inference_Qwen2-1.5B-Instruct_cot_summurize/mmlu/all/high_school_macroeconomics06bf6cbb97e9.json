Prices will be driven upward to restore equilibrium.\n\nWhen the economy is in disequilibrium, meaning the price level is higher than what it should be due to an excess demand for goods and services, the government can take several measures to restore equilibrium:\n\n1. **Increase Supply**: If there's an excess demand, the government can stimulate supply by lowering taxes or providing subsidies to producers. This encourages them to produce more at lower costs, leading to an increase in supply and decreasing prices over time.\n\n2. **Decrease Demand**: The government might also use fiscal policy tools like cutting interest rates or increasing spending on infrastructure projects. These actions reduce consumer and business confidence, which decreases their demand for goods and services, thereby reducing excess demand and restoring equilibrium.\n\n3. **Adjust Price Levels**: To correct the misalignment between price levels and demand, the central bank can raise interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, making consumers and businesses less willing to spend and thus reducing excess demand. This leads to a downward pressure on prices and eventually back to equilibrium.\n\n4. **Adjust Exchange Rates**: If the economy is experiencing high inflation, the central bank might consider adjusting exchange rates to stabilize the currency value against other currencies, ensuring that domestic prices align with those abroad.\n\nIn summary, these actions aim to rebalance the market, bringing the price level closer to its natural level (which reflects the actual supply and demand) and restoring equilibrium."
