It involves reducing risk factors that can lead to illness or injury. Examples include promoting healthy lifestyles, such as regular exercise and a balanced diet, or providing access to healthcare services.\n\nSecondary prevention refers to interventions aimed at preventing the onset of a disease once it has been diagnosed. This might involve early detection through screening tests or other methods, or providing treatment to prevent further complications.\n\nTertiary prevention refers to efforts made after a person has developed a serious health condition, aiming to improve their quality of life and reduce the likelihood of death. This might involve managing symptoms, providing palliative care, or working with support groups.\n\nTherefore, primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention are all forms of prevention that focus on different stages of the disease development process."
