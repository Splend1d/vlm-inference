Androgen insensitivity\n\nAndrogen insensitivity is a condition in which individuals have the physical characteristics of males but lack the hormonal effects associated with male sex hormones, such as testosterone and androgens. This can lead to symptoms that suggest female gender, such as secondary sexual characteristics (such as breasts) or anovulation (lack of menstrual cycles). Other factors that may contribute to female pseudohermaphroditism include chromosomal abnormalities, genetic disorders, and environmental factors."
