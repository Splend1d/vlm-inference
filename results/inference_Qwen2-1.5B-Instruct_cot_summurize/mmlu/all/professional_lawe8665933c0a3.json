The head of the department has promulgated the following hiring rule: \"Because the rich are the source of all problems of society and cannot understand the plight of the poor, anyone who has a net worth over $10,000.00 is ineligible for employment with this department.\" Immediately, 25 employees in the department are fired due to their net worth above the designated level. They sue the state. Which of the following is the correct analysis and conclusion?\n\nA. The action is arbitrary and capricious, so it is unconstitutional under the strict scrutiny standard.\nB. The action is not deemed done by a state actor because wealth redistribution is not an essential government function.\nC. The right to public employment is a protected property interest and the employees would likely prevail because of lack of procedural due process.\nD. Wealth is a quasi-suspect class, so the rule must promulgate an important governmental purpose. Eliminating poverty is important, so the rule meets this level of scrutiny.\n"

Wealth is a quasi-suspect class, so the rule must promote an important governmental purpose. Eliminating poverty is important, so the rule meets this level of scrutiny.\n\nThis is because the hiring rule discriminates against individuals based on their financial status, which is a form of wealth discrimination. Therefore, it falls under the category of a suspect classification that requires a higher level of scrutiny (strict scrutiny) when determining whether it is constitutional or not. In this case, eliminating poverty is considered an important governmental purpose, which justifies the rule's constitutionality."
