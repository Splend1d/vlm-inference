This could include discriminatory applications of a facially neutral law, where the law has no discriminatory intent but results in discrimination nonetheless due to the discriminatory effects of the underlying policies or practices. However, it does not necessarily require a discriminatory intent to be considered discriminatory, as long as there is a discriminatory motive behind the discriminatory application of the law."
