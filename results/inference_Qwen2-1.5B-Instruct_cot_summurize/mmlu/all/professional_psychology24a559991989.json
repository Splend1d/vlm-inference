The correct answer is D: the total selection process results in unequal results for one or more groups covered by law. This can happen if there is a systematic bias against these groups in the selection process, such as through discriminatory practices or biases in the job requirements or assessment methods. It is important to avoid any form of discrimination and ensure equal treatment for all applicants."
