At this point, the firm's total revenue is equal to its total cost.\n\nHowever, if the price of the product is less than the minimum average total cost (ATC), then the firm's total revenue from selling all units produced will be less than its total cost, which means the firm will incur losses. Therefore, the optimal decision for the firm would be to shut down production since it cannot make a profit under these conditions."
