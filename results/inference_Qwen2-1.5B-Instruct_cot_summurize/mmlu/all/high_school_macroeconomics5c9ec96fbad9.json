In these circumstances, the government can take action to stimulate economic growth by increasing public investment in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other public goods.\n\nIncreased government spending can lead to higher levels of aggregate demand in the economy, which can help to create jobs and boost consumer confidence and spending. This, in turn, can lead to a reduction in unemployment and an increase in output and inflation, as long as there is no excessive inflation associated with the increased spending.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most accurate answer according to the principles of classical economics."
