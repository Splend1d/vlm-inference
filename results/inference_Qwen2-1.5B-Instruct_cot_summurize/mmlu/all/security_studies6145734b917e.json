No, arms control does not serve any purpose outside the realm of traditional military weapons.\nB. Yes, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control strategies.\nC. Effective deterrence requires international cooperation which is achievable in theory, but the verification required for traditional arms control strategies is impossible in cyber(ed) warfare.\nD. Only arms control is unproblematic, deterrence has failed because international cooperation cannot be reached and common rules or practices cannot be established.\n"

Yes, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control strategies.\n\nArms control and deterrence can be applied to cyber-attacks and threats just like they are applied to traditional military weapons. For example, countries can agree on guidelines for how to detect and respond to cyber attacks, and set up mechanisms for sharing information about cyber threats and vulnerabilities. This can help prevent future cyber attacks and reduce the damage caused by existing ones. However, it's important to note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on the nature and scope of the cyber threat."
