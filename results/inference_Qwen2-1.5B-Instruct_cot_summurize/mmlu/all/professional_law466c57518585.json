Character evidence refers to evidence that tends to prove or disprove a witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. In general, character evidence is admissible only if it relates specifically to the witness's state of mind at the time of an event and cannot be used to prove or disprove the witness's credibility as a witness. Therefore, the defendant cannot introduce evidence to show honesty, but they can introduce evidence to show their truthfulness during cross-examination."
