A major shift of urban voters in Northern states from the Republican to the Democratic Party\n\nThe New Deal coalition, which included the Democratic Party and its supporters, was able to gain significant electoral success during the 1930s due to several factors, including:\n\n- The Great Depression: The widespread economic hardship caused by the depression made it easier for the Democrats to appeal to voters who were struggling financially.\n- The New Deal policies: Many of the New Deal programs such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, and public works projects provided direct relief to those affected by the crisis.\n- The Democratic Party platform: The Democratic Party platform in the 1930s emphasized the need for government intervention to address economic problems, and this resonated with many voters.\n- The Republican Party response: The Republican Party initially tried to appeal to voters sympathetic to the New Deal through a \"moderate\" wing that advocated for limited government intervention. However, the party ultimately shifted towards a more conservative position, which helped to solidify the Democratic base.\n\nIn summary, the combination of the Great Depression, the New Deal policies, the Democratic Party platform, and the Republican Party's shifting stance played a key role in the electoral success of the New Deal coalition during the 1930s."
