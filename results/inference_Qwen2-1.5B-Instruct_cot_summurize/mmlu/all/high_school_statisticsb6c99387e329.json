Therefore, the probability of committing a Type I error is low.\n\nThe probability of committing a Type II error (accepting a false null hypothesis) can be calculated using the complement rule:\n\nP(Type II Error) = 1 - P(Type I Error)\nP(Type II Error) = 1 - P(H0 | H0 is True)\n\nSince there are no other assumptions or conditions given about the test statistic distribution for these tests, we cannot determine the exact probabilities without additional information. However, based on the nature of the alternatives, we can expect the probability of committing a Type II error to be relatively high.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 0.50"
