Equilibrium quantity rises, and the price rises.\n\nWhen there is an increase in the supply of grapes, it means that more grapes are available for sale at the same level of demand. As a result, the market will tend to move towards a higher equilibrium quantity where both buyers and sellers are satisfied with the outcome. This will lead to an increase in the price as well because the surplus (the difference between the amount of grapes supplied and demanded) needs to be distributed among all buyers.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct interpretation of the relationship between demand, supply, and price in this scenario."
