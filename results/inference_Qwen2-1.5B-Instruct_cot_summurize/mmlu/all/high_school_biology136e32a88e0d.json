In fact, they discovered that humans have only about 24,000 genes. How can we exhibit so many different traits from so few genes?\n\nA. Modification of histone proteins usually increases the function of genes.\nB. Epigenetics enables one gene to produce many different traits.\nC. This is proof that pseudogenes and introns are expressed.\nD. A single gene can produce more than one trait because of alternative splicing\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D: A single gene can produce more than one trait because of alternative splicing.\n\nAlternative splicing refers to the process by which pre-mRNA molecules are processed into mature mRNA molecules with different coding sequences. In alternative splicing, some parts of the pre-mRNA are removed or modified before it is translated into a protein. This allows multiple transcripts to be produced from a single gene, each with a different set of amino acids encoded in its sequence.\n\nThis means that while humans have only about 24,000 genes, there could still be thousands of alternative splicing events occurring within those genes, leading to the production of multiple proteins with similar structures but different functions. For example, two different versions of a protein could be produced from the same gene through alternative splicing, even though they share the same DNA sequence."
