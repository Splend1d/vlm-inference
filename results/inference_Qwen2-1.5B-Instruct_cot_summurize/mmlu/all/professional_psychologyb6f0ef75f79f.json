They provide a framework for decision-making and can guide behavior based on past experiences or expectations. Scripts may be explicit or implicit and can vary depending on cultural, social, or personal factors. In different scenarios such as at a faculty meeting, at a wedding, or in a restaurant, people often rely on their scripts to determine how to act appropriately."
