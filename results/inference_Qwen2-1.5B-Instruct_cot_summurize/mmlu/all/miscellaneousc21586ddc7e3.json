The term \"Arkansas toothpick\" is a play on words that originated in the 1960s when a group of college students in Arkansas used it as a nickname for the spare ribs they ate at a restaurant. The term has since become widely recognized and is now commonly used to refer to the spare rib as well. Therefore, the correct answer is B. spare rib."
