Laughing at someone who is on fire is considered morally wrong because it is cruel and insensitive. Bounding someone's ankle without their consent is also considered morally wrong because it can cause physical harm and discomfort. Neither scenario involves breaking any laws or causing harm to others beyond what is necessary for self-defense or protection."
