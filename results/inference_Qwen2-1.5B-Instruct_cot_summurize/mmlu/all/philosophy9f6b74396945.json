However, it is worth noting that there is some evidence in psychology and philosophy that suggests that people may experience pleasure from achieving goals or desires they have set for themselves.\n\nPsychological egoism, which is the idea that individuals act primarily out of self-interest, can explain why someone might pursue their own interests without considering others' needs. This does not necessarily mean that everyone will always feel pleasure when they achieve something, as there are many factors beyond personal gain that can influence one's emotions and well-being.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: The statement could be true, but it would not necessarily support psychological egoism even if it were true."
