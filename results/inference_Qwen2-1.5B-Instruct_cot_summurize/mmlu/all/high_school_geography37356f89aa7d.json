However, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey, the number of Americans identifying as Christian has remained relatively stable over the past few decades, while the number of Americans identifying as Muslim and Hindu have both increased significantly.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the most rapidly growing religion in the United States today would be either Islam or Hinduism. It is also possible that other religions such as Judaism, Sikhism, or Buddhism could be experiencing growth. Ultimately, the answer to this question will depend on the specific data available at the time of the census."
