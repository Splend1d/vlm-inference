We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nWhich of the following was most directly a cause of the success of the Populist party?\n\nA. Western farmers and ranchers favored conservation and organized to promote the National Parks system.\nB. The growth of corporate power and banking interests inspired rural activists to lobby for political reform.\nC. Western farmers resisted the mechanization of agriculture and resented government interference in rural affairs.\nD. After the Civil War, westward migration slowed, causing a long-term recession in many Western territories.\n"

However, it does state that the Populist party sought to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of \"the plain people,\" with whom it originated, and that its platform included calls for greater democracy, economic reform, and protectionism against foreign competition. Therefore, it is possible that some of the factors mentioned in your options, such as the growth of corporate power and banking interests inspiring rural activism, could have contributed to the popularity of the Populist party during the late 19th century."
