                    "text": "The entropy change for the vaporization of water can be calculated using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the specific volume at constant pressure to the entropy change:\n\n\u0394S = \u0394H / R * ln(P/P0)\n\nwhere:\n\u0394S is the entropy change,\n\u0394H is the enthalpy change (which is equal to the heat of vaporization),\nR is the gas constant,\nP is the pressure at the initial state,\nP0 is the pressure at the final state.\n\nFor water, \u0394H = -43.9 kJ/mol and \u0394S = -56.7 J/mol*K.\n\nUsing the Clausius-Clapeyron equation with P0 = 1 atm and P = 1 atm:\n\n\u0394S = (-43.9) / (8.314) * ln(1/1)\n\u0394S \u2248 -56.7 / 8.314 * 0\n\u0394S \u2248 -6.7 J/mol*K\n\nHowever, this result is negative, indicating that the entropy actually decreases during the process, not increasing as in other processes where the entropy increases. This discrepancy arises from the fact that the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is used here incorrectly, assuming it applies only to changes in temperature rather than pressure or enthalpy.\n\nIn reality, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation should be applied to changes in enthalpy (\u0394H), not pressure (dP). For the specific case of water vaporizing, we need to use the ideal gas law instead of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n\n\u0394S = (PV - nRT) / RT\n\nwhere V is the volume, n is the number of moles, T is the absolute temperature, and R is the gas constant.\n\nGiven that the molar heat of vaporization is \u0394H = -43.9 kJ/mol and the molar volume at STP is V = 22.4 L/mol, we can rearrange the ideal gas law formula to solve for the temperature change (T):\n\nV = nRT/V0 = nRT/R\n\nRearranging for T:\n\nT = nRV0/R = nRT/V0\n\nSubstituting known values:\n\nT = (n*22.4 L/mol)*8.314 J/(mol*K)/22.4 L/mol = 8.314 nK\n\nSo, the temperature change \u0394T is approximately 8.314 nK.\n\nUsing the ideal gas law again to find the molar heat of vaporization:\n\n\u0394S = (PV - nRT) / RT = (nRT/V - nRT) / RT = (nRT/V) / RT = nV / R\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u0394S = (n*22.4 L/mol)/(8.314 J/(mol*K)) = 27.8 J/mol*K\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 2.78 J mol-1 K-1."
