That's all right: when I come to India and somebody says, \"Oh, Mr. Schumacher, I don't believe in appropriate technology\", I just look him straight in the face and say, \"Oh, that's splendid.

Schumacher believed in the concept of appropriate technology, but later used the term \"appropriate technology\" inconsistently with his earlier statement about intermediate technology. The use of the word \"all\" implies that there were multiple events or discussions related to this topic, which could be interpreted as equivocation."
