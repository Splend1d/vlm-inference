If I have commanded that the tribute offerings sent by you, O King, are to be accepted, this was solely in consideration for the spirit which prompted you to dispatch them from afar. . . . As your Ambassador can see for himself, we possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country's manufactures. It behooves you, O King, to display even greater devotion and loyalty in future, so that, by perpetual submission to our Throne, you may secure peace and prosperity.\nWhat was the impact of European demand for Chinese goods?\n\nA. The Portuguese increased their international power and prestige.\nB. The British shifted their focus for trade and colonization to Japan.\nC. The bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China.\nD. The British sought control of the Malacca Strait.\n"

Therefore, option D (the British sought control of the Malacca Strait) cannot be confirmed as true based on the given information. \n\nHowever, if we consider the context of the passage, it does not seem to directly relate to the impact of European demand for Chinese goods on the global economy. The passage appears to be an exchange between an emperor and an ambassador regarding trade relations and suggests that the emperor is rejecting foreign goods due to his own personal preferences rather than being influenced by European demand.\n\nTherefore, without further information, it is difficult to determine the correct answer to the question about the impact of European demand for Chinese goods on the historical events mentioned."
