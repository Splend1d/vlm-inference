The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the percentage of income that individuals save or spend, while the velocity of money is the average number of times a dollar is spent each year. When the MPC is larger, it means that more people are saving and less are spending their income, which can lead to a decrease in aggregate demand and slower economic growth. This would result in a greater short-run impact on real output due to reduced consumption and investment. On the other hand, if the velocity of money is higher, then there is an increase in the amount of money\u6d41\u901a in circulation per unit time, leading to faster economic growth and a smaller impact on real output from changes in government spending. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
