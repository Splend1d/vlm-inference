This means that it is not a primary rule, as it does not directly relate to the structure of a legal system or the sources of legal authority within a given country. Instead, it serves to establish what constitutes a valid legal document, such as a treaty or constitution, that can be relied upon by courts to determine the validity of other legal documents within a given jurisdiction.\n\nIn contrast, the rule of recognition is often invoked when a court must determine whether certain legal documents, such as a treaty or constitution, are binding under the laws of a particular country. In these situations, the court will apply the rule of recognition to determine whether the documents meet the criteria for binding force and therefore have the authority to override conflicting laws within the country.\n\nTherefore, option B (that it is not a social rule) is correct. The rule of recognition is indeed a social rule, as it is determined by the political processes of a state and is applied to ensure the legitimacy and validity of legal documents."
