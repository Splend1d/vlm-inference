The visual cliff consists of two identical cliffs, one with a hole in it, and the other without a hole. Infants are shown the visual cliff and asked to decide which one they want to climb over. If an infant goes \"over the cliff,\" it indicates that they have learned to perceive depth through experience.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. had learned by experience in crawling to perceive depth. This finding supports the idea that infants are capable of perceiving depth through visual cues, such as the difference in height between the cliff faces, even before they can crawl or walk. However, the data also shows that infants are still developing their ability to distinguish depth and may need more time to fully develop this skill."
