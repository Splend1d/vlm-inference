Stool bulking occurs mainly through the action of insoluble fibres such as cellulose.\n\nFibre sources, such as hemicelluloses, pectins, and inulin, can be slowly or partially fermented by gut bacteria, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that can affect the growth of beneficial bacteria and promote gut health. However, they do not contribute significantly to stool bulk. \n\nOn the other hand, insoluble fibres like cellulose play a crucial role in promoting stool bulkiness because they cannot be broken down by digestive enzymes and require more water to be absorbed. This allows them to expand in the large intestine, increasing its volume and potentially improving bowel movements. Therefore, the main source of stool bulkiness from fibre intake is actually the insoluble type."
