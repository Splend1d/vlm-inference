The symptoms of Cushing's Syndrome include weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, high blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, and often a \"moon face\" appearance with prominent cheekbones and a broad forehead. \n\nIt is important to note that Cushing's Syndrome can also cause other problems such as osteoporosis in women, but it is not typically associated with enlarged extremities or buffalo humps."
