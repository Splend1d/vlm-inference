However, it's not necessarily true that the MAP estimate approaches the MLE estimate as the number of data points increases to infinity. In fact, if we have a very large number of data points and use a small sample size (e.g., only a few observations per class), then the MAP estimate may not even approach the MLE estimate. Therefore, the answer is D. False, True."
