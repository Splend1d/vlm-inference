However, this does not mean that they do not undergo mutation. In fact, coronaviruses have been shown to be highly mutagenic and can mutate rapidly over time. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption A is also incorrect because the RNA transcripts produced by the viral RNA polymerase enzyme all terminate in a common 5\u00b4 end and produce overlapping sets of transcripts, not a common 3\u00b4 end. Option B is correct because coronaviruses use recombination with the long RNA genome to spread their genetic material. Option D is also incorrect because coronaviruses are not known for using capping cellular mRNAs. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. They take advantage of recombination with the long RNA genome"
