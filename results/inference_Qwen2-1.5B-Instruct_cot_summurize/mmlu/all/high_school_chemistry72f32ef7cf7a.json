The point at which the attractive and repulsive forces between the two atoms are equal.\n\nBond lengths are typically determined by the balance between the attractive and repulsive forces between the atoms in a molecule or compound. When the attractive force between the atoms (such as covalent bonding) is stronger than the repulsive force (such as electrostatic forces), the atoms will be held closer together, resulting in a shorter bond length.\n\nIn contrast, when the repulsive force is stronger than the attractive force, the atoms will be further apart, leading to a longer bond length. This principle is known as the \"van der Waals\" theory of molecular structure, which takes into account both covalent and ionic interactions.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer."
