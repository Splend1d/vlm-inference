Collective output: Team members work together towards a common goal or objective.\n2. Individual and collective responsibility: Each member of the team has individual responsibilities, but also shares in the responsibility for achieving the group's goals.\n3. Fluid dimension to roles and tasks: Team members can change their roles and responsibilities as needed to meet the needs of the project.\n4. Minimal and formal knowledge sharing: Knowledge sharing within a team should be informal and collaborative rather than formal.\n\nTherefore, option A (Minimal and formal knowledge sharing) does not fit the characteristics of a team."
