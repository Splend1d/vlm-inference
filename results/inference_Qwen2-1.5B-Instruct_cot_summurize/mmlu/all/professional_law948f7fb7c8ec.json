The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the regulations set forth in the Declaration of Covenants reads:\"Each purchaser, by the acceptance of a deed therefore, promises to pay the community association an annual assessment or charge to be determined on the basis of the valuation of each individual lot and the improvements thereon. Nonpayment of any annual assessment or charge when due shall result in a lien upon the parcel of the property. \"A gardener, the owner of lot 29 in the development, sold his land to a landscaper with a deed containing no restrictions. The community association, pursuant the Declaration of Covenants, sues the landscaper to collect the annual assessment for lot 29. Which of the following is the best argument for the landscaper?\n\nA. There is not privity of contract between the housing corporation and the community association.\nB. Because the charge constitutes a lien, there is no personal obligation on the landscaper's part.\nC. There is no privity of contract between the gardener and the landscaper.\nD. There is no privity of estate between the gardener and the landscaper.\n"

In this case, the community association has provided landscaping services to the landscaper and is owed money from the sale of the lot to the gardener. Therefore, the landscaper owes a debt to the community association as a result of performing services for them.\n\nHowever, the fact that the charge constitutes a lien does not absolve the landscaper of any obligation under the Declaration of Covenants. Instead, it creates a legal right for the community association to seize the landscaper's interest in the property if they fail to pay the annual assessment. This is why the landscaper can be sued by the community association to collect the assessment."
