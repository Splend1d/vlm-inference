Don't let her do it again!\" would not be considered hearsay because it does not involve communication between the speaker and another person. It is a statement that occurred after the incident described by the bystander, and therefore falls outside the hearsay exception for statements made under belief of impending death. Additionally, the bystander cannot be shown to have been a co-conspirator or an excited utterance, so those exceptions do not apply. Therefore, the bystander's testimony would be admissible as non-hearsay."
