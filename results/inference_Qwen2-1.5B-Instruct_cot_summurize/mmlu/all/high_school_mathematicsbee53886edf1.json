In this case, we have 4 distinguishable balls and 2 indistinguishable boxes, so we want to find the number of ways to distribute these balls into the boxes such that each ball goes into one box.\n\nThe number of ways to distribute $n$ indistinguishable balls into $k$ distinguishable boxes is given by the Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted as $S(n,k)$. However, in this case, since the balls are distinguishable, we need to use a different approach.\n\nWe can think of the balls as being placed in a line, with each ball in its own box. There are 4 positions in which to place the first ball, then 3 for the second ball, then 2 for the third ball, and finally 1 for the fourth ball. This gives us a total of $4! = 24$ ways to arrange the balls.\n\nHowever, we must divide by the factorial of the number of boxes, since each arrangement is counted multiple times if the boxes are indistinguishable. Since there are 2 boxes, we divide by $2! = 2$, giving us $\\frac{24}{2} = 12$ ways to arrange the balls such that each ball goes into one box.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$.\nThe answer is: $12$"
