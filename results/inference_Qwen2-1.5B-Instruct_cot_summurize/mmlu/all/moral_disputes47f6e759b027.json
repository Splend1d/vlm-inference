You do not have an obligation to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour.\n\nThis is based on the idea that the violinist's request for organ donation is not a medical emergency and therefore does not require immediate action. The violinist's life may be in danger if they do not receive an organ transplant within a certain time frame, but it is not an absolute necessity for their survival. Therefore, you have the option to refuse the offer and choose not to donate your organs."
