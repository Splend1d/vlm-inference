According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, such actions are generally not accepted.\nScenario 2, where the main character digs a hole in the city park for no reason, may be seen as morally neutral or even beneficial if done with good intentions. However, this action still goes against the general rule that one should not harm animals or cause unnecessary destruction. Therefore, option B is also incorrect.\nOption A states that the first scenario is morally wrong, but this is based on the assumption that the act is cruel. It does not necessarily follow that cutting off an injured animal's paw would always be considered morally wrong.\nOption C states that the second scenario is not morally wrong. This is also based on the assumption that digging a hole is harmless and can be done without causing any harm. While this may be true, it does not necessarily mean that digging a hole in a public space is acceptable or not morally wrong.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong."
