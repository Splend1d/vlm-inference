                    "text": "The correct answer is D. All four statements are true concerning the Box-Jenkins approach to diagnostic testing for ARMA models.\n\n1. (i) The tests will show whether the identified model is either too large or too small: This statement is true because the Box-Jenkins approach involves selecting an appropriate order for the autoregressive and moving average components of the model. If the selected order is not adequate, the test can help identify this issue.\n2. (ii) The tests involve checking the model residuals for autocorrelation, heteroscedasticity, and non-normality: This statement is also true as part of the diagnostic analysis process. It helps in assessing the adequacy of the chosen model by examining its residuals for these issues.\n3. (iii) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the acf and pacf for the residuals should show no additional structure: This statement is true as well. The ACF and PACF plots should show no additional structure beyond that expected from the chosen model, indicating that it captures all relevant time series dynamics.\n4. (iv) If the model suggested at the identification stage is appropriate, the coefficients on the additional variables under the overfitting approach will be statistically insignificant: This statement is also true. In overfitting scenarios, the estimated coefficients may become highly sensitive to changes in the data, leading to inflated significance levels for the additional variables. Therefore, statistical significance might not hold when the model is overly complex or has been fit with a lot of data."
