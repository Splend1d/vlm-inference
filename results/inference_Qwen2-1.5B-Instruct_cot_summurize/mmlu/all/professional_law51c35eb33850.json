At the time that the crime occurred, this jurisdiction required a unanimous verdict of all 12 jury members for a conviction on a capital offense. On November 1, the state legislature enacted a new law requiring a majority vote of seven of 12 jurors to convict on a capital offense. The defendant's trial began on December 1. He was subsequently convicted of murder by an eight- to-four vote. Following the trial, the defendant's attorney filed a motion to set aside the verdict. Which of the following would provide the strongest constitutional grounds to overturn the verdict?\n\nA. The ex post facto clause.\nB. The contracts clause.\nC. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a fair and public trial by an impartial jury in criminal cases. This means that the accused has the right to be tried by a jury of his peers, which must consist of twelve individuals who have not been involved in any way with the case. If the state legislature changes the requirements for what constitutes a \"crime\" or how those crimes should be punished, it can potentially violate the Sixth Amendment if the change disproportionately affects certain groups of people and violates their fundamental rights.\n\nIn this scenario, the new law requiring a majority vote of seven out of twelve jurors to convict on a capital offense could potentially violate the Sixth Amendment because it may not provide an impartial jury as required under the Sixth Amendment. Additionally, the fact that the new law applies retroactively (meaning it affects actions taken before its enactment) also raises concerns about equal protection under the law.\n\nTherefore, option A (the ex post facto clause), option B (the contracts clause), and option C (the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment) are not strong enough reasons to overturn the verdict based solely on the new law alone. However, option D (the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial) provides the strongest constitutional ground to overturn the verdict."
