Job performance for older workers depends both upon the decline of skills and the benefits of experience\n\nOlder workers may have lost some of their technical skills over time due to retirement or other life changes, but they also bring valuable experience and knowledge that can be beneficial to a team or organization. Additionally, older workers may have developed new skills through additional education or training opportunities as they transitioned into their careers later in life. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that older workers always perform better simply because of their experience. Instead, job performance is influenced by a combination of factors including age, experience, skill level, and the specific demands of the job."
