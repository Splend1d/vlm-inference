However, in general, it is important to inform clients of any consultations or discussions that may involve their personal health information or treatment plan. This helps to build trust and ensure informed consent.\n\nIf a client has given explicit permission to consult with another professional without disclosing sensitive information, then there may be no need to inform them beforehand. However, if there is a risk of disclosure or unauthorized use of confidential information, it is generally best to discuss these concerns with advance with the client.\n\nUltimately, the decision on whether to inform a client about a consultation should be based on the specific circumstances and the client's preferences. It is important to maintain confidentiality unless there is a clear legal or ethical reason to disclose information."
