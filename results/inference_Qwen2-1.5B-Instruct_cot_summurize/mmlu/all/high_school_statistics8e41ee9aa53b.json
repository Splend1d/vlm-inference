In this case, n=14.\n\nThe critical values for a one-tailed test at the 0.075 level of significance can be found in the t-table or a statistical software package. The appropriate value depends on the degrees of freedom and the desired level of confidence. However, since we only need to find the range of t-values, we can approximate the critical values by considering the range of values that correspond to a P-value of 0.075 when the degrees of freedom are increased.\n\nUsing the degrees of freedom formula, df = n - 1 = 14 - 1 = 13. We can use the t-table or software to find the critical value(s) corresponding to a P-value of 0.075 at df=13:\n\nP(t) = 0.075\n\nThis corresponds to the t-value approximately equal to 1.761 (using Excel's T.INV.2T function).\n\nNow, let's calculate the range of t-values that would have given us this P-value. Since the t-value of 1.761 falls within the range of t-values from 1.345 to 1.782, which corresponds to a two-tailed test, we can conclude that the range of t-values that would have given us the same P-value as our one-sided test is between 1.345 and 1.782, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 1.345 < t< 1.782."
