Signal detection theory\n\nSignal Detection Theory is a psychological concept that explains how humans can reliably distinguish between different stimuli, such as Coke and Pepsi. It is based on the idea that we have an innate ability to discriminate between two stimuli even if they are very similar in appearance or taste.\n\nIn this context, the difference between Coke and Pepsi can be considered a signal that triggers a response from our sensory system. When we see or smell a Coke bottle or hear its distinctive sound, it stimulates certain neurons in our brain that register the presence of a particular chemical compound. Similarly, when we see or smell a Pepsi bottle or hear its distinctive sound, it also stimulates these same neurons, but with a slightly different set of chemicals.\n\nThe difference threshold for distinguishing between Coke and Pepsi is the point at which the neural signals start to differ enough for us to perceive a difference. This difference threshold is typically around 5-10 milligrams per liter (mg/L), which means that a small amount of difference in the chemical composition of the drinks can cause us to notice the difference.\n\nTherefore, Signal Detection Theory provides an explanation for why most people can reliably distinguish between Coke and Pepsi despite their similarities. It shows that our brains have evolved to be able to detect subtle differences between different stimuli, making it easier for us to distinguish between familiar products like Coke and Pepsi."
