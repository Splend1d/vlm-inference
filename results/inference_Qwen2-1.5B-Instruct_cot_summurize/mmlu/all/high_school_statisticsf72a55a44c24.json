To find the range where 9,965 z-scores fall within, we use the z-table or look up this value directly:\n\n- For a z-score of 9,965, it falls between approximately 35.28 and 44.72.\n- This corresponds to a range of 35.28 to 44.72 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 25.3 to 44.7 minutes**."
