She obtains a simple random sample of 30 adults as they leave a Wall Street office building one weekday afternoon. All but two of the adults agree to participate in the survey. Which of the following conclusions is correct?\n\nA. Proper use of chance as evidenced by the simple random sample makes this a well-designed survey.\nB. The high response rate makes this a well-designed survey.\nC. Selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\nD. A voluntary response study like this gives too much emphasis to persons with strong opinions.\n"

In this case, the researcher chose all but two adults who left the office building on a particular day, which means that the sample did not include people from different demographics or regions of the country. This could lead to an unrepresentative sample and biased conclusions about the general public's opinion on the U.S. economy. Therefore, it is important to consider factors such as sample size, representation, and method of data collection when designing and analyzing surveys."
