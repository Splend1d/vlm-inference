Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation.\n\nShoot apical meristem (SAM) formation is not related to seed formation; it occurs during the development of leaves, stems, and roots in plants. Seed formation occurs later in the life cycle when seeds are produced by the fruiting of flowers or fruits. Therefore, the statement that shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation is incorrect. \n\nAll other statements are correct based on the information provided."
