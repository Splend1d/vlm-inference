This action goes against the principle of respect for nature and the environment, as well as the idea of stewardship of resources. The act of taking something from the natural world without permission is generally considered unethical and harmful to the ecosystem.\nOn the other hand, breaking someone's running record is not necessarily morally wrong if it was done with good intentions or for the benefit of the person being recorded. However, this scenario involves physical harm and aggression towards another person, which can be seen as morally wrong.\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
