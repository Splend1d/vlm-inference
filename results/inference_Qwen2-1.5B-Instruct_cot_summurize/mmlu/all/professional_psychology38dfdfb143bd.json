Psychodynamic\n\nPsychodynamic theory posits that behavior is driven by unconscious motivations and desires, which can manifest in various forms such as aggression, withdrawal, or masochism. The psychologist's explanation about the child's misbehavior aligning with a psychodynamic perspective might suggest that it is a manifestation of underlying psychological conflicts or issues.\n\nRogerian (also known as client-centered therapy) focuses on the therapist-patient relationship and the client's self-actualization. Transactional analysis looks at how people interact with each other through relationships, focusing on the roles they play within these interactions. Adlerian psychology emphasizes individual differences and growth, often discussing how past experiences shape personality.\n\nWhile these theories may also apply to some aspects of parenting and behavior management, the most closely related to the given information is psychodynamic theory."
