                    "text": "The answer is C: Decreased intrinsic factor in the stomach.\n\nIntrinsic factor, which is produced by the parietal cells in the stomach lining, plays an important role in the absorption of vitamins B12 (cyanocobalamin) and folic acid from food. Older adults may have reduced production of intrinsic factor due to age-related changes in the stomach lining. This can lead to an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency and other related conditions if adequate amounts of vitamin B12 are not consumed through diet or supplements.\n\nThe other options listed do not directly affect the risk of vitamin or mineral deficiencies among older people in high-income countries:\n\n- Low income might decrease access to affordable nutrients, but it does not specifically relate to increased risk.\n- Decreased mobility could potentially increase exposure to sunlight, leading to higher intake of certain nutrients like vitamin D.\n- Increased nutrient requirements for tissue turnover might be relevant, as older adults may require more protein, iron, and other nutrients than younger individuals, but this is not specific enough to determine the risk of deficiency without additional information on their dietary habits."
