To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism?\n\nA. That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices\nB. That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits\nC. That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations\nD. That European colonizers often resorted to armed force to impose their will on imperial subjects\n"

That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices\n\nThe passage suggests that the Europeans who colonized India did not always respect or understand the customs and beliefs of the indigenous people. This undermines the commonly held assumption that Western imperialism was always focused on profit-making and cultural assimilation. Instead, it highlights the complex relationship between colonial powers and the cultures they sought to control."
