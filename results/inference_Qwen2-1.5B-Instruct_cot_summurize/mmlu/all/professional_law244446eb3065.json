The pedestrian must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the painting company was negligent.\nC.

This means that if an accident occurs involving a machine or instrument, and the injured person can show that the accident occurred as a result of the machine or instrument's inherent dangerousness, they may still recover damages from the manufacturer or owner of the machine or instrument. \n\nIn this case, the pedestrian has shown that the accident occurred because the ladder used by the painters fell and struck him, which would be considered an \"inherent danger\" under res ipsa loquitur. Therefore, the painting company is presumed to have been negligent and must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they were not negligent."
