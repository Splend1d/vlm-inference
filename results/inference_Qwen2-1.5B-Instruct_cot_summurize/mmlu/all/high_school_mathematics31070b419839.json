So, the equation for the sum of the first 7 numbers becomes:\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 105 \\]\n\nSimilarly, since the mean of 8 numbers is 12, the sum of these 8 numbers is $12 \\times 8 = 96$. So, the equation for the sum of all 8 numbers becomes:\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + x = 96 \\]\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives us:\n\\[ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 - (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7) = 96 - 105 \\]\n\\[ x = -9 \\]\n\nSo, the 8th number is $\\boxed{-9}$.\nThe answer is $\\boxed{-9}$."
