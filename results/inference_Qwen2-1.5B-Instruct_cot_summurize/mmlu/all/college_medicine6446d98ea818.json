This results in the DNA sequence being \"GGATCCTCATG\".\n\nTo create a deletion, one or more nucleotides need to be removed from the sequence. In this case, we can remove three nucleotides starting from the third nucleotide (position 2) which will result in the DNA sequence becoming \"TGATCCCAG\".\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D. 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCATG \u2013 3\u2019."
