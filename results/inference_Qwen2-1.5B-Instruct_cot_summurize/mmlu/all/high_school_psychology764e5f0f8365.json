Major Depressive Disorder\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment that has been shown to be effective in treating many mental health conditions, including major depression. CBT focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, and fatigue. It is often used in combination with medication or other treatments, depending on the individual's specific needs and preferences. While some disorders may respond better to certain types of therapy than others, it is generally true that CBT can be very effective for individuals with major depression."
