Under the equity method, if you have a 25% interest in the common stock of one company but not in the common stock of another, then you would report that investment as equity in the balance sheet of the company with the greater ownership percentage. In this case, Goll would report its investment in Rose as equity on its balance sheet because it has a higher ownership percentage than Jave. Therefore, Goll would account for its investment in Rose using the equity method."
