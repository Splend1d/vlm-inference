The niece and her husband took immediate possession of the farm and lived there with their daughter and son. Thereafter, the husband died in an automobile accident. In 1972, two years after her father's death, the daughter moved to another state. The son lived with his mother on the farm until her death intestate in 1980. The son continued in exclusive possession of the farm until his death in 2001. In his will, the son devised the farm to a local charity. When he was alive, the son was unaware that his sister was still alive and that title to the farm had descended to the two of them as their mother's sole surviving heirs. Since his mother's death in 1980, the son has held himself out as the owner of the farm, maintaining it and paying all of the taxes on the property. The sister had not communicated with either her mother or her brother since her redomiciling in 1972. The jurisdiction in which the farm is located has a 20-year limitation period for the acquisition of property by adverse possession. What interest, if any, does the sister have in the property?\n\nA. None, because of her own laches.\nB. None, because the brother acquired title to the farm by adverse possession.\nC. An undivided one-half interest because the brother's possession was not adverse to her title.\nD. An undivided one-half interest because the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of the brother's exclusive possession.\n"

An undivided one-half interest because the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of the brother's exclusive possession.\n\nUnder the Uniform Encumbered Property Act (UEPA) in California, a person may acquire an undivided one-half interest in real property through adverse possession if they possess the land continuously for 20 years without the owner's knowledge. However, this requirement is subject to certain exceptions, including when the possessor is unaware of the owner's presence.\n\nIn this case, the sister did not know about her brother's possession of the farm until after her mother's death in 1980, when the son conveyed the farm to a local charity in his will. Therefore, the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of her brother's exclusive possession. As a result, she would have an undivided one-half interest in the property."
