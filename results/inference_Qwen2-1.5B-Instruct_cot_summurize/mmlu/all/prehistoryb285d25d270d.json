Casting: This method involves pouring molten metal into molds to create a solid object.\n2. Hammering: This is the process of using anvil and hammer to shape or deform metal by striking it with force.\n3. Smelting: This involves heating the metal to its melting point and then extracting impurities or impurities from it.\n\nSo, all three methods were used to work on the first metals in South America."
