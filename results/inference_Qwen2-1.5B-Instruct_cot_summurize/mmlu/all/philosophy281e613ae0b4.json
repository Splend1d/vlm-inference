Why should we bother? and What are the consequences of our believing one thing over another?\n\nThese questions ask us to consider the reasons for engaging in philosophical inquiry, as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks of holding certain beliefs.\n\nB. What do you mean? and How do you know?\n\nThese questions seek to clarify the meaning behind statements or arguments made by philosophers, as well as the methods used by philosophers to arrive at their conclusions.\n\nC. Who really believes X? and How can we explain differences in people's beliefs?\n\nThese questions explore the nature of belief systems and how they differ among individuals, as well as the factors that influence these beliefs.\n\nD. How do philosophers argue? and Are their differences important?\n\nThese questions delve into the specific methodologies and techniques employed by philosophers when conducting research, as well as the importance of philosophical debates and disagreements."
