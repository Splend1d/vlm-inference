                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The rules of Congress make it extremely difficult for representatives to influence legislation on the House floor.\n\nUnder the Constitution, each state has two senators and 435 representatives in the House of Representatives. Senators can serve on any committee they choose, while representatives can only serve on one committee at a time. This means that representatives have less flexibility in choosing which committees to serve on, and therefore may be more focused on their specific committee assignments rather than influencing legislation overall.\n\nIn addition, there are many restrictions on how representatives can influence legislation on the House floor. For example, they cannot filibuster (continue speaking indefinitely) or hold up legislation for an extended period of time. Senators, on the other hand, can use these tactics to block legislation from passing.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason why house members may be more concerned about their committee assignments than senators is due to the limited number of committees they can serve on and the restrictions on their ability to influence legislation on the House floor."
