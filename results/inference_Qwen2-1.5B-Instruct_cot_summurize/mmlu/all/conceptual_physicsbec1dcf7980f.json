Practically zero.\n\nWhen a satellite is in an orbit around the Earth, it experiences a force from gravity that pulls it towards the center of the Earth. This force causes the satellite to move in a circular path. The magnitude of this force is approximately 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s^2) at the Earth's surface. However, as the satellite moves further away from the Earth, the gravitational force becomes weaker due to the inverse square law of gravitation. At very high altitudes, where the distance between the satellite and the Earth is much greater than the radius of the Earth's orbit, the gravitational force can be considered negligible compared to the centripetal force required for the satellite to remain in its orbit. Therefore, the net force acting on the satellite is effectively zero or practically zero."
