None of the above.\n\nTherapeutic cloning involves using stem cells from a specific individual (the donor) to create an identical clone that can be used for medical purposes. This process aims to produce a genetically identical copy of the original individual, rather than producing a new individual with genetic material from multiple sources as in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT).\n\nTherefore, the goal of therapeutic cloning is not to produce and raise a child, or to go down a slippery slope, but rather to treat diseases by creating genetically identical copies of individuals who have already been diagnosed with certain illnesses."
