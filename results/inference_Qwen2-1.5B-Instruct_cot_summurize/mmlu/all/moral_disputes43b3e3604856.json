This means that if a caring action does not produce the desired outcome or if it lacks\u8bda\u610f, then it may not have the same moral value as a caring action that does produce the desired outcome and has a stronger intention to do so. Therefore, the strength of one's intention to fulfill the recipient's interest is an important factor in determining the moral value of caring actions."
