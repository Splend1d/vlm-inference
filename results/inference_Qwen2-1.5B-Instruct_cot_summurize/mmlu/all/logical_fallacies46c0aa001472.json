Ignoring the person\n\nThe fallacy of appeal to the person occurs when someone rejects a claim or argument simply because they disagree with the person making the claim, rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself. This can be seen as ignoring the person and not evaluating the validity of their claims based on their credibility or expertise in the relevant field. Therefore, option C is correct."
