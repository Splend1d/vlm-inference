The preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3 percent noncumulative dividend. Rainbow submits to its stockholders a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. At a shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred vote in favor of the proposal. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.\nB. The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\nC. The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.\nD. The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.\n"

This is because the proposed new class of preferred stock comes before the old preferred stock in terms of priority for redemption, which is a requirement for authorization of any new classes of stock under most corporate law systems. Therefore, at least two-thirds of both the common and preferred stockholders must approve the proposal for it to be validly approved. In this case, only 700 common and 400 preferred votes were cast in favor of the proposal, leaving less than two-thirds of the outstanding shares (800 total) in favor of the proposal. Therefore, the proposal cannot be approved by the shareholders without the necessary two-thirds vote from both classes of stockholders."
