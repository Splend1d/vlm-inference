Since 16 is negative, we want to add a positive number before it to make the sum positive. Let's choose 7 because adding a 7 to 16 gives us a sum of 13, which is positive:\n\n\\[2 \\times 8 + 7 = 16 + 7 = 23\\]\n\nNow, we need to place a positive sign (+) between two numbers that will result in a product greater than zero. Since 16 is negative, we want to multiply it by a negative number before adding 7 to get a positive result. Let's choose -5 because multiplying 16 by -5 gives us a product of -56, which is negative:\n\n\\[23 \\times (-5) = -115\\]\n\nFinally, we need to place a plus sign (+) between two numbers that will result in a difference greater than zero. Since -115 is negative, we want to subtract a positive number from it to get a positive result. Let's choose 3 because subtracting 3 from -115 gives us a difference of 112, which is positive:\n\n\\[-115 - 3 = -118\\]\n\nSo, the highest possible number John could obtain is \\(118\\) or \\(118\\).\n\nThe correct answer is **(C) 100**."
