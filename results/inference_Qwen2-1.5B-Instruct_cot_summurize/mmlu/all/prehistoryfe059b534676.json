It was often carried out as part of religious ceremonies or rituals, such as the consecration of new temples or the celebration of victories over enemies. The captives would be brought before a priest or deity, who would perform various acts of torture and humiliation before they were ultimately killed.\n\nIn the case of the Incas, it is believed that elite members of society would sponsor these feasts, which could involve the beheading of prisoners of war. These feasts were likely intended to demonstrate the power and authority of the ruling class and to show their superiority over the conquered peoples. While there is no record of any specific dates for these events, it is estimated that they occurred on a regular basis throughout the empire's history.\n\nIt is worth noting that while human sacrifice may have been a common practice among ancient cultures, it should not be viewed as an acceptable or ethical practice today. Human life is sacred and should never be used for entertainment or other purposes without consent from the individuals involved."
