                    "text": "The \"classic aging pattern\" refers to a specific pattern of cognitive decline that is characterized by a gradual loss of abilities in various domains of cognitive function over time. This pattern is often associated with an increase in age-related cognitive impairment.\n\nBased on the options provided:\n\n- Option A suggests that verbal functions are preserved relatively well, but performance decreases on tests of perceptual-integrative ability. This is consistent with the classic aging pattern where there is a decline in abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills.\n  \n- Option B suggests that the ability to quickly organize and integrate perceptual stimuli declines, while flexibility of thought improves. While this could occur in older adults, it does not necessarily characterize the classic aging pattern, which tends to focus more on a decline in executive functioning (ability to plan, solve problems, and make decisions).\n  \n- Option C suggests that memory retrieval mechanisms remain relatively intact, except for recall of remote memories. This is consistent with the classic aging pattern where there is a decline in episodic memory (the ability to remember personal experiences) and semantic memory (the ability to recognize familiar objects and concepts), along with other forms of memory.\n  \n- Option D suggests that tasks requiring short-term or primary memory show two consistent declines. This is also consistent with the classic aging pattern where there is a decline in working memory (the ability to hold and manipulate information temporarily) and attentional processes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: memory retrieval mechanisms remain relatively intact, except for recall of remote memories."
