Nectar with high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts\n\nHummingbirds, which are small birds that feed primarily on nectar from flowers, have specialized digestive systems that allow them to extract nutrients from very concentrated nectar. This adaptation allows them to consume large amounts of nectar quickly, making it an efficient way for them to collect food.\n\nIn contrast, most plants produce nectar at lower concentrations, which can be difficult for larger animals like bees to consume. As a result, many plant species have evolved to attract smaller pollinators like hummingbirds instead of relying solely on bees or other insects. This is why hummingbirds are often considered the primary pollinator of many plant species."
