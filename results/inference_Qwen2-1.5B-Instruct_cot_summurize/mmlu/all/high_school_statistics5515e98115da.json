Using stratified random sampling rather than simple random sampling\n\nStratified random sampling involves dividing the population into strata (groups) based on certain characteristics, and then selecting a random sample from each stratum. This method can help reduce bias by ensuring that all groups within the population have an equal chance of being selected, thereby reducing the likelihood of sampling bias.\n\nOn the other hand, A, B, and D are methods for reducing bias in a sample survey:\n\nA. Following up with those who did not respond to the survey the first time: This method could potentially increase response rates and reduce non-response bias.\nB. Asking questions in a neutral manner to avoid influencing the responses: This can also help reduce bias, as it ensures that participants do not feel pressure or influence when answering the questions.\nD. Selecting samples randomly: Random selection helps ensure that every member of the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample, which reduces bias.\n\nHowever, using stratified random sampling instead of simple random sampling does not directly address bias reduction. Stratification helps balance out different subgroups within the population more effectively, but it still relies on sampling without replacement, which can introduce some level of bias due to the finite nature of the sample."
