Propane tanks were an essential component of the mobile homes produced by the builder. The representative told the owner that the company could supply propane tanks at $50 per tank, a substantial savings over what the owner currently paid for propane tanks. The owner asked if the company could supply 1,000 propane tanks by the end of the month, and the representative assured him that they could. The owner stated that he would think about it and decide what to do within a week. On June 3, the owner sent the following memo to the company headquarters at the address provided by the representative: \"I am happy to confirm my order of 1,000 propane tanks, to be delivered by June 30. I have always received a 10 percent discount for cash payment, so I will assume you will grant me the same discount. I will have $45,000 cash ready to give to your representative at the time of delivery. \"On June 30, the company delivered 1,000 propane tanks to the owner. The representative accompanied the delivery and presented the owner with a bill for $50,000. The owner refused to pay any more than$45,000. Which of the following accurately states the legal rights of the parties?\n\nA. The contract price was $45,000, because the June 3 memo was an effective integration of their agreement.\nB. The contract price was $45,000, because the company did not specifically object to the 10 percent discount stipulated by the owner in his June 3 memo.\nC. The contract price was $50,000 if the discount term in the owner's June 3 memo materially altered the terms of the company's offer.\nD. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The contract price was $50,000 even though the company's offer did not expressly limit acceptance to the terms contained therein. This is because the owner's June 3 memo did not explicitly state that he would accept the terms of the company's offer as written, but rather stated that he would consider the offer and make a decision within a week. Therefore, the contract was not fully integrated until the delivery of the 1,000 propane tanks on June 30, and the owner's refusal to pay more than $45,000 was based on this understanding."
