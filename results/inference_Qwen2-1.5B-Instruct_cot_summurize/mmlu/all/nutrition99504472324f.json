An increased appetite\n\nAn increase in appetite is more commonly observed with aging due to hormonal changes and other factors such as decreased physical activity and stress levels. However, this does not directly relate to an increase in lean body mass or impaired immune function, which can also be expected with older adults. Bone density may decrease slightly with some individuals with advancing age due to osteoporosis, but it's not typically considered part of \"increasing age.\" The reduction in immune function often becomes more pronounced during old age, leading to decreased resistance against infections and diseases."
