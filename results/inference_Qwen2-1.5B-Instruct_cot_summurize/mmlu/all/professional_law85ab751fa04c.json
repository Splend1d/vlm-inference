The law directs the state juvenile court to enter a termination order in such a case after the parent has been afforded notice and an opportunity for a hearing at which the only relevant issues are the age of the child and whether the child has been convicted of a violent crime in the state. Is the state law constitutional?\n\nA. No, because the law is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial state interest.\nB. No, because the law is not necessary to serve a compelling state interest.\nC. Yes, because a state's police power authorizes it to punish criminal behavior with appropriate sanctions.\nD. Yes, because the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n"

The law does not require the termination of parental rights without due process, as required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Additionally, the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest in protecting children from harm. Therefore, the answer is D. Yes, because the law is rationally related to a legitimate state interest."
