This is because with more data points, the spread of the data becomes less significant and the central tendency (average) of the data becomes more accurate. \n\nHowever, when you increase the confidence level from 95% to 99%, the width of the confidence interval will decrease even further, but only up to a point. Beyond this point, increasing the confidence level will not significantly change the width of the confidence interval.\n\nTherefore, if you want to obtain a narrowest confidence interval, it's best to use a larger sample size and maintain a 95% confidence level."
