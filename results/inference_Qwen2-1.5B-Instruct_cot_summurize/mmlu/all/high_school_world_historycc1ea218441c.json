By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\nA. How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\nB. Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\nC. Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\nD. How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion\n"

Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n\nThe passage discusses how European countries, such as France and England, were able to develop advanced weaponry like cannon during the Middle Ages, while China did not have access to similar technology due to its focus on improving horse archer units instead. This suggests that Europe's ability to develop and adopt new technologies led to its eventual military dominance over Asia. Therefore, option B is the best fit for the argument presented in the passage."
