An undercover police officer knocked on the woman's door and told her that he was willing to pay for usable credit cards. When the woman asked if he was a police officer, the officer replied, \"No,\" giving her a false name and saying, \"You can call Harvey \u0080\u0094he'll vouch for me.\" The woman admitted him to her house. After she left the room to call Harvey, the officer lifted some papers off a desk and underneath discovered three credit cards bearing different names. He seized the cards, and when the woman returned, he arrested her. The woman has moved to suppress the evidence seized on the ground that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\n\nA. No, because it was immediately apparent that the cards were stolen.\nB. No, because the woman assumed the risk that the officer would seize items in plain sight.\nC. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer lifted the papers.\nD. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n"

Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit. \n\nThe woman had a reasonable expectation of privacy in her home while there, as her Fourth Amendment rights protected against unreasonable searches and seizures without probable cause or a warrant. In this case, the officer's deception about his true identity and purpose, as well as his actions of lifting papers from the desk, constituted an unreasonable search that violated the woman's expectations of privacy. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to suppress the evidence."
