This is because AVC is the total cost per unit produced and MR is the revenue from selling one more unit. If AVC > MR, it means that producing one more unit will increase the firm's costs without increasing its revenues, which indicates that the firm should continue operating. On the other hand, if AVC < MR, it means that producing one more unit will decrease the firm's costs while increasing its revenues, which indicates that the firm should shut down."
