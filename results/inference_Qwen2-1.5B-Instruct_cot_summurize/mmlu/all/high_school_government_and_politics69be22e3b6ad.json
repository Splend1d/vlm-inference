State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.\n\nThe balance struck by the Supreme Court between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause is often referred to as the Lemon Test, which was established by the Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971). The test requires that a law or practice: (1) neither advances nor inhibits religion; (2) has a secular legislative purpose; and (3) does not result in the government endorcing or disendorsing a particular set of beliefs or religious practices.\n\nUnder this test, state-sponsored prayer at public schools would violate the Establishment Clause because it endorses one religion over others and promotes religion rather than education. However, voluntary prayer by student groups before school is generally allowed under the Free Exercise Clause because it allows individuals to exercise their own religious beliefs without interference from the government."
