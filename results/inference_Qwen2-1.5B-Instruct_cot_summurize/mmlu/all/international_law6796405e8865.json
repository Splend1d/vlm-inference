This can lead to the development of divergent rules, which may conflict with one another, resulting in inconsistencies and difficulties in implementing international agreements and treaties.

It is possible for several legal regimes (such as foreign investment law and human rights law) to exist and develop in isolation of each other, ultimately culminating in the production of divergent rules of international law."
