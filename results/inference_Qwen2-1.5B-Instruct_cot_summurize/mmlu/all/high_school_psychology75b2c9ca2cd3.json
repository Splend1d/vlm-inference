This is known as establishing a cause-and-effect relationship. Manipulating a participant's response to some aspect of a situation can be an effective method for demonstrating this relationship, but it is not enough on its own. The independent and dependent variables need to be manipulated in such a way that they can be directly observed or measured, and the change in the dependent variable should be proportional to the change in the independent variable. Additionally, the study should control for other factors that could influence the outcome and ensure that any differences found are due to the manipulation of the independent variable alone."
