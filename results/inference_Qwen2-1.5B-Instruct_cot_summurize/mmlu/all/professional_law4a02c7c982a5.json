Among the purposes of the statute are the prevention of theft of boats in coastal waters and the protection of the rights of individual boat owners throughout the United States. Congress enacted the statute despite the fact that all states require boat owners to register their craft with the state department of motor vehicles. In addition, there is uncontradicted evidence that most stolen boats are kept or resold in the state in which the theft occurred. Nonetheless, an increasing number of boats are transported to other states and other countries for resale. Is the statute likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because most stolen boats remain within the state in which they were stolen.\nB. No, because the registration of boats is a matter reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment.\nC. Yes, because Congress could determine that the transportation of stolen boats affects interstate commerce.\nD. Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Yes, because Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reserves certain powers to the states, including regulation of property. However, the Supreme Court has established that Congress may regulate property if it does so \"for the general welfare.\" The regulation of property for the general welfare includes activities that affect interstate commerce, such as the transportation of goods across state lines.\n\nIn this case, Congress has determined that transporting stolen boats across state lines affects interstate commerce and therefore has the authority to enact a law regulating the registration of boats with the federal government. This is consistent with the principle that Congress has the power to regulate property for the general welfare, even when those properties are subject to state regulation. Therefore, the statute is likely to be held constitutional."
