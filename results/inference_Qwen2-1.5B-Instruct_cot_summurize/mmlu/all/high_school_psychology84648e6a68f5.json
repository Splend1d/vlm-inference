The mention of early family relationships suggests that this approach may also include exploring the impact of past experiences or relationships on the individual's mental health. However, it is not explicitly labeled as such in the options provided. The other options, while relevant to certain aspects of treatment for anorexia nervosa, do not fully capture the specific focus on the role of psychological factors in the disorder. Therefore, the closest match is likely B. biological, although some elements of psychodynamic theory (such as the idea that early life events can shape personality) might also be present in this context."
