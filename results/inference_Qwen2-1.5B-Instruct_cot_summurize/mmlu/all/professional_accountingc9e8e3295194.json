Whether the board of directors, audit committee, or owner-manager oversees employment decisions related to the internal auditor.\n\nAn external auditor should obtain updated information about the internal auditor's competence by ensuring that the organization has clear policies in place regarding employment decisions related to the internal auditor, including whether these decisions are made by the board of directors, the audit committee, or the owner-manager. This ensures that the internal auditor is not biased or conflicted due to their relationship with the organization or any of its employees. Additionally, it helps to maintain transparency and accountability in the selection and evaluation process for internal auditors."
