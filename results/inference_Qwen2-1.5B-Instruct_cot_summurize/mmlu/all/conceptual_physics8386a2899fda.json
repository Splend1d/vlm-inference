However, the atomic mass of the element remains unchanged. This is because the mass of an atom is determined primarily by its protons and neutrons, not its electrons or other particles. The atomic number, on the other hand, is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus, which does not change with the loss of protons and neutrons. Therefore, when an element ejects an alpha particle, its atomic number increases by 2."
