Expected future inflation.\n\nWhen there is an expectation of future inflation, people may hold onto their money or deposit it into banks rather than spend it immediately. This increases the money supply and can lead to a rise in prices as well. \n\nHowever, if there is no real increase in the overall demand for money (e.g., because of economic growth), then the increase in the money supply will not necessarily lead to any change in prices or output levels. In this case, the increase in the money supply would be purely artificial and unsustainable over the long term."
