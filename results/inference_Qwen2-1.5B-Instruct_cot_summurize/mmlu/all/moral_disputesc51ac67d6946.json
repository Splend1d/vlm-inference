Instead, we should focus on specific instances where we may be faced with difficult ethical decisions. If we were to appeal to the idea that humans have a higher moral status than animals because they possess rationality, this would be a form of the argument from marginal cases.\n\nHowever, if we were to argue that such a difference in moral status is morally relevant for the status of animals as moral patients rather than their status as moral agents, we would need to provide evidence that supports this claim. This evidence could come from empirical research on animal behavior, cognitive abilities, and emotional intelligence, among other factors. Without such evidence, it would be difficult to make the case that humans have a higher moral status than animals based solely on rationality.\n\nTherefore, option C (both A and B) accurately describes the potential challenges associated with attempting to justify the claim that humans have a higher moral status than animals by appealing to rationality."
