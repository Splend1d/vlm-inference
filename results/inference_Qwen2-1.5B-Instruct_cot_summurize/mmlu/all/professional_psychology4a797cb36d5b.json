This discomfort can lead to a desire to reduce this conflict, which may cause them to engage in behavior that contradicts their beliefs.\n\nIn forced compliance situations, where someone is compelled to act against their own beliefs, the theory of cognitive dissonance predicts that there will be an increased likelihood of change in their beliefs as they try to reconcile their actions with their existing beliefs. Therefore, option B (when compliance is accompanied by a large reward) is correct. \n\nIt's important to note that the theory of cognitive dissonance does not necessarily apply to all types of compliance situations, and it's also influenced by other factors such as individual personality traits and social norms."
