They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S. Truman, 1947\nThe passage above is part of President Truman's argument to Congress in favor of\n\nA. the Servicemen's Readjustment Act (G.I.

The passage suggests that he believes that the Congress should provide assistance to those who have suffered from years of suffering and struggle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. an extension of aid to Greece and Turkey. This option aligns with the overall message of the passage, which emphasizes the importance of providing support to those who have been affected by adversity."
