With a seating capacity of 1,500, it is customarily leased for rock concerts, rodeos, sporting events, fashion shows, etc. In January, a rock star held a week-long concert there, drawing a full house each night. Generally, the city leases the auditorium's facilities for a charge of $2,000 per day. In February, a religious sect applied to rent the auditorium for its annual celebration. However, the city council voted 7 to 3 against permitting the group from using the auditorium. When their rental application was denied, the religious sect threatened to take legal action against the city council. They contended unfair discrimination inasmuch as other religious organizations had leased the auditorium in previous months for their religious gatherings. Amid this controversy, the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the rental of the auditorium to any religious group. The ordinance was passed in a \"closed door\" session, which did not permit any debate or hearings on the matter. Is this newly enacted city ordinance likely to be held constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it violates the due process rights of religious groups by not affording them an opportunity for a hearing.\nB. No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC. Yes, because the ordinance treats all religious groups equally.\nD. Yes, because a city ordinance is not a state action, per Se, and, therefore, is not subject to the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\nThe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment provides that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, or to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. This clause applies to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits states from denying equal protection under the law.\n\nIn the case at hand, the city council's ordinance discriminates against religious groups by prohibiting their use of the auditorium for religious purposes. This is in violation of the Free Exercise Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the city ordinance is likely to be held unconstitutional."
