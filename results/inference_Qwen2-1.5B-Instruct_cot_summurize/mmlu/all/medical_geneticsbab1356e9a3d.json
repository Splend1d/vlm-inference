Transmitted by males only to females.\n\nIn X-linked dominant inheritance, the affected gene is located on the sex chromosome (in this case, the X chromosome). The male receives one copy of the normal X chromosome from his mother and two copies of the affected X chromosome from his father. Since he has two copies of the affected X chromosome, he will express the recessive trait even if he does not have any of the mutated genes himself. \n\nTherefore, in X-linked dominant inheritance, the affected gene is transmitted by males only to females. This means that a woman can inherit the affected gene from her father or grandfather, but she cannot inherit it from her mother or grandmother."
