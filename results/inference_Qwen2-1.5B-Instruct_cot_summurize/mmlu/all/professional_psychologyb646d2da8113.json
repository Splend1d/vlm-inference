This is because motor functions such as grip strength, dexterity, and coordination can be measured using standardized tests that assess both speed and strength.\n\nIt's important to note that while intelligence plays a role in many aspects of motor function, it does not explain all variability in these tasks. Additionally, motor function may also be influenced by other factors such as muscle tone, sensory input, and environmental factors.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect as it suggests that most motor functions are well represented by intelligence, which is not supported by the evidence from factor analysis studies. Option D is also incorrect as it suggests that most motor functions are highly specific, but this is not always true. Some tasks, such as fine motor skills, may show more specificity than others."
