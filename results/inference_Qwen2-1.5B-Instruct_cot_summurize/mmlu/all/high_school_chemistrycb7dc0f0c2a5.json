Therefore, if \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S < 0, then \u0394G will also be positive because it involves a decrease in the system's entropic contribution to its surroundings.\n\nThis means that the overall process is exothermic and endothermic, which implies that the reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions. However, when the temperature is increased, the reaction can become spontaneous due to an increase in entropy. This is because at higher temperatures, the system gains more thermal energy, causing an increase in the entropy of the surroundings and thus increasing the spontaneity of the reaction. Therefore, \u0394G > 0 indicates that the reaction is endothermic, and \u0394H > 0 indicates that the reaction is exothermic."
