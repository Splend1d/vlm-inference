As people age, they may experience fewer new and exciting events in their lives compared to younger individuals, which can make time seem to pass more quickly. This is because novelty provides a sense of excitement and anticipation, which helps to fill up our time and make it feel more meaningful. When we have fewer novel experiences, we may find ourselves feeling more bored or unfulfilled, which can also contribute to a perception of time passing faster."
