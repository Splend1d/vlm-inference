When the demand curve shifts to the right and the supply curve shifts to the left, it leads to an increase in the quantity demanded and an increase in the quantity supplied, which results in a decrease in the equilibrium price.\n\nOption A, B, and C do not necessarily lead to a decrease in the equilibrium price. Option A may result in an increase in the equilibrium price due to a shift to the right of the demand curve. Option B may also result in an increase in the equilibrium price due to a shift to the left of the supply curve. Option C could potentially result in both an increase in the equilibrium price and a decrease in the quantity supplied if the quantity demanded shifts to the left as well. However, this would require that the change in the quantity demanded caused by the shift on the demand side exactly balances out the change in the quantity supplied caused by the shift on the supply side. Without more information about the specific circumstances, it's difficult to determine whether option C will lead to a decrease or increase in the equilibrium price."
