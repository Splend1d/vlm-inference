Corona.\n\nDuring a total solar eclipse, the Moon blocks most of the sun's light and only a small amount reaches Earth. This small amount of sunlight passes through the corona, which is a layer of gas and plasma surrounding the Sun. The corona can be seen as a bright, colorful glow around the Moon during a total solar eclipse."
