On August 1,2005, Ann sells to Hunter and Willa, a husband and wife, an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by Hunter). The deed to Hunter and Willa reads as follows: \"To Hunger and Willa and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. \"On August 1, 2006, Ann sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to Hunter and Brandon, his brother, for $125,000 (Hunter pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and Brandon pays the balance). The deed to Hunter and Brandon provides: \"To Hunter and Brandon and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. \"On August 1, 2007, Hunter, Willa, and Brandon die in a common disaster, and as a consequence, the order of their deaths cannot be established by proof. Hunter's will and Willa's will devise whatever interest in the land in question that is subject to disposition by their wills to their son.

An undivided one-half interest in the land.\n\nWhen a person dies intestate (without a will), their property is distributed according to certain rules established by law. In this case, the property is divided among the surviving spouse or children, if any, and then any remaining property goes to the state under the laws of intestate succession.\n\nIn this scenario, since Hunter, Willa, and Brandon all died together without a will, they were considered to have died intestate. Therefore, the land would go to Hunter's son, who is listed as the heir in the will of both Hunter and Willa. This means that Hunter's son would own an undivided one-half interest in the land.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that Hunter's son would inherit an undivided one-third interest in the land. \n\nOption B is also incorrect because it suggests that Hunter's son would inherit an undivided one-quarter interest in the land. \n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that Hunter's son would inherit an undivided three-quarters interest in the land."
