Given that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]/\\gcd(a,b) = 33$, we can substitute $a=45$ into this equation to get $ab/\\gcd(a,b) = 33$, or $45 \\cdot b/\\gcd(45,b) = 33$. Simplifying gives us $b/\\gcd(45,b) = 33/45 = 11/5$. This means that $\\gcd(45,b)$ must be such that when you divide it by $11/5$, you get an integer (since the denominator of the fraction on the left is less than 1). The only number in our options that satisfies this condition is $5$. Therefore, $\\gcd(45,b) = 5$. Since $45$ is divisible by $5$, the other number must also be divisible by $5$. The smallest such number is $5*2 = 10$. So, the answer is $\\boxed{10}$. However, since we're asked for the smallest possible value of the other integer, we need to check if there's another option that fits the criteria. If we try $45*2 = 90$, then $\\gcd(90,5) = 5$, so the other number must also be divisible by $5$. The smallest such number is $5*2 = 10$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of the other integer is $\\boxed{10}$.\nThe answer is: $10$"
