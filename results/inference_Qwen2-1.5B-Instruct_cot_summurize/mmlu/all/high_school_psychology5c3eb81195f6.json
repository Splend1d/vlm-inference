Sand is essentially just rock, and the minerals in it do not undergo chemical reactions with our taste buds.\nSimilarly, we cannot smell platinum because it has no volatile organic compounds that can be detected by our sense of smell. Platinum is a very pure metal, and its molecules are too small to be detectable at room temperature and pressure.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. they are not chemicals."
