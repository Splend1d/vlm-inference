This can be influenced by many factors, including changes in technology and consumer culture, shifts in family structures and parenting styles, and developments in society that impact the way we interact with others.\n\nFor example, the widespread availability of television and other media has transformed how children view themselves and their world, and this has shaped our ideas about what constitutes \"normal\" behavior and what is appropriate for them to do at different ages. Similarly, advances in medicine and medical care have impacted our understanding of childhood, as well as our attitudes towards aging and death.\n\nIn summary, the social construction of childhood is a complex process that is shaped by a variety of factors over time, and these factors continue to evolve as society changes."
