Reparation includes restitution, compensation, and satisfaction, either alone or alongside other forms of reparation\n\nThe obligation of reparation in international law refers to the duty of states to make good any harm caused by their actions or omissions. This can include both financial compensation (pecuniary compensation) and non-financial measures such as physical restoration or satisfaction.\n\nIn some cases, the obligation of reparation may be limited to monetary compensation, but it's important to note that this is not always the case. There may also be instances where the state is required to restore something to its original condition or perform another action, such as providing an apology or acknowledging the harm caused.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct."
