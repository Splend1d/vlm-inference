Transnational crime developed as a result of the declining expenditure on defence and the standing down of armies, which reduced the risk of activities.\nB. TNC as a concept emerged in the academic sphere as linked to human security concerns and developmental opportunities in weak states as a means of conflict resolution and peace building in Europe.\nC. Transnational criminal activities have always been a feature of the international system. In the policy community, the growth of interest in TNC is due to the increasing sophistication of intelligence and communications technology, which has enabled the true representation of the scale and the scope of the problem to be known.\nD. International trends such as globalization may have had the unintentional consequence of opening up new spaces for the development of transnational crime.\n"

This integration can create new opportunities for criminals to operate across borders, as they can move freely between countries without being detected or apprehended. Additionally, globalization can lead to the emergence of new markets and economic opportunities that are attractive to criminals seeking to exploit them.\n\nFurthermore, globalization can also facilitate the spread of information and communication technologies (ICTs), which can enable criminals to communicate and coordinate more effectively, making it easier for them to plan and execute crimes across borders. The ability to access vast amounts of data and information, including personal details about individuals, can also provide criminals with valuable insights into potential targets and vulnerabilities.\n\nIn summary, the expansion of transnational crime in the 1990s was facilitated by the globalized economy, which created new opportunities for criminals to operate across borders, as well as the advancement of ICTs that made coordination and planning more efficient."
