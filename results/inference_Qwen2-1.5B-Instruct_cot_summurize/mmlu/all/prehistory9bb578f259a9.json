The researchers found that individuals who were able to create tools using specific techniques showed better performance on tasks that required them to understand complex grammatical structures.\n\nThese findings suggest that the skill of tool-making may have been an important factor in the evolution of language, as it required coordination and collaboration among multiple individuals, which is characteristic of cooperative social behaviors.\n\nTherefore, option A (connections made in tool making prepared the brain for the production and use of language) is the most likely explanation for why the hypothesis was developed."
