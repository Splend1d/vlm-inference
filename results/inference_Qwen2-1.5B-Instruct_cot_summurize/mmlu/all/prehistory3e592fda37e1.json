Anthropology is holistic and integrative in its approach.\n\nAnthropology is a social science that focuses on the study of human cultures, societies, and their development over time. It involves an interdisciplinary approach that combines methods from various fields such as biology, psychology, linguistics, and archaeology to understand how humans interact with their environment and each other. Anthropologists use a variety of research methods, including fieldwork, interviews, and analysis of cultural artifacts, to gather data about different societies and cultures around the world. This holistic and integrative approach allows anthropologists to study complex systems at multiple levels of organization, from individual behaviors to larger societal structures."
