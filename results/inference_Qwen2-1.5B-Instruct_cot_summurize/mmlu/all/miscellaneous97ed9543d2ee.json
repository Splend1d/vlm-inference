This is because storing meat above this temperature can cause it to spoil more quickly. However, many people mistakenly believe that keeping meat frozen at 0\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) will keep it fresh indefinitely. In fact, this is not true; freezing at 0\u00b0F can actually cause the meat to become dry and tough. Therefore, it is important to store meat in the freezer at an appropriate temperature to ensure its freshness and safety."
