The distance between the rover and the rock can be calculated using the formula:\n\ndistance = angle * radius\n\nwhere angle is the angular size in radians (in this case, 0.5 degrees) and radius is the radius of the Earth.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the angle into radians by multiplying it by pi/180:\n\nangle = 0.5 * (pi/180) = 0.0027745 radians\n\nNext, we can calculate the radius of the Earth using the average radius of the Earth:\n\nradius = 6371\u5343\u7c73 / 180\u5ea6 = 3951.033\u7c73\n\nFinally, we can calculate the distance using the formula:\n\ndistance = angle * radius = 0.0027745 * 3951.033 \u2248 10.72 \u7c73\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. About 10 meters."
