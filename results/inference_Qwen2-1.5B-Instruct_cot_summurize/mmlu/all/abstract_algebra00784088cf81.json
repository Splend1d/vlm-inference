Therefore, |aH| must be equal to |Ha| for any element a in G that generates H.\nStatement 2 is false because it doesn't necessarily mean that aH and Hb are identical or disjoint. For example, consider the cyclic group Z/6Z under addition, where the subgroup H = {0, 3} generated by 3 has order 2, but the sets aH = {0, 3} and Hb = {0, 3} for all elements a in Z/6Z do not have the same size (since 3^4 = 81=0 mod 6), and they are not disjoint either since 0 \u2208 H \u2229 aH."
