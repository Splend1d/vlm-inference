The protein requirement can be less than the demand.\n\nThe protein requirement refers to the amount of protein that the body needs to maintain or repair tissues and organs, while the demand for protein is influenced by factors such as physical activity level, age, gender, and specific health conditions. Efficiency of utilization refers to how effectively the body uses the available protein resources, which can vary depending on these factors. Therefore, the protein requirement may not necessarily be equal to the demand multiplied by the efficiency of utilization."
