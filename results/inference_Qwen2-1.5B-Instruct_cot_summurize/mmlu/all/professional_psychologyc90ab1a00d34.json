The Premack Principle states that when introducing a new behavior into an animal's environment, it should be accompanied by a generalization of a previously existing behavior that is associated with the reinforcement. This means that the new behavior will be reinforced in conjunction with the existing behavior that has already been generalized. Therefore, the reinforcer used to modify the behavior would need to be something that is already associated with the desired behavior and can be generalized. A generalized conditioned reinforcer would be the most appropriate choice as it is a type of reinforcer that can naturally elicit the desired behavior through association with other behaviors."
