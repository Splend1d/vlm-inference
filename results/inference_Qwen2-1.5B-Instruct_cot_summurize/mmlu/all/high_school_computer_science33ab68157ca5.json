(age \u2265 16) AND (age \u2264 18)\n\nThis expression checks that the person's age is between 16 and 18, inclusive. This condition is satisfied for ages 16 through 15, so it always evaluates to True.\n\nII. (age \u2265 16) AND (NOT(age \u2265 18))\n\nThis expression checks that the person is either 16 or younger or older than 18. Since age cannot be both 16 and older than 18 at the same time, this condition is always False because there is no overlap with the first condition.\n\nIII. (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16))\n\nThis expression checks that the person is younger than 18, but not younger than 16. However, since age cannot be less than 16, this condition is always False because there is no overlap with the second condition.\n\nTherefore, the expressions that evaluate to True are:\n\n- I: Always True\n\nThe expressions that evaluate to False are:\n\n- II: Always False\n- III: Always False\n\nNone of the options provided match all three conditions simultaneously. Therefore, none of them are correct.\n\nHowever, let's consider option B. It includes both conditions from question I, \"age \u2265 16\" and \"age \u2264 18\", and does not include the additional condition in question III, \"age < 16\". So, when evaluated against the two conditions, option B correctly evaluates to True for ages 16 through 15, while it evaluates to False for any other age. \n\nHence, the correct answer is **B**."
