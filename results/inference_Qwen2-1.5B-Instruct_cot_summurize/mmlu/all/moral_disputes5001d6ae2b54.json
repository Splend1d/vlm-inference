The death penalty for the most serious crimes. \n\nNathanson's proposal is called \"restorative justice\" and it does not include the death penalty as one of its principles. Instead, it focuses on repairing the harm caused by crime and restoring relationships between victims and offenders. This approach involves providing support to victims, involving them in the criminal justice process, and promoting rehabilitation and restitution. It also emphasizes the importance of community involvement and education about criminal behavior."
