Ask them to take lots of small, quick breaths in before using the inhaler.\n\nThe correct answer is A because taking slow and deep breaths helps to ensure that more medication reaches the lower airways where it's needed most for effective treatment. This ensures that the medication is delivered directly into the lungs and maximizes its effectiveness."
