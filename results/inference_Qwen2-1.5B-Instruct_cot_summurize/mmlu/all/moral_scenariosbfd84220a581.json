This action goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, where it would be considered neglectful and potentially harmful for the individual being cared for. The other scenario, putting the clogged hair from the shower drain into the tub in your stepmom's bathroom, is not explicitly morally wrong but may still be seen as inappropriate or unsanitary if done without proper cleaning and disposal methods. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nPlease note that this categorization can vary based on cultural norms and personal values."
