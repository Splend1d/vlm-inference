M = 10, m = 1.\n\nHere's why:\n\nIn order for a graph to have exactly 6 edges without self-loops and an upper bound on the number of edges connecting each pair of nodes, it must satisfy the following conditions:\n- It can't have more than 5 edges because that would require at least 2 disconnected components (each with at least 3 nodes).\n- It can't have less than 6 edges because that would mean there were fewer than 5 edges or more than 4 edges connecting each pair of nodes.\n- It can't have more than 10 disconnected components because that would mean it had at least 6 edges but couldn't connect every pair of nodes without self-loops.\n\nTherefore, the only possible graph that satisfies these conditions is a complete graph with 10 vertices, which means it has exactly 6 edges and has exactly 1 disconnected component. This means that M = 6 and m = 1."
