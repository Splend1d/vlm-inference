Coherence refers to the ability of an artistic work to create a unified and coherent whole, which can include elements such as structure, style, form, and content that come together in a way that enhances the overall impact or message of the work. This can be seen in works of literature, music, film, and other forms of visual and performing arts where different elements are brought together in a cohesive manner to create a complete and meaningful experience for the viewer or listener."
