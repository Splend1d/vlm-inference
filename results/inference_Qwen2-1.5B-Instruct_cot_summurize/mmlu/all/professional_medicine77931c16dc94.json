This is because TNF\u03b1 plays a crucial role in inflammation and can cause damage to joints in ankylosing spondylitis. Sulfasalazine is a prodrug that converts to indomethacin, which is an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase enzymes and thus reduces inflammation. However, it does not specifically target TNF\u03b1."
