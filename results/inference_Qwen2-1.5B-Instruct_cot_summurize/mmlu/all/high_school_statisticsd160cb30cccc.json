The significance level (\u03b1), or alpha, is the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nGiven that the population mean \u03bc is 65, we want to find the value of n such that the power of the test is maximized given the given significance level and sample size.\n\nLet's calculate the power for each option:\n\nA. \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 15\n\nPower = 1 - [P(Reject H0 | H0 is True)] = 1 - [P(Z > (\u03bc - \u03bc0)/\u03c3)] = 1 - [P(Z > (65 - 70)/5)] = 1 - [P(Z > -2)] = 1 - [P(Z < 2)] \u2248 0.842\n\nB. \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 15\n\nPower = 1 - [P(Reject H0 | H0 is True)] = 1 - [P(Z > (\u03bc - \u03bc0)/\u03c3)] = 1 - [P(Z > (65 - 70)/5)] = 1 - [P(Z > -2)] = 1 - [P(Z < 2)] \u2248 0.903\n\nC. \u03b1 = 0.05, n = 30\n\nPower = 1 - [P(Reject H0 | H0 is True)] = 1 - [P(Z > (\u03bc - \u03bc0)/\u03c3)] = 1 - [P(Z > (65 - 70)/5)] = 1 - [P(Z > -2)] = 1 - [P(Z < 2)] \u2248 0.842\n\nD. \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 30\n\nPower = 1 - [P(Reject H0 | H0 is True)] = 1 - [P(Z > (\u03bc - \u03bc0)/\u03c3)] = 1 - [P(Z > (65 - 70)/5)] = 1 - [P(Z > -2)] = 1 - [P(Z < 2)] \u2248 0.903\n\nFrom these calculations, we can see that the highest power occurs when the sample size is 30, which corresponds to choice D. Therefore, the correct answer is D. \u03b1 = 0.01, n = 30."
