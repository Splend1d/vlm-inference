The aid is in the form of annual subsidies to qualified institutions. The grants are non-categorical but may not, under an added provision, be utilized by the institutions for sectarian purposes. A state agency determines the eligibility of applicant institutions. Eight state taxpayers, all avowed atheists, bring suit in federal court to enjoin the payments of subsidies under the statute to all church-affiliated institutions in the state. The federal district court will most likely\n\nA. dismiss the action for lack of standing.\nB. uphold the validity of the statute as nonviolative of the establishment clause.\nC. invalidate the statute as violative of the establishment clause.\nD. uphold the validity of the statute as a valid exercise of the state's power to subsidize education.\n"

It provides financial assistance to qualified institutions that do not discriminate against students based on their religion. Therefore, the statute does not promote or endorse religion, which is what the Establishment Clause prohibits."
