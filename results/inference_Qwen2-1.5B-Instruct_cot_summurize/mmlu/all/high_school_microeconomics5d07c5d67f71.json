This is known as the law of increasing costs. It means that the marginal cost of producing one more unit of a good increases with each additional unit produced, leading to higher prices for the good.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe the law of increasing costs:\n\n- A. Does not apply to guns and butter: The law of increasing costs applies to all types of goods, including both luxury items like guns and butter, and basic necessities like food and clothing.\n- B. Is the result of resources not being perfectly adaptable between the production of two goods: While it's true that the law of increasing costs can arise from factors such as scarcity or fixed input constraints, this statement doesn't fully capture its implications.\n- D. Causes the production possibilities frontier to be a straight line: The law of increasing costs does not necessarily cause the production possibilities frontier to be a straight line; instead, it can lead to shifts along the frontier due to changes in technology or demand."
