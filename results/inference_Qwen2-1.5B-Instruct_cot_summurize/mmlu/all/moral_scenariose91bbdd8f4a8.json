It also goes against the principle of treating others with respect and consideration.\nScenario 2: Helping someone with their academic work, such as taking a test for them, is generally seen as a kind and helpful act. However, this scenario is not inherently wrong, but rather depends on the context and intentions behind the help. If the person being helped genuinely benefits from the assistance, then it may be seen as a positive outcome. On the other hand, if the help was given solely out of selfish motives or to gain personal advantage, then it could be seen as morally wrong.\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the answer would be:\n\nB.
