The man said out loud, \"Oh God, look what that truck driver did. The man driving that truck was racing and going about 100 mph.! Someone call 911!!\" A woman, who was sitting on the beach nearby, but facing the other way, heard the man's outcry. When the case comes to trial, will the court allow both the man and the woman to testify about the man's utterances?\n\nA. Yes, both the woman and the man can testify because it is an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule that goes to the material issue of the case.\nB. Yes, because this is not hearsay and it is not being entered for the truth of the statement by either witness so that they can both testify.\nC. No, neither of them can testify because the man was impaired due to being too relaxed from his meditation, and the woman cannot repeat the utterances of an impaired witness.\nD. No, neither can testify because the utterances do not fit any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n"

Yes, because this is not hearsay and it is not being entered for the truth of the statement by either witness so that they can both testify.\n\nIn this scenario, the man's utterances were made spontaneously and without any prompting or influence from others. They were not intended to be recorded or used as evidence against the defendant. Therefore, they fall under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, which allows declarants to testify about statements they make during the time immediately preceding their arrest or conviction if the statements were made voluntarily and without any suggestion or pressure from others.\n\nAdditionally, the woman's testimony would also be admissible as she overheard the man's utterances while sitting nearby. Overhearing someone else's spontaneous speech does not automatically disqualify a person from testifying about that speech. In fact, it can be considered a powerful piece of evidence if the testimony is relevant to the case.\n\nTherefore, both the man and the woman can testify about the man's utterances, making option B the correct answer."
