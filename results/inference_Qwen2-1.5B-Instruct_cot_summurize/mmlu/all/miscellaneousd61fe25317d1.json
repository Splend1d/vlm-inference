The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment. Zora Neale Hurston is associated with which of the following literary movements?\n\nA. New England Puritanism\nB. Transcendentalism\nC. Naturalism\nD. Harlem Renaissance\n"

This scene is part of Hurston's novel, which explores themes of black identity, cultural traditions, and social norms.\n\nBased on the description of this scene, it is clear that Hurston's work falls under the category of African American literature, specifically the Harlem Renaissance. The Harlem Renaissance was a period of great artistic and intellectual activity in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, characterized by an emphasis on African American culture and the celebration of Black experience.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Harlem Renaissance."
