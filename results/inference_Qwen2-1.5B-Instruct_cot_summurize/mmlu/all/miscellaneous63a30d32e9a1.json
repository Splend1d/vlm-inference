Total revenue will not change.\n\nIf the price of a product with an inelastic demand increases, this means that consumers are less sensitive to changes in price and are less likely to purchase the product at the higher price point. As a result, the quantity demanded of the product will remain relatively constant or may even decrease slightly (due to decreased affordability).\n\nSince the quantity demanded remains unchanged, total revenue generated from selling the product will also remain unchanged. This is because the additional revenue earned by selling more units of the product than initially planned is offset by the lower sales volume due to the reduced quantity demanded. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
