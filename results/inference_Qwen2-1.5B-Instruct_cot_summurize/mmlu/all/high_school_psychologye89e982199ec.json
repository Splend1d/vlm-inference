Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) can cause symptoms such as depression, fatigue, and changes in sleep patterns during certain times of the year. Insomnia may occur due to stress or other medical conditions but does not directly relate to an increased risk of losing interest in activities like gardening and bridge. Major depressive disorder is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and lack of interest in daily activities, which could explain Odette's symptoms."
