Her medications include occasional ibuprofen for mild osteoarthritis of both knees. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/79 mm Hg. Examination of the right knee shows warmth, erythema, and effusion. Exquisite tenderness is produced with minimal range-of-motion testing. Examination of synovial fluid obtained via joint aspiration shows that it is clear, with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. Deposition of which of the following substances is the most likely cause of these findings?\n\nA. Ammonium urate\nB. Calcium oxalate\nC. Calcium pyrophosphate\nD. Calcium urate\n"

This is because calcium pyrophosphate crystals can form in the synovial fluid surrounding the joints, leading to effusions and inflammation. The presence of birefringent rhomboids, which are structures that appear as two-dimensional lines when viewed through polarized light, suggests that the crystals are negatively charged and may be more easily seen under this condition. It is important to note that this diagnosis should be confirmed by further laboratory tests such as X-ray imaging or electron microscopy."
