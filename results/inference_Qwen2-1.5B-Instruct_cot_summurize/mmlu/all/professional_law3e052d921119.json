Sally has an adult conviction for vehicular homicide. She was charged with driving a car in a reckless manner resulting in the death of her sister, a passenger in the car. Sally pleaded nolo contendere, was adjudicated guilty and received a suspended sentence although she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years. At trial, evidence of this conviction is\n\nA. admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.\nB. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.\nC. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.\nD. inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.\n"

Since she is testifying about events that occurred in the past, it would be relevant to ask whether or not she has ever been convicted of vehicular homicide. If she has, then her past conviction can be used to impeach her credibility as a witness by showing that she may not have acted responsibly in the past. This would also help establish that she is not someone who would easily fall for extortion tactics. Therefore, the answer is A. admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year."
