All of the above.\n\nIn the context of moral philosophy, a prima facie duty refers to a duty that seems morally obligatory at first glance but may not be fully justified or compelling upon closer examination. In the case of expanding Ross's list of prima facie duties to include veracity, enhancement and preservation of freedom, and respectfulness, it can be argued that these values align with the principles of honesty, justice, and compassion respectively, which are also fundamental to ethical behavior in society. Therefore, they can be considered as prima facie duties that seem morally obligatory at first glance."
