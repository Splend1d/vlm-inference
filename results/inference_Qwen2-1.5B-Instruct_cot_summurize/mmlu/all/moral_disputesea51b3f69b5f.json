All of the above.\n\nAccording to Dershowitz, there are several views on whether or not it is appropriate to use torture in certain circumstances:\n\n1. The \"ticking bomb\" argument: This suggests that torture may sometimes be necessary if it can prevent a potentially catastrophic harm (such as an explosion).\n\n2. The \"off-the-books\" argument: This suggests that public officials should not be allowed to engage in illegal actions outside of their official duties and responsibilities.\n\n3. The \"torture warrants\" argument: This suggests that governments should have the ability to justify using torture by providing evidence that it is necessary to prevent serious harm or danger.\n\nTherefore, Dershowitz argues that all of these views are valid arguments against the use of torture."
