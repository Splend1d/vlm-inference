During metaphase, the chromosomes align at the equator of the cell. In anaphase, the centromeres separate and the spindle fibers attach to the chromosomes. In telophase, the cell separates into two daughter cells by cytokinesis. Finally, in metaphase, the chromosomes align at the equator again before cytokinesis occurs."
