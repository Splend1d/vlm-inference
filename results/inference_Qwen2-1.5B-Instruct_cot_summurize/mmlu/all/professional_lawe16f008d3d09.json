The judge must appoint Defendant a lawyer. \n\nUnder California law, an individual accused of a crime has the right to an attorney appointed by the court if they cannot afford one. This includes individuals who are indigent (poor). In this case, the judge determined that Defendant was indigent and therefore had the right to an attorney appointed by the court.\n\nIt is important to note that the judge's decision to appoint an attorney does not depend on whether the State subsequently charges Defendant by information or whether the judge states in writing that Defendant will not go to jail for more than six months if convicted. These factors may influence the judge's decision, but ultimately, the judge must decide based solely on the individual's ability to pay for an attorney."
