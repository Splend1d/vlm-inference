This happens when both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are equal to some value. Since \\(x\\) can range from 0 to 3 and \\(y\\) from 0 to 4, there are 4 points where \\(x=y\\):\n\n- For \\(x=0\\): There is only one point \\(y=0\\).\n- For \\(x=1\\): There are two points \\(y=0\\) and \\(y=1\\).\n- For \\(x=2\\): There are three points \\(y=0\\), \\(y=1\\), and \\(y=2\\).\n- For \\(x=3\\): There are four points \\(y=0\\), \\(y=1\\), \\(y=2\\), and \\(y=3\\).\n\nThus, there are a total of \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\) points where \\(x=y\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that \\(x<y\\) is the ratio of the area where \\(x<y\\) to the total area:\n\n\\[P(x<y) = \\frac{Area\\ where\\ x<y}{Total\\ Area} = \\frac{24 - 10}{24} = \\frac{14}{24} = \\frac{7}{12}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. 7/12**."
