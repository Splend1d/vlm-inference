The trapped hook caused her to cough blood uncontrollably, and she was rushed to a hospital for emergency surgery. The restaurant later defended the customer's lawsuit by showing that it had done everything reasonable to eliminate foreign objects from its product and there was no negligence. Will the lawsuit be dismissed and judgment entered for the restaurant?\n\nA. No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.\nB. Yes, because a customer voluntarily assumes the foreseeable risk that fish will contain metal fish hooks.\nC. Yes, because customers are expected to know that a fish sandwich will often have foreign objects in it.\nD. No, because the seller did not post a warning that its fish might contain fish hooks.\n"

No, because even without negligence there is strict liability imposed for selling an unreasonably dangerous product.\n\nStrict liability is a legal doctrine that holds parties responsible for their actions or omissions if they cause harm to others without any intention to do so. In this case, the restaurant has been held liable for selling a product that contained a foreign object that posed a significant risk of causing harm to the customer. While the restaurant may have taken reasonable steps to prevent foreign objects from entering the product, the fact remains that such objects could still pose a risk to consumers. Therefore, even if the restaurant acted reasonably, it would still be considered negligent under the law."
