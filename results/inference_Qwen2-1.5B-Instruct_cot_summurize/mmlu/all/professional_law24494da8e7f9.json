                    "text": "A police officer was employed on a city's police force for 10 years. When the officer accepted the job, the city's employee benefit plan provided a death benefit to the spouse of any employee who died as a result of any job-related injury. Last year, the city amended its employee benefit plan to deny its death benefit in cases where the death \"was caused by the employee's refusal to accept, for any reason other than its excessive risk to life or health, reasonably available medical care prescribed by a physician.\" After this amendment took effect, the officer was shot while on duty. Because of a sincerely held religious belief, the officer refused to allow a prescribed blood transfusion and, as a result, died from loss of blood. When the officer's spouse applied for the death benefit, the city denied the application on the basis of the amendment to the employee benefit plan. The officer's spouse has challenged the amendment, claiming that, as applied to the officer, it violated the officer's constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. Is the court likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer?\n\nA. No, because it effectively discriminates against a religious practice.\nB. No, because it violates the vested contractual rights of city employees who were hired before the amendment took effect.\nC. Yes, because it does not single out religious reasons for the denial of benefits and is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits.\nD. Yes, because it imposes a condition only on the award of a government benefit and does not impose a penalty on an individual's conduct.\n"

                    "text": "The court is more likely to find the amendment to the employee benefit plan constitutional as applied to the officer under option C.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe amendment restricts the death benefit only if the death was caused by the employee's refusal to accept, for any reason other than its excessive risk to life or health, reasonably available medical care prescribed by a physician. This means that the amendment is a reasonable limitation on the award of such benefits, particularly when considering the circumstances surrounding the officer's death.\n\nOption A states that the amendment discriminates against a religious practice, which is incorrect because the amendment applies equally to all employees regardless of their religious beliefs. Option B states that the amendment violates the vested contractual rights of city employees, which is also incorrect because the amendment affects only the award of benefits rather than the terms of employment. Option D suggests that the amendment imposes a penalty on an individual's conduct, which is not correct either since the amendment is designed to prevent certain types of deaths resulting from injuries sustained in the line of duty.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most appropriate answer based on the analysis provided above."
