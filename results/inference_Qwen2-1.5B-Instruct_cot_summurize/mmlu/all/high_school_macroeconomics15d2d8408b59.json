This means that as unemployment falls, wages may also fall less rapidly than they would otherwise. This can lead to a lower level of inflation, which is generally considered desirable by policymakers and economists.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual rate of inflation may still increase if there are supply shocks or other factors that drive up prices. So while the Phillips curve might shift to the right, it doesn't necessarily mean that the actual inflation rate will remain steady."
