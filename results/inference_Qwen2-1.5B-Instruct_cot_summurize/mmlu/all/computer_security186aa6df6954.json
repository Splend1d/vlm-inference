When a wireless user authenticates to an access point (AP), both the user and the AP engage in a series of steps known as a 4-way handshake to establish a secure connection between them. This process includes verifying the user's identity through various means such as passwords or biometric data, establishing a secure channel for communication, and ensuring that the user's device is not compromised by unauthorized access attempts."
