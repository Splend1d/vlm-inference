The acceleration of the car during the collision will be double the magnitude but in the opposite direction.\n\nThis is because when two objects collide, their masses add up. In this case, if the toy truck's mass is double that of the toy car, the net force on both objects must be equal to zero for them to come to rest together (or move at constant velocity). This means that the total momentum of the system before and after the collision must remain the same.\n\nSince the mass of the toy truck is twice that of the toy car, the impulse imparted by the truck to the car must be twice as large. Impulse is defined as the change in momentum of an object due to an external force. Therefore, the acceleration of the car during the collision must be twice as large as the acceleration of the truck. Since the direction of the forces involved is not given, we cannot determine whether the acceleration is in the same or opposite direction. However, the magnitude of the acceleration is always doubled, regardless of the direction."
