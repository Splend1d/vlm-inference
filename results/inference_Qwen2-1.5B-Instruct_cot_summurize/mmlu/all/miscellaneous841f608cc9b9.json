Therefore, 4:00 pm would be represented as \"4:00\" in military time.\n\nOption A, 1600, is not a valid representation of military time because it has more than one digit for hours and minutes combined. Option B, 4, does not represent a valid hour or minute in military time either. Option C, 400, is not a valid representation of hours and minutes combined either."
