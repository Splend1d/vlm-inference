Let's say these numbers are $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$. Since all these numbers have the same number of digits, we can assume that each digit in any one of these numbers has the same position (i.e., they are all in the leftmost column).\n\nNow, let's consider the terms of the sequence. For each term $a_i$, there are two possibilities: either it is equal to $a \\cdot r^{(i-1)}$ or it is not equal to $a \\cdot r^{(i-1)}$. \n\nIf $a_i = a \\cdot r^{(i-1)}$, then the number of digits in $a_i$ is equal to the number of digits in $a$. If $a_i \\neq a \\cdot r^{(i-1)}$, then the number of digits in $a_i$ is less than the number of digits in $a$. \n\nSince Bill picked out $k$ different numbers, at least one of them must be equal to $a \\cdot r^{(i-1)}$. This means that the total number of digits in all the selected numbers is at least $k$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of $k$ is achieved when all the selected numbers are equal to $a \\cdot r^{(i-1)}$. In other words, we want to maximize the power of $r$ in the terms of the sequence. \n\nLet's denote the number of digits in $a$ as $d$. Then, the number of digits in $a \\cdot r^{(i-1)}$ is $d + i - 1$. \n\nTo maximize the power of $r$, we need to minimize the number of digits in $a \\cdot r^{(i-1)}$. This happens when $i = d + 1$. Therefore, the maximum possible value of $k$ is $d + 1$.\n\nSubstituting $d = 1$, we get the maximum possible value of $k$ is $\\boxed{5}$."
