Describing quantities.\n\nThis is because the students are creating and describing models for their numbers, which involves understanding how to represent and communicate numerical values in different ways (e.g., as tens, ones, etc.). This practice helps students develop an understanding of numbers and their relationships in the decimal system, which aligns with option B.\n\nOption A (Comparing Quantities) refers to comparing two or more quantities based on their size or relationship. While this is related to the task of modeling numbers, it's not the primary focus of the instruction given.\n\nOption C (Ordering Quantities) focuses on arranging numbers in order from least to greatest or greatest to least. Although the students may arrange their models in some way, this doesn't directly relate to the specific task of modeling numbers, which is described in terms of quantity representation rather than ordering.\n\nOption D (Decomposing Quantities) refers to breaking down larger numbers into smaller components. However, the task of modeling numbers in place value notation does not involve decomposing quantities; instead, it involves representing them visually.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Describing quantities."
