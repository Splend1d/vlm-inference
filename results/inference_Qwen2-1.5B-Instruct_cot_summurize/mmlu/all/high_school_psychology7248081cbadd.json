The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in regulating appetite and metabolism, and its activity is often associated with changes in hunger and satiety signals. Other brain regions such as the cerebellum, medulla, and amygdala also play important roles in these processes, but the hypothalamus is considered to be the primary site for hunger motivation."
