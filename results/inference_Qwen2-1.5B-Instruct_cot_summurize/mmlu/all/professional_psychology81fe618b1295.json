However, if these arguments are then strongly refuted, this can lead to a weakening of their resistance to later persuasive appeals. This is because they have already experienced cognitive dissonance and may be more open to being convinced by other arguments in the future. Therefore, exposing individuals to arguments against their views can help to strengthen their resistance to later persuasive appeals."
