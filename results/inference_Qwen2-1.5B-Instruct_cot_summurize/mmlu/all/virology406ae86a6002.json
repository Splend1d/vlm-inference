NGS has been used extensively in the field of virology to study viral genomes and identify novel viruses. It has also been used in other areas such as cancer research, forensic science, and environmental monitoring. While NGS may not be as fast or cost-effective as some other technologies, it remains an important tool for understanding the genetic basis of diseases and other complex biological processes."
