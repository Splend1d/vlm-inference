However, in a DC machine, the shunt resistance (RS) is typically higher than the armature resistance (RA), which is used for generating the magnetic field. This is because the DC current flowing through the circuit is constant, so there is no need for the motor to generate its own magnetic field. Therefore, the shunt resistance can be much higher than the armature resistance."
