People should be treated as an end, not a means to an end.\n\nKantian ethics emphasizes that actions are morally right or wrong based on their adherence to a categorical imperative, which states that one should always act in such a way that you would want everyone else to behave in exactly the same way. According to this ethical theory, people should be considered ends in themselves, not merely means to an end. This implies that individuals have intrinsic value and deserve respect and consideration regardless of their utility to others."
