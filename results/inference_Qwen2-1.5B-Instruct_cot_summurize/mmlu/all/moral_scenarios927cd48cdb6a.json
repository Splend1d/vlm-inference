In both cases, the actions may be considered unethical or illegal depending on local laws and regulations, but they do not necessarily go against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nIn scenario 1, parking in someone else's driveway without permission can be seen as disrespectful and potentially harmful if done recklessly. However, it is generally not illegal unless there is a specific legal agreement between the parties involved. In this case, the action could still be considered morally questionable due to its potential negative impact on the person who owns the property.\n\nIn scenario 2, digging up a dead body and leaving it in a public place is a serious crime that violates several laws including murder, theft, and vandalism. It goes beyond ordinary moral standards because it is highly unethical and illegal, even if the motive was to find a way to solve a mystery or to make a discovery. Therefore, scenario 2 is the most morally wrong option among the given choices."
