However, when a tire on the woman's car suddenly blew out, she lost control of her car and crashed, injuring a pedestrian. The pedestrian later sued the man, because the woman had no insurance or assets. Will the pedestrian be likely to prevail in that action?\n\nA. No, because the man did not cause the injury.\nB. No, because the man was driving very carefully.\nC. Yes, because the man and the woman were acting in concert in a dangerous activity.\nD. Yes, because the man was exceeding the speed limit. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because the man and the woman were acting in concert in a dangerous activity."
