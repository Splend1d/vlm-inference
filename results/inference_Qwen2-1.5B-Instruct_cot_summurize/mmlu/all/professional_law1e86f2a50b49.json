Overrule all the objections because the witness is an adverse party to the plaintiff and can be questioned by leading questions and subject to impeachment. This is true because the opposing side has the right to cross-examine witnesses for their side and challenge their credibility and testimony. The managing agent of the defendant corporation is an adverse party to the plaintiff, so they have the right to ask leading questions and impeach the witness if necessary. It is up to the trial court to determine whether the questioning is appropriate and within the bounds of the rules of evidence."
