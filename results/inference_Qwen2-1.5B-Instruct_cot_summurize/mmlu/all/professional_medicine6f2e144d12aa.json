Over the past week, she has had nausea related to excess coughing. Over the past year, she has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled \u03b2-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. She appears thin. Examination shows a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. Examination shows no other abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland. A biopsy specimen of the lung mass is most likely to show which of the following?\n\nA. Mesothelioma\nB. Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast\nC. Multiple endocrine neoplasia\nD. Non-small cell lung carcinoma\n"

This is because the patient has a history of smoking, which is a known risk factor for this type of cancer. Additionally, the presence of a mass in the right lower lobe and right adrenal gland, as well as the fact that the tumor is located away from the central nervous system and lungs, suggests that it is not a metastasis from another organ. The CT scan also shows calcifications, which can be seen in certain types of lung cancer. However, it is important to note that this is only an educated guess and further testing may be needed to confirm the diagnosis."
