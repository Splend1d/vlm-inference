It works by converting analyte molecules into gaseous ions through ionization methods such as electron impact or laser desorption/ionization. These ions are then separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio using techniques like quadrupole or time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Additionally, mass spectra can also provide information about the isotopes present in an analyte molecule, including its isotopic masses and isotopic ratios."
