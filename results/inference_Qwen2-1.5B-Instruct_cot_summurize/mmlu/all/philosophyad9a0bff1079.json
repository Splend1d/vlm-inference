It is his duty not to do so.\n\nSocrates argues that the purpose of education is to develop good character and virtues in individuals, rather than to corrupt or manipulate them for personal gain. He believes that it is his duty as a philosopher and educator to guide individuals towards virtuous behavior and to avoid any actions that could lead to their moral corruption.\n\nTherefore, Socrates' argument is based on the idea that he has a responsibility to act in ways that promote the well-being of society and to avoid behaviors that could damage individuals or undermine the common good. This belief is consistent with many philosophical traditions, including Aristotelian ethics and Stoic philosophy, which emphasize the importance of self-control and ethical conduct in achieving happiness and living a fulfilling life."
