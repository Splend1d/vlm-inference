The contract provided that the closing would be 60 days after the contract was signed and that the seller would convey to the buyer a \"marketable title\" by a quitclaim deed at closing. The contract contained no other provisions regarding the title to be delivered to the buyer. A title search revealed that the land was subject to an unsatisfied $50,000 mortgage and a right-of-way easement over a portion of the land. The buyer now claims that the title is unmarketable and has refused to close. Is the buyer correct?\n\nA. No, because nothing under these facts renders title unmarketable.\nB. No, because the buyer agreed to accept a quitclaim deed. quitclaim deed.\nC. Yes, because the right-of-way easement makes the title unmarketable.\nD. Yes, because the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable.\n"

Yes, because the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable.\n\nUnder a quitclaim deed, the grantor (seller) transfers only a \"good faith\" interest in the property, and does not guarantee or assume any responsibility for any defects in the title, including liens, encumbrances, or restrictions on use. Therefore, if there is a lien or other encumbrance on the property that affects its marketability, the buyer should reject the transfer.\n\nIn this case, the title search revealed that the land was subject to both an unsatisfied $50,000 mortgage and a right-of-way easement. These two issues render the title unmarketable. The buyer's refusal to close is therefore justified."
