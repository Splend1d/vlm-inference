Therefore, the area of the base is:\n\n\\[A_{base} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{leg})^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2^2 = 2\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the height of the solid. Since each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square, its side length is equal to the difference between the two bounding lines. Here, one bounding line is \\(y = 2\\) and the other is \\(x^2 = 4y\\). To find this distance, we solve for the intersection point of these two equations:\n\n\\[x^2 = 4(2) \\Rightarrow x^2 = 8 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm \\sqrt{8}\\]\n\nSince we know from our previous calculation that the base of the solid is a right triangle with legs of length 2 units, the height of the solid will be the distance between the two bounding lines, which is:\n\n\\[h = |2 - (-2)| = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the solid can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a pyramid, where the base is a square and the height is the distance between the two bounding lines:\n\n\\[V = \\frac{1}{3}A_{base}h = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 2 \\times 4 = \\frac{8}{3}\\]\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the answer in terms of the options provided, we convert \\(V = \\frac{8}{3}\\) into the given form:\n\n\\[V = \\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.67\\]\n\nThus, the closest option to \\(V\\) is **C. 20**."
