A campaign manager's introduction of a mayoral candidate\n\nIn a persuasive speech, the speaker aims to influence or persuade their audience towards adopting a particular viewpoint or action. This could be through emotional appeals, logical arguments, or personal anecdotes. In contrast, options B, C, and D do not typically involve influencing or persuading an audience in this way; they provide factual information, discuss topics of general interest, or give descriptions of specific experiences or events. Therefore, option A is the correct answer for an example of a persuasive speech."
