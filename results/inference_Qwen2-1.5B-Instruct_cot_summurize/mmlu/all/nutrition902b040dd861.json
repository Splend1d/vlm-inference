This could include things like smoking, being around toxins, and so on. \n\nAn \"exposed individual\" can have a higher risk of developing certain diseases if they come into contact with a harmful factor. For example, someone who smokes is more likely to develop lung cancer than someone who does not smoke.\n\nDietary intake is indeed an \"exposure,\" but it's important to note that individuals do have control over their diet and can choose to make healthier choices. However, dietary factors alone cannot cause all health problems, and other factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and environment also play a role.\n\nBody mass index (BMI) is a measure of weight relative to height, and it can be used as a risk factor for various health conditions. While BMI itself is not a single exposure, it can be considered when assessing the overall health risks associated with obesity."
