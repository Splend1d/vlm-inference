In other words, we must rely on our own reason and judgment to determine whether an action is desirable based solely on its consequences, rather than relying on external authority or expert opinion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, as rational insight is the only evidence that something is desirable according to Mill's philosophy."
