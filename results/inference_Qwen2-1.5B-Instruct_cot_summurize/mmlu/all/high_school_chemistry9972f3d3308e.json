This gives us:\nln(Q) = -kt\nWhere Q = [SO2] * [Cl2]/[SO2Cl2]^2.\nFor this reaction, k = -1/([SO2Cl2]^2), so ln(Q) = -t/k.\nTaking the second derivative of ln(Q) with respect to t gives us the rate constant for the reaction, which is k. The half-life of the reactant is given by:\nT/2 = ln(2)/k\nSo if we want to increase the half-life of SO2Cl2, we need to decrease the rate constant k. One way to do this is to increase the temperature, which would increase the activation energy of the reaction and thus reduce the rate constant. Therefore, increasing the temperature at which the reaction occurs would cause an increase in the half life of SO2Cl2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Increasing the temperature at which the reaction occurs."
