This means that everyone who is not actively engaged in fighting or supporting it should be considered a non-combatant. Discrimination based on nationality, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, political beliefs, or any other characteristic is therefore unacceptable.\n\nOption A, which states that there is no difference between combatants and non-combatants, is incorrect because it would allow for discrimination against certain groups based on their nationality or other characteristics. Option B, which states that the difference between combatants and non-combatants is a matter of degree, is also incorrect because it does not clearly define what constitutes a non-combatant and what does not. Option D, which suggests that terrorism should be defined as indiscriminate violence, is not relevant to the question of discrimination in war."
