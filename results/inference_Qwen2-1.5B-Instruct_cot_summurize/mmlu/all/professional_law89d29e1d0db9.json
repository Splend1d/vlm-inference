The carpenter agreed to bid if the general contractor would agree to give the carpenter the job provided that his bid was lowest and the general contractor was awarded the main contract. The general contractor so agreed. The carpenter, incurring time and expense in preparing his bid, submitted the lowest carpentry bid. The general contractor used the carpenter's bid in calculating its own bid, which was successful. Which of the following best supports the carpenter's position that the general contractor is obligated to position that the general contractor is obligated to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter?\n\nA. The carpenter detrimentally relied on the general contractor's conditional promise in preparing his bid.\nB. The carpenter gave consideration for the general contractor's conditional promise to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter.\nC. The general contractor has an implied duty to deal fairly and in good faith with all bidders whose bids the general contractor used in calculating its main bid to the building owner.\nD. The general contractor has an obligation to the owner of the building to subcontract with the carpenter because the carpenter's bid was used in calculating the general contractor's bid, and the carpenter is an intended beneficiary of that obligation.\n"

The carpenter gave consideration for the general contractor's conditional promise to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter.\n\nWhen a contractor agrees to bid on a project and then uses the lowest bidder's bid in calculating their own bid, it creates a situation where the contractor may be obligated to award the subcontract to the lowest bidder, even though they did not bid on it directly. This can create a conflict of interest for the contractor, as they have already committed to using the lowest bid in their calculation. Therefore, the contractor must ensure that they do not benefit from this arrangement by giving consideration to the lowest bidder.\n\nIn this case, the carpenter incurred time and expense in preparing their bid, and the general contractor used their bid in calculating their own bid, which resulted in success for the general contractor. However, the carpenter had given consideration for the general contractor's conditional promise to award them the subcontract. This means that the carpenter acted in reliance on the general contractor's promise, and therefore, the carpenter should receive the subcontract.\n\nTherefore, option B is the best support for the carpenter's position that the general contractor is obligated to award the carpentry subcontract to the carpenter."
