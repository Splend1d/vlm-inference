A State is 'injured' if the obligation breached was owed to it individually or if it was owed to a group of States, including that State, and it was specially affected.\nIn other words, the injured state is one that has been directly or indirectly harmed by the internationally wrongful conduct of another state, either through direct harm or through indirect harm caused by the actions of the other state. The injured state may be an individual state, a group of states, or any other entity that can be considered as a legal entity for purposes of international law."
