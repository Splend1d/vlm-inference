PF5. \n\nIn PF5, each phosphorus (P) atom has five electron pairs, resulting in a total of seven valence electrons, which is equal to eight. The outermost shell of phosphorus contains two electrons, and these electrons are paired up with four electrons from the sulfur (S) atoms. This arrangement ensures that the central phosphorus atom has an octet of electrons. \n\nBF3 (bromine trifluoride), NH4+ (ammonium ion), SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride), and PF5 do not have an octet of electrons around their central atoms because they either lack sufficient electrons or have more than eight electrons in the outermost shell."
