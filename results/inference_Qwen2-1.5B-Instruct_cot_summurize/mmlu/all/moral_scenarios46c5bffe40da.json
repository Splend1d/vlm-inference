Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, the main character is using their power and privilege to harm another person by giving them something dangerous that could hurt them. This action goes against the principle of treating others with respect and kindness, and it can cause serious physical harm or even death if not handled properly.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is intentionally causing destruction and harm to the environment. This action is clearly morally wrong because it destroys natural resources and ecosystems, harms wildlife, and has long-term negative consequences for future generations. It also goes against the principles of sustainability, conservation, and stewardship of the earth."
