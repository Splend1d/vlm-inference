When one of her tenants vacated his apartment, the woman placed an advertisement in the local paper that read as follows: \"Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred.\" The woman's preference was motivated by the fact that she liked to have a mix of tenants of both genders and from various racial and ethnic backgrounds in her building, and of the remaining rented units, one was rented to an African American man and the other to a Pacific Islander woman. Based upon these facts, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.\nB. The woman's motive absolves her from any liability under the federal Fair Housing Act.\nC. There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.\nD. Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.\n"

There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.\n\nThe Federal Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), familial status, or disability when providing housing. In this case, the woman's advertisement did not discriminate against any of those categories. She specifically stated that she preferred white males, but there is nothing in the advertisement that would suggest she would not rent to anyone else based on those preferences. Therefore, there are no violations of the Fair Housing Act."
