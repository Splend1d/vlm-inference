This will have no effect on the amount of the product supplied right now.\n\nWhen firms expect prices to be lower in the future, they may produce more of the product now to take advantage of potential price discounts. However, there is no guarantee that prices will actually be lower in the future, so the firms' expectations about prices may not come true. As a result, their production decisions may not have any impact on the current supply of the product."
