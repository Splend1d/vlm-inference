In this case, the force is the gravitational force acting on the crate (which is 100 kg), and the distance is the height it rises (2 meters). \n\nThe formula for work is:\nW = F * d\n\nwhere W is the work done, F is the force applied, and d is the distance traveled.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\nW = 100 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 2 m = 1960 J\n\nHowever, this is not one of the options provided. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the question. The correct answer should be related to the work done by the person lifting the crate. If you meant to ask about the work done by gravity alone, then the correct answer would be:\n\nWork done by gravity = mass * acceleration due to gravity * height = 100 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 2 m = 1960 J\n\nSo the correct answer would be B. 500 J."
