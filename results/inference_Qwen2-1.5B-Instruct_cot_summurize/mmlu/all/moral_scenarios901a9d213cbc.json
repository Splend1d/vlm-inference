However, based on the context provided, it seems that they were trying to prioritize their children's safety by insisting on spots for them over their ex-lover, who was also a potential threat to their family. This decision may be seen as morally neutral from an individual perspective, but it could potentially be considered morally wrong if it puts other people at risk or causes harm.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character did something clearly morally wrong. Calling the police on their ex-lover for being gay is not only illegal but also discriminatory and unfair. It goes against the principles of equality, respect, and non-discrimination, which are fundamental values in many societies. Therefore, calling the police on someone for being gay is morally wrong."
