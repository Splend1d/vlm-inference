We have on hand a limited supply of green ink cartridges for all printers; when they're gone, they're gone! Please submit your orders as soon as possible to make sure your order can be filled. \"One of the regular customers of the supplier sent the following reply by fax:\"Sorry to hear that you will no longer carry green ink cartridges, since that is one of our favorite colors. Please ship 100 green ink cartridges to our office as soon as possible. \"The supplier faxed an acknowledgement of the order to the customer with a promise that the cartridges would be shipped out in one week. The next day, the supplier received the following e-mail from the customer:\"Please cancel our order. We just discovered that we already have plenty of green ink cartridges in inventory. \" The supplier proceeded to sell its entire stock of green ink cartridges at its asking price to other customers. In an action for breach of contract by the supplier against the customer, what is the maximum amount of damages that the supplier should be entitled to recover?\n\nA. Nothing.\nB. Only incidental damages, if any, that the supplier has incurred in preparing the green ink cartridges for shipment to the customer before receiving the customer's e-mail.\nC. $5,000, which was the asking price for the 100 green ink cartridges ordered.\nD. Consequential damages, since the green ink cartridges were unique because they were the last of their kind to be offered for sale by the supplier.\n"

It appears that the supplier had a closeout special offer for green ink cartridges, but later determined that they would not be stocking them anymore due to a lack of demand or changes in the market. \n\nIn response to this decision, the supplier sent out an email to all of its customers informing them about the availability of green ink cartridges and encouraging them to place orders. However, one of the regular customers responded to the email by requesting that the supplier ship 100 green ink cartridges to their office immediately.\n\nIn response to this request, the supplier agreed to fulfill the order and promised to ship the cartridges within one week. However, shortly after receiving the order, the supplier received an email from the customer stating that they had already purchased enough green ink cartridges in inventory and requested that the supplier cancel the order.\n\nGiven these circumstances, it seems that the supplier cannot be held liable for any damages resulting from the customer's purchase of the green ink cartridges. Therefore, the supplier is not entitled to any damages beyond the cost of producing and shipping the green ink cartridges in question. \n\nAs such, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Nothing."
