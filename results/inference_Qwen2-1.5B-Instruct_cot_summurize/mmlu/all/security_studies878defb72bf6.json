Nations may be difficult to distinguish from societies.\n\nWhile it is true that nations often have distinct cultures, languages, and political systems, they are also characterized by their shared sovereignty and international relations with other states. Societies, on the other hand, can include individuals from diverse backgrounds who share common values but do not necessarily share a single government or territory. Therefore, while societies can overlap with nations in some ways, they are fundamentally different entities."
