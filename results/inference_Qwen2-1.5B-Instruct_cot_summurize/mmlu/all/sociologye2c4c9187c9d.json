Chodorow's theory of \"gender socialization\" suggests that children learn about gender roles by observing the behavior of adults in their lives, including their parents and siblings. According to this theory, boys and girls who grow up with close female caregivers may develop certain expectations about how they should behave as men or women, while those who have more male-oriented caregivers may develop different expectations. As a result, boys and girls may become increasingly distant from their mothers over time, as they begin to explore and assert themselves as independent individuals."
