This is because epinephrine can constrict blood vessels and reduce oxygen delivery to the muscles, which can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath during physical activity. The other options (Apraclonidine, Latanoprost, and Timolol) are not typically associated with causing shortness of breath or other cardiovascular side effects in patients with glaucoma."
