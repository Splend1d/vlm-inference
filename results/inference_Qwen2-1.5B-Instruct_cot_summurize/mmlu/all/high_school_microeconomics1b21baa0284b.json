Firms A and B are substitutes because the cross-price elasticity is greater than zero.\n\nWhen one firm's prices increase while another firm's prices remain unchanged or decrease, the quantity demanded for the cheaper good will increase relative to the quantity demanded for the more expensive good. This means that the two goods are substitutes in this context. The cross-price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good when the price of its complement changes. If the cross-price elasticity is positive, it indicates that the two goods are substitutes. In this case, as the price of firm A's cell phone service increases, the quantity demanded of firm B's cell phone service also increases due to the fact that they are substitutes. Therefore, the cross-price elasticity between firm A and firm B is greater than zero, indicating that they are substitutes."
