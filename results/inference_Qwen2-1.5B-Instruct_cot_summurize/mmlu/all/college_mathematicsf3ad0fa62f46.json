For any matrix A, we have:\n   \\[ \\text{Tr}(A^2) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij}a_{ji} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij})^2 \\geq 0 \\]\n   where the inequality follows from the fact that the sum of squares of real numbers is always non-negative (the square of a number is either zero or positive).\n\n2. From the given information, we know that \\( A^2 = A \\). This implies that for all i and j, \\( a_{ii}a_{jj} = a_{ij}a_{ji} \\), so \\( a_{ii} = a_{ji} \\) for all i and j. Therefore,\n   \\[ \\text{Tr}(A^2) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{ii}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{ii}a_{ii} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{ii}^2 \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{ii}^2 = \\text{Tr}(A) \\]\n   since the sum of squares of real numbers is always non-negative. Thus, if \\( A^2 = A \\), then the trace of \\( A \\) must be nonnegative as well.\n\n3. If \\( A \\) has a non-zero trace, say \\( \\text{Tr}(A) > 0 \\), then by the above reasoning, \\( A^2 \\) also has a non-zero trace because \\( A^2 = A \\). So, both \\( A \\) and \\( A^2 \\) have non-negative traces, which means their product \\( AB \\) will also have a non-negative trace. Conversely, if \\( AB \\) has a non-negative trace, then \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) each have a non-negative trace, and hence \\( A^2 = A \\) (by taking \\( A \\) to the power of 2). \n\nTherefore, statements I and II are true, making the correct answer D. II and III only."
