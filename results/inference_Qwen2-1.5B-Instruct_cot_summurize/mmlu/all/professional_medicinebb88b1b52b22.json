The patient had mammography and ultrasonography of the breasts 2 months ago for evaluation of increased glandularity, palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, noted at her most recent annual examination. The studies showed likely benign findings with recommended follow-up in 6 months. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and she takes no medications. BMI is 30 kg/m2 . Vital signs are normal. Palpation of the right breast discloses glandularity in the upper outer quadrant but no other masses. There is scant, black discharge from the right nipple. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Ductography\nB. Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue\nC. Repeat mammography\nD. Repeat ultrasonography of the right breast\n"

Excisional biopsy of glandular tissue\n\nThe patient's symptoms of black discharge from the right nipple and palpable glandularity in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast suggest the presence of a breast lesion that could be cancerous. A biopsy can help determine if there is any malignancy present. Excisional biopsy involves removing a small amount of tissue from the breast for analysis under a microscope. This procedure can help distinguish between benign and malignant conditions, allowing for early treatment and management. Other options such as ductography (a type of imaging test used to visualize blood flow through the ducts of the breast) or repeat mammography and ultrasound may not provide enough information to make an accurate diagnosis of the breast lesion. Repeat ultrasonography would also not be appropriate given the recommendation for follow-up in 6 months."
