However, if we assume the percentage for brown is correct, then the calculation would still yield a negative result. In such a case, it's likely that the question was intended to ask about the frequency of heterozygous carriers rather than the frequency of heterozygous individuals.\n\nIf we were to calculate the frequency of heterozygous carriers instead, it would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Frequency of heterozygous carriers} = \\text{Frequency of dominant allele} \\times \\text{Frequency of recessive allele} = 0.96 \\times 0.04 = 0.0384 \\]\n\nRounding this to the nearest whole number gives us approximately 4%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **C. 40 percent**."
