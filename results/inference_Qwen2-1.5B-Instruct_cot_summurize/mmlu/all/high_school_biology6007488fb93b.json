Cell membrane: Both prokaryotic and animal cells have a cell membrane that is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cell and allowing substances to enter or leave the cell.\n\nC. Chloroplasts: Chloroplasts are found only in plant cells, not in animal cells.\n\nD. Cell wall: While some prokaryotes can form a cell wall, it is not unique to prokaryotic cells. All eukaryotic cells also contain a cell wall made of cellulose.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic that allows you to distinguish between a prokaryotic cell and an animal cell is A. Ribosomes."
