Grounding a child for two weeks after the child has misbehaved is an example of negative punishment, which involves removing a desirable reward or activity as a consequence for behavior that is deemed undesirable. In this case, the parent may be punishing the child's misbehavior by grounding them from certain activities and privileges, in order to teach them not to behave in such a way again. This type of punishment can be effective in teaching children appropriate behavior, but it should be used with caution and only when necessary. Avoidant attachment, compliance learning, and negative reinforcement are not examples of parenting strategies for disciplining children."
