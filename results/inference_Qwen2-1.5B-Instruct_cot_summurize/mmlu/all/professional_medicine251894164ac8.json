Endometrial biopsy\n\nEndometrial biopsy is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis as it can help determine if there is an abnormality in the endometrium that may be causing the symptoms. It is important to note that progesterone challenge test and colposcopy are not typically used for this purpose. Cystoscopy is also not typically used for this purpose, although it can be done if needed."
