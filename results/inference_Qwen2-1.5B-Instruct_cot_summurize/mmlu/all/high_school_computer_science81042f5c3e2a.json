The condition `while(num1 > num2 || num1 > num3)` checks whether either num1 is greater than num2 or num1 is greater than num3. \n\nIf any of these conditions is true, the loop will continue executing. However, if both num1 is greater than num2 AND num1 is greater than num3, then the loop will terminate because at least one of the conditions has been satisfied. Therefore, the loop will not execute in this case.\n\nHence, option C is sufficient to guarantee that the `body of loop` will never be executed."
