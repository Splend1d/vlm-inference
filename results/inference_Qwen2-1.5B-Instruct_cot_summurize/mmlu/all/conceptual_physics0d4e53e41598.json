This causes the Moon to appear partially or completely obscured by the Sun in the sky.\n\nTherefore, when the shadow of the Moon falls on Earth during a solar eclipse, it is a natural phenomenon that occurs only at night, as seen from Earth. The other options (A. Lunar Eclipse) and (D. Very Dangerous Event) are incorrect because they refer to events that occur during a lunar eclipse, which is not what happens when the shadow of the Moon falls on Earth during a solar eclipse."
