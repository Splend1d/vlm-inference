Instead, clusters are chosen based on some characteristic or variable that exists within each group. For example, if you were conducting research on the health effects of smoking among adults aged 18-25 years old, you might cluster the adult smokers into age groups (e.g., 18-20, 21-24, etc.) and then randomly select one person from each age group for the study.\n\nCLUSTER SAMPLING increases external validity because it allows researchers to generalize findings to the broader population. By selecting samples from different subgroups within a larger population, researchers can identify patterns and differences that may be more significant than those found in the original sample. This can help ensure that the results of the study are reliable and applicable to the wider population."
