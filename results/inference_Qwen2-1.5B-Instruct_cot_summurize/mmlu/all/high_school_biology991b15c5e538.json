Frameshift mutation.\n\nA frameshift mutation occurs when a segment of DNA is inserted or deleted at a specific location in the coding sequence, resulting in an abnormal reading frame for the protein that results from translation. In this case, the insertion of the retroviral DNA disrupts the normal reading frame and changes the amino acid sequence of the protein produced by the mutated gene.\n\nA duplication mutation involves adding extra copies of a gene to the genome, which can also result in an abnormal reading frame. An inversion mutation involves swapping two consecutive bases on a strand of DNA, but does not affect the reading frame of the protein encoded by the gene.\n\nTranslocation mutations involve moving the start codon or stop codon of a gene to a different position within the same gene, but do not necessarily change the reading frame of the protein."
