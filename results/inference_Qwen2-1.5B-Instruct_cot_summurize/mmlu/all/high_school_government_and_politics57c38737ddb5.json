Negotiating treaties\n\nPresidential powers that are not shared with the Senate include deploying troops, drafting appropriations bills, and forcing Congress into session. However, the power to negotiate treaties is a unique presidential power that is exclusive to the President and cannot be delegated or shared with the Senate. The Senate has the authority to confirm appointments made by the President to federal agencies, but this does not involve negotiating treaties on behalf of the United States."
