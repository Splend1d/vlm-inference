Services cannot be touched or seen like physical products can. They also have variable quality, as customers may receive different levels of service depending on the provider or circumstances. Inseparability refers to the fact that it's difficult to separate the delivery of a service from the experience itself. Finally, a lack of ownership means that customers do not own the product they receive, but rather use it for a limited period of time."
