Absolute location refers to the position of an object in relation to other objects, such as the Earth or another planet. Geographical coordinates, on the other hand, provide relative positions and directions between points on the Earth's surface. Longitude and latitude are two commonly used geographical coordinates that help define absolute locations on the Earth's surface. The equator is also an important geographical feature that helps define absolute locations on the Earth's surface."
