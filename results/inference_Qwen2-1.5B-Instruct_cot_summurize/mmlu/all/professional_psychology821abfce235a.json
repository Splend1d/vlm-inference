For example, in some cultures, family secrets can be deeply stigmatized and viewed as shameful, which might contribute to feelings of guilt or shame when discussing family issues openly with a counselor.\n\nAdditionally, it's possible that certain cultural backgrounds may have different expectations around how families should interact and communicate, leading to feelings of guilt or shame when discussing family problems.\n\nOverall, while it's true that experiencing intense feelings of shame and guilt upon admitting to a family problem is common among various cultural groups, it's essential to recognize that each person's experience may differ based on personal values, beliefs, and cultural context."
