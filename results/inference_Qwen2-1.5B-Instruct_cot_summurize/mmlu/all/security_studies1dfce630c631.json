An approach to security that applies critical knowledge to established orthodoxies of security studies.\n\nCritical Security Studies is an approach to security that emphasizes the importance of understanding the ways in which power, ideology, and social structures shape security practices and outcomes. It recognizes the limitations of traditional security theories and seeks to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of security issues by incorporating critical perspectives on these topics. This approach involves examining security from multiple angles, including economic, political, cultural, and environmental, and considering how these factors interact with each other."
