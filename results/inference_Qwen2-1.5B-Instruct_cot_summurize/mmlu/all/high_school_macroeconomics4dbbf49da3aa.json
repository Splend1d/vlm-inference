The euro has appreciated.\n\nWhen the value of one currency increases relative to another, it means that the currency with the higher value is appreciating against its counterpart. In this case, the euro is appreciating against the U.S. dollar (from $1.36 to $1.40). This suggests that the euro's value is increasing compared to the U.S. dollar, making option D correct."
