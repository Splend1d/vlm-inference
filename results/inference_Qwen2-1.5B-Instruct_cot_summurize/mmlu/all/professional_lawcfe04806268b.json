Character evidence is generally not admissible in court unless it is directly related to the facts of the case and has probative value. In this case, the neighbor's testimony about the man's reputation as a good neighbor does not have any relevance to the issue of whether the man struck the victim in self-defense. Therefore, it cannot be used to impeach the defendant's credibility or establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."
