For a 68%-ish percentage, the corresponding value for $\\alpha$ would be 0.025 (since 68% is equivalent to 0.68).\n\nSo, if we assume the population proportion is 60%, then the lower bound of the confidence interval would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Lower Bound} = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = \\frac{0.05}{2} = 0.025 \\]\n\nAnd the upper bound of the confidence interval would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Upper Bound} = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 1 - \\frac{0.05}{2} = 0.975 \\]\n\nSince we're looking for a range of percentages from 60% to 68%, which includes both endpoints, we'll take the average of these two bounds to get an estimate within the desired range:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Confidence Interval} = \\frac{0.60 + 0.68}{2} = 0.64 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 64.0%."
