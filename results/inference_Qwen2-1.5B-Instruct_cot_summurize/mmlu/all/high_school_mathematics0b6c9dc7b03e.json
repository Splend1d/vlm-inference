We have $1200 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$.\nThe factors of $1200$ that can be expressed as $n^2$ are those where $n$ contains at least one factor of $2$, one factor of $5$, and one factor of $7$.\nThe possible values for $n$ are then $2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 20, 28, 35, 40, 56, 70, 100, 140, 210, 420$.\nTo find the sum of these values, we simply add them up: $2 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 20 + 28 + 35 + 40 + 56 + 70 + 100 + 140 + 210 + 420 = 1200$.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$. The answer is $\\boxed{12}$. If fortune favors, this is correct."
