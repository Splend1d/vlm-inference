A nation removes penalties for firms that pollute natural resources.\n\nEconomic growth is often driven by technological advancements, which require more productive workers to produce goods and services. Labor productivity increases when there are fewer barriers to entry for businesses, such as taxes or regulations. By removing barriers to pollution, a country can encourage investment in cleaner technologies and reduce the cost of doing business, leading to increased productivity and economic growth.\n\nSubsidizing education for all citizens may improve overall health and well-being, but it does not necessarily lead to higher labor productivity or economic growth. Imposing tariffs and quotas on imports can harm domestic industries, but they do not directly increase labor productivity or economic growth. Ignoring societal barriers like discrimination may lead to unequal distribution of benefits and opportunities, but it does not affect labor productivity or economic growth."
