Turner syndrome\n\nTurner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females and is caused by a single X chromosome being missing or damaged, resulting in a condition known as Klinefelter's syndrome. The disorder can affect multiple systems, including cardiovascular, skeletal, and reproductive organs. It is characterized by short stature, webbed neck, small breasts, and absent fallopian tubes, among other features.\n\nX-linked disorders occur on the X chromosome, which means they are inherited in males but not in females. These disorders typically involve the loss of one copy of the gene for the affected protein or enzyme, leading to a malfunction of the corresponding biological function.\n\nThe other options listed do not have a specific association with X chromosome aneuploidy or the conditions mentioned:\n\n- Cystic fibrosis: A recessive genetic disorder affecting the lungs, digestive system, and liver.\n- Hemophilia: An inherited blood disorder that affects clotting factors in the blood.\n- Tay-Sachs disease: An autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hexosaminidase II, leading to damage to the nervous system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Turner syndrome."
