The optimization that directly affects this attack is the repeated squaring and sliding windows (RS) method. Therefore, turning off RS would effectively close the timing channel attack. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that both RS and KM would close the timing channel attack, which is not true.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because it suggests that only RS would close the timing channel attack, which is not true either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.
