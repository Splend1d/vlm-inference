Lowering the income tax rate would not have any effect on the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy as it does not affect the level of government spending. Selling Treasury securities to commercial banks would also reduce the amount of money in circulation and decrease aggregate demand, but it would not necessarily lessen the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy. Lowering the discount rate would lower interest rates and encourage investment and consumption, but it is not an effective way to lessen the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Decreasing the value of the domestic currency."
