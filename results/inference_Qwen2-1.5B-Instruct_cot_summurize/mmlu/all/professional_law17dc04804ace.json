The policy contains a clause providing that double indemnity is payable in the event that death of the insured \"results directly, and independently of all other causes, from bodily injury effected solely through external violent and accidental means. \"The plaintiff's wife met her death in the silage shed of her farm. The death resulted from wounds caused by the discharge of a double-barreled shotgun. The plaintiff was arrested and prosecuted for the murder of his wife. After a lengthy trial, the plaintiff was acquitted of the charge. After the insurance company refused to pay the plaintiff's insurance claim, the plaintiff instituted this civil action. The complaint sets forth the policy, alleges the facts surrounding the death of the insured, avers that the death was within the policy provisions for double indemnity payment, and demands judgment accordingly. At trial, the insurance company's attorney proposes to introduce excerpts from the plaintiff's murder trial. The plaintiff's attorney objects to the introduction of such evidence. The trial judge should rule the proffered evidence\n\nA. admissible as a declaration against interest.\nB. admissible as former testimony.\nC. inadmissible, because of collateral estoppel.\nD. inadmissible, because of double jeopardy.\n"

In this case, the insurance company can introduce evidence of the plaintiff's murder trial to show that the death of the insured was not caused by \"external violent and accidental means,\" which is the condition under which double indemnity coverage applies. This evidence could potentially support the argument that the death did not result directly and independently from the cause of death specified in the policy provision. However, the court may consider whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs its potential prejudicial impact before allowing it to be introduced."
