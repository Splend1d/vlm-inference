Valid DV certificates provide more confidence to a user that she is connecting to the intended party than valid EV certificates.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true, as the level of confidence in the authenticity of a certificate depends on various factors such as the strength of the encryption algorithm used, the size of the certificate, and the time since the last revocation. Additionally, while EV (Extended Validation) certificates require additional information about the organization, such as a physical address or a website URL, they may still be less secure than DV (Digital Verification) certificates if the organization's physical location or other identifying information is publicly available online. Therefore, both types of certificates can provide varying levels of confidence in the authenticity of a website, and the level of confidence may depend on the specific circumstances of each case."
