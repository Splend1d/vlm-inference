One of these changes was the shift from a focus on trust and commitment to performance metrics and accountability.\n\nAccording to Mulholland, the introduction of detailed daily worksheets and other performance-oriented tools can reduce the level of trust and commitment between companies and their employees, as employees may be more focused on meeting specific performance targets rather than developing long-term relationships with their employers. This can lead to a loss of flexibility and adaptability, as employees may feel less empowered to make decisions or take risks.\n\nOverall, Mulholland suggests that the transition to a market-based economy requires a different approach to management and leadership, one that emphasizes performance and accountability rather than trust and commitment."
