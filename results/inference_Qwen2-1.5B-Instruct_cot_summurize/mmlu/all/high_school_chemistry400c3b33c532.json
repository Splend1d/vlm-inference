For Cr, A = P + N + E.\n\nGiven that Z = 24, we need to find P, N, and E:\n\n- Since Cr has 24 electrons:\n  - E = 24\n\nNow, calculate P and N:\n\n- From the periodic table, the average atomic mass for Cr is approximately 51.998 u. However, since this is not exact due to the uncertainty principle, let's assume it's closest to 52.000 u.\n  \nUsing the relation between atomic mass (A), atomic number (Z), and atomic weight (W):\n  - W = A/Z\n  - W = 52.000/24 \u2248 2.1667 u\n  - Using the relation between atomic number (Z), atomic mass (A), and atomic weight (W):\n    - A = Z * W\n    - A = 24 * 2.1667 \u2248 51.998 u\n\nSo, using the given information that the average atomic mass of Cr is approximately 52.000 u, and knowing that the actual atomic mass of Cr is closer to 52.000 u than to 51.998 u, we can estimate that Cr has about 24 protons and 24 neutrons. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 24 electrons, 28 protons, 24 neutrons."
