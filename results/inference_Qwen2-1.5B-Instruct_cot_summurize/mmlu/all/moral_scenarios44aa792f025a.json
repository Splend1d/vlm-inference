The act of following someone into a private space without their permission is generally considered intrusive and disrespectful, but it is not necessarily considered morally wrong if the person being followed consents or if there are extenuating circumstances.\nIn contrast, the scenario where the main character copies a library book from a public place and returns it to the shelf is considered morally wrong because it violates the rights of the author and publisher of the book. Copying material without permission is generally considered theft, and returning the book to the shelf after copying it suggests that the person did not return the book to its rightful owner."
