Whoever violates this statute shall be fined not more than $1,500 (one thousand five hundred dollars), or imprisoned not more than 45 days, or both. \"A mother purchased an air rifle, which she gave to her son. The mother, a police officer, who was familiar with firearms, trained her son in the systematic practice of care in the use of the air rifle. One afternoon, the son, who was 15 years of age, was playing with his friends. The three boys took turns firing the air rifle, which discharged small pellets, at various targets in the son's back yard. As one of the friends, who was 16 years old, was using the air rifle, he fired a shot over the other friend's head, intending to frighten him. The pellet missed the other friend, but struck a next-door neighbor in the eye, severely injuring her. The mother is subsequently charged with violating the state statute. As her defense, the mother claims that she erroneously believed the statute prohibited firearms to be given or sold to minors under 15 years of age. If the mother's mistaken belief is honest, it should\n\nA. result in her acquittal, because she didn't have the necessary mental state required for the crime.\nB. result in her acquittal, because the friend is 16 years of age or older.\nC. not prevent her conviction, because mistake of law is no defense.\nD. not prevent her conviction, because mistake of fact is no defense.\n"

Not prevent her conviction, because mistake of law is not a defense.\n\nUnder the law, the mother violated the statute because she gave an air rifle to her 15-year-old son and allowed him to use it. This action constitutes giving or selling a firearm to a minor under 16 years of age. Therefore, even if the mother had mistakenly believed that the statute only applied to individuals under 15 years of age, she would still be guilty of violating the statute.\n\nThe mistake of law defense requires that the defendant acted honestly and believed they were complying with the law, but the mistake must be material and the defendant must know their mistake. In this case, the mistake of law defense cannot apply since the mother did not know that she was breaking the law. Instead, the mistake of fact defense may apply. However, the mother's mistake must be reasonable, and in this case, it was not. Therefore, the mistake of fact defense will not apply either. \n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Not prevent her conviction, because mistake of law is not a defense."
