If a drought persists for several years, what should one expect to result from natural selection?\n\nA. Small birds gaining larger beaks by exercising their mouth parts.\nB. Small birds mutating their beak genes with the result that later-generation offspring have larger beaks.\nC. Small birds anticipating the long drought and eating more to gain weight and, consequently, growing larger beaks.\nD. More small-beaked birds dying than larger-beaked birds. The offspring produced in subsequent generations have a higher percentage of birds with large beaks.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D: More small-beaked birds dying than larger-beaked birds.\n\nDuring a drought year, small, easy-to-eat seeds may become scarce, leading to competition among birds for these resources. As a result, smaller birds may need to work harder to find food, which could lead to evolution towards larger beaks as they adapt to finding more difficult to access resources. This process is known as natural selection.\n\nOver time, this selective pressure would favor the evolution of larger beaks in the population of small-beaked birds, allowing them to compete more effectively for scarce food sources during droughts. In contrast, larger-beaked birds would likely have an advantage in accessing food more easily due to their ability to break down tougher seed shells, even if it means consuming seeds that are not as nutritious or tasty.\n\nTherefore, the expected outcome under these conditions is that there will be more small-beaked birds dying off compared to larger-beaked birds, as those with larger beaks are better adapted to the limited food resources available during droughts. This is a classic example of natural selection acting on physical traits to promote survival and reproductive success."
