Innate instincts are genetic instructions passed down from parents that determine basic behavior patterns without conscious thought or experience. Learned behaviors occur as a result of experiences and interactions with other individuals. In this case, the young male would have learned the song of another species by listening to it repeatedly and imitating its pattern.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. both instinctive and learned."
