Tetramethylsilane (TMS) is a common choice for a 1H chemical shift reference because it has a stable and easily accessible proton, which makes it easy to use in chemical shifts experiments. However, it does not necessarily mean that all organic compounds do not contain silicon atoms, as there are some exceptions such as silicon-containing amino acids and sugars."
