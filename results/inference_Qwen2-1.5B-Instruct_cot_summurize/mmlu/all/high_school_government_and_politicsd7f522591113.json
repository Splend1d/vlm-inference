While it is true that interest groups like those represented by businesspeople and investors can have significant influence over legislation through campaign contributions and access to lawmakers, this does not necessarily mean that they will control elections. In fact, some studies suggest that political parties may play a more important role in determining election outcomes than individual interest groups. Therefore, while interest groups can be effective at influencing policy decisions, they do not guarantee victory in an election."
