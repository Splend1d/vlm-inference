The potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency.\n\nEinstein's theory of the photoelectric effect states that when light with a certain frequency falls on a\u91d1\u5c5e\u8868\u9762\uff0cit can cause an electron to be emitted from the surface. This process is called photoelectric emission and it requires a certain amount of energy, which is known as the work function of the metal. \n\nWhen light with a higher frequency falls on the same metal surface, it will have more energy and will be able to remove more electrons from the surface. Therefore, the potential difference required to stop the emitted electrons will also increase. \n\nThis relationship between the frequency of the light and the potential difference required to stop the electrons is described by the equation V = k f where V is the potential difference required to stop the electrons, f is the frequency of the light, and k is a constant that depends on the properties of the metal. \n\nSo, the correct answer is D. The potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency."
