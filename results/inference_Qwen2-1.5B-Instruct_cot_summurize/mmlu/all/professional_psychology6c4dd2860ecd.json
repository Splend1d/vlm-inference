Encouraging healthy behavior and educating the public on problems in society can help create awareness and promote positive change. Building resilience, building self-esteem and social skills, addressing risk factors, and encouraging healthy behavior are all important aspects of promoting health. Implementing advocacy groups for health can also be beneficial, as they can raise awareness and encourage action towards improving health outcomes. However, it is not necessary to target specific problem groups or solely advocate for obesity, as these issues require broader societal changes that involve multiple sectors."
