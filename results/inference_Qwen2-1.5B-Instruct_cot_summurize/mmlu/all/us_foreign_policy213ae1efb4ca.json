Local developments were viewed through a geopolitical lens\n\nThe Cold War context played a significant role in shaping US perceptions of the Third World by emphasizing the geopolitical implications of regional conflicts and tensions. This was particularly evident during periods of heightened military competition between the US and the Soviet Union, which often involved proxy wars in countries such as Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\n\nDuring this period, the US government's policies towards the Third World were often shaped by concerns about global stability, security, and economic interests. The US saw itself as having a responsibility to protect its own national interests while also attempting to promote democratic values and human rights around the world.\n\nAs a result, US policymakers often viewed local developments within the Third World through a geopolitical lens, focusing on issues such as territorial disputes, regional alliances, and strategic vulnerabilities that could impact US interests. This approach sometimes led to a more interventionist foreign policy, with the US intervening militarily or economically in various parts of the world to prevent what it perceived as threats to its security or way of life.\n\nTherefore, option B accurately reflects how the Cold War context influenced US perceptions of the Third World."
