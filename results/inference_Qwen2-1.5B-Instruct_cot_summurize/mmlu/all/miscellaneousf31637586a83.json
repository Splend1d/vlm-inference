Correct toothbrushing technique\n\nCorrect toothbrushing technique is an important developmental milestone that can be achieved by toddlers as early as 6-12 months old. This involves teaching children how to hold their toothbrush with both hands, how to turn it in circular motions, and how to spit after brushing to prevent the spread of germs. It is also important to ensure that the child is not left alone with a toothbrush or any other sharp objects. While growth of permanent teeth, correct use of incisors while eating, and evolution of the human tooth are all related to oral health, they may not be developmentally appropriate for toddlers until later stages of their development."
