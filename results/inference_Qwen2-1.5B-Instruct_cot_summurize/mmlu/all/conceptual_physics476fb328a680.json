When the temperature of the iron strip is increased, its molecules move faster and interact more with each other, causing them to bond more strongly. This results in an increase in the length of the strip due to the formation of new bonds between the atoms.\n\nHowever, this increase in length may not always be accompanied by an equal increase in width. The shape of the iron strip (e.g., rectangular or circular) will also affect how much the length changes compared to the width. In some cases, the length may increase while the width remains constant, resulting in a shorter overall length. Conversely, in other cases, the length may increase while the width decreases, leading to a longer overall length. Therefore, the correct answer is C. may increase and may decrease."
