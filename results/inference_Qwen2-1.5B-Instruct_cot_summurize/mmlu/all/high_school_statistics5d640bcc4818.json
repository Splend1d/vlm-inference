To see if there is a difference between boys and girls in their opposition to the new dress code, they conduct a poll of 60 randomly selected male and 70 randomly selected female high school students in the district. They find that 66 females oppose the dress code and 50 males oppose the dress code. Which of the following explains why a two-proportion z-test is not appropriate?\n\nA. The sample sizes are different.\nB. The sample sizes are too large.\nC. The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.\nD. The shapes of the population distributions are not known.\n"

In this case, the sample size for males (n = 50) is less than 30, while the sample size for females (n = 60) is also less than 30. Therefore, a two-proportion z-test would not be appropriate in this scenario.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of test depends on several factors such as the population distribution, sample size, and the significance level chosen. A more detailed analysis should be conducted to determine which test is most appropriate for this situation."
