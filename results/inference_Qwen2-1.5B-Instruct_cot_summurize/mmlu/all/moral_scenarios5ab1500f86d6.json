Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves not doing something that is considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 - looking up a girl's blouse. This action may be seen as inappropriate or even illegal depending on the circumstances and cultural norms in different regions. \n\nScenario 2 involves painting one's pet a bright shade of purple, which could be seen as a personal choice or a form of self-expression, but it is generally not considered morally wrong either if it aligns with an individual's values and lifestyle choices. It is also important to note that this scenario does not involve any harm or wrongdoing towards others."
