One and only one sperm will fertilize the egg.\n\nAfter fertilization occurs, the acrosome reaction on the sperm's head is triggered, causing it to swell with a fluid called acrosome body. This swelling increases the surface area of the sperm cell, making it more likely to penetrate the outer layer of the egg (the zona pellucida). The cortical reaction on the egg also triggers an increase in membrane fluidity, allowing the sperm to enter the egg more easily. \n\nOnce inside the egg, the sperm begins to move through the cytoplasm of the egg, where it can attach itself to the nuclear envelope using its tail. This process ensures that only one sperm cell will fertilize the egg, resulting in a single zygote. If there were to be multiple sperm cells fertilizing the same egg, the result would be an abnormal number of offspring, known as polyparity or tetraploidy, leading to problems such as chromosomal abnormalities."
