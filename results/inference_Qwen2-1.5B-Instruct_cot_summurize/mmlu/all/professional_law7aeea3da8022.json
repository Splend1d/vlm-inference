S. Senate. One of the columnist's eager young apprentices concocted a plan that he hoped would enable him to gain the columnist's favor. Late one evening, without telling anyone, the apprentice broke into the lawyer's private office and copied several letters pertaining to \"dirty tricks\" perpetrated by the lawyer during the most recent presidential campaign. When the apprentice presented the columnist with the fruits of his diligent research, the columnist was quite impressed and immediately printed excerpts from the material. If the lawyer asserts a claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.\nB. prevail, because the publication was not newsworthy.\nC. not prevail, because what the columnist printed was true, thus establishing there was no \"false light. \"\nD. not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.\n"

This type of defamation occurs when the journalist publishes defamatory statements that damage the plaintiff's reputation or professional standing.\n\nIn this scenario, the plaintiff's reputation has been harmed as a result of the columnist printing excerpts from the letters. The plaintiff may argue that the columnist acted with reckless disregard for the truth, which is required for a successful defamation claim. Additionally, the plaintiff may also be able to show that the columnist knew or should have known that the information contained in the letters was false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts."
