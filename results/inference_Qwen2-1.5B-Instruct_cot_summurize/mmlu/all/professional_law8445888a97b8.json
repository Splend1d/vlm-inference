A hooded sweatshirt and bandana concealed the rest of his face. A few days later, while the victim waited to be interviewed, she observed the defendant being escorted through the courthouse, in jail clothing, and restrained by handcuffs and leg irons. She identified him as the perpetrator shortly thereafter. Will the court allow that identification into evidence?\n\nA. No, because it is not reliable enough and there was too much suggestion to make a reasonably accurate identification.\nB. No, because prior statements of identification are considered hearsay and never allowed into evidence.\nC. Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.\nD. Yes, because the witness' recognition of someone is all that is needed; the reliability or credibility of it is subject to cross examination.\n"

Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.\n\nThis is because the witness's identification based solely on sight, without any other corroborating evidence, is sufficient for admission under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 403 exception to the hearsay rule. FRE 403 allows for identification testimony where the witness perceives the perpetrator by seeing their eyes. The court will consider whether the identification is sufficiently reliable to meet this standard before admitting the identification testimony. \n\nIn this case, the witness's identification is supported by her observation of the defendant's appearance in court, which includes the description of the hooded sweatshirt and bandana covering his face. Therefore, the court would likely admit the identification testimony under FRE 403. However, the reliability of the identification could still be questioned during cross-examination."
