This means that for any polynomial \\(p(x)\\), we can express it as \\(p(x) = q(x)(x - c)\\), where \\(q(x)\\) is some polynomial of lower degree and \\(c\\) is an integer such that \\(c \\neq 0\\).\n\nFor \\(p(x)\\in P\\), let's consider the derivative \\(p'(x)\\). Since \\(p(x)\\) has degree at most 7, \\(p'(x)\\) will have degree at most 6. Therefore, \\(p'(x)\\) cannot be expressed as a product of two polynomials of lower degree. \n\nNow, let's find the basis vectors of \\(r\\), i.e., the polynomials that are mapped to zero by \\(\\mathbf{D}\\):\n\n- For \\(p(x) = x^k\\), the derivative \\(p'(x) = kx^{k-1}\\), so \\(k=0, 1, 2, ..., 6\\).\n- For \\(p(x) = x^k + ax^{k+1} + bx^{k+2} + ... + cx^{k+r}\\), the derivative \\(p'(x) = kx^{k-1} + (k+1)a x^k + b(k+1)x^{k+1} + ... + crx^r\\), so \\(a=b=c=...=0\\).\n\nThus, there are 7 basis vectors in \\(r\\): \\(x^0, x^1, x^2, ..., x^6\\), making the dimension of \\(r\\) equal to 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. n = 1 and r = 7."
