These rights are based on international law, which recognizes the sovereignty of coastal states over their territorial waters and adjacent zone (also known as the continental shelf). The continental shelf extends from the low-water mark of the baseline to 200 nautical miles from the coast, and can be exploited for commercial purposes such as fishing, mining, and oil exploration. However, there are certain restrictions and limitations that apply, including the principle of \"fair use\" and the need to ensure sustainable development."
