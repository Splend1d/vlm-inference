However, if we consider the transaction amounts involved, Stone Co. would need to record the full value of the consigned inventory at December 31 year 1 in its balance sheet. This is because Stone Co. still owes money to the consignees, even though no sales were made.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Option D. $37,800**"
