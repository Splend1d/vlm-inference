While it is true that some solvable groups have prime-power order (e.g., cyclic groups), this does not hold for all solvable groups. For example, the alternating group A5 has order 60 which is not a prime power.\n\nStatement 2: \"Every group of prime-power order is solvable.\" This statement is also false in general. The group Z_p^n is a group of prime-power order, where p is a prime number and n \u2265 1. It is known that every finite abelian group is solvable, so the direct product of two copies of Z_p^n will also be solvable. However, there exist non-abelian groups of prime-power order that are not solvable, such as the dihedral group D_4 \u00d7 D_4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
