The specific range can vary depending on the network operator and location.\n\nIn terms of bandwidth, LTE typically offers 10 MHz or more per carrier, which translates to approximately 2 Mbps or higher for both download and upload speeds. However, the actual speed may be lower due to factors like interference, channel conditions, and other network constraints.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is not listed among the given choices, but rather it's within the theoretical limits that 4G networks can achieve."
