Vertical integration refers to the process of acquiring or merging with another company that controls one's own production and distribution channels, allowing for more efficient use of resources and better control over the entire value chain. This can include companies moving from manufacturing goods in-house to directly selling them to consumers or from distributing products themselves to becoming suppliers to other companies. Therefore, vertical integration tends to occur at the source of supply rather than towards the consumer or in another industry."
