Therefore, there is no critical point in the domain where \\(f'(x) = 0\\).\n\nThe second derivative test tells us that if \\(f''(x) < 0\\) for some \\(x_0\\), then \\(f(x)\\) has a local maximum at \\(x_0\\); if \\(f''(x) > 0\\) for some \\(x_0\\), then \\(f(x)\\) has a local minimum at \\(x_0\\).\n\nHowever, since \\(f''(x) = e^x - c\\) does not change sign over any interval (because \\(c > 0\\)), we can conclude that \\(f(x)\\) has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum. This means that \\(f(x)\\) must have a global minimum somewhere between \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=c\\) because the function increases until \\(x=0\\) and decreases thereafter.\n\nLet's consider the case when \\(x = c\\):\n\n\\[f(c) = e^c - c \\cdot c = e^c - c^2.\\]\n\nThis expression represents the minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) for all real numbers \\(x\\), as shown by the correct answer choice A: \\(f(c)\\)."
