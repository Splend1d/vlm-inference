Memory T cells are specialized cells that remember an antigen (antibody or pathogen) and can quickly respond to that same antigen upon re-exposure, even if it has been modified slightly. This allows the adaptive immune system to rapidly mount a response against pathogens and other antigens without needing to generate new antibodies or T cells from scratch each time. This is why memory T cells are considered to be the most important component of the adaptive immune system."
