They looked and thought like us.\n\nAnatomically modern humans and Neanderthals were similar in many ways, including their physical appearance, brain size, and cognitive abilities. However, there were also significant differences, such as their use of language and tool-making techniques. It is likely that they had different genetic makeup and evolutionary histories that led to these differences. While we share some similarities with Neanderthals, it's important to note that they lived thousands of years before us and had evolved independently from Homo sapiens."
