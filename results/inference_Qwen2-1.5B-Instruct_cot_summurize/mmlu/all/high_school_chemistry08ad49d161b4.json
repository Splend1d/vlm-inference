The kinetic energy of gas molecules increases by a factor of 2 when the temperature is increased from 50\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C.\n\nThis is because the kinetic energy of a molecule depends on its temperature and mass. According to the equation for kinetic energy (KE), KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass of the molecule and v is its velocity, an increase in temperature will result in an increase in both the mass (since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy per particle) and the speed (which is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass). Therefore, if we double the temperature, the kinetic energy doubles as well.\n\nSo, the velocity of the gas molecules increases by a factor of 2 when the temperature is increased from 50\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C, which corresponds to option C."
