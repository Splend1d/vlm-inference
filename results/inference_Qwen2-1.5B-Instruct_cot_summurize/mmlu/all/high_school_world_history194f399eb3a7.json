And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.\"\nLetter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879\nIncidents such as those described by the author of the letter were used by the British government to do which of the following?\n\nA. Issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu\nB. Tax the Zulu kingdom to cover damages attributed to them\nC. Sever its responsibility to protect citizens who chose to live in South Africa\nD. Liberate the Zulus from British colonialism\n"
