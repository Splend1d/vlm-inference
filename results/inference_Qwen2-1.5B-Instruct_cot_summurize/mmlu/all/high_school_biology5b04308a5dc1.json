They carry blood away from the heart.\n\nArteries are the largest blood vessels in the body and carry deoxygenated blood from the body to the various organs, tissues, and cells throughout the body. They are thick-walled blood vessels with high-pressure walls that help push the blood forward against gravity. Arteries also have a higher resistance than veins, which allows them to deliver blood at a faster rate to the target organ or tissue. In contrast, veins are smaller blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood from the body's organs and tissues back to the heart. Veins are thinner-walled and less resistant than arteries, allowing more fluid to flow through them as it returns blood to the heart."
