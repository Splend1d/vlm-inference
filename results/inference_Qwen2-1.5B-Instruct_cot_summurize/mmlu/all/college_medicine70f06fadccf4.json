This occurs primarily in the nucleus and can be a two-step process depending on the organism's genetic makeup. The first step involves DNA replication, where the entire DNA double helix is replicated into two identical strands of DNA (which is then called the template for the second step). In the second step, the RNA polymerase enzyme binds to one of these newly synthesized DNA strands and begins transcribing it into an RNA molecule. This process is essential for gene expression and protein synthesis in all living organisms."
