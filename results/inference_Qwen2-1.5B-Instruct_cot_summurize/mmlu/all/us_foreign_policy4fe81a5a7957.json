Anarchy\n\nRealists believe that an anarchic international system means that there is no central authority or governing body that controls the behavior of states in the international system. This lack of central authority leads to competition for power among states, which can result in armed conflict. In contrast, the domestic system refers to the relationships and interactions within a state, such as between government officials and citizens."
