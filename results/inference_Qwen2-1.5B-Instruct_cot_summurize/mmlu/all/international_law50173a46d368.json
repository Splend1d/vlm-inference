This means that even if the defendant was not present in the state at the time of the crime, they may still be subject to prosecution for the crime if it caused harm within the state's borders.\n\nIn other words, the effects doctrine allows a state to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed outside its own territory, but if those crimes cause harm within the state's borders, the state can bring charges against the defendant. This doctrine helps ensure that states have the ability to address and prevent harm caused by individuals who commit crimes anywhere in the world, regardless of their location."
