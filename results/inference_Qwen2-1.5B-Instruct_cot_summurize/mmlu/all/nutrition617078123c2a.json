Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes is caused by several mechanisms, including increased glucose production by the liver (A), impaired insulin secretion (B), and decreased glucose uptake from the skeletal muscle (C). However, D suggests that all of these mechanisms are incorrect, which contradicts the evidence supporting each mechanism as part of the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, option D is not correct."
