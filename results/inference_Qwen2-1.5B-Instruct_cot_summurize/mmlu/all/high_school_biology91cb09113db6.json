If this bag were instead placed into a beaker of distilled water, what would be the expected result?\n\nA. There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.\nB. There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\nC. The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.\nD.

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.\n\nWhen an object with a higher concentration of solutes (solute) than another object with lower concentration of solutes (solvent) is placed in contact with that solvent, the solute molecules will move from the concentrated object to the dilute object until equilibrium is reached. In this case, the dialysis bag with its high concentration of solutes is placed in contact with the low concentration of solutes in the beaker of distilled water. As a result, the solute molecules will migrate towards the less concentrated environment and fill up the space inside the bag, leading to swelling or expansion of the bag.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct explanation for what would happen if the dialysis bag were instead placed into a beaker of distilled water."
