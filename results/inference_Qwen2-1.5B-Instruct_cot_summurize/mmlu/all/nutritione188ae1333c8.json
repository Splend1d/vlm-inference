Palmitic acid. \n\nPalmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid that cannot undergo de novo synthesis in the liver to produce glucose, as it does not contain a keto group (-COOH) necessary for the formation of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors such as acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. \n\nThe other options - glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and galactose can all serve as substrates for gluconeogenesis by providing a keto group or a phosphate group (in the case of aspartic acid), respectively, which are required for the formation of glucose."
