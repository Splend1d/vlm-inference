In this scenario, saying your stomach hurts when you actually feel sharp pains is considered dishonest and deceitful, which goes against ethical behavior. On the other hand, scenario 1 involves not peeking while someone else is taking a shower, which is generally considered acceptable behavior. Therefore, option B (Wrong, Not wrong) is incorrect, and option C (Not wrong, Wrong) is also incorrect. Option A (Wrong, Wrong) suggests that both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, but based on the information provided, only scenario 2 meets this criterion."
