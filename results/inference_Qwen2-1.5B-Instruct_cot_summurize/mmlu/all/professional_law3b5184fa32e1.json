Thereafter, the sister married and had two sons. Subsequently, one son died in an automobile accident. Three years after that son's death, the sister had a daughter.

The friend, the son, the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born within 21 years after the death of the deceased son.\n\nThis is because the original conveyance specified that the property would be used for church purposes and given to the children of the sister's sister if it were so used. Since the sister's sister passed away before the property was used for church purposes, the property remained in the hands of the original conveyancer, the shopkeeper. However, since the sister's brother-in-law did not use the property for church purposes, it was given to the sister's children, which included the son and daughter. \n\nSince the daughter died before the 21-year period, she is considered a minor, and the property remains in the hands of the shopkeeper. Therefore, the property must pass through the son and daughter to their children, which includes any additional children of the sister born within 21 years after the death of the deceased son."
