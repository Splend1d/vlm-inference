This means that many people in developing countries are living longer and experiencing higher rates of aging compared to those in wealthier countries.\n\nThe third statement, \"In older age groups men outnumber women,\" is incorrect. While there may be some variations between different countries, overall men tend to live longer than women, so it is more common for men to outnumber women in older age groups.\n\nThe fourth statement, \"Men have a lower mortality rate than women, over the life course,\" is partially correct. While there may be differences in mortality rates between genders, it is not accurate to say that men have a lower mortality rate than women across all ages. Mortality rates can vary widely depending on factors such as genetics, lifestyle choices, and access to healthcare."
