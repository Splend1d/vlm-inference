However, without further information about the specific cause of the patient's asthma, it is difficult to determine the best course of action. The patient should continue to use their albuterol inhaler as needed, and if necessary, they may need to increase the dose or switch to a different medication. Additionally, the patient should avoid triggers such as allergens and smoke, maintain a healthy weight, and manage stress. Finally, they should discuss their concerns with their healthcare provider and consider additional testing or interventions as recommended by their healthcare team."
