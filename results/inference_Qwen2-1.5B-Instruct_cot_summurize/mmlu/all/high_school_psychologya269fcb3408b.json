A man slaps his wife because he is angry that she made hamburgers for dinner again.\n\nHostile aggression involves a person's aggressive behavior directed towards another individual, typically resulting in harm or injury. In this case, the husband slaps his wife as a result of her perceived actions, which led him to feel angry and frustrated. This type of aggression often occurs due to emotional distress rather than physical need or desire. Hostile aggression is generally characterized by a lack of empathy towards the victim and may involve threats or verbal abuse. The other options do not fit the definition of hostile aggression, as they do not involve direct harm or injury to another person."
