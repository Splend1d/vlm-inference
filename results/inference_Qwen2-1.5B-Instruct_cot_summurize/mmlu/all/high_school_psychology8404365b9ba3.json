According to Dr. William Sears, infants who have longer and more frequent periods of REM sleep tend to develop better motor skills and cognitive abilities than those who do not get enough REM sleep. The REM sleep cycle is characterized by rapid eye movements, vivid dreaming, and increased brain activity, which helps the brain consolidate memories and prepare for the next day's activities. Therefore, it is important for parents to ensure that their baby gets adequate amounts of REM sleep during the night."
