Therefore, \\(4x + 6y\\) is also divisible by 11.\n\nB. \\(x + y + 5\\)\n\nThis does not directly follow from our initial condition because adding 5 does not necessarily ensure divisibility by 11 based on our given information about \\(3x + 7y\\).\n\nC. \\(9x + 4y\\)\n\nSimilarly, subtracting 4y from both sides gives us:\n\n\\[9x = 9x + 4y - 4y = (3x + 7y) \\times \\frac{9}{3} - 3y\\]\n\nSince \\(3x + 7y\\) is divisible by 11, subtracting 3y from the right-hand side ensures divisibility by 11. However, this approach relies on the fact that 3x + 7y itself is divisible by 11, but it doesn't guarantee divisibility if you just add or subtract numbers within this context.\n\nD. \\(4x - 9y\\)\n\nThis expression is derived from subtracting 9y from 4x, which is equivalent to:\n\n\\[4x - 9y = (3x + 7y) \\times \\frac{4}{3} - 2(3x + 7y)\\]\n\nAs before, since \\(3x + 7y\\) is divisible by 11, subtracting 2 times the same quantity is still guaranteed to leave a number divisible by 11. This shows that \\(4x - 9y\\) is also divisible by 11.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, only A. \\(4x + 6y\\) and D. \\(4x - 9y\\) must always be divisible by 11, assuming the conditions hold true."
