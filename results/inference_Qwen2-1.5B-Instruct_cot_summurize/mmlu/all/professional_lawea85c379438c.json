During the party, the defendant invited the victim into his bedroom to show her his tattoos. When she entered his bedroom, the defendant ripped off her blouse and threw her onto his bed. He then jumped on the victim and tried to pull off her skirt. When the victim began to scream, some of the guests rushed into the bedroom and pulled the defendant off the victim. At trial, the defendant testified that he wanted to have sexual intercourse with the victim but he believed that she was consenting. The defendant further testified that he had consumed a pint of whiskey earlier in the evening and was intoxicated at the time the incident occurred. If the jury believes that the victim did not consent but also believes that the defendant, in his intoxicated state, honestly believed that she was consenting, the defendant should be found\n\nA. guilty, because consent is determined by the objective manifestations of the victim and not the subjective beliefs of the defendant.\nB. guilty, because voluntary intoxication is no defense.\nC. not guilty, because he honestly believed that she was consenting.\nD. not guilty, because his belief that she was consenting was reasonable.\n"

Not guilty, because his belief that she was consenting was reasonable.\n\nIn order for a defendant to be found guilty of attempted rape, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to engage in sexual activity with the victim without her consent. However, if the jury believes that the victim did not consent but also believes that the defendant, in his intoxicated state, honestly believed that she was consenting, the defendant may still be found not guilty.\n\nIt is important to note that voluntary intoxication can serve as a valid defense against charges of attempted rape or any other violent crime. In this case, the defendant's belief that he was truly consensual is what led him to attempt to sexually assault the victim. This belief was not based on coercion or manipulation, but rather on an honest mistake. Therefore, even if the jury believes that the victim did not consent, the defendant's belief that she was consenting could be considered a mitigating factor that allows him to be acquitted."
