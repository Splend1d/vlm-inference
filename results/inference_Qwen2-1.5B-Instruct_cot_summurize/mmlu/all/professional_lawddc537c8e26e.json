His neighbor wants to buy it so he can make his yard bigger and use the structure as a storage space, so he agrees to buy the bungalow in a written agreement. The sale is to be complete on October 14. On October 10, the neighbor realizes he cannot pay $10,000, and offers to pay $8,000 instead. The man agrees, and the exchange takes place on October 14. The man then sues for the remaining $2000. Would he likely prevail in getting the additional $2,000 that is part of the signed contract?\n\nA. No, the modification of the sales price was accepted and therefore both parties are bound to the $8000 price.\nB. Yes, there was a lack of additional consideration under the pre-existing duty rule so that the modification was invalid and the original price was still valid.\nC. No the original contract was a unilateral contract that could not be modified and had to be performed at the original price.\nD. No, there was full performance of the contract.\n"

Yes, there was a lack of additional consideration under the pre-existing duty rule so that the modification was invalid and the original price was still valid.\n\nWhen a party modifies an existing contract by changing the terms without any new consideration, the modification is considered void and unenforceable. In this case, the man agreed to buy the bungalow for $8,000, but later changed his mind and offered to pay $2000 more. This change in price was not accompanied by any new consideration, such as money or something of value exchanged, which means the modification was void and the original price of $8,000 remained valid.\n\nTherefore, the man would likely prevail in getting the additional $2,000 that is part of the signed contract."
