Since there are infinitely many possible outcomes for each function, the set of all such functions is also uncountable.\n- D: The set of all finite subsets of R is countable since it consists of finitely many elements for each natural number n.\n\nTherefore, the set of all functions from R to {0, 1} has the greatest cardinality among the given options."
