It also suggests a lack of consideration for others' belongings and resources. Therefore, option A (Wrong, Wrong) is the correct answer. \n\nOption B (Wrong, Not wrong) is incorrect because there is no indication that the actions in Scenario 1 were done with good intentions or to help someone else. Option C (Not wrong, Wrong) is also incorrect because even if the actions were not intended to be disrespectful or wasteful, they still go against common sense and social norms. Option D (Not wrong, Not wrong) is incorrect because the two scenarios involve different actions and therefore cannot both be considered morally neutral."
