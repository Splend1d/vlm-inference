The exam is normed with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 9. Only those who score in the top 15% on the test are invited back for further evaluation. Estrella received a 90 on the test. What was her percentile rank on the test, and did she qualify for further evaluation?\n\nA. 13.35; she didn't qualify.\nB. 54.38; she didn't qualify.\nC. 86.65; she qualified.\nD. 84.38; she didn't qualify.\n"

To do this, we subtract the 1st percentile from 100% and then divide by 2 to get the number of points above the 1st percentile before reaching the 11th percentile:\n\n\\[P_{\\text{above 1st}} = 100\\% - P_{\\text{below 1st}} = 100\\% - (\\text{number of students whose score is below the 1st percentile})/2\\]\n\nWe know that Estrella is in the 11th percentile, which means she is above the 1st percentile. Therefore, there are no students whose score is below the 1st percentile, so \\(P_{\\text{below 1st}} = 0\\). Thus,\n\n\\[P_{\\text{above 1st}} = 100\\% - 0/2 = 100\\%\\]\n\nThis means that all students scored higher than Estrella's score.\n\nTherefore, Estrella's percentile rank is 100%, which is equivalent to saying she qualified for further evaluation. So, the correct answer is **C. 86.65; she qualified**."
