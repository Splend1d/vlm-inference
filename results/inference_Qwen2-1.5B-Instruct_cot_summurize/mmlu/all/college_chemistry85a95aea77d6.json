For a proton (I=1/2), the NMR frequency at a given magnetic field B is given by:\n\nf = B * g * hbar / m\n\nwhere f is the NMR frequency in Hz, B is the magnetic field strength in Tesla, g is the gyromagnetic ratio (1.359 for protons in water), hbar is the reduced Planck constant (1.0545718 x 10^-34 kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s), and m is the mass of the nucleus.\n\nFor a 20.0 T magnetic field, we can plug the values into the equation to find the NMR frequency:\n\nf = 20.0 * 1.359 * 1.0545718 x 10^-34 / (1.0545718 x 10^-34) = 239.2 MHz\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 239.2 MHz."
