This can lead to collusion and manipulation of prices, as well as reduce competition and innovation in the marketplace. It is not uncommon for companies to engage in price fixing in order to maintain or increase their profits during periods of low demand or high costs. However, it is generally considered unethical and illegal in many jurisdictions."
