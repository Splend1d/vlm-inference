The homeowner paid the contractor only $20,000, truthfully saying that she did not like the finish on the cabinets and was therefore not satisfied. If the contractor sues the homeowner for the balance of the contract price, will the contractor be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a condition to the homeowner's obligation to pay was not satisfied.\nB. No, because the contractor breached his duty of good faith and fair dealing by supplying unsatisfactory materials.\nC. Yes, because the homeowner breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by rejecting the cabinets without justification.\nD. Yes, because the homeowner was the first party to breach the contract.\n"

No, because a condition to the homeowner's obligation to pay was not satisfied.\n\nThe condition that was not satisfied is that the homeowner had to provide satisfactory work or goods as per the contract terms. In this case, the homeowner did not provide the goods as promised, which is why the contractor cannot seek payment for the remaining amount. Therefore, the contractor will likely prevail in the lawsuit."
