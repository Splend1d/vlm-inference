Convolving an image with any matrix that does not have all ones on the diagonal will result in a shift or rotation of the image, which can cause it to lose information and become distorted. However, if the matrix has all ones on the diagonal, then it will not change the image at all. For example, the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ shifts the image by one pixel in each direction, while the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ scales the image proportionally, while the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ flips the image horizontally and vertically."
