Failing to sign a bill after Congress has adjourned\n\nUnder Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution, the President of the United States has the power to \"sign or veto\" bills passed by Congress. If the President fails to sign a bill within ten days of its receipt (which is called a \"pocket veto\"), it becomes law unless overridden by Congress in a joint session of both houses within 10 days. The President can then issue a \"pocket veto\" if they choose not to sign the bill at all. This is different from a pocket veto that occurs when the President's term ends and the new President takes office without having signed any bills into law during their first year in office, as mentioned in the question about a possible situation with foreign policy negotiations."
