Peristalsis\n\nPeristalsis is the involuntary movement of the walls of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the stomach and intestines, in response to chemical signals from the brain or other stimuli in the body. In the case of peristalsis in the stomach, it involves the coordinated contractions of the muscular layers that form the stomach wall, which help push food into the small intestine for digestion.\n\nAbsorption refers to the process by which nutrients are taken up by the body from the digestive tract. Emulsion refers to the formation of droplets within a liquid medium, typically used in food preparation. Regurgitation refers to the act of regurgitating food back into the mouth or digestive tract after eating.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Peristalsis."
