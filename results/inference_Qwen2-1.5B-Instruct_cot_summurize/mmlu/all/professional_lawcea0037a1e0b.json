As a nurse employed by the hospital was pushing the wheelchair through a set of automatic doors at a normal pace, the doors closed on the patient's foot, injuring it. The nurse attempted to pull the wheelchair back through the doors. This action caused the doors to close more tightly on the patient's foot, injuring it further. The patient sued the hospital, alleging improper maintenance of the doors. The patient has produced no evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. The hospital has moved for summary judgment. Should the court grant the hospital's motion?\n\nA. No, because a jury could find that there was a latent defect in the doors.\nB. No, because a jury could find the hospital liable for negligence based on res ipsa loquitur.\nC. Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the nurse's action was a superseding cause of the injury. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because proof of an accident, by itself, does not establish that an injured person was a victim of negligence.\n\nThe court should grant the hospital's motion for summary judgment because the patient's claim is based solely on the hospital's failure to maintain the doors properly and the nurse's actions were not sufficient to establish negligence on the part of the hospital. The patient did not provide any evidence of specific conduct or neglect on the part of the hospital that would have caused the automatic doors to malfunction. Therefore, the court should rule against the patient and allow the hospital to proceed with its defense."
