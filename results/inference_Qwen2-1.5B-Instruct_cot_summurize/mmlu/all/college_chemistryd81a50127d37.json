Copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and cobalt (Co) are all metals with stable positive oxidation states. Zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), and gallium (Ga) are also metals but do not typically have stable positive oxidation states in their reduced forms. Sodium (Na), barium (Ba), and aluminum (Al) are also metals but do not typically have stable positive oxidation states either. Magnesium (Mg) has a stable positive oxidation state, but it does not form part of the active site of redox enzymes."
