The sequence for each step is:\n\n- Starting with \\(12\\):\n\\[ f(12) = \\frac{1 + 12}{1 - 12} = \\frac{13}{-11} = -13 \\]\n- Then:\n\\[ g(-13) = \\frac{-2}{-13 + 1} = \\frac{-2}{-12} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nSince the sequence alternates between applying \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), after one iteration, it will return to the original value, so we can apply \\(g\\) again, which gives us another application of \\(f\\):\n\n\\[ g(\\frac{1}{6}) = \\frac{-2}{\\frac{1}{6} + 1} = \\frac{-2}{\\frac{7}{6}} = -\\frac{12}{7} \\]\n\nContinuing in this way, we'll apply \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) eight times:\n\n- First iteration: \\(f(-\\frac{12}{7}) = \\frac{1 - \\frac{12}{7}}{1 + \\frac{12}{7}} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{7}}{\\frac{19}{7}} = \\frac{5}{19}\\)\n- Second iteration: \\(g(\\frac{5}{19}) = \\frac{-2}{\\frac{5}{19} + 1} = \\frac{-2}{\\frac{14}{9}} = -\\frac{18}{14}\\)\n\nWe continue this process for each iteration, but since we're looking for a pattern or shortcut, let's notice that the final result seems to be approaching some sort of fixed point, possibly due to the alternating nature of the functions. However, without additional information or simplification steps, it's challenging to determine an exact numerical value for the fixed point. \n\nGiven the complexity and potential infinite iterations, we might not have a simple closed-form solution like a single answer from choices A through D. It would require further analysis or iterative calculations beyond the scope of typical mathematical problems. In a practical scenario, such a calculation might involve numerical methods or specialized algorithms designed for these types of sequences, rather than straightforward algebraic manipulation. If you intended for a direct analytical solution within the given constraints, there may not be a straightforward, unique answer from the options provided, as the sequence becomes increasingly complex and unpredictable with each iteration."
