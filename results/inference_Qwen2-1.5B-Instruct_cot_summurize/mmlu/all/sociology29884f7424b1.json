They represent images of women as both domesticated and independent\n\nSoap operas have been identified as a \"feminine genre\" by Pilcher (1999) due to their portrayal of strong, independent women who are not subservient to men or society's expectations. These characters often defy traditional gender roles and challenge societal norms around femininity and masculinity. The representation of these complex and multifaceted women on screen can be seen as empowering for women and challenging to male stereotypes."
