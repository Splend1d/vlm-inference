The patient may choose to adopt, receive in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, undergo an amniocentesis before pregnancy, or consider other fertility treatments such as egg donation. Ultimately, the decision should be based on the patient's personal goals, medical history, and preferences, and should be made in consultation with a qualified healthcare provider."
