According to Nussbaum, Aristotle believed that the reference of each virtue term was fixed by our experiences and how we engage with the world around us. This means that virtues such as courage or justice were not innate qualities but rather learned through experience and practice. Nussbaum argues that this understanding of virtue ethics emphasizes the importance of practical wisdom in shaping one's character and behavior."
