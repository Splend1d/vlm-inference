The tax shield can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nTax Shield = Value of Firm - Value of Unlevered Firm\n\nGiven that the value of the firm is $5 million, the value of the unlevered firm is $4.78 million, and the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is $360,000, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the tax shield:\n\nTax Shield = 5,000,000 - 4,78,00000\n\nTax Shield = $220,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $220,000."
