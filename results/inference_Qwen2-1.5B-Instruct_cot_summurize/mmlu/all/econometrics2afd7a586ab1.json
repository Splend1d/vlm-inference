The p-value is only one piece of evidence that can help us make a decision about the null hypothesis. It is possible that the observed effect size is just too small for us to reject the null hypothesis at the chosen level of significance, even if it is significant when looking at one-tailed alternatives. Therefore, we need more data or additional information to make a definitive conclusion about which alternative hypothesis is true."
