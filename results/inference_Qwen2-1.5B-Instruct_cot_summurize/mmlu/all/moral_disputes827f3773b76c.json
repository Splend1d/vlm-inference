The abortion issue can be settled just by determining at what stage (if any) the fetus is a person.\n\nThis is because Thomson's argument against abortion does not address the moral implications of allowing abortions to occur based solely on the stage of fetal development. Instead, his focus was on the ethical treatment of the fetus itself as an individual with rights. Therefore, Thomson's conclusion is not relevant to the abortion issue, which is about when abortions should be allowed under certain circumstances."
