The error terms will be heteroscedastic and not normally distributed.\n\nIn the linear probability model, we assume that the probability of an event occurring is a linear function of some independent variables. This means that the probability can only take on values between 0 and 1. However, the error term (the difference between the predicted value and the actual observed value) in the model can have different variances depending on the level of the independent variable. This is called heteroscedasticity. \n\nAdditionally, because the error term is binary (either 0 or 1), it cannot be normally distributed. It will instead follow a Bernoulli distribution, which has a mean of 0.5 and a variance of 0.25.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The error terms will be heteroscedastic and not normally distributed."
