For adults, the normal range of heart rate during rest is typically between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm). However, it's important to note that individual differences in heart rate variability can occur and may not fall exactly within this range. It's always best to consult with a healthcare provider or a fitness professional for personalized advice on your heart rate and overall health."
