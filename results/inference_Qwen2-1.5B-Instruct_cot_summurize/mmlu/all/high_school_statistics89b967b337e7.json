This value represents the z-score corresponding to the 2.5th percentile of the standard normal distribution, which gives us the margin of error for our confidence interval. The formula for calculating the margin of error using a z-score and the desired confidence level is:\n\nMargin of Error = Z * Standard Error\n\nwhere Z is the z-score with the desired confidence level, S is the sample size, and n is the total number of observations.\n\nFor a 94% confidence interval, we use Z = 1.96, since 94% corresponds to the 75th percentile on the standard normal curve. We also know that the margin of error E can be calculated as:\n\nE = Z * SE\n\nwhere SE is the estimated standard error. The standard error (SE) is an estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, and it can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSE = sqrt(p(1-p)/n)\n\nwhere p is the sample proportion, n is the sample size, and SE is the estimated standard error.\n\nGiven the information provided, we cannot determine the exact value of p from the given data. However, if you have additional information about the sample proportions or the population size, we could calculate the estimated standard error and find the appropriate z-score for the desired confidence level. Once we have the z-score, we can plug it into the formula for the margin of error and solve for the confidence interval."
