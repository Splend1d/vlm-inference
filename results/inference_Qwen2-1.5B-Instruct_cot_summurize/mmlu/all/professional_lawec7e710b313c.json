The producer sent the manufacturer a sheet containing the dimensions of the boxes' needs, as well as the logo to be placed on each box. After negotiations, the parties entered into a written contract whereby the manufacturer agreed to supply the producer with as many of the boxes as the producer may require up to a maximum of 10,000 per month. Later that day, the producer telephoned the manufacturer and said that they were running a one-time promotion and expected to sell an unusually large number of widgets. Therefore, for the first month only, they would need 15,000 boxes. The manufacturer agreed to this request. The manufacturer's oral agreement to supply the producer with the 15,000 boxes for the first month would most likely be held\n\nA. enforceable.\nB. unenforceable, because their written contract on the same date was the final integration of the terms of their agreement.\nC. unenforceable, because the agreement was violative of the parol evidence rule.\nD. unenforceable, because there was inadequate consideration to support the manufacturer's unilateral promise.\n"

Therefore, any subsequent oral agreement or promise by either party to provide more boxes than specified in the original contract would not be enforceable unless it can be shown that the other party had notice of the additional demand and agreed to it. In this case, the manufacturer did agree to the additional demand made by the producer, so the oral agreement would be enforceable. However, if the producer later breached the original contract by refusing to pay for the extra boxes, then the manufacturer could sue for breach of contract under the original written contract."
