We're given that there are 256 unique values.\n\n\\[ n = \\log_2{256} + 1 \\]\n\\[ n = 8 + 1 \\]\n\\[ n = 9 \\]\n\nThis means we need at least 9 bits (or 3 digits) to represent all 256 possible values in ternary logic. However, since we're working with ternary logic where \"true\" is represented by 0, \"false\" by 1, and \"unknown\" or \"not applicable\" by 2, the total number of \"flits,\" or ternary logic elements, will be \\( 9 + 1 = 10 \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 6**."
