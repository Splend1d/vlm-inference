If both parents are A, then there's only one way to get a child with type O blood because it would mean the child inherits all of its genes from each parent. \n\nIf one parent is A and the other is B, then there are three ways for the child to inherit type O blood:\n\n- Both parents are A.\n- One parent is A and the other is B.\n- One parent is B and the other is A.\n\nSo, the probability that the child has type O blood is 3/4 = 75%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 25%**."
