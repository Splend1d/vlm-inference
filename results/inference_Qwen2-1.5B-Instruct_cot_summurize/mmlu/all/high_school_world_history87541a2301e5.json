The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nWhich of the following was a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s?\n\nA. Russia was excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance).\nB. Russia benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\nC. Islam became the dominant religion of Russia.\nD. Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D: Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy.\n\nThe passage states that after the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s, it \"benefited by becoming the administrative center of Mongol political activity.\" This suggests that the Mongols established a centralized government in Russia, which allowed them to control and manage the region more effectively. This was likely a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not mention any exclusion of Russia from Western European developments like the Renaissance. Option B is also incorrect because the passage states that the Mongols established a centralized government in Russia, not that they were the administrative center of Mongol political activity. Option C is also incorrect because the passage mentions that the Mongols established a centralized government in Russia, but it does not say that Islam became the dominant religion there."
