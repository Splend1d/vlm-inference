                    "text": "The correct answer is C: Both accruals and deferrals are concerned with expected future cash receipts and payments.\n\nIn accrual accounting, an accrual occurs when a business records revenue or expenses based on what it expects to happen in the future rather than on what actually happened in the past. For example, if a company expects to receive $100,000 in sales next year, it would record that amount as an accrual in its financial statements. This means that the company has not yet received the money but has recognized it as a liability because it expects to receive it in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, deferral refers to the recognition of cash flows from events that have already occurred but which will not be paid off until later. In accrual accounting, deferred revenues (revenue that is due in the future) and deferred expenses (expenses that are due in the future) are recorded in the balance sheet. These items represent cash that has been earned but not yet collected, or spent but not yet paid for.\n\nTherefore, both accruals and deferrals involve recording transactions in the future, but they do so at different times relative to the actual occurrence of those transactions."
