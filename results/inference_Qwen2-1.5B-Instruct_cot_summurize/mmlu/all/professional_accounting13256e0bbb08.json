However, for practical purposes, we can say it's effectively zero because the growth of money over time becomes negligible at very high rates.\n\nThus, the present value would be very close to zero but not exactly zero since we're dealing with an annuity where the payments continue indefinitely, so it's impossible to calculate an exact amount without knowing the total number of payments.\n\nThe closest answer choice to what we've calculated is:\n\nB. $2"
