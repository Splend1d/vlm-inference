If someone suffers from this phobia, they may avoid sleeping in the dark or even stay awake at night if possible. Hypnophobia refers to the fear of being hypnotized or having one's mind controlled by another person, while cryptophobia is the fear of cemeteries. Hadephobia is not a recognized term in psychology, but it could refer to a specific fear of the dark that is unique to an individual."
