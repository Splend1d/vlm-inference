Subsequently, the woman sued the driver of the vehicle to recover damages for her injuries. At trial, the woman calls a police officer to testify that a few minutes after the accident, a driver stopped him and said, \"Hey, officer, I just saw an accident involving a red truck that hit this girl who was riding a bicycle. The truck left the scene of the accident and I followed it to a warehouse. \" The police officer then testified that he immediately drove to the warehouse and saw the defendant sitting in a red truck that was parked in the lot. The driver is available to testify at trial. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the police officer's testimony regarding the driver's statement should be\n\nA. admissible as a statement of recent perception.\nB. admissible as a present sense impression.\nC. inadmissible, because the driver was available to testify at trial.\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

In general, statements made out of court cannot be used as evidence unless they fall under one of several exceptions. One such exception is when the statement is made under oath or affirmation. However, in this case, the police officer did not make a statement under oath or affirmation.\n\nAdditionally, the police officer's testimony about what the driver told him is hearsay and therefore cannot be admitted into evidence. Hearsay is considered irrelevant and prejudicial, and it is generally inadmissible except when it falls under certain exceptions. In this case, there are no recognized exceptions for the police officer's testimony. Therefore, it should be excluded from the trial."
