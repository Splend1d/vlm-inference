                    "text": "The correct answer is D: the ratio of force to mass is the same.\n\nWhen an object falls under the influence of gravity, it experiences a downward force equal to its weight (mg). This downward force is directed towards the center of the Earth, which means that the net force acting on the object is also directed downwards. However, since the object is accelerating towards the center of the Earth at a constant rate, there is no upward force opposing the downward force, so the object's velocity remains constant.\n\nThis means that the ratio of force to mass is the same for both objects. The heavier rock has more mass than the lighter rock, but the gravitational force acting on both objects is the same. Therefore, the acceleration of each object will be the same.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the force due to gravity is not the same on both rocks; it depends on their masses. Option B is incorrect because air resistance can affect the motion of the rocks, although it is negligible for small objects like rocks falling from high altitudes. Option C is also incorrect because the inertial properties of the rocks do not play a role in determining their acceleration."
