According to Craig's argument, the series of events in time cannot be actually infinite because if it were, then there would be no cause for the first event. Therefore, the universe could not have existed before the first event, which means it must have had a cause. However, if the universe has an infinite past, then it would not have been caused by anything, which would mean it was uncaused. This contradicts the idea that the universe has a beginning, which is why Craig believes that the universe is finite in the past and began to exist."
