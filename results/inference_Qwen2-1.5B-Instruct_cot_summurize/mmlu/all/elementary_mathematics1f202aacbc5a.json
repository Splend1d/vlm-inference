This means that each penny contributes 1/7th (or 0.142857) of a centimeter to the total height. \n\nIf Nick's stack of pennies has a height of 4 centimeters, then the number of pennies in his stack can be calculated by dividing the total height by the height contributed by one penny:\n\nn = 4 / (1/7) = 4 * 7 = 28\n\nSo, the number of pennies in Nick's stack is 28. The other options are incorrect because they do not take into account the relationship between the number of pennies and their contribution to the total height."
