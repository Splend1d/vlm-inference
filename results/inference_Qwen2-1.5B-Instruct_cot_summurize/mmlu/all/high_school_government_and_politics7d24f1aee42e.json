The National Rifle Association (NRA) and other powerful interest groups such as anti-abortion activists have been able to gain significant legislative victories through strategic lobbying and mobilization efforts among their supporters. This demonstrates that even when majorities do not strongly favor certain policies or issues, minority groups with strong advocacy can still significantly impact public policy outcomes."
