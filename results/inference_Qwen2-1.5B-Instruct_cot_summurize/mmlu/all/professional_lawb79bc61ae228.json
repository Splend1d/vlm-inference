The path, made of concrete, led through the woods from a public highway to a pond in the rear of the woman's property. The pathway was used for sledding and the pond for skating by the residents of the neighboring areas, without the consent of the woman. Furthermore, the woman failed to post any signs forbidding trespassing. After the boy had been sledding down the pathway for approximately three hours one morning, he lost control of the sled, and steered it into a tree. The boy suffered serious injuries in the crash. If a suit is brought on the boy's behalf against the woman for the boy's personal injuries, the plaintiff will\n\nA. recover, under the \"attractive nuisance\" doctrine.\nB. recover, because the woman knew or should have known of the frequent trespasses.\nC. not recover, because the boy was a trespasser.\nD. not recover, because a 15-year-old boy should have realized the risk.\n"

In this case, the woman knew or should have known about the frequent use of the pathway by the boy for sledding and the presence of the pond for skating, which could be considered dangerous to children.\n\nHowever, even though the woman may have known or should have known about the risks associated with the pathway, the boy himself was also a trespasser. Trespassers are generally not entitled to recover damages from others who were unaware of their presence. Therefore, the boy cannot recover under the doctrine of attractive nuisance.\n\nAdditionally, as an adult, the boy should have recognized the risks involved in using the pathway and should have taken reasonable precautions to avoid injury. Therefore, the boy cannot recover based solely on the fact that he was a trespasser.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. recover, because the woman knew or should have known of the frequent trespasses."
