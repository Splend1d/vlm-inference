All of the above.\n\nFeminist legal theory has indeed inadvertently led to the under-acknowledgment of the harms of consensual sex due to its emphasis on the concept of consent and the idea that all sex is inherently harmful if it is not consensual. By suggesting that all sex is potentially harmful, even when it is consensual, it can lead to an overemphasis on the idea of sexual harm rather than the importance of consent in ensuring safe and respectful relationships. This can result in a lack of recognition of the potential harms of consensual sex and may contribute to a culture that values sexual harm over sexual safety."
