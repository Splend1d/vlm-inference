Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have no structural similarities.\nC. The organelles in larger eukaryotic cells took care of the problems of having a larger surface area\u2013to\u2013volume ratio.\nD.

Eukaryotic organelles helped create separate environments for metabolic reactions, thus increasing their metabolic efficiency.\n\nEukaryotic cells contain various organelles such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and more. These organelles help in performing specific functions like energy production (mitochondria), photosynthesis (chloroplasts), protein synthesis (endoplasmic reticulum), sugar transport (lysosomes), and waste removal (lysosomes). Each of these organelles has its own set of enzymes and proteins that perform specific tasks within the cell. This division of labor among organelles helps in maximizing the efficiency of cellular processes, especially during high-energy demands or stress conditions."
