This decrease in demand can cause businesses to reduce production, leading to a further decline in economic activity. In response to this, lenders may be less willing to lend money at favorable rates, as they may fear that borrowers will default on their loans or repayments.\n\nAs a result, the demand for loanable funds (money) may increase, as lenders seek to secure additional funds to cover their losses from borrowers who have been unable to repay their loans during the downturn. This increased demand for loanable funds can drive up interest rates, as lenders must pay higher premiums to borrow money from each other.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer. The other options are not necessarily true under all circumstances."
