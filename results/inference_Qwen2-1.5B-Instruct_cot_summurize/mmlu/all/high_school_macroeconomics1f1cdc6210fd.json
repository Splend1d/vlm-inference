                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The nominal interest rates fall.\n\nWhen the money supply increases, it leads to an increase in the total amount of money available for circulation in the economy. This influx of money can lead to an increase in transaction demand for money as people have more money to spend or save, which could lead to higher prices and lower interest rates. As a result, nominal interest rates tend to fall.\n\nOption A is incorrect because if the money supply increases, it is likely that there will be a decrease in money demand, which would lead to a decrease in nominal interest rates.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the nominal interest rate does not depend on money demand alone; other factors such as government policy, inflation expectations, and credit conditions also affect the nominal interest rate.\n\nOption D is partially correct but not entirely accurate. While transaction demand for money may indeed fall due to increased liquidity, it is important to note that this effect is temporary and typically reverses over time as people adjust their spending habits and saving behaviors. Additionally, changes in money demand can also lead to shifts in aggregate demand, which can ultimately influence the level of interest rates."
