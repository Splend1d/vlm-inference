Consequentialism, which focuses on the outcomes or consequences of actions, and virtue ethics, which emphasizes the character and virtues of individuals, can both be considered value-based theories.\n\nConsequentialism argues that the morality of an action depends on its outcomes or consequences, while virtue ethics suggests that the rightness or wrongness of an action lies in the character and virtues of the person performing it. Both theories recognize the importance of considering values and principles when making moral decisions."
