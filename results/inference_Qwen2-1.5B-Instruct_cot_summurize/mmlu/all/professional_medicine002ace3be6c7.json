His mother says that he is extremely active and likes to climb. During the past year, he fractured his right tibia after falling off a trampoline and sustained a concussion after falling off his bicycle. She says that his teachers reprimand him frequently for running wildly in the classroom, talking excessively, and getting out of his seat; he often forgets to turn in his homework. His parents are currently divorcing. His father has a history of illicit drug use. The patient is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a dislocated left shoulder, healing abrasions over the elbows, and ecchymoses in various stages of healing over the knees. Mental status examination shows a neutral affect. He says that he likes to run and climb trees. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?\n\nA. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\nB. Conduct disorder\nC. Learning disorder\nD. Seizure disorder\n"

Conduct disorder\n\nConduct disorder is characterized by repetitive behaviors or activities that cause harm to others or themselves, such as hitting oneself or others, destroying property, stealing, or engaging in sexual behavior. These behaviors can be observed in children from early childhood up until adolescence.\n\nIn this case, the child's aggressive behavior (e.g., climbing trees) and tendency to run freely around the classroom suggest a possible conduct disorder. Additionally, the child's physical injuries and mental state (neutral affect) also align with the characteristics of a conduct disorder.\n\nIt's important to note that while these symptoms might be indicative of a conduct disorder, an accurate diagnosis requires further evaluation by a professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders like ADHD, OCD, or anxiety disorders. \n\nIf you need more information or have additional questions, please let me know!"
