According to Hourdequin, individuals may become more isolated and less integrated into their communities. This can lead to a lack of cooperation and collaboration among people, which is important for social cohesion and mutual support.\n\nAdditionally, individualism can lead to a focus on personal gain over the common good. This can result in actions that harm others or the environment without regard for the long-term effects. For example, consuming excessive amounts of resources such as water, electricity, and food, while contributing little to the overall well-being of society. This can contribute to environmental degradation, climate change, and other societal issues.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n\nB. They lead us into \"tragedy of the commons\" situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons.\n\nSo, individualism can lead to failures of developing integration and integrality, as well as to a focus on personal gain at the expense of the common good, which can lead to negative consequences for society."
