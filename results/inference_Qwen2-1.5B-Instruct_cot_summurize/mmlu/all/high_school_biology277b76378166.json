Genetic drift refers to random fluctuations in population size that can lead to the accumulation of small differences between individuals over time. This can result in variations in traits and characteristics within a population. Other sources of variation include mutations, but these are relatively rare and do not contribute as much to the overall variation seen in humans compared to genetic drift."
