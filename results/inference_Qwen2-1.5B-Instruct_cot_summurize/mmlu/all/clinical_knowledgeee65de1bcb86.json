Hepatomegaly refers to an enlarged liver that can be felt when the patient lies down on their back or side. It is often caused by various medical conditions such as fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, autoimmune disorders, and some types of cancer. Jaundice, spider naevi, and purpura are also common symptoms in patients with liver disease. However, they do not necessarily indicate alcohol as a cause of hepatomegaly."
