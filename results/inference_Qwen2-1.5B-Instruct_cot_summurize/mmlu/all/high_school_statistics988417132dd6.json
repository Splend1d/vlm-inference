However, if they are also mutually exclusive (meaning they cannot both occur at the same time), then their intersection is empty, meaning there is no overlap between them. In this case, the probability of either event happening would be the sum of the individual probabilities, which is not possible for any non-zero values of p and q.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
