GDP measures the total value of all final goods and services produced in an economy over a specific period of time. Net income refers to the total income generated by businesses minus their expenses, while personal income refers to the income earned by individuals from sources such as wages, salaries, and capital gains. Disposable personal income is the total income minus taxes and other deductions.\n\nWithout additional information about how these variables are related to each other, it is impossible to determine which one is greater than the others or what the relationship between them might be. It is also important to note that there may be other factors at play, such as inflation, population growth, and changes in the composition of the economy, that could affect these variables. Therefore, any conclusion made based on this information would need to be supported by further analysis or evidence."
