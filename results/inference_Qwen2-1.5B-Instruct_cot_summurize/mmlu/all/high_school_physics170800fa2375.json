This is because the wavelengths of visible light range from about 400 to 700 nanometers, and orange light falls in this range. The shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency, and vice versa. Therefore, gamma rays have the shortest wavelength, ultraviolet light has a medium length, blue light has a slightly longer wavelength than orange light, and orange light has the longest wavelength."
