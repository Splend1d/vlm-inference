However, based on my understanding of the context provided:\n\nKamm argues that Sandel\u2019s view on moral distinctions between treatment and enhancement assumes that:\n\nA. nature in itself has no moral value.\n\nThis statement aligns with Kamm's argument against Sandel's views on moral rights for animals. According to Kamm, Sandel wrongly interprets Kantian ethics by equating all forms of life (including humans) as ends in themselves rather than means to an end. This misinterpretation leads to a moral duty towards animals that goes beyond what is required under animal welfare laws, which are primarily concerned with preventing harm to animals. \n\nSo, the answer would be A, but please clarify if this isn't the correct interpretation or if you meant something else."
