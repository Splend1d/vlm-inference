Reliable delivery of large (multi-packet) messages between machines that are not necessarily directly connected.\n\nThe TCP protocol provides reliable, end-to-end delivery of data over a communication link by ensuring that all received packets reach their intended destination and arrive in the correct order. It also supports the transmission of large amounts of data over the network, which can be necessary when dealing with multi-packet messages or large files. The reliability provided by TCP ensures that the data will be delivered to its intended recipient without any loss or corruption. This makes it an essential part of the TCP/IP protocol suite and is used widely in computer networks today."
