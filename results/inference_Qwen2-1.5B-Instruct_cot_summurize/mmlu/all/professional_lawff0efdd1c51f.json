Which of the following states the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between theparties?\n\nA. There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\nB. There is no enforceable contract, because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake asto a basic assumption.\nC.

However, without more specific details about the nature of the property being sold and the terms of the agreement, it is difficult to determine the exact legal consequences.\n\nAssuming that the letter of reply was sent in good faith by the owner, and that the buyer intended to make a lower offer based on their initial error, it could be argued that the contract has been formed at a price of $2,000 per acre. This would mean that the owner accepted the buyer's offer and agreed to sell the property for that price, even though the actual price offered was higher than what they initially expected.\n\nOn the other hand, if the buyer made a genuine mistake and intended to offer $2,000 per acre, then it would not be possible for them to rescind the contract based on a mutual mistake regarding the basic assumption. In this case, the contract would remain in place, and the owner would have accepted the buyer's offer at that price.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome would depend on the specifics of the situation and any additional evidence or documentation related to the negotiation and execution of the contract. Without further information, it is impossible to definitively state which option is correct."
