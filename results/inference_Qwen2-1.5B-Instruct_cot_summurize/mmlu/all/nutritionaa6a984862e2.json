Reduce their total energy intake, increase their activity level, and reduce their screen time.\n\nObesity in children can be caused by a combination of factors, including poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and excessive screen time. By reducing their total energy intake, increasing their activity level, and reducing their screen time, children with obesity can improve their health and weight over time. It is important for parents and caregivers to work together to help their child develop healthy habits that will benefit them throughout life."
