The size of the training dataset has an impact on how overfitting behaves. A smaller training dataset may lead to overfitting because the model becomes too specialized to the training data, making it perform poorly on unseen data. On the other hand, a larger training dataset can help prevent overfitting by providing enough variability in the data that the model can learn to generalize from it. Therefore, statement 1 is true, while statement 2 is false."
