In other words, if there are no charges outside the surface, then the net electric flux will be zero because there would be no charge inside or outside the surface to contribute to the flux.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the enclosed charge must be symmetrically distributed within the surface. It could also be non-symmetric, as long as it is evenly distributed throughout the volume bounded by the surface. The key condition for the net electric flux to be proportional to the enclosed charge is that there should be no charges outside the surface, meaning that there cannot be any unbalanced charges that could affect the flux calculation."
