The symptoms you described (rotatory vertigo, decreased hearing, tinnitus, a sense of fullness, and vomiting) are consistent with Meniere's disease. \n\nThe other options listed do not typically cause these symptoms:\n\n- Acoustic neuroma: This is a benign tumor of the inner ear but does not cause vertigo.\n- Benign positional vertigo: This refers to a sensation of spinning or rotating when moving your head in specific positions.\n- Brain stem transient ischemic attacks: These refer to temporary disruptions in blood flow to the brain, which can cause symptoms such as vertigo, but they are not caused by the symptoms you described.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Meniere's disease."
