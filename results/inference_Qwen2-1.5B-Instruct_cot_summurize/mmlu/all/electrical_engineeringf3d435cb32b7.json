This allows them to produce a wide range of frequencies that can be tuned to specific values through the use of capacitors or other components. The series resonant frequency corresponds to the lowest frequency at which the crystal oscillates, while the parallel resonant frequency corresponds to the highest frequency. Together, these two frequencies determine the overall resonant frequency of the crystal."
