The ability to make important life decisions on the basis of our deepest values.\n\nAutonomy refers to the freedom or capacity for independent action or choice. When someone possesses autonomy, they have the ability to make choices that reflect their personal values and beliefs, which can be seen as an expression of their deepest self. This allows them to take responsibility for their actions and live according to their conscience, rather than being influenced by external pressures or constraints.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer."
