It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nFrederick Douglass was most influenced by which of the following social movements?\n\nA.

In this speech, he criticizes the role of religion in supporting slavery. He states that the State governments, churches, and federal government (including the military) are all aligned with the cause of slavery. This suggests that Douglass was most influenced by the Second Great Awakening movement, which was focused on promoting religious conversion and reform. The Second Great Awakening emphasized the importance of individual conversion and spiritual rebirth as a means of changing society and ending slavery."
