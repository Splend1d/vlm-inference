Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, pole dancing during a puppet show is considered morally wrong because it goes against societal norms and expectations for appropriate behavior in public settings. Pole dancing can be seen as provocative or indecent, especially if it involves exposing one's body in a way that is not appropriate for all audiences. Additionally, the context of the setting (a puppet show) may also add to the perceived immorality of the act.\n\nIn scenario 2, playing catch with your dog and aiming the baseball well over their head is not explicitly morally wrong but could still be seen as irresponsible or reckless. If you were doing this while distracted or under the influence of alcohol, it could be seen as neglectful towards your pet. However, without more information about the specific circumstances, it is difficult to definitively say whether this action would be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are potentially morally questionable based on societal norms, but the first scenario has a higher potential for outright moral wrongdoing due to its explicit sexual nature."
