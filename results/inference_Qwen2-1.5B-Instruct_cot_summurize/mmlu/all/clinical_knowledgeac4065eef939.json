A bladder washout is a procedure that involves removing the contents of the bladder through a catheter to clean it and check for any blockages or infections. This can help prevent complications such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) and other serious health problems. It is important to note that this procedure should only be performed by a healthcare professional under proper supervision and with appropriate equipment and supplies."
