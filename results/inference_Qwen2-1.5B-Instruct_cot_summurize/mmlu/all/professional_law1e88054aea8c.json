The neighbor who owns property adjacent to the farm knows of the friends' use of the property during the hunting season. One day during the hunting season, without the farmer's knowledge or permission, the neighbor took a shortcut across the farm to visit an acquaintance. The neighbor was wounded by a shot fired by one of the farmer's friends, who was shooting at quail and carelessly failed to see the neighbor. Traditional rules of landowners' and occupiers' liability apply. In an action by the neighbor against the farmer to recover for the injuries, will the neighbor be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the farmer is not responsible for his friends' conduct.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing.\nC. Yes, because the careless friend was permitted to hunt without safety training.\nD. Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity.\n\nAbnormally dangerous activities are those that involve a high degree of risk but are nevertheless permissible under traditional rules of landowners' and occupiers' liability. This means that if someone is injured while engaging in an abnormally dangerous activity, they may still be able to hold the person responsible for their actions. However, this requires that the person engaged in the activity had knowledge of the risks involved and acted recklessly or negligently.\n\nIn this case, the farmer allowed his friends to hunt on his property, including allowing them to shoot guns. It is possible that the farmer did not take reasonable steps to ensure that his friends were properly trained in gun safety, as required by traditional rules of landowners' and occupiers' liability. If the farmer knew or should have known that his friends posed a risk to others, such as by failing to wear protective gear or not being properly trained in gun safety, then the neighbor could potentially recover from the farmer for the injuries sustained by the neighbor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Yes, because the use of firearms is an abnormally dangerous activity."
