This means that if we take any two consecutive observations from the process, their differences should also be zero. Stationarity can have different forms depending on whether it is defined as a stochastic process or an ergodic sequence.\n\n- A stationary stochastic process is one where the probability distribution of future values depends only on past values.\n- An ergodic sequence is a set of numbers such that the average of every finite number of terms equals the average of all terms.\n- A stationary process has a constant mean and variance over time, which means that its mean and variance do not change over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)."
