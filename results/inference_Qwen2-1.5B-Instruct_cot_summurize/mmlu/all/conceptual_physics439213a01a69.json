According to Einstein's theory of relativity, objects moving faster than the speed of light experience time dilated (i.e., stretched) compared to the time experienced by stationary observers. This means that while traveling at high speeds, the elapsed time between events on Earth will appear shorter to someone who is stationary relative to us. This phenomenon has been observed in various experiments and tests conducted by scientists around the world."
