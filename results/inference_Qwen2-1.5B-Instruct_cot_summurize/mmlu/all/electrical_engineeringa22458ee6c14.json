In general, materials with high permeability (i.e., low resistivity) tend to have higher susceptibilities to magnetization compared to those with lower permeability.\n\nNon-magnetic substances, such as metals or gases, generally have very low susceptibilities to magnetization due to their low permeability. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nDiamagnetic substances, on the other hand, have a negative susceptibility to magnetization because they emit anti-magnetic fields when subjected to an external magnetic field. This means that these substances will oppose the alignment of neighboring atoms in the sample, resulting in a reduced net magnetization. Therefore, option B is also correct.\n\nFerromagnetic substances, which have strong magnetic moments aligned parallel to the applied magnetic field, have a positive susceptibility to magnetization. They can easily align themselves with the external magnetic field, leading to increased magnetization. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Non-magnetic substances.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this explanation assumes that you're referring to magnetic materials in general, rather than specific types like iron or cobalt, which have different susceptibilities depending on the direction of the external magnetic field."
