(1, 1) = 1 + 1 = 2\n2. (1, 2) = 1 + 2 = 3\n3. (1, 3) = 1 + 3 = 4\n4. (1, 4) = 1 + 4 = 5\n5. (1, 5) = 1 + 5 = 6\n6. (1, 6) = 1 + 6 = 7\n\nThe sum of these values is: \\(2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 27\\).\n\nSince there are 6 possible outcomes, the expected value per game is: \\(\\frac{27}{6} = 4.5\\).\n\nThis means the player would expect to win an average of \\$4.50 per game, which rounds to approximately \\$4.55. Therefore, the correct answer is A. The player will gain about $0.55."
