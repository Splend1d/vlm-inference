The two blastomeres were then separated. What is the expected fate of the blastomeres?\n\nA. The blastomere with the gray crescent will grow in size more quickly than the one without the gray crescent.\nB. The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\nC. The blastomere without the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.\nD. The blastomere with the gray crescent will stop dividing and die before the second cleavage.\n"
