Biased but consistent.\n\nWhen OLS is applied separately to each equation in a simultaneous system, it may lead to biased estimates because the error terms for each equation may not be independent of one another. This can cause the overall estimate to be biased even if it is consistent.\n\nHowever, under certain conditions, such as when all the errors have constant variance or when the number of equations exceeds the number of parameters being estimated, the bias can be reduced or eliminated. In these cases, the OLS estimates may be unbiased even when applied to separate equations in the system."
