However, if the person was also providing transportation services like driving others around or delivering goods, then they could be considered a \"driver\" or \"deliveryman,\" respectively. In such cases, the act would not be morally wrong but rather a form of employment or contract. \n\nTherefore, based on the given options:\n- B. Wrong, Not wrong - Incorrect because this option suggests that both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, whereas only one actually does.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong - This indicates that Scenario 1 involves morally wrong behavior, while Scenario 2 doesn't."
