When a company purchases an asset, such as a piece of art, it can be considered as an investment that will generate future income for the company. As a result, there will be an increase in the total investment component of GDP. \n\nHowever, if the painting is purchased with borrowed funds, then the increase in GDP would come from both I and C (Consumption). In this case, the purchase would not affect GDP directly but could lead to higher levels of consumption and investment in the economy.\n\nIt's important to note that the value of an asset like a painting is subjective and may fluctuate based on market demand and supply, which are influenced by various economic factors beyond just the purchase itself."
