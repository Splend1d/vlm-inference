Increase as consumers demand more money for transactions increasing the interest rate. \n\nThe nominal GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy over a specific period of time, adjusted for inflation. When nominal GDP is rising, it means that overall economic activity has increased, which could be due to factors such as technological advancements, increased productivity, or changes in consumer preferences.\n\nAs consumers demand more money for transactions (i.e., they have more disposable income), they may want to hold onto more cash or other liquid assets like checking accounts instead of spending their money immediately on purchases. This can lead to an increase in demand for money in circulation, which can push up interest rates in order to attract new savings into the banking system. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
