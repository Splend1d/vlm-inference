She brought a Title VII civil rights action in federal court for gender discrimination against the employer. At trial, a former co-worker of the woman was not allowed to testify that she heard the human relations manager saying in an informal meeting that the plaintiff and her predecessor were both fired due to what the manager described as \"pregnancy complications.\" The proposed witness had been a vice-president of the company and a close adviser to the president. Without the benefit of that vital testimony, the jury entered a verdict for the defendant employer. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the testimony should have been allowed and that it was not hearsay under the federal rules. Will the court likely grant the appeal, and order a new trial?\n\nA. No, because the statement is clearly hearsay with no exception to the hearsay rule being applicable.\nB. No, because it was based on things that the co-worker heard from others, making double-hearsay that is never admissible.\nC. Yes, because that kind of testimony is reliable and not excludable as hearsay.\nD. Yes, because it was admissible under the \"spontaneous utterance\" exception to the hearsay rules.\n"

No, because it was based on things that the co-worker heard from others, making double-hearsay that is never admissible.\n\nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, double-hearsay statements cannot be admitted as evidence unless they fall within one of several exceptions. One such exception is the \"spontaneous utterance\" exception, which allows statements made by a person who has no reason to lie about them and is not seeking personal gain or advantage. However, this exception does not apply here because the co-worker's testimony was based on things that he heard from others, rather than on his own direct observation or experience.\n\nTherefore, the court is unlikely to grant the appeal and order a new trial."
