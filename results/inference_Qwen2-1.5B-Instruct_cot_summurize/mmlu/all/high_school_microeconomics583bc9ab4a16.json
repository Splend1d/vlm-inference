Horizontal\n\nIf Matt's utility from consuming each additional unit of bratwurst increases at the same rate, regardless of the quantity consumed, this suggests that the marginal utility per unit is constant. In economics, this is often represented by a horizontal demand curve because it indicates that as the quantity demanded (or consumed) increases, the price paid remains relatively constant or unchanged. This scenario corresponds to a perfectly inelastic demand, where the price elasticity of demand is equal to 1, meaning that the consumer is indifferent between any level of consumption and the marginal cost of adding more units."
