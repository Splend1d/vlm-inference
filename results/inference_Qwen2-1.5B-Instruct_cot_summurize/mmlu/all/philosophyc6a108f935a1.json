His argument focuses more on how we should treat people based on their suffering rather than whether they have suffered at all. \n\nIn his view, treating someone well is morally right even if they don't suffer much, because the quality of our treatment matters more than its quantity. This means that while we might consider an action to be better from the perspective of someone who suffers greatly, it could still be worse from the perspective of someone who doesn't suffer at all.\n\nSo, according to Parfit, option C (both A and B) could be true. But he does not explicitly state this as the case. He suggests instead that treating someone well may involve giving them less than they want or need, but that this can be justified by the fact that their lack of suffering is greater than their desires."
