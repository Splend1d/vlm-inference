In this case, the hunter fired his gun into the air, hitting the hiker accidentally. This constitutes a battery because the bullet from the gun made direct physical contact with the hiker, despite the fact that the hunter did not mean for it to happen. Therefore, the hiker has a valid claim for battery against the hunter."
