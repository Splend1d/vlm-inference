The university contacted a coach who had a strong reputation as a person who cottld \"turn around\" a program and produce winning teams. The university offered the coach an annual salary of $250,000 to coach its basketball team, but the coach declined the offer, hoping to find another institution that would pay him a higher salary. Thereafter, a wealthy booster, who was interested in enhancing the university's basketball program, contacted the coach and told him that if he would sign a coaching contract with the university, the booster would pay him $50,000 a year as an unpublished supplement to his salary. Furthermore, the booster promised to contribute $5,000 to the university athletic fund every time the basketball team won a game under the coach's tutelage. The coach thereupon signed a three-year contract as the head basketball coach at the university at an annual salary of $250,000. During the coach's first year as coach, the university basketball team compiled a record of 18 wins and 12 losses. The booster, however, refused to pay anything to either the coach or the university athletic fund. Assume that the agreement between the coach and the booster does not violate any rule of the university or of any intercollegiate athletic association. The university brought suit against the booster to recover $90,000 for breach of his promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. Is it likely that the university will prevail in this contract action?\n\nA. Yes, because the university is an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster.\nB. Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.\nC. No, because the booster's promise was, in essence, an illegal form of procurement and void as against public policy.\nD. No, because the booster's promise was made to the coach rather than to the university and, therefore, was not a charitable subscription.\n"

Yes, because the university detrimentally relied on the booster's promise by hiring the coach.\n\nIn this scenario, the university hired the coach based on the booster's promise to pay $5,000 into the athletic fund for each game won by the basketball team. This promise was not a charitable subscription, but rather a conditional payment based on the success of the basketball team. Therefore, the university did not have a legal right to expect the booster to fulfill his promise, and the university's reliance on the promise resulted in its breach of contract.\n\nAdditionally, the university has no intention to be a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the coach and the booster, so the university cannot rely on the coach's termination due to the failure to meet contractual expectations. Finally, the booster's promise was made to the coach, not to the university, which means that the booster could not have been considered a charitable donor to the university."
