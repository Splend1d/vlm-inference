Pure time-series models assume that the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear, while structural models allow for nonlinear relationships. This means that it can be challenging to accurately predict future values based on historical data alone. Additionally, pure time-series models may not capture all relevant factors influencing the dependent variable, which can lead to biased or inaccurate predictions."
