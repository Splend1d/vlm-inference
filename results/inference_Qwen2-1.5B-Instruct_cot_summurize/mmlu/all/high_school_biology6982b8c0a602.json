However, if the external salt concentration is higher than the cell's internal salt concentration (in this case, 10% NaCl), the cell will begin to swell due to the influx of water from the environment.\n\nAs the cell swells, it becomes more hydrophilic and less able to retain solutes. The cell membrane will no longer be able to maintain its original shape and may eventually rupture or lyse, releasing its contents. This process is known as plasmolysis."
