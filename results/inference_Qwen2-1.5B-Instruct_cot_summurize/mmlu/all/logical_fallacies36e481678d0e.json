This fallacy occurs when someone suggests that they should engage in certain behavior simply because others like them, rather than on their own merits or based on the actual benefits of the action itself. It is often used to justify actions that may not have any merit beyond their popularity. For example, if someone says \"I should eat more junk food because everyone else is doing it,\" they are committing this fallacy."
