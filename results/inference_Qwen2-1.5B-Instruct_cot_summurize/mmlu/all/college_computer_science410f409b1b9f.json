Assignments A := B + C and D := A/F will take one time unit each since they involve simple arithmetic operations.\n2. Assignment C := A * E will also take one time unit because it involves multiplication.\n3. After completing the first three assignments, there is no further need for any additional time units because all variables have been assigned their values.\n4. The remaining assignments E := B - C and F := A + B do not require any additional time units since they are independent of the previous assignments.\n\nTherefore, the total minimum number of time units required is 1 (for A := B + C) + 1 (for D := A/F) + 1 (for C := A * E) = 3 time units.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 3."
