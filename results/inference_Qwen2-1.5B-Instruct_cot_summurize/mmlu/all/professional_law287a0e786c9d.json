This can include taking items without permission, using them for personal gain, or selling them without consent. Conversion is typically considered a civil wrong and involves the return of the item taken plus any profit made by the defendant.\n\nIn contrast, \"remedy is recovery of actual damages from harm to chattel or loss of use.\" While recovery of damages may be appropriate in some cases of conversion, such as if the property was used in a way that caused damage, this does not necessarily mean that the defendant must pay the full price of the chattel. In many jurisdictions, there is no requirement for compensation in conversion cases.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect."
