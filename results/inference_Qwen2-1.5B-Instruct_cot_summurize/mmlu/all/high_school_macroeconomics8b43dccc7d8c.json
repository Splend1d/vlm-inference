France should specialize in and export wine while Belgium should specialize in and export cheese.\n\nThis statement is based on the concept of comparative advantage, which suggests that countries should specialize in producing goods for which they have an absolute advantage (i.e., where production costs are lower than those of other countries) compared to others who have a comparative advantage. In this case, France has a comparative advantage in cheese due to its low labor hours per unit of cheese production compared to Belgium, which specializes in wine.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect because it suggests that France has an absolute advantage in both products when it actually only has a comparative advantage in cheese.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because France does not have an absolute advantage in cheese compared to Belgium, as shown by the difference in labor hours between the two countries.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because France does not have an absolute advantage in wine compared to Belgium, as shown by the difference in labor hours between the two countries."
