However, this does not necessarily mean that all individuals should also be obligated to perform those same actions.\n\nOption A (that your government morally ought to do something) does not prove that government officials ought to promote it. This is because the government may have its own reasons for doing what it does, and these reasons may not align with the interests of the individual who is being asked to perform the action.\n\nOption B (that you ought to do it) also does not necessarily follow from the fact that the government has an obligation to do something. It is possible that performing the action would harm others or go against ethical principles, even if the government has a moral duty to do so.\n\nOption C (that you ought not to do it) goes in the opposite direction of option A, suggesting that the government's moral obligations may not justify performing the action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D (that you ought to do it, too), which implies that the government's moral duty to perform the action may also justify acting on that duty."
