This pattern consists of 20 amino acids and has been used as a reference point for assessing the nutritional quality of proteins. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because the amino acid scoring methods are designed to be specific to each age group, taking into account the growth needs and metabolic differences between children and adults.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nA.
