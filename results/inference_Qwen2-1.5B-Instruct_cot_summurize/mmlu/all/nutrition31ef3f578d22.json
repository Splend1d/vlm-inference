The term \"low birthweight\" refers to a birth weight that falls below the 10th percentile for gestational age, while \"very low birthweight\" refers to a birth weight that falls below the 5th percentile. However, these terms do not specifically describe the same definition as \"birth weight below a population threshold for gestational age.\""
