Anarchy means that the state exists as part of society being indistinguishable from national government and the domestic character of the state.\nB. Anarchy refers to the lack of over-arching power in the international system - there is no controlling power beyond the multiple states. In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behaviour.\nC. Anarchy means that there is little continuity in a government's foreign policy over time. Leaders come and go and their foreign policy changes, which is reflective of different preoccupations and ideologies.\nD. Anarchy means that the structure of the international system is distinctive because states have a strong sense that they are part of a larger entity in international politics with overarching interests and goals, making association unlimited and important.\n"

In the absence of such authority, states have their own agenda for achieving security, and can determine their own goals and behavior.\n\nThe significance of anarchy to the realist explanation of international politics lies in its emphasis on the role of states in shaping international relations. Realists argue that states are the primary actors in international politics, and that their self-interest and pursuit of security are the driving forces behind their actions. Anarchy, therefore, suggests that states will act independently and seek to protect their own interests, even if this conflicts with the interests of other states or international organizations. This perspective explains why states may engage in conflict or cooperation with one another, rather than seeking to establish a single global governance structure."
