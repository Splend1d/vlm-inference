In a hypothetical environment, the coat pattern that is associated with crossed eyes is highly adaptive, with the result that both the coat pattern and the cross-eyed condition increase in a feline population over time. Which statement is supported by these observations?\n\nA. Evolution is progressive and tends toward a more perfect population.\nB. Phenotype is often the result of compromise.\nC. Natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive genes in populations over the course of time.\nD. Polygenic inheritance is generally maladaptive, and should become less common in future generations.\n"

Phenotype is often the result of compromise.\n\nThe observation that the coat pattern associated with crossed eyes is highly adaptive supports the idea that phenotype can sometimes be a result of compromise rather than an inevitable outcome of genetic variation. This means that some individuals may have evolved to have traits that are advantageous under certain conditions, even if those traits might not be optimal overall. The observation that the cross-eyed condition increases in frequency as a result of the adaptive coat pattern suggests that there may be trade-offs or compromises involved in achieving these advantages. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer based on the given information."
