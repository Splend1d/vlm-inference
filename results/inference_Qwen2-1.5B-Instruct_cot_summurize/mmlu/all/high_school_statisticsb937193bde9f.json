This can be calculated using the Z-score formula:\n\n\\[Z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nWhere \\(x\\) is the observed value, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\nGiven:\n- Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 210 calories,\n- Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 10 calories.\n\nWe want to find the area under the curve where \\(x > 225\\), which corresponds to finding the area between Z=0 and Z=-1.\n\nFor a standard normal distribution, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is given by:\n\n\\[P(Z < z) = 0.5 + \\Phi(z)\\]\n\nwhere \\(z\\) is the Z-score for our problem. The CDF gives us the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to \\(z\\).\n\nFirst, calculate the Z-score for 225 calories:\n\n\\[Z = \\frac{225 - 210}{10} = \\frac{15}{10} = 1.5\\]\n\nNow, find the area from Z=0 to Z=-1:\n\n\\[P(0 < Z < -1) = P(-1.5 < Z) = 0.5 - \\Phi(1.5)\\]\n\nSince \\(\\Phi(1.5)\\) is the area below the curve at Z=1.5, it's the area above Z=0 and below Z=-1. Therefore,\n\n\\[P(0 < Z < -1) = 0.5 - \\Phi(1.5) = 0.5 - 0.964 = 0.064\\]\n\nThis means approximately 6.4% of the candy bars contain more than 225 calories. However, since there are only two answer choices (A and B), and none of these percentages match exactly, we must look elsewhere for an accurate calculation.\n\nRecalculating directly from the standard normal table:\n\nThe cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution is approximately 0.9545 for values less than 1.5 standard deviations away from the mean. Thus, the area between Z=0 and Z=-1 is about 0.0545, which is not listed among the provided options but matches the calculation for 6.4%.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is based on the approximation, as the exact calculation would require a different approach due to the nature of the problem. Given the options, the closest and most likely correct calculation method is using the approximate table values or a calculator for more precision. \n\nThe correct choice is **C** (43.30%)."
