However, the term \"fallacy of accident\" specifically refers to a logical error where an argument assumes that one event must have caused another without providing any evidence for this assumption.\n\nSweeping generalization and petitio principii are related to the idea of making a generalization without sufficient evidence, while false dichotomy is a logical fallacy that occurs when an argument presents only two options (black-or-white thinking) instead of considering other possibilities. None of these terms directly applies to the fallacy of accident."
