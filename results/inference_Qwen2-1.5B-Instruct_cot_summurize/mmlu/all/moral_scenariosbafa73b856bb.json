Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nScenario 1 involves giving away one's sibling without their consent or knowledge, which goes against common ethical and moral principles regarding family relationships. It also implies that the person has no control over what happens to their sibling, which can be seen as a violation of their autonomy.\n\nScenario 2 involves not allowing an animal out during bad weather, which is generally considered responsible and protective behavior towards animals. It does not violate any moral principles related to family relationships or autonomy."
