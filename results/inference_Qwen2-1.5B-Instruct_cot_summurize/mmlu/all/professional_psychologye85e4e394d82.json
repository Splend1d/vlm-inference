This can lead to financial discrepancies and may cause unnecessary stress for the client. Additionally, it undermines the trust between the therapist and their client by potentially causing them to pay more than they should for services provided before the insurance coverage begins. Therefore, Dr. Olivetti's action of writing the bills to appear as though the client had just started therapy is unethical."
