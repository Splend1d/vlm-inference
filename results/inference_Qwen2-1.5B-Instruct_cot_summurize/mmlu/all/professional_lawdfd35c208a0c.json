Thereafter, the proposal was placed on the ballot and was overwhelmingly passed by the voters in both towns. After the election, but before the merger had officially been carried out, two taxpayers from one of the towns initiated suit to enjoin the unification, attacking the constitutionality of the proposal. The suit reached the state supreme court and was found to be constitutional under both state and federal law. The plaintiffs now file a motion seeking to have thiscase reviewed by the U. S. Supreme Court. The Court may\n\nA. not hear the case, because it was decided on independent state grounds.\nB. not hear the case, but may have it remanded to federal district court.\nC. hear the federal issues involved, but decline to rule on the state issue.\nD. rely on the advisory opinion rendered by the state attorney general and not hear the case on its merits.\n"

The Court may rely on the advisory opinion rendered by the state attorney general and not hear the case on its merits.\n\nThis is because the Court has jurisdiction over cases involving questions of state law only when those questions arise in a federal context. In this case, the question presented is purely a matter of state law, which is being considered by the state's highest court. Therefore, the Court does not have jurisdiction over this case and can dismiss it without prejudice. However, if the Court were to decide to hear the case, it would have to determine whether the advisory opinion was binding on the federal courts as well. If the Court finds that the advisory opinion is binding, it will not hear the case on its merits; if not, it will consider the merits of the case."
