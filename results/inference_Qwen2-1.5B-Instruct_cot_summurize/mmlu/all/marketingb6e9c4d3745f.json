It does not directly differentiate products or services from competitors, reinforce brand loyalty, or inform consumers about new product launches or updates. Instead, participating typically focuses on building relationships with potential customers and maintaining engagement over time. The other three tasks - differentiating, reinforcing, and informing - are all key components of effective marketing communications."
