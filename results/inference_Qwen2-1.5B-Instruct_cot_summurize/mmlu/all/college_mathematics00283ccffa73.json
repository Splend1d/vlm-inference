It's not an inner product because it doesn't satisfy the properties that make it an inner product (such as linearity, positive-definiteness, etc.). However, if we let p = 2, then the expression becomes:\n\n||x|| = \u221a(\u2211i xi^2)\n\nwhich is indeed an inner product since it satisfies the properties of an inner product: linearity, bilinearity, and positivity for the second term (the square root).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. p \u2265 1."
