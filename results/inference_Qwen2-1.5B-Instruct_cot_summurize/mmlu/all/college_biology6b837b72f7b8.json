While DNA provides the macromolecular basis of heredity (fact A) and Mendelian principles explain how certain traits are inherited from parents to offspring (fact B), these concepts were not developed until much later. The discovery of prokaryotes, or bacteria, was made independently by both Robert Hooke in 1663 and James Thomson in 1859 (fact C). However, this discovery did not establish that there existed fossilized remains of extinct species before 1859."
