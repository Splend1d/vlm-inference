Both a and b\n\nThe risk of perinatal transmission of HIV-1 infection during breast feeding is increased due to mixed feeding (feeding both breast milk and formula) or very early introduction of solid foods, which can lead to the transfer of mother's antibodies to the infant through breastfeeding. Therefore, it is recommended that mothers avoid mixed feeding and introduce solid foods after 6 months of age to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission."
