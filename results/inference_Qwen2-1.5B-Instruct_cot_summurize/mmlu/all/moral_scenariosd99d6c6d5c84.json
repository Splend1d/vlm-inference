The protagonist may have done so out of necessity or a sense of duty, but still, such behavior goes against societal norms of honesty and integrity.\n\nIn scenario 2, pulling the frightened patient's teeth with novocaine is considered medical malpractice. While the intent was likely to help the patient feel more comfortable during the procedure, the act itself goes beyond what is necessary for the treatment and can cause harm if performed improperly. This situation is also morally wrong because it involves treating a patient in an unethical manner.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, both scenarios involve clear violations of ethical standards, making option A the correct answer."
