The agent asked the addict to obtain heroin for him, but the addict refused. For several weeks the agent continued to plead with and beg the addict to get him drugs; finally, the addict gave in to the pressure and got the drugs. The police promptly arrested him. At trial, the defendant raised the defense of government entrapment. Will the trial court likely dismiss the case based on that argument?\n\nA. Yes, because this was entrapment in that the intent to commit the crime originated with the government.\nB. No, this was not entrapment because the addict was predisposed to want to obtain drugs due to his status as a drug user.\nC. No, this was not entrapment because the addict went voluntarily to get the drugs; he could have refused.\nD. Yes, this was entrapment because as soon as the agent asked a second time, he had established entrapment under the majority rule.\n"

Yes, this was entrapment because as soon as the agent asked a second time, he had established entrapment under the majority rule.\n\nIn order for entrapment to be successful, there must be an element of \"government enticement.\" This means that the government intentionally induces or encourages someone to commit a crime by offering them something they would otherwise not consider doing. In other words, the government's actions must cause the person to act outside their normal inclinations or desires.\n\nIn this scenario, the government agent did indeed induce the addict to obtain drugs by repeatedly pressing for them, which satisfies the requirement of government enticement. Additionally, the addict voluntarily sought out the drugs themselves, indicating that they were willing to go against their own inclination to obtain them. Therefore, the trial court is likely to dismiss the case based on the defense of government entrapment."
