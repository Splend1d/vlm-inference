The landowner accepted the award of fair market value and did not appeal. For the next 15 years, the agency held the property but did not implement an educational use for it. In year 16, the agency abandoned the intended education use and sold it at a properly advertised auction under state law. The original landowner appealed, arguing that the agency only took a fee simple determinable and when it ceased its intended educational use, superior fee simple title reverted back to the original owner. Will the appellate court likely rule that the landowner can assert rights to stop the attempted transfer?\n\nA. No, because the state also acquired fee simple title by adverse possession after 11 continuous, uninterrupted years of possession.\nB. No, because the original transfer was legally conducted and the landowner received fair market value, thereby allowing a presumption of fee simple title in the agency.\nC. Yes, eminent domain is restricted to taking property that is urgently needed for a public use and the failure to use it for that purpose defeated fee simple ownership in the agency.\nD. Yes, because every eminent domain taking implies a fee simple determinable aspect to the governmental acquisition.\n"

Yes, eminent domain is restricted to taking property that is urgently needed for a public use and the failure to use it for that purpose defeated fee simple ownership in the agency.\n\nIn order to obtain a fee simple determinable interest in property through eminent domain, the government must show that the property is necessary for a public use and that it will be used for that purpose within a reasonable time frame. If the government does not fulfill this requirement, the property may revert to the original owner or become subject to adverse possession.\n\nIf the government fails to use the property for its intended public use, such as when the state education agency in this scenario failed to implement an educational use for the land, the agency may lose fee simple ownership in the property. Therefore, the landowner can assert rights to prevent the attempted transfer of the property."
