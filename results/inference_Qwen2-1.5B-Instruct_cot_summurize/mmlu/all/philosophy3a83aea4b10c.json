However, it is generally accepted in ethical theory and philosophy that moral judgments are necessary for making decisions and taking actions that are consistent with moral principles.\n\nIf a person refuses to make any positive moral judgments, they may be considered as being irrational or immoral because they do not take into account the consequences of their actions on others or on society as a whole. This lack of consideration can lead to harmful or unethical outcomes.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that such a person could still have coherent moral reasoning if they were able to consider other factors beyond just their own self-interest, such as the well-being of others or the common good.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would depend on the specific context and assumptions underlying Hare's argument. It is important to note that there is no consensus among philosophers on this issue, and different perspectives may differ in their evaluation of the consequences of refusing to make positive moral judgments."
