The prosecutor has called the friend's mother to testify to a conversation she had with her son the day before he left the country. She implored him not to go, but he said, \"Mom, I have to go. I was involved in a robbery at [the bank], and I don't want them to catch me.\" The prosecutor has other evidence indicating that the defendant and the friend were together on the morning of the robbery. Is the statement by the friend to his mother admissible?\n\nA. No, because inculpatory statements against penal interest do not satisfy the confrontation clause.\nB. No, because the friend's statement to his mother was not corroborated.\nC. Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\nD. Yes, as a statement of the friend's state of mind that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n"

This exception allows individuals who are present during an event or incident to make statements about their own actions or lack thereof during the event. In this case, the friend's statement to his mother can be considered a statement against penal interests, since it relates to the events leading up to the bank robbery.\n\nHowever, the statement must also meet the requirements of being admissible under the confrontation clause, which requires that the witness be available for cross-examination. Since the friend's mother did not appear in court, her testimony would not be admissible under the confrontation clause.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause."
