Theo's loss of employment may be due to seasonal changes in demand for services, which occurs during the winter months when pools typically do not operate. Seasonal unemployment can occur regardless of economic conditions or overall market forces and is often associated with specific industries or periods of time. Cyclical unemployment refers to those who lose their jobs because of business cycles or downturns, while discouraged workers have lost interest in finding work despite being available and qualified. Frictional unemployment is when individuals move from one job to another but find it difficult to find work that matches their skills and experience, even though they are willing and able to work."
