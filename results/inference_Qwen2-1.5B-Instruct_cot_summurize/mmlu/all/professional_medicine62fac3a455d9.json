On physical examination, his temperature is 37.4\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F), his mucous membranes are dry, and his abdomen is slightly distended. No other abnormalities are seen. The problem is most likely related to which of the following?\n\nA. Fructose intolerance\nB. Transient lactase deficiency\nC. Magnesium deficiency\nD. Regional enteritis\n"

This condition is characterized by the inability of infants to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk, due to insufficient production of lactase enzyme in their small intestine. This can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating. It is more common in infants born prematurely or with certain genetic disorders. In this case, the infant's mother may be able to identify if her child's symptoms are related to transient lactase deficiency by observing any signs of digestive distress after consuming cow's milk products. If the symptoms persist despite dietary modifications, further testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine appropriate treatment."
