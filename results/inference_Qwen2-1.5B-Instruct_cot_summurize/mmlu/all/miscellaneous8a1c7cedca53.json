When you store food at room temperature, the molecules in the food are still moving around, but they are no longer in thermal equilibrium with each other. As a result, the entropy of the food increases, which causes it to warm up.\n\nOn the other hand, when you cool down food, the molecules start to move more slowly and become less disordered. This leads to a decrease in entropy, which causes the food to cool down."
