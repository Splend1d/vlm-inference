The magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person.\n\nWhen two objects are in contact and push against each other, they exert forces on each other that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. This is known as Newton's third law of motion.\n\nIn this scenario, the heavier person is pushing on the lighter person with a force F. Since the surface is essentially frictionless, the lighter person will also apply an equal and opposite force to the heavier person, which will be -F.\n\nNewton's second law of motion states that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration. Therefore, we can write:\n\nF = m * a\n\nwhere F is the force applied by the heavier person, m is the mass of the lighter person, and a is the acceleration of the lighter person.\n\nSince the heavier person is applying a force of F, the lighter person must also apply an equal and opposite force of -F. Therefore, the acceleration of the lighter person is -a.\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the magnitudes of the accelerations: a / a = 1 / 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. The magnitude of the acceleration of the lighter person will be twice the magnitude of the acceleration of the heavier person."
