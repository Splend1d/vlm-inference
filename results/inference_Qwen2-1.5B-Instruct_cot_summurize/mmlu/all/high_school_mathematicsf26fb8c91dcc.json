Then, five years ago, the speed of the old computer was \\(\\frac{1}{2}S\\) and its price was \\(2P\\).\n\nThe ratio of the speeds of the two computers was then \\(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}S}{S} = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and the ratio of their prices was \\(\\frac{2P}{P} = 2\\).\n\nSo, the original ratio of the old computer's speed to price was \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and the original ratio of the current computer's speed to price was 2.\n\nTo find the percentage increase in the speed-to-price ratio over time, we can use the formula for percentage change: \\(\\text{Percentage Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Old Value}}{\\text{Old Value}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\\).\n\nApplying this to our problem:\n\n\\[\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{2 - 1}{1} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 1 \\times 100\\% = 100\\%\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 20."
