The GCD of 96 and 216 is 36.\n\nSo, when you divide each number by 36:\n\n- For 96: \\( \\frac{96}{36} = 3 \\)\n- For 216: \\( \\frac{216}{36} = 6 \\)\n\nThe simplified ratio is therefore 3 over 6, which can be written as 1 over 2 or as 3 divided by 6, which simplifies further to 1 over 2 or 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 16 over 36**."
