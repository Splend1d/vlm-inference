Kwashiorkor, also known as Kwashiorkor disease, is a severe form of malnutrition that affects children under the age of five. It is caused by a combination of factors including low levels of protein and calories in the diet, dehydration, and infection. While it is possible for a child to experience oedema (swelling) due to other causes such as iron deficiency or low intake of antioxidant nutrients, it is not typically associated with sudden weaning from the breast."
