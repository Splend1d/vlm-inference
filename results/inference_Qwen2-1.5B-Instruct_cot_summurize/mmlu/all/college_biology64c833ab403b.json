Increasing the total surface area available for diffusion\n\nWhen increasing the total surface area available for diffusion, more molecules will be able to pass through the walls of the capillaries into the surrounding tissues or directly out into the surrounding environment. This can lead to an increased rate of gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood within the pulmonary capillary. \n\nDecreasing the partial pressure gradient of the gas or decreasing the solubility of the gas in water would decrease the rate of diffusion, while decreasing the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillary would also decrease the rate of diffusion but not necessarily increase it."
