If both parents are affected by an autosomal recessive disorder, then there is a 25% chance (since they are both carriers) that each of their offspring will inherit the disorder from one parent and the other from the unaffected partner. Therefore, if one child is affected, the other child has a 25% chance of being affected as well. The total number of offspring that would be expected to be affected is 1/4 x 1/4 = 1/16 or approximately 0.167 or 16.7%. So, the probability that at least one of their children will be affected is 1 - 0.167 = 0.833 or 83.3%, which is closest to 1 in 4."
