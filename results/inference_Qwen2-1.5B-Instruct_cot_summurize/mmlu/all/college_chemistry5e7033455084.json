However, we can express \u03bcI as a ratio to the value you provided for 1H (the hydrogen nucleus), which has a g-factor of 1:\n\n\u03bcI = (I / 1)^2 * 2.00 * B\n\nTo get the actual value, we would need more information about the magnetic field and the specific properties of the 13C nucleus. The options provided seem to be the same as yours but without any additional details, it's not possible to determine the correct answer."
