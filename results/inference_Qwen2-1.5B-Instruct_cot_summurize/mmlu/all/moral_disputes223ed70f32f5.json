Both A and B\n\nAccording to Carruthers, whenever someone is required to act in a certain way toward an animal for the sake of the animal, it is because there exist facts about the animal and the broader effects on human beings. The animal's biology, behavior, and needs must be taken into account when deciding how best to treat them. At the same time, these actions have consequences for humans as well, such as changes in attitudes towards animals or increased awareness of ethical considerations in animal welfare. Therefore, both the animal's biology and the broader impacts on human beings play a role in explaining why people are required to act in certain ways toward animals."
