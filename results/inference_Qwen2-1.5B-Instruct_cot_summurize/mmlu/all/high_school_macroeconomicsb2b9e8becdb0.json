This can lead to lower prices for consumers and increased efficiency in production. As a result, real GDP (Gross Domestic Product adjusted for inflation) may increase. However, this does not necessarily mean that the price level will increase; if production is cheaper, it could also lead to an increase in supply, potentially driving down prices without raising them significantly."
