Basing the price on the full cost of production plus the required profit\n\nCost-based pricing involves calculating the total cost of producing or providing a good or service, including all direct and indirect costs, and then adding a markup that covers the desired profit margin. This method helps ensure that the price reflects the true value of the product or service, which can be important for businesses looking to maximize profits while maintaining quality standards."
