These costs can generally be amortized over the period in which they are incurred, but they may not be deductible for tax purposes if certain conditions are met. For example, if the organization is incorporated under state law and meets certain criteria, it may be able to take a deduction for organizational meeting costs as an adjustment to income. However, this depends on the specific circumstances of each organization and should be reviewed with a tax professional."
