A smaller confidence level would increase the margin of error because it reduces the precision of the estimate.\nII. A smaller sample standard deviation would decrease the margin of error because it reduces the variability of the data within the sample.\nIII. A smaller sample size would also decrease the margin of error but to a lesser extent than a smaller sample standard deviation because there are fewer data points available to calculate the margin of error.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. II and III."
