The University considered a student a \"nonresident\" if the student's primary residence was outside the state at any time during the previous school year. Imma Grant transferred from Sunshine State University to Evergreen State in her junior year, and paid nonresident tuition. She filed a declaratory judgment action against the Evergreen Registrar to have her considered a resident and asked for no money damages. Fourteen groups filed amicus briefs in support of Imma, advocating a change in Evergreen's protectionist regulation. Now that she is a senior, and spent the previous year within Evergreen so she is thus now considered a resident student. The federal court should\n\nA. Dismiss the suit as moot.\nB. Dismiss the suit, because Imma lacked standing to sue initially.\nC. Hear the case if it appears that Ms. Grant is diligently prosecuting the matter.\nD. Hear the case due to the amicus interests.\n"

In this case, Imma Grant transferred from Sunshine State University to Evergreen State University in her junior year, and she has since been declared a resident student by the university. Therefore, there may be amicus briefs supporting her claim, indicating that the issue is relevant and could affect other students' rights. Since she is now considered a resident student, it seems unlikely that the case will become moot once she graduates. Additionally, the fourteenth group filing an amicus brief indicates that the issue is significant enough to warrant consideration by the court. So, the court should hear the case even though it involves a transfer of a student and the issue might not directly impact current students."
