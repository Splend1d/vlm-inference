If a regulation amounts to a taking of private property, the government must either pay just compensation for the property taken or terminate the regulation and pay damages that occurred while the regulation was in effect.\n\nIt's important to note that just compensation means fair and adequate payment for the property taken, which may include lost profits, increased costs of relocation, and other losses incurred as a result of the regulation. The government must also consider any adverse effects on the surrounding community and take appropriate measures to mitigate those effects.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary for the government to address the issue within a specific time frame, such as 30 days, but this is not always required. Ultimately, the government must act in good faith and work towards resolving the issue in a way that is fair and reasonable to all parties involved."
