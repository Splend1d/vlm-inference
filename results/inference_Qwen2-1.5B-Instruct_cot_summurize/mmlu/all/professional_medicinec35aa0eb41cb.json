He appears reluctant to remove his shirt for the examination, and says that he is embarrassed because he has grown breasts during the past year. He is at the 50th percentile for height and weight. Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement?\n\nA. Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor\nB. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome\nC. Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome)\nD. Normal development\n"

This is because the patient is at the 50th percentile for height and weight, which suggests that they have not yet reached puberty and therefore their breast development is expected. The other options listed do not fit with the patient's age or medical history. \n\nIt is important to note that breast development can be caused by various factors including genetic predisposition, hormonal changes, and environmental influences. Therefore, further evaluation such as hormone levels and genetic testing may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's breast development."
