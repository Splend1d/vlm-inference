Because he conceives of laws in a pragmatic rather than a conceptual manner.\n\nAustin's philosophical position, known as Pragmatism, emphasizes the practical consequences and outcomes of actions rather than their abstract or theoretical meaning. In this context, Austin would argue that laws should be judged by their effectiveness in achieving desired social outcomes, such as promoting cooperation and reducing conflict. He would likely suggest that laws should be flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances and that they should not be rigidly adhered to without considering their practical impact. This pragmatic approach contrasts with a more conceptual view of law that focuses on its theoretical foundations and principles."
