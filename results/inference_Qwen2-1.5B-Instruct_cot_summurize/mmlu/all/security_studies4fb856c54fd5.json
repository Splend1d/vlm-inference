Realism posits that states exist primarily for self-interest, and that they seek to achieve their goals through power politics and statecraft. It also assumes that states are rational actors who weigh the costs and benefits of their actions and make decisions based on maximizing their own interests. Additionally, realism argues that the international system is anarchic, with no overarching governing body or ideology that guides state behavior."
