However, this can also lead to overfitting if the model is too complex for the training data. On the other hand, forcing all classes to have the same mean vector may result in less flexibility but reduces the risk of overfitting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: whether we allow classes to have different mean vectors or we force them to share the same mean vector."
