This means that the magnetic field has no effect on the populations since they remain unchanged throughout the period of interest. Therefore, we can ignore the magnetic field for this calculation.\n\nThe populations after a 5.0 \u03bcs pulse can be calculated using the formula above:\n\nP = B^2 / (4\u03c0\u03b5_0h)\n\nAfter plugging in the values, we get:\n\nP = (4.697 * 10^-3)^2 / (4\u03c0\u03b5_0*9.109 * 10^-31 * 2.82e-16) \u2248 0.00001\n\nSo, the populations are approximately 1%, which is equivalent to half the population of the ground state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. n\u03b1 = \u00bd(n\u03b1eq + n\u03b2eq) and n\u03b2 = \u00bd(n\u03b1eq + n\u03b2eq)."
