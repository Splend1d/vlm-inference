At the man's trial, the owner of the liquor store was called to testify. He admitted that he was unable to identify the man, who now had a shaven head, as the robber. The prosecuting attorney then handed the owner six photographs. He proposed to testify, over defense objections, that he had previously told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4, admittedly a picture of the man before he shaved his head, was a picture of the person who robbed his store. The owner's proffered testimony should be adjudged\n\nA. admissible as a prior identification by the witness.\nB. admissible as past recollection recorded.\nC. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation.\n"

The owner's proffered testimony that he had previously told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4 was a picture of the person who robbed his store would qualify as a hearsay statement. However, this statement does not fall under any recognized exception to the hearsay rule, such as the business record exception or the declarant against interest exception. Therefore, the admission of this statement would violate the defendant's right to confront witnesses."
