An increase in the number of graduates at tuba maker training school.\n\nWhen there is an increase in the number of graduates from tuba maker training schools, it can lead to an increase in the supply of tuba makers, which can drive down the prices of tubas. This is because there are more people who can make tubas, and they may be able to sell their products at lower prices than before.\n\nOn the other hand, increasing the price of tubas or offering tuba lessons would not necessarily increase wages for tuba makers, as these changes would affect the overall demand for tubas rather than directly impacting the wages of those involved in making them. Similarly, an increase in taxes on tubas would also not have a direct impact on the wages of tuba makers.\n\nTherefore, the best option to increase wages for tuba makers is to encourage more graduates to attend training schools."
