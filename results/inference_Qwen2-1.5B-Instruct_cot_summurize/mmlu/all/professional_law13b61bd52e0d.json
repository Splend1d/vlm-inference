The retailer emailed a note back saying \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised.\" No shipment was sent, but four months later when the market demand for widgets skyrocketed, the retailer sued the manufacturer for breach claiming that the retailer suffered damages by not having received the shipment of ten trucks as agreed. Does the retailer have a legal right to collect damages under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\nB. No, the parties do not set a date for delivery, which always invalidates a contract between merchants for the delivery of goods.\nC. No, the retailer never called back and asked for the widgets, which means that the contract was not finally confirmed and legalized.\nD. Yes, the retailer is entitled to collect damages because the manufacturer violated the doctrine of avoidable consequences.\n"

Yes, there is a specific and detailed enough offer, followed by an unequivocal acceptance, indicating an intent to form a contract.\n\nWhen a party makes an offer, it must be clear and definite, and the offeree must understand what they are agreeing to. In this case, the manufacturer's offer was clear and definite, stating that they would sell ten truckloads of construction-quality widgets for $1,000 per truck. The retailer's acceptance of the offer was also clear and definite, with their email message clearly stating \"Please send 10 truckloads as promised.\"\n\nAdditionally, the parties' conduct after the offer was made indicates that they intended to enter into a contract. The retailer did not call back and ask for the widgets, which could suggest that they had already accepted the offer and were preparing to purchase them.\n\nTherefore, based on the evidence presented, the retailer has a legal right to collect damages under these facts."
