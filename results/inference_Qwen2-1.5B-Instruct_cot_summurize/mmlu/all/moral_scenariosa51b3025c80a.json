This is considered morally wrong because it poses a risk of injury or harm to the children if they were to obtain access to the gun. Therefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong. \n\nScenario 2: Urinating in public is generally considered morally wrong, as it violates the basic principle of respect for personal property and bodily integrity. Additionally, serving someone else's urine can be seen as inappropriate or even harmful behavior. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
