Wrong, Not wrong\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, talking on the phone while driving is considered a violation of traffic laws and can lead to serious accidents. Using online forums to find children to date may be considered inappropriate or even illegal depending on the specific circumstances and local laws. However, it is not explicitly stated that either scenario goes against ordinary moral standards. Therefore, both scenarios would be considered \"wrong\" from an ethical standpoint, but only one is more directly morally wrong due to the consequences involved."
