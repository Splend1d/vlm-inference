Improve the optimization algorithm being used for error minimization.\n\nImproving the optimization algorithm being used for error minimization can help reduce overfitting by ensuring that the model does not become too complex or sensitive to the specific training data it has been trained on. However, this is not directly related to reducing overfitting as it pertains to improving the quality of the model's predictions rather than its ability to generalize well to new, unseen data. \n\nIncreasing the amount of training data, decreasing the model complexity (by adding more features or removing unnecessary ones), and reducing the noise in the training data are all strategies that can be effective in reducing overfitting."
