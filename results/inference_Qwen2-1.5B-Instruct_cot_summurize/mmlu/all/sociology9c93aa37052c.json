This means that race is not based on biological differences between individuals, but rather on societal expectations and discrimination based on skin color, ethnicity, and other factors. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that race is an objective way of categorizing people on biological grounds, as it is a socially constructed category. The theories also suggest that racial identities are fluid and can change over time due to changing circumstances and experiences."
