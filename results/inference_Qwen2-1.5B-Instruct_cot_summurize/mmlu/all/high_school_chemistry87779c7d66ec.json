                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the ideal gas law equation: PV = nRT, where P is pressure (in atm), V is volume (in liters), n is number of moles, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol*K)), and T is temperature (in Kelvin). We'll start by converting all temperatures to Kelvin.\n- 127\u00b0C = 319 K\n- 875 mm Hg = 1167 kPa\n\nAt first, the gas occupies a volume of 5.00 L with a pressure of 875 kPa. Using the ideal gas law, we get:\nPV = nRT\nn = PV / RT\nn = (875 * 10^(-3) * 319) / (8.314 * 319)\nn = 0.0277 moles\n\nNow, let's assume that the process is adiabatic, meaning no heat is exchanged between the gas and its surroundings. This means that \u0394U = Q = 0.\nThe work done by the gas during expansion will be equal to the change in internal energy (\u0394U) due to heating. According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, W = \u0394U + Q, so we have:\nW = -Q\nSince Q = 0, we get:\nW = 0\n\nNow, we need to find the final temperature after the gas expands from 5.00 L to 10.00 L at constant pressure. Let's denote the final temperature as T_f. We know that the volume changes by a factor of 2, so the new volume is 10.00 L, and the original volume is 5.000 L. The new volume is given by:\nV_f = V_i * (1 + \u03b4V)\nwhere \u03b4V is the change in volume per mole. For one mole of an ideal gas, the change in volume is proportional to the square root of the change in temperature, so:\n\u03b4V = V_f/V_i * \u221a(T_f/T_i)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\u03b4V = (10/5) * \u221a((T_f/319))\n\u03b4V = 2 * \u221a(T_f/319)\n\u03b4V = 2 * \u221a(T_f/319)\n\nWe also know that the work done by the gas during expansion is equal to the change in internal energy, so:\nW = 0\nW = nRT_f * ln(V_f/V_i)\n0 = nR(T_f/T_i) * ln(V_f/V_i)\n\nSolving for T_f gives:\nT_f = T_i * ln(V_f/V_i)\n\nSubstituting the known values:\nT_f = 319 * ln(10/5)\nT_f = 319 * ln(2)\nT_f \u2248 454 K\n\nTherefore, the final temperature is approximately 454 K, which corresponds to option A."
