In Burgess's concentric zone model, the first zone consists of residential areas, the second zone consists of commercial areas, and the third zone consists of industrial areas. Higher-rent apartments are typically found in the second zone, as they cater to residents who work in nearby businesses or commute to other parts of the city. Single-family homes are also more common in this zone due to its proximity to employment centers."
