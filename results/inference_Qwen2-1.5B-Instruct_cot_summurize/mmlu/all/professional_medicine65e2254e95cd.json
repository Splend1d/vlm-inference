A needle biopsy of the prostate gland is done on all men with serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL (N<4). One hundred men undergo biopsy procedures; 90 are found to have prostate cancer, and five are found to have chronic prostatitis. Which of the following is necessary to calculate the sensitivity of this test?\n\nA. Incidence of chronic prostatitis in the general population\nB. Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen\nC. Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population\nD.

In other words, it's the percentage of people who actually have the condition that come back positive for the test.\n\nIn this case, we want to find out what proportion of men with a serum PSA concentration above 5 ng/mL would be expected to have prostate cancer if the test were perfect. The number of men with a serum PSA concentration above 5 ng/mL and a negative biopsy result would be our denominator, while the number of men with a positive test result but no prostate cancer would be our numerator. \n\nWe can't directly use the total number of men with a positive test result because that includes both those who do and don't have prostate cancer. However, we know from the data given that 90 men had prostate cancer, so we can estimate the prevalence of prostate cancer among men with a serum PSA concentration above 5 ng/mL by dividing this number by the number of men with a positive test result. This gives us the proportion of men with a positive test result and no prostate cancer, which we can then multiply by the total number of men with a positive test result to get the number of men with prostate cancer who actually have the disease.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nC. Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population"
