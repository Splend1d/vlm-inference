However, the decline in explicit memory tends to be more pronounced than that in implicit memory. This means that while people's ability to recall information they have learned may decrease, their ability to perform tasks that require them to use that information, such as solving puzzles or playing games, remains relatively stable. Additionally, research suggests that certain types of cognitive abilities, such as visual-spatial reasoning, remain relatively stable throughout adulthood. Therefore, option C is the best answer."
