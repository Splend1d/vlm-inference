The most common causes of laryngeal oedema are infections such as strep throat, viral infections like rubella or measles, or allergic reactions.\n\nThe larynx contains many small blood vessels, which are located in the submucosal space between the muscularis externa (outer layer) and the mucosa. These blood vessels supply oxygenated blood to the vocal cords, which are responsible for producing sound through vibration.\n\nWhen the larynx becomes inflamed due to infection or other reasons, the muscles around it may contract involuntarily, leading to swelling of the larynx. This can be caused by various factors such as dehydration, physical trauma, or stress. In severe cases, laryngeal oedema can lead to difficulty in breathing and even paralysis of the vocal cords.\n\nIn summary, the presence of many small blood vessels in the submucosal space of the larynx makes it vulnerable to inflammation, which can result in laryngeal oedema."
