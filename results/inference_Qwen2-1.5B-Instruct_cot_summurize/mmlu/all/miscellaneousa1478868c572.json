It weakened the plantation system in the southern states.\n\nThe construction of a transportation network during this time period was crucial to the growth of the American economy and helped to stimulate the development of a market revolution by making it easier to transport goods across long distances. This allowed for greater competition among farmers, which led to increased efficiency and ultimately weaker plantation systems in the south. The transportation network also facilitated the expansion of the cotton industry, which played a significant role in the economic growth of the nation."
