II and III.\n\nDatagrams sent from a node in a network using IPv4 protocol must have a size that is less than or equal to the largest MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) of all the links on the path to the destination. This ensures that the data packets do not exceed the capacity of the network link.\n\nDatagrams may also be fragmented during routing, as they are not guaranteed to reach their final destination. However, this does not necessarily mean that the fragments will be reassembled only at the destination - it depends on how the network is configured and how routers handle fragmentation.\n\nTherefore, options A and C are incorrect because they suggest that either I or both I and II are false, which contradicts the information given in the question. Option B is correct because option II suggests that fragments can be reassembled, while option III suggests that the fragments will be reassembled only at the destination, but this is not necessarily true due to fragmentation and reassembly rules in IP networks."
