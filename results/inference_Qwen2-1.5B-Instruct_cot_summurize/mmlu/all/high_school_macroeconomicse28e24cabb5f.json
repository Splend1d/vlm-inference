More investment in capital infrastructure and less consumption of nondurable goods and services.\n\nInvesting in capital infrastructure can lead to increased productivity, which can ultimately result in faster economic growth. Additionally, reducing consumption of nondurable goods and services may also stimulate economic activity by encouraging people to spend money on more expensive items that require more capital investment. However, eliminating mandatory school attendance laws and annual limits on the number of foreigners immigrating into the United States would not have a direct impact on economic growth."
