These gases scatter light of all colors, but they scatter red light less effectively than blue light. This is why we see the sky as blue during the day. As the sun sets, the blue light is scattered by air molecules and other particles, while red and orange light remains unperturbed. This causes the sky to turn reddish or orange at sunset and sunrise."
