This is known as Type II error. When using a MANOVA, this risk can be reduced by controlling for potential confounding variables or by using appropriate statistical techniques such as Bonferroni correction.\n\nIn addition, MANOVA allows for multiple comparisons to be made without needing to perform multiple-comparison follow-up tests, which can increase the likelihood of committing a Type I error.\n\nTherefore, when comparing the performance of learning-disabled and normal students on different scales of the WISC-R, using an ANOVA might provide some useful information, but a MANOVA would offer greater protection against Type II error and may also allow for more accurate interpretation of the results."
