It encourages participants to think outside the box and generate as many ideas as possible, regardless of their relevance or feasibility. This type of thinking promotes divergent thinking, where individuals consider a wide range of possibilities rather than focusing on specific solutions.\n\nConvergent thinking, on the other hand, refers to the process of narrowing down options or selecting one solution that fits a given set of criteria. While it can be useful in refining ideas, it does not encourage the exploration of all potential solutions.\n\nDeductive reasoning involves starting from a premise and logically deriving a conclusion based on logical connections within that premise. Groupthink, on the other hand, refers to a situation where group members become overly influenced by fear, intimidation, or conformity, resulting in decisions that are irrational or even harmful.\n\nTherefore, using brainstorming techniques to solve problems encourages divergent thinking, leading to more innovative and comprehensive solutions."
