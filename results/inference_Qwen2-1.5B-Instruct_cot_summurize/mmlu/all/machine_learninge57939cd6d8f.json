Bagging reduces the variance of the model by reducing the probability of overfitting by randomly selecting samples from the training data set for each bootstrap sample.\n\nOption A, B, and D are not directly related to preventing overfitting in bagging. Sampling with replacement can help reduce bias but does not prevent overfitting. Weak classifiers can be used to improve generalization, but they do not inherently prevent overfitting. Validation performed on every classifier trained would increase the computational cost of the model without necessarily improving its performance."
