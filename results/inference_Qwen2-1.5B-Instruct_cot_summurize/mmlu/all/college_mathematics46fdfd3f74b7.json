It is possible to place a linear order relation on the complex numbers C which make (C, +, \u00d7, \u2264) an ordered field.\n\nTo prove this statement, we need to show that there exists a linear order relation \u2264 on the complex numbers C that makes (C, +, \u00d7, \u2264) an ordered field. \n\nFirstly, note that the real numbers R form an ordered field with the usual addition (+) and multiplication (*). By considering the subset of the complex numbers consisting of those whose imaginary part is non-negative, we can obtain a subfield of the complex numbers that has all the properties of R except for the ordering property. This is because the set of positive reals forms a totally ordered subset of the real numbers, but it does not contain a positive element greater than any negative element. However, in the complex numbers, every positive number has a corresponding negative number whose product is 1 (i.e., 0), so the positive elements of the complex numbers do form a totally ordered subset.\n\nTherefore, by considering only the positive elements of the complex numbers, we have obtained a subfield of the complex numbers that is not an ordered field under the standard ordering (+, \u00d7). However, if we consider the subset of the complex numbers consisting of those whose imaginary part is non-positive, then we have an ordered field (with respect to the standard ordering (+, \u00d7)) that contains all the positive real numbers as its elements. This means that the complex numbers themselves form an ordered field under the standard ordering (+, \u00d7).\n\nHence, option B is correct."
