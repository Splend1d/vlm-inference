                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: For every positive integer \\(n\\), there exists a cyclic group of order \\(n\\).\n\nThis statement is true. Cyclic groups can be defined as groups where every element has a unique cycle. These cycles have the property that they form a subgroup under multiplication and also generate the entire group. Since any number \\(n\\) can be expressed as \\(k \\times m\\) for some integers \\(k\\) and \\(m\\), we can construct a cyclic group with exactly \\(n\\) elements by taking the cyclic group generated by the identity element (which always generates the entire group) and multiplying it by itself \\(n-1\\) times to get all the other elements. This ensures that the group has exactly \\(n\\) elements.\n\nStatement 2: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.\n\nThis statement is also true. In a cyclic group, every element in the group has a unique cycle. If \\(n\\) is the order of the group, then the orders of its elements range from 1 to \\(n-1\\). Therefore, if \\(d|n\\) (where \\(d\\) is the divisor of \\(n\\)), there must exist at least one element whose order is \\(d\\), because dividing \\(n\\) by \\(d\\) will give you all possible orders between \\(1\\) and \\(n-1\\).\n\nThus, both statements are true, making the correct answer:\n\n**A. True, True**"
