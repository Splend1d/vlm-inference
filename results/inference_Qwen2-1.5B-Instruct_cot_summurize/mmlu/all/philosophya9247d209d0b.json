However, if we assume that Brandt is referring to John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism, then his views would most closely resemble option C, a rule-utilitarianism based on ideal moral rules. This is because Mill believed in the importance of following certain moral principles and using them as guides for making decisions. He also believed that these moral principles should be chosen based on their inherent goodness rather than their usefulness or popularity. Therefore, his approach to ethics would be similar to that of someone who follows ideal moral rules rather than specific rules derived from social conventions."
