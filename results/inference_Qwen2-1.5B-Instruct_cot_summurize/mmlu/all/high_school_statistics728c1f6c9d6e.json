This approach helps establish causality by identifying a direct link between two variables that can be measured and observed. \n\nA complete census, a least squares regression line showing high correlation, and a simple random sample (SRS) do not provide enough information to establish cause-and-effect relationships. A census collects all available data on a particular subject or phenomenon, but does not allow for manipulation or control over variables. A least squares regression line shows how two variables are related, but without any control over the variables involved, it cannot establish causation. Finally, an SRS provides a random sample from a population, but does not allow for manipulation or control over variables."
