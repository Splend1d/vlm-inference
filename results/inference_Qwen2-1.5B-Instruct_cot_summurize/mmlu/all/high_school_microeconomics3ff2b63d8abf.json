In other words, if the price increases by 1%, then the quantity demanded will also increase by 1%. This type of demand is considered to be perfectly elastic, meaning that there is no limit to how much the quantity demanded can decrease with a small percentage increase in price. Therefore, a business should decrease the price to increase revenue when the demand price elasticity is equal to 1."
