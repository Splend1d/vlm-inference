If the alpha is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, which of the following is the most likely result?\n\nA. Significant findings can be reported with greater confidence\nB.

There is an increased likelihood of statistically significant findings.\n\nWhen the alpha level (alpha) is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, there is less certainty that the results are due to chance. This means that if the new antihypertensive drug is actually better than standard therapy, it is more likely to be found to be so when compared to the placebo group. Therefore, there is an increased likelihood of statistically significant findings."
