However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill?\n\nA. The commerce clause.\nB. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The Commerce Clause provides the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill because it protects against arbitrary taxation that discriminates against interstate commerce. The Commerce Clause prohibits Congress from passing laws that apply unequally to the same class of persons engaged in the same trade or commerce across state lines. If the state tax bill imposes unequal burdens on interstate commerce, it would violate the Commerce Clause."
