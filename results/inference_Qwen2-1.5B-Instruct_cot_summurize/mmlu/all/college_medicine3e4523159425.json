It refers to the body's capacity to perform repeated physical activities without fatigue or exhaustion. Strong muscles and powerful leg muscles can help improve performance in shorter distances, but they may not be sufficient for long-distance events like marathons. Stride length and power also play important roles in marathon running, but they do not have as significant a role as stamina in determining success."
