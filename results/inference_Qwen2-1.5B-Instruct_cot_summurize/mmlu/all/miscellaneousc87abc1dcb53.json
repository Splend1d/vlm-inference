This process releases minerals that can then be transported by rivers and other natural means to the ocean where they can precipitate out as salt crystals. The oceans also play a role in recycling these minerals back into the atmosphere through processes like evaporation and precipitation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. the weathering of continental rocks."
