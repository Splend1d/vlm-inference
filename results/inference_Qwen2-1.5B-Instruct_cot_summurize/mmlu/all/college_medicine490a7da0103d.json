Lymphoid progenitor. \n\nIn acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the myeloid progenitor cells that remain after chemotherapy treatment are transformed into lymphoid progenitor cells, which then differentiate into different types of lymphocytes such as B cells or T cells. These lymphoid progenitors can further differentiate into mature lymphocytes, including B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Therefore, the stem cell that arises from AML would be transformed into a lymphoid progenitor cell, not an NK cell, platelet, or T cell."
