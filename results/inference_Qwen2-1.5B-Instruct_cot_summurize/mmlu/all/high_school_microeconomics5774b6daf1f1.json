This can happen when the price charged by the monopoly is equal to the marginal cost of producing one additional unit of output.\n\nTherefore, the monopolist's profit maximization condition (which involves marginal revenue equaling marginal cost) leads to an output level where price is equal to marginal cost. The other options listed are not relevant in this context as they refer to situations where the monopolist is making non-profitable profits or where the monopoly has too much or too little output."
