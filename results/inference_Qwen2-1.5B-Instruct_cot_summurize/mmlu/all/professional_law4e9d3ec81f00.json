This clause requires that laws be reasonable and not overly broad, which means that they must serve a legitimate governmental interest and not unduly burden protected rights or interests. In this case, the federal statute is designed to prevent racial discrimination in the sale, transfer, or rental of real estate, which is a legitimate government interest. Additionally, the statute is narrowly tailored to achieve its goal, as it only applies to private and public sales, transfers, and rentals of real estate. Therefore, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides the best rationale for the enactment of this federal statute."
