This means that the slope of the line tangent to the curve at \\(x=3\\) must be equal to \\(-4\\).\n\nSince \\(F'(x) = -4\\) at \\(x=3\\), we have:\n\\[F''(x) = -4\\]\n\nThe second derivative of \\(F(x)\\) gives us the slope of the tangent line, which is the rate of change of the function with respect to its first derivative. Thus, \\(F''(x) = -4\\) means that the function is concave down (meaning it's decreasing) for all values of \\(x\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate \\(F(3.02)\\):\n\\[F(3.02) = F(3) + (-4)(3.02 - 3)\\]\n\\[= 8 - 4(0.02)\\]\n\\[= 8 - 0.08\\]\n\\[= 7.92\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 7.92."
