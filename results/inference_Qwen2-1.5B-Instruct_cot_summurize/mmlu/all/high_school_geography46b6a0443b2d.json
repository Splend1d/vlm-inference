Fourth Agricultural Revolution.\n\nThe term \"Fourth Agricultural Revolution\" refers to the period from the 18th century onwards, when significant changes occurred in agriculture that led to increased productivity and efficiency. These changes were driven by advances in technology such as the steam engine, mechanization, and the introduction of new crops and livestock breeds. The Industrial Revolution also played a role in this development, as it provided the means for large-scale production and distribution of goods. However, it was not until the 20th century that these developments began to have a significant impact on agricultural practices and the overall economy."
