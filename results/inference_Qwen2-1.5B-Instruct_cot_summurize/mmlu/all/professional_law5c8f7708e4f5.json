Over the course of time, the land development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern development and a western development, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that \"the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single- family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. \"After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:\"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern development and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern development. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, grantor \u0080\u0094 land development company, its successors and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. \"At the time of this conveyance, the land development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Which of the following would best describe the country club's interest in the SO-acre tract that it purchased from the land development company?\n\nA. Fee simple determinable.\nB. Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\nC. Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.\nD. Easement appurtenant.\n"

Fee simple subject to condition subsequent. \n\nWhen a country club purchases a parcel of land with conditions attached, such as restricting the use of the land to a specific purpose or requiring certain improvements to be made before the land can be used for another purpose, the country club obtains a fee simple determinable interest in the land. This means that if the country club does not comply with the conditions within a specified period of time, the land will revert back to the land developer.\n\nIn this case, the country club's interest is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent because it has the right to use the land for a specific purpose (a country club), but if the country club fails to comply with the conditions within a specified period of time, the land will revert back to the land developer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Fee simple subject to condition subsequent."
