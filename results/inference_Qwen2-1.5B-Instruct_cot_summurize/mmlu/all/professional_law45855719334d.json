Adjoining the farmland was a 50-acre ranch, which was owned by a rancher. In 2004, the rancher forged the farmer's signature on a deed and purported to convey the farmland to a grocer. The grocer paid the rancher $100,000 as the purchase price for the farmland. The following year, the grocer sold the property to a buyer for $125,000. The deed from the grocer to the buyer was properly executed and recorded by the buyer. This jurisdiction has the following \"pure race\" recording statute in effect:\"No conveyance or other instrument is valid as against purchasers for a valuable consideration who record first. \"After the buyer took possession of the farmland, he renovated the farmhouse that was located on the property and made improvements valued at $50,000. In 2006, the farmer returned to visit his sister. During his visit, the farmer went to the farmland to inspect his farmland. While doing so, he encountered the buyer, who informed the farmer that he was the new owner of the property. The farmer thereupon instituted suit to quiet title to the farmland. After judgment was rendered in the farmer's favor, the buyer was ejected from the property. The buyer has now filed an appropriate action against the grocer seeking restitution for the loss he incurred with respect to the purchase and improvements made on the farmland.
