We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nWhich one of the following political movements most closely shared many of the goals outlined by the Populist Party?\n\nA. Progressivism of the early 1900s\nB. Neoconservatism of the 1980s\nC. Federalism of the late 1700s\nD. Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s\n"

It advocated for popular sovereignty, direct democracy, and the rights of states and local communities to govern themselves. The Populist Party platform of 1892 also emphasized similar principles such as restoring the government to the hands of \"the plain people,\" opposing corporate interests, and advocating for social and economic reforms.\n\nTherefore, the Populist Party platform is most closely associated with Jacksonian Democracy."
