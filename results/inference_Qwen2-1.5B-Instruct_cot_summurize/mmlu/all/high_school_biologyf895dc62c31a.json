Their offspring have less genetic variation than the parents.\n\nThis is because mules are relatively long-lived and hardy organisms that can survive and reproduce without significant genetic mutations or changes in their genome due to the lack of proper meiosis. Therefore, there is less genetic variation among mule offspring compared to the genetic variation found within the parents. This means that mules tend to produce more genetically similar offspring compared to other organisms with higher levels of genetic diversity."
