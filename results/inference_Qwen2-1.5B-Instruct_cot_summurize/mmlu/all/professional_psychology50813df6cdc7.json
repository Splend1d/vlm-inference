Low-context communication is grounded in the situation, which means that it involves providing minimal information and relying on context clues to understand what is being communicated. This type of communication is often used when there is limited time or when the speaker needs to convey complex ideas quickly. In contrast, high-context communication typically involves providing extensive information and relies heavily on nonverbal cues such as body language and facial expressions to convey meaning. High-context communication can be more difficult for people who do not have strong cultural ties to understanding the intended message."
