For a person who consumes 2,000 calories per day, the amount of kale they would need annually depends on their caloric requirements. However, since the question asks for the total annual requirement without specifying the individual's specific calorie needs, we can use the general average daily consumption rate as a starting point.\n\nLet's assume a typical serving size of kale is about 2 cups (or 240 grams), which contains around 75 calories per cup (source: Nutrition data). If we consider a person consuming 2,000 calories per day:\n\nTotal daily caloric intake = 2,000 calories\n\nIf we divide this by the number of calories per cup:\n\\[ \\frac{2,000}{75} = 26.67 \\]\n\nThis means a person would consume about 26.67 cups of kale per day. Since there are 8 cups in a pint, 16 pints make up a cup, so a person would eat approximately 16 * 26.67 = 420 cups of kale per week.\n\nGiven the annual consumption rate is based on a 365-day year, and assuming an equal distribution across the year, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Annual Consumption} = \\frac{\\text{Daily Consumption}}{365} \\times 365 = \\frac{420}{365} \\times 365 \\]\n\n\\[ = 1 \\times 365 \\]\n\n\\[ = 365 \\] cups of kale per year.\n\nNow let's convert cups to kilograms, knowing that 1 pound equals 0.453592 kilograms, and 1 cup equals 0.005 pounds:\n\n\\[ 365 \\text{ cups} = 365 \\times 0.005 \\text{ pounds} = 0.1825 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nSince 1 pound equals 453.592 grams:\n\n\\[ 0.1825 \\text{ pounds} = 0.1825 \\times 453.592 \\text{ grams} = 83.1225 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 2*10^5 kg/year."
