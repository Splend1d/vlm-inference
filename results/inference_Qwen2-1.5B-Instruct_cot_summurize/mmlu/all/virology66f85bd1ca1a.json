One way to study the virus is through animal models. These models can help scientists understand the biology and behavior of the virus in different hosts and environments, which can provide valuable insights into its replication cycle, pathogenesis, and potential transmission mechanisms.\n\nAnimal models can also be used to test new drugs or vaccines for the treatment or prevention of norovirus infections. By studying these animals, researchers can learn more about the virus's impact on their immune systems and body processes, which can inform the development of targeted therapies.\n\nIn addition, animal models can be used to monitor the spread and dynamics of norovirus outbreaks in different populations and settings, such as hospitals, schools, and food facilities. This information can be used to identify potential sources of infection and guide public health interventions.\n\nTherefore, while the human norovirus may not be easily cultured in cell cultures, it can still be studied and investigated through animal models."
