In this case, the individual has two copies of the recessive allele, which means they cannot transmit it to their offspring. However, if they have a child with an unaffected partner (who also carries one copy of the recessive allele), the child may inherit both copies of the recessive allele and be a carrier of the disease. This allows for the disease to be passed down through generations, even though the affected individual does not experience any symptoms themselves.\n\nHomozygosity refers to having two identical alleles at a particular locus on a chromosome. In this case, since the individual is homozygous recessive, they carry only one copy of the recessive allele but exhibit the phenotype associated with the disease."
