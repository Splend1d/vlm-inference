The detection of a skull fracture.\n\nComputed tomography (CT) is often used to detect fractures and other injuries in the head and spine, including those caused by skull fractures. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is more sensitive for detecting brain tumors, but it may not be as useful for detecting fractures or other types of injuries in the head and spine. Therefore, MRI is generally preferred over CT for these conditions. \n\nHowever, if you have a suspected skull fracture, your doctor may choose to use either CT or MRI depending on their experience and the specifics of your case."
