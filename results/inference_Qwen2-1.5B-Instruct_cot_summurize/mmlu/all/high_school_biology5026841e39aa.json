This process is essential for ensuring that each daughter cell receives an accurate copy of the genetic material. Other cellular processes, such as protein synthesis or the movement of substances across the plasma membrane, do not require microtubules for their function. Chemiosmosis also does not directly involve microtubules in its operation, although it is influenced by the energy stored in ATP molecules."
