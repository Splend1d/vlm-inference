The BEKK model reduces the dimensionality problem that arises when a number of series are modelled together.\n\nIn the diagonal VECH approach, each individual variable's conditional variance is estimated separately using a separate equation, resulting in a large number of parameters for each variable. This can lead to overfitting and difficulty interpreting the results. In contrast, the BEKK approach uses Bayesian estimation techniques to incorporate prior knowledge about expert opinions or domain-specific information into the model, leading to more interpretable and accurate parameter estimates. Additionally, the reduced dimensionality of the BEKK model makes it easier to visualize and understand the relationships between variables, which can be crucial for understanding the underlying dynamics of financial markets."
