Some countries have had relatively significant growth rates. \n\nSub-Saharan Africa has seen relative economic growth over the last few decades, with several countries experiencing positive GDP growth rates. However, there are still many challenges and disparities within the region. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is one example of a country that has experienced significant economic decline since its independence in 1960. Despite having high oil reserves, the DRC has struggled with political instability, corruption, and poverty, leading to a decrease in per capita income compared to initial estimates from 1980."
