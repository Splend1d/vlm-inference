For several months sections of the building had been wobbling noticeably, particularly during inclement weather, when the river pounded more aggressively against the structure. Several employees and customers complained but the general manager did not respond. One windy night a section of the pier collapsed into the river, killing 28 customers and employees. It was revealed that officials had on several prior occasions cited the club for violating applicable safety regulations. The police arrested the general manager and charged him with involuntary manslaughter. He defended on the basis that his omissions to act were legally insufficient to establish manslaughter. What will the court decide?\n\nA. This was not manslaughter because the omission to respond to safety citations is not enough to establish the high degree of criminal negligence that is required.\nB. The failure to act is much less culpable than active recklessness, and therefore there was insufficient evidence to charge manslaughter.\nC. A corporate employee cannot be prosecuted for the crime of manslaughter with respect to the performance or nonperformance of his duties on behalf of the corporation.\nD. The charge of involuntary manslaughter is legally sufficient because the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful under the circumstances.\n"

The charge of involuntary manslaughter is legally sufficient because the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful under the circumstances.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter is a type of homicide where a person acts negligently or recklessly in causing death, but does not have the intent to kill. In this case, the manager was responsible for ensuring the safety of the patrons at the nightclub, as well as maintaining the structural integrity of the pier. When the pier collapsed due to the force of the river pounding against it, the manager's actions were negligent and unlawful. Therefore, the court would likely find that the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful under the circumstances, which constitutes voluntary manslaughter rather than involuntary manslaughter."
