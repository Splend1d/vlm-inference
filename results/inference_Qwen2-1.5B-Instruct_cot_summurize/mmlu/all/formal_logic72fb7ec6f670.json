(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2261 C)\n\nThis statement represents the logical relationship between the given conditions in a clear and concise manner. It states that if England imports beef, then it must be because France subsidizes agriculture; however, if China promotes human rights, this implies that South Africa does not supply diamonds. Therefore, the first part of the statement (F \u2192 E) indicates that the two conditions are connected through an implication, and the second part (~S \u2261 C) expresses the opposite direction of the implication, meaning that if South Africa supplies diamonds, then China does not promote human rights. This formulation accurately captures the complex interconnections between the conditions presented in the original sentence."
