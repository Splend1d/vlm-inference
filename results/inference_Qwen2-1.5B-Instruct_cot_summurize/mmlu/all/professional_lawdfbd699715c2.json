The woman's attorney had recently been embarrassed in court by the judge to whom the case was assigned. Wishing to avoid difficulties with the judge, the woman's attorney promptly removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal-question jurisdiction. The employer's attorney has timely moved to remand. How is the federal court likely to proceed?\n\nA. Remand the entire case.\nB. Remand the state claims but keep the federal claims.\nC. Retain the case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in having it proceed before a judge who has shown clear hostility toward the woman's attorney.\nD. Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims.\n"

This is because the woman's attorney's motivation for removing the case may have been motivated by fear of bias or prejudice against the woman's attorney. Additionally, the removal motion was made within 30 days after the original filing, which is not too late. Therefore, the court will most likely allow the case to continue in federal court."
