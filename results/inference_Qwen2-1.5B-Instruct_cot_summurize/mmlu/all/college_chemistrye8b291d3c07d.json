                    "text": "The correct answer is A: both 35Cl and 37Cl have I = 0.\n\nThis statement is accurate because the nuclear spin quantum number (I) for an electron in an atom can only be zero, one, or two. In the case of 12CHCl3, the molecule consists of three carbon atoms, each with four electrons. Therefore, each carbon atom has a total of eight electrons, which means that there should be a net magnetic moment of zero due to the cancellation of the magnetic moments of the individual electrons. This is what is referred to as \"nuclear spin\" or \"spin quantum number\", denoted by I. \n\nSince all the electrons in this molecule have identical spins (I = 0), they cancel out when adding them together, resulting in a total magnetic moment of zero. This is known as the \"g-factor\". However, the molecule also contains a chlorine atom, which has a spin quantum number of 1/2. Since the chlorine atom does not have any other unpaired electrons, it contributes its own contribution to the overall magnetic moment of the molecule, but this does not affect the overall g-factor since it cancels out. Therefore, the molecule's 1H spectrum will show a singlet state."
