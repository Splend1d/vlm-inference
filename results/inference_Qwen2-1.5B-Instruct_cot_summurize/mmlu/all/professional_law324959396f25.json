This income tax exempts taxable income earned outside of the state by photographers who live in the state. Moreover, resident-photographers of the state are not taxed on their in-state earned income. A photographer who operates a studio in the state but is a resident of another state, challenges the constitutionality of this tax. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The commerce clause.\nD. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.\n"

In other words, it grants Congress the authority to regulate trade between different states or with foreign countries.\n\nIn this case, the tax imposed by the state on non-resident photographers who operate photographic studios in the state could be seen as an attempt to regulate commerce between the state and other states or with foreign countries. Therefore, the Commerce Clause might provide the most applicable basis for challenging the constitutionality of this tax under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nC. The commerce clause."
