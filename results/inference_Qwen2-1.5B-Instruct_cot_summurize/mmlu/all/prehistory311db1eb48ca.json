All of the above.\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) is known for its highly centralized economies, carefully planned and designed cities, standardized weights and measures, and advanced agricultural techniques. The IVC was one of the earliest civilizations in South Asia, with evidence of settlements dating back to around 3500 BCE. The civilization flourished from about 2600 to 1900 BCE and is considered to be one of the most sophisticated ancient civilizations in the world. The IVC's achievements include the construction of complex urban planning, the development of writing systems, and the invention of the plow, which allowed for more efficient farming practices."
