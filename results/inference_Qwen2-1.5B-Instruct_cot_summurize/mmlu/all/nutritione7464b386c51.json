Elimination of toxins\n\nAfter consuming food, the gastrointestinal tract plays a crucial role in removing harmful substances that may have been ingested, such as toxins, pathogens, and foreign particles. This process helps to maintain homeostasis and prevent illness. The other options listed (absorption and retention of water and electrolytes, maintenance of barrier function, extraction of maximum value from nutrients) also play important roles in maintaining overall health, but their primary importance lies in protecting the body against potential threats rather than directly facilitating survival after eating."
