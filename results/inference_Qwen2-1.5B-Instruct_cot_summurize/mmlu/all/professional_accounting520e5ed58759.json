This could indicate that there are accounts receivable that need further investigation or clarification before being included in the total amount owed to the client.\n\nIf payments that should have been recorded but were not, this would be one possible reason for the categorization as \"exception.\" Similarly, if there are responses that were mailed rather than faxed to the auditor, this could also be a reason for the categorization.\n\nHowever, the options provided do not specifically mention any of these scenarios, so they cannot be definitively ruled out without additional information."
