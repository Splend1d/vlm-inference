In a chemical reaction involving nitrogen monoxide (NO), when it is reduced to nitric oxide (NO2), nitrogen is not oxidized but rather reduced. Nitrogen gas (N2) does not participate in this reaction as it is already present in excess amounts. Therefore, nitric oxide (NO2) is the only possible product of this reaction. The other options listed do not correspond to any known products of a chemical reaction involving nitrogen monoxide."
