Gemeinschaft is a society based on community, Gesellschaft one based on association\n\nGemeinschaft refers to communities or societies that are based on close relationships and shared values, often found within families, tribes, or ethnic groups. In contrast, Gesellschaft refers to societies based on individualism, competition, and the pursuit of personal success and wealth. While both concepts involve some form of social organization, Gemeinschaft emphasizes collective bonds and shared values, while Gesellschaft emphasizes individualism and self-interest."
