PCOS is a hormonal disorder that affects females and can lead to irregular periods or no periods at all. It is characterized by an excess of male hormones and insulin resistance, which can affect the body's ability to regulate menstruation. Other possible causes include hyperthyroidism or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but these conditions would typically present with other symptoms such as weight gain, fatigue, or infertility."
