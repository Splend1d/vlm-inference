Continue working with Lisa but consult with a colleague if he believes his attraction might be interfering with his objectivity.\n\nAs a psychologist, it is important to maintain professional boundaries and avoid any situations where there is a risk of compromising objectivity or impairing therapeutic relationships. If Dr. Jones becomes sexually attracted to Lisa during therapy, it may affect his ability to provide unbiased guidance and support. In this case, consulting with a colleague who can offer additional expertise and support would be appropriate."
