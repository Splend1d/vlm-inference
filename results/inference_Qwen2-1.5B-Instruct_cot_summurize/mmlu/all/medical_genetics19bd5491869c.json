AIP can cause severe neurological symptoms if left untreated.\n\nMaple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called transaminase. The condition results in the accumulation of abnormal amino acids in the blood, leading to yellowing of the skin and eyes.\n\nMedium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is a rare inherited disorder affecting the body's ability to break down certain fatty acids. MCADD can lead to liver damage, heart problems, and other complications.\n\nZellweger syndrome is a developmental disorder caused by a defect in the enzyme alpha-1,3-glucanase, which is essential for the development of the central nervous system. It can result in intellectual disability, seizures, and other neurological issues.\n\nTherefore, all four options listed are peroxisomal disorders."
