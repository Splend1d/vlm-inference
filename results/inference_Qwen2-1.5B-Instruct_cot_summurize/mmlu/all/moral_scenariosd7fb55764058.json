However, if someone feels uncomfortable or threatened by this contact, they may have a right to refuse it.\n\nScenario 2 involves taking action to avoid harm, which is also generally seen as morally appropriate behavior. Slamming on one's breaks can cause damage to property or vehicles, but it is still a reasonable response to an unexpected threat or danger. Therefore, neither scenario is inherently morally wrong, but rather depends on individual circumstances and the specific actions involved."
