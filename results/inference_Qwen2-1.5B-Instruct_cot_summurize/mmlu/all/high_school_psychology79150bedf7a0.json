When the delay between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) is too long, it can lead to the strengthening of the association between the CS and the UCS through classical conditioning. This means that after a long enough delay, the CS may no longer be able to elicit a response from the subject even when paired with the UCS. \n\nOther options do not affect the ability of the CS to elicit a response in the absence of the UCS:\n\n- Interval schedule between the two stimuli: This refers to the timing of when the CS and UCS occur relative to each other. It does not affect the ability of the CS to elicit a response.\n- Fixed-ratio schedule between the two stimuli: This schedule specifies how often the CS must occur before the UCS occurs. It does not affect the ability of the CS to elicit a response in the absence of the UCS.\n- Interstimulus ratio: This refers to the number of seconds that pass between the presentation of the CS and the presentation of the UCS. It does not affect the ability of the CS to elicit a response in the absence of the UCS."
