All of the above.\n\nAccording to Sandel, eugenics and genetic enhancement can be seen to be wrong from a religious perspective for several reasons:\n\n1. The Bible explicitly opposes all forms of technological enhancement, including genetic modification and other forms of genetic engineering.\n2. Using these technologies could lead to a loss of faith in God and an atheistic or agnostic worldview.\n3. It could also lead to confusion about our relationship with God, as it may seem that we have control over our own bodies and destinies through technology rather than relying on God's\u65e8\u610f."
