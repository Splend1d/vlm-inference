All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter; Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French radicals and German police spies.\nTwo things result from this fact.\nI. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power.\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\"\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nBy 1917, which idea in this pamphlet had become a reality in Russia?\n\nA. The avoidance of entangling foreign alliances\nB. The violent overthrow of the bourgeois by the proletariat\nC. The establishment of a powerful Russian Parliament\nD. The adoption of free education for all children in public schools\n"
