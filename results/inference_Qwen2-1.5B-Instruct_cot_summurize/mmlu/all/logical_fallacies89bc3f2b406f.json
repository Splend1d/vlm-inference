This fallacy occurs when someone appeals to the expertise or authority of another person or group in order to support their own argument. In this case, Tan Ah Tiat argues that his opium habit does not cause harm because he is too old to work and therefore receives money from his grandmother. However, this argument is invalid because it assumes that the grandmother's income is sufficient to sustain Tan Ah Tiat without working. It also ignores the fact that opium use can have serious physical and mental health consequences, including addiction and overdose. Therefore, the correct answer would be (D) Appeal to Authority."
