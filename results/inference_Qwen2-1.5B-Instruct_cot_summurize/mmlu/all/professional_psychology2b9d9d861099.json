Standardized test results show that the incumbent does not have all the aptitudes expected for the particular job. Asking someone's age during personnel selection is generally not appropriate because it could potentially discriminate against individuals based on their age. Additionally, asking about age can be seen as discriminatory if it has no basis in objective criteria or is used to make hiring decisions solely based on age. Therefore, it is important to consider the specific circumstances of each situation before making any assumptions about an individual's abilities based on their age."
