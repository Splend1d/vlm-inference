An acf that declines geometrically and a pacf that is zero after q lags.\nIn an ARMA(p,q) model, the autoregressive (AR) part of the model determines the shape of the autocorrelation function (ACF). The moving average (MA) part of the model determines the shape of the partial autocorrelation function (PACF).\nFor an ARMA(p,q) model, the ACF will decline geometrically with p lags, meaning that the correlation between two observations at lag i and i+p will be approximately 0 for large values of i. The PACF will also decline geometrically with q lags, meaning that the correlation between two observations at lags i and j will be approximately 0 for large values of i and j.\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer."
