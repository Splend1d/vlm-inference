Therefore, option C (both A and B) could be correct if Callahan were discussing this topic.\n\nHowever, without more specific information about what was discussed by the commission, it is impossible to determine which of these options is accurate. It is important to note that discussions regarding laws permitting euthanasia and doctor-patient relationships are complex issues with strong emotional and legal implications."
