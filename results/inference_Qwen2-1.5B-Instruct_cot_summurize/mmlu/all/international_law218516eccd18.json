Yes, it has been consistently held by the Court since the La Grand case (2001) that provisional measures issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) are binding on the parties.\n\nIn La Grand, the ICC issued provisional measures requiring the parties to provide information about their financial assets and to cooperate with the ICC in an investigation into allegations of war crimes committed during the conflict in Sierra Leone. The ICC also ordered the parties to refrain from obstructing or interfering with the ICC's investigations and proceedings.\n\nThe court ruled that the provisional measures were binding on the parties because they were necessary for the effective conduct of the ICC's investigations and proceedings. The court emphasized that the ICC had broad powers under its treaty obligations to issue provisional measures as a means of ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of its investigations and proceedings.\n\nSince La Grand, other cases have confirmed that provisional measures issued by the ICC are binding on the parties. For example, in the 2016 case of the ICC v. the Democratic Republic of Congo, the court issued provisional measures ordering the parties to disclose certain documents and to make certain witnesses available for questioning. These measures were considered binding on the parties because they were necessary for the effective conduct of the ICC's investigations and proceedings.\n\nTherefore, based on these precedents, the provisional measures issued by the ICC are indeed binding upon the parties."
