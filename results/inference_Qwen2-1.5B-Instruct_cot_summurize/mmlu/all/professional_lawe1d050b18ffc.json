Congress has the power to tax and provide for the general welfare as part of its enumerated powers under Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. This includes the power to regulate commerce among the states, which includes the regulation of transportation services such as air travel. Therefore, Congress can enact legislation to regulate and control the operation of airlines if it believes that doing so is in the public interest."
