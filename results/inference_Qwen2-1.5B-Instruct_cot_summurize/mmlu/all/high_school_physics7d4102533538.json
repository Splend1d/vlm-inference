In this case, we know that the motor's efficiency is 75%, which means that only 75% of the input power (120V x 1.0 A) is converted into mechanical work.\n\nTo find the maximum torque (force that the motor can generate), we can use the formula:\n\nTorque = Input Power x Efficiency\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nTorque = 120V x 1.0 A x 0.75 = 90 Nm\n\nThis torque will be required to lift a mass of 6 kg at constant speed. To find the speed, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nSpeed = Torque / Mass x Gravity Acceleration\n\nUsing the standard acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2) and the mass of the object being lifted (6 kg):\n\nSpeed = 90 Nm / 6 kg x 9.8 m/s^2 \u2248 14.9 m/s\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 1.5 m/s."
