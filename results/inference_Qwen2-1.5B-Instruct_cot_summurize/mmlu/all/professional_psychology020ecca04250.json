While it's true that some children may experience side effects or have difficulty tolerating high doses, the primary benefit of stimulant therapy for ADHD is improved attention and behavior control. A lower dose can help manage symptoms more effectively by reducing side effects while still providing the necessary benefits for improved academic performance and social interaction. It's important to work with healthcare providers to determine an appropriate dosage and monitor any potential side effects."
