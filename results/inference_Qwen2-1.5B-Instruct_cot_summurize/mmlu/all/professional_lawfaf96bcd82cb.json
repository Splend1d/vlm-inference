He was permitted to borrow law books and legal treatises to take home for his own personal use. One afternoon, the law student was preparing a brief in the firm's law library when he noticed a book lying on the conference table. Making sure no one was watching him, he took the book and placed it in his briefcase. He planned to take the book home that night with the intention of not returning it. If the law student is subsequently charged with larceny of the book, which of the following claims, if true, would LEAST aid him in his defense?\n\nA. The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.\nB. He intended to return the book after reading it.\nC. The law firm had given him possession of the book.\nD. The law firm had given him custody of the book.\n"

The law firm had failed to give him his salary for two weeks, and he took the book as security for the debt.\n\nIf the law firm had failed to pay the law student his salary for two weeks, then the law student could argue that taking the book as security for the debt was justified. This claim would help the law student defend against charges of larceny because it shows that the law student had a legitimate reason for taking the book, which is why they did not intend to keep it beyond the agreed-upon period.\n\nOn the other hand, options B, C, and D do not provide any justification for the law student's actions and may actually undermine their defense. Option B suggests that the law student intends to return the book, which contradicts the initial act of borrowing it from the conference table. Option C states that the law firm already possessed the book, which again undermines the argument that the law student intended to return it. Option D implies that the law firm gave the law student custody of the book, which also goes against the initial act of borrowing it from the conference table. Therefore, option A is the least likely claim that would aid the law student in their defense."
