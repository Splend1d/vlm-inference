This ensures that society as a whole receives the most benefit from its production process without any waste or excesses. The other options do not accurately describe allocative efficiency:\n\nA. Means that no inferior products will be produced - This option describes the concept of marginal efficiency of capital, which focuses on how efficiently capital can be used rather than on whether there are enough resources available for all desired goods.\n\nB. Implies that the economy's output is distributed evenly - This would imply perfect competition, where prices reflect market supply and demand perfectly, but this does not guarantee allocative efficiency.\n\nC. Means that those who work hardest will get more - This suggests a focus on individual effort rather than on resource distribution, which is not aligned with allocative efficiency goals."
