We should be 90% confident that the difference in life expectancies is between 6 and 12 years.\n\nThis is because the given information states that the 90% confidence interval estimate of the difference is (6, 12), which means that we are 90% confident that the true difference in life expectancies falls within this range. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the mean life expectancy of one model is twice that of the other. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the mean life expectancy of one model is twice that of the other, which contradicts the given information. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that the mean life expectancy of one model is 6 years while the mean life expectancy of the other is 12 years, which again contradicts the given information. Option C is also incorrect because it suggests that the probability that the life expectancies are different is 0.90, which is not supported by the given information."
