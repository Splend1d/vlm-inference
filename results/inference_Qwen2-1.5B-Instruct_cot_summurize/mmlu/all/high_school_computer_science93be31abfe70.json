                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data. This is because the Internet uses a protocol called Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) which allows packets of data to be sent and received on the network. Each packet consists of a header that includes information about the packet's destination address, length, type of data being transmitted, and any additional metadata required by the sender or receiver. The actual data being transmitted is contained within the body of the packet. This allows for efficient use of bandwidth and ensures that packets are delivered reliably to their intended recipient."
