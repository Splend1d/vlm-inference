A presidential veto is overridden when at least two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate vote to override it. If the president's successful reelection campaign advocated bipartisanship, then there may be enough support among the members of Congress to override the veto.\n\nOption A is incorrect because if approximately 30% of the senators and representatives were members of the presidential political party, that would only give the president enough support to override the veto with a simple majority (51 votes out of 100). Option B is also incorrect because if the majority of American citizens supported the proposed legislation, that would not necessarily lead to an override of the veto. It depends on how much support the legislation has from other parties as well. Option C is also incorrect because the chief justice of the Supreme Court does not have any influence over whether a presidential veto is overridden or not."
