Tropical rain forest\n\nTropical rain forests have high rates of leaching and nutrient cycling due to their high rainfall, which helps to dissolve nutrients in the soil. This can lead to rapid turnover of nutrients in the soil, as these nutrients are often not stored for long periods and are quickly moved through the ecosystem."
