Increase, Decrease, Decrease, Decrease.\n\nIn a contractionary monetary policy, the central bank reduces the money supply by lowering the reserve requirement for banks or by increasing interest rates. This leads to a decrease in aggregate demand as businesses and consumers have less disposable income to spend. As a result, the price level decreases due to lower demand for goods and services. The output also decreases because firms reduce production levels as they expect lower future prices. However, this decrease in output does not necessarily lead to a higher price level since the decrease in aggregate demand may be offset by an increase in substitution effects (as people adjust their spending habits) or a decrease in the cost of labor or inputs. Therefore, the nominal interest rate remains unchanged, but the real interest rate falls due to the reduction in aggregate demand. The price level also decreases as a result of the decrease in aggregate demand."
