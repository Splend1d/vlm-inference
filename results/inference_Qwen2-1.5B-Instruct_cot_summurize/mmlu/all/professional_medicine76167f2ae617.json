This type of pneumothorax occurs when there is a small hole or crack in the lung that allows air to escape into the pleural cavity. It is usually caused by trauma or surgery and can be managed conservatively with observation and treatment of any underlying medical conditions. If the condition worsens or does not improve within a certain time frame, it may require surgical intervention."
