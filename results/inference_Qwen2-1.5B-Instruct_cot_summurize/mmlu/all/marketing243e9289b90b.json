Legal environment.\n\nThe ban on tobacco advertising in various countries reflects legal regulations aimed at reducing the promotion and accessibility of tobacco products to vulnerable populations, such as children and young people. These regulations are primarily influenced by laws that aim to protect public health and prevent the initiation of smoking habits among minors. Therefore, it can be said that the ban on tobacco advertising is an example of an influence from the legal environment."
