The electrodes used in ERW must have certain properties to ensure that the welding process occurs effectively and safely. These properties include:\n\n1. High electrical conductivity: This ensures that the current can flow easily between the electrodes, which is necessary for the welding process to occur.\n\n2. High thermal conductivity: This allows the heat generated during the welding process to be transferred efficiently from one electrode to the other, ensuring that both electrodes are heated to the desired temperature.\n\n3. Sufficient strength to sustain high pressure at elevated temperatures: This property is important because the welding process requires a high-pressure environment, and the electrodes need to be able to withstand this pressure without breaking.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above."
