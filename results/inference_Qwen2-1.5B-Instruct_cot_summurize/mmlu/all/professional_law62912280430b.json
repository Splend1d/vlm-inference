A profit-a-prendre is a type of easement that allows someone to take possession of the land and keep it for their own benefit.\n\nIn this scenario, the resident conveyed the tract \"to the people of the state in fee simple,\" which means that they transferred ownership of the land to the state. However, they also stated that the tract must remain in its natural state and only for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. This restriction on the use of the land by the state creates a profit-a-prendre, where the state has the right to use the land for its own purposes, but cannot actually use it."
