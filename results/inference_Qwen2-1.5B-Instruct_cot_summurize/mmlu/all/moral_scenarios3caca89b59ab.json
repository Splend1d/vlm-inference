This action goes against the principle of not harming others without cause, and it also violates laws regarding the carrying of weapons by minors.\nOn the other hand, holding the neighbor's boy's head above water is not necessarily morally wrong, depending on the context and circumstances surrounding the incident. However, if this behavior resulted in physical harm or emotional distress to the neighbor's boy, then it would be considered morally wrong.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
