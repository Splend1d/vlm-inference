There's a 0.2% chance of an accident on Highway 48 when it's dry and a 1.0% chance of an accident on Highway 48 when it's wet.\n\nWe can calculate the probability of an accident happening as follows:\n\n- For a dry day: \\(0.2\\%\\)\n- For a wet day: \\(1.0\\%\\)\n\nThe total probability of an accident occurring on any given day (considering both scenarios) is the sum of these probabilities:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Probability} = 0.2\\% + 1.0\\% = 1.2\\% \\]\n\nHowever, this total probability must not exceed 100%, which means we need to account for the possibility of no accidents at all. Therefore, we subtract this maximum possible probability from 100%:\n\n\\[ \\text{Actual Probability} = 100\\% - 1.2\\% = 98.8\\% \\]\n\nRounded to two decimal places, this gives us approximately 0.988 or 98.8%. However, since the question asks for the exact value with two significant figures, the correct answer is 0.0016, which corresponds to option B."
