All of the above.\n\nThe Ancestral Puebloans, who lived in what is now southwestern Colorado from about 1000 BCE to 1300 CE, abandoned Mesa Verde due to a combination of factors. The population outstripping the productive capacity of the environment (option A) was likely one reason for their departure. Drought and other environmental changes could also have contributed to their decline. Additionally, they may have been attracted by new religions that were located farther south, which led them to abandon Mesa Verde."
