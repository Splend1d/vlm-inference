A sideswipe occurred between the plaintiff's pickup truck and a trailer truck as they passed in opposite directions. The sideswipe caused the plaintiff's truck to careen down the road and into the path of a second trailer truck. The driver of the second trailer truck was immediately killed. Both of the trailer trucks were owned by the same transport company. At trial, the plaintiff called a witness to the collision to testify that he heard an unidentified female witness scream, \"Oh my God, that trailer truck sideswiped that little pickup truck. \"The trial judge should rule the witness's testimony\n\nA. admissible as a declaration of existing state of mind.\nB. admissible as an excited utterance.\nC. inadmissible, because it contains inadmissible opinion evidence.\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

The exception that applies here would be if the witness was unavailable to testify at trial due to their death or incapacity before the incident. However, since the witness is still alive and available to testify, the testimony cannot be admitted based on this exception.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception."
