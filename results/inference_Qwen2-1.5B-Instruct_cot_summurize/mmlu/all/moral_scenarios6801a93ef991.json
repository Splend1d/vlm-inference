This could include things like not taking calls or messages during work hours, using your cell phone during meetings, etc. In this scenario, the character is engaging in such behavior during their work shift, which goes against the standard of respect for one's coworkers and employers. Therefore, Scenario 1 is considered morally wrong. \n\nOption A is incorrect because speaking on the phone during work hours is generally considered acceptable.\nOption B is also incorrect because helping someone who is in prison is usually considered morally right, but the specific action of escaping from prison may be seen as morally questionable depending on the circumstances.\nOption D is also incorrect because both scenarios involve actions that are generally considered ethical, although they may not align with the individual's personal beliefs or values."
