They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\n\nA. The eastward expansion of Russia\nB. The Portuguese conquest of India\nC. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate\nD. The Spanish conquest of Mexico\n"

Therefore, none of the options provided (A, B, C, or D) can be considered as the correct answer.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the passage describes the trade between Portugal and Japan during the 16th century CE, which was a significant period in world history due to its impact on global trade networks and cultural exchange. It also highlights the importance of trade routes and the role of merchants like the Portuguese in facilitating these exchanges.\n\nIn summary, while the passage does not provide a direct answer to which development would most directly undo the trade patterns described, it does suggest that the establishment of new trade routes and the growth of merchant powers could have had a significant impact on the patterns of trade and economic relationships during this time."
