This activity is generally seen as necessary and beneficial for maintaining productivity and advancing one's career.\n\nIn scenario 2, shooting a hole in the man's ear during gun practice may be considered morally wrong depending on the context and circumstances surrounding it. It could potentially cause harm or distress to the individual who was hit, especially if there were no immediate medical attention provided. However, without knowing the specific details of the situation, it cannot be definitively determined whether this action is morally wrong or not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the actions in scenario 1 are not morally wrong, but scenario 2 may be considered morally wrong based on the potential consequences."
