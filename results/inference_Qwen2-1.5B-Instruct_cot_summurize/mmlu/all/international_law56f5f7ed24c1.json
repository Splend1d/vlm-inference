This means that both the General Assembly and the Security Council can request an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but they must be accompanied by other relevant bodies such as specialized agencies or states that have been authorized by the General Assembly.\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A (only the principal organs of the UN may request an advisory opinion) nor B (all international organizations may request an advisory opinion)."
