                    "text": "The time constant (T2) for a first-order decay process is given by:\n\n\\[T_2 = \\frac{ln(2)}{\\mu}\\]\n\nwhere \u03bc is the rate constant or decay rate. For an exponential decay with \u03a9 = 0 (meaning there's no external force), we can use the equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - \\mu x = 0\\]\n\nThis equation represents a first-order differential equation, which has a characteristic equation \u03bb^2 - \u03bc\u03bb = 0. The roots of this equation give us the decay constants (k1 and k2) for each half-life period in the decay series.\n\nFor a single decay period, the decay constant is:\n\n\\[k_1 = \\frac{\u03bc}{2}\\]\n\nGiven that the amplitude of a free induction decay drops to 25% of its initial intensity after 1.0 s, it means the decay constant is 25%. Therefore,\n\n\\[k_1 = \\frac{0.25}{2} = 0.125\\]\n\nSubstituting this value into the general form of the decay equation gives:\n\n\\[\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - 0.125t = 0\\]\n\nSolving this equation for \\(dx/dt\\) at t=1.0 s yields the amplitude at that point. However, since you've already determined the amplitude is 25%, let's assume you're interested in finding the time constant directly from the decay equation:\n\n\\[k_2 = \\sqrt{0.125} = 0.394\\]\n\nNow using the decay equation again, but substituting the known values:\n\n\\[\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - 0.394t = 0\\]\n\nSolve this equation for \\(dx/dt\\) at t=1.0 s to find the decay constant at that point:\n\n\\[-0.394 * 1.0 = 0\\]\n\nThus, the decay constant at t=1.0 s is also 0.394. Now, using the decay equation:\n\n\\[\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - 0.394t = 0\\]\n\nWe want to solve this for t when the amplitude equals 25% of its initial value (which was found to be 25%), so:\n\n\\[0.25 = 0.394t\\]\n\n\\[t = \\frac{0.25}{0.394} \\approx 0.646 s\\]\n\nTherefore, the time constant T2 is approximately 0.646 seconds, which corresponds to option C. \n\nHowever, if the question asks for the exact time constant from the exponential decay model without solving the differential equation explicitly, then the time constant T2 would be given as the inverse of the decay constant:\n\n\\[T_2 = \\frac{1}{k_2} = \\frac{1}{0.394} \\approx 2.50 s\\]\n\nIn this case, the answer would be D. 1.661 s. Please note that your question mentions \"assuming exponential relaxation\", but does not specify whether the decay should follow an exponential function or another specific type of decay. If the decay follows an exponential function, the exact solution might vary based on the specific parameters involved."
