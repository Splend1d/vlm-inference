About 100 earth days.\n\nOn planet X, the rotation period (sidereal day) is 100 Earth days, which means that the planet rotates once on its axis in the same amount of time it takes for one orbit around the Sun. This implies that the planet has an orbital period of 100 Earth days as well. Therefore, the sidereal day on Planet X is equal to the orbital period, or about 100 Earth days."
