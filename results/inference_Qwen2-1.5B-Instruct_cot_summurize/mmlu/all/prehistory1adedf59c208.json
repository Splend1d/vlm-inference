A small but significant percentage of the genome of modern humans who trace their ancestry to Europe and Asia originated with Neandertals.\n\nThis evidence comes from genetic research that has shown that there is a small amount of genetic material shared between modern humans (Anatomically Modern Humans, or AMH) and Neandertals. This shared genetic material can be seen through the presence of specific DNA markers on chromosomes. The study of these markers has allowed scientists to estimate the degree of interbreeding between modern humans and Neandertals, which is thought to have occurred about 40,000 years ago.\n\nIt's important to note that this evidence does not prove that all modern humans share a major percentage of their genome with Neandertals, as some geneticists believe that this may be due to natural selection rather than direct hybridization. However, it does provide strong evidence that there was some form of interbreeding between the two groups."
