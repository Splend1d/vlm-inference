However, this equation doesn't seem directly solvable without numerical methods or approximations, so let's focus on finding the first point where the velocity becomes negative, indicating the object reverses direction:\n\nWe can start by setting \\(v'(t) = 0\\) and solving for \\(t\\) explicitly:\n\n\\[-t \\sin(t) - \\frac{1}{t+2} = 0\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(t+2\\) to get rid of the denominator:\n\\[-t \\cdot (t+2) \\sin(t) - 1 = 0\\]\n\nExpand and rearrange:\n\\[-t^2 \\sin(t) - 1 = 0\\]\n\nNow, we have:\n\\[-t^2 \\sin(t) = 1\\]\n\nDividing by \\(-t^2\\) gives us:\n\\[\\sin(t) = -\\frac{1}{t^2}\\]\n\nThis is a transcendental equation that requires numerical solutions. Using numerical methods like Newton-Raphson or other root-finding techniques, we might find that there is only one solution for \\(t\\) within the interval \\(0 < t < 10\\).\n\nThus, the object reverses direction once.\n\nCorrect answer: B. one"
