This includes the ability to think about things that do not exist yet (hypotheses), make predictions based on evidence, and plan out future actions or courses of action.\n\nSimple motor responses to sensory stimuli and capacity to deal well with concrete objects without understanding reversibility would be more associated with earlier stages of development, such as the preoperational stage. Logical reasoning and systematic planning are typically seen as hallmarks of later stages of cognitive development, including the formal operational stage."
