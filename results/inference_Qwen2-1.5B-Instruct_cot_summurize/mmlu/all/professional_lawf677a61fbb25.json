No, because the defendant may not prove his good character by specific instances of good conduct.\nC.

This is known as \"character evidence\" and can be used to show that a person acted in accordance with their character traits. In this case, the witness's testimony about the defendant's past dealings with the black market could be used to suggest that the defendant was a thief, which would be relevant to the current charge of theft. However, the question specifically asks whether the witness's testimony is admissible, so we need to determine if it meets the requirements for admissibility under the rules of evidence. The answer is yes, but only if the witness is properly identified as a witness who can testify to the defendant's past actions. If the witness is someone who is not qualified to testify on this matter (for example, if they were involved in the black market themselves), then their testimony may be excluded."
