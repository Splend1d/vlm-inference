This action may be considered distracting or unsafe, but it does not involve any illegal or harmful behavior.\nScenario 2 is also not considered morally wrong, as it involves laughing at a funny joke with someone else who is not a family member or friend. While it may be considered inappropriate in some situations, such as in a professional setting or when discussing sensitive topics, this action does not involve any harm or wrongdoing towards others. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
