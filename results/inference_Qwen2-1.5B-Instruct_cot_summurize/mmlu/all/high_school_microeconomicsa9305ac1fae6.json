This ensures that the total revenue from selling additional units of output equals the total variable costs, allowing the firm to break even and potentially earn a profit. If the MC exceeds the MR, the firm will need to reduce production or increase prices to maintain profitability. Conversely, if the MC is less than the MR, the firm can increase production without decreasing profits."
