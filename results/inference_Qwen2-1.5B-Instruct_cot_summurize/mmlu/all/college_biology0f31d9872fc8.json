Respiration, on the other hand, is a process by which organisms use oxygen to break down organic matter, releasing carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Combustion of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when they are burned, but this does not involve respiration or bacterial decomposition. Therefore, combustion of fossil fuels is not a source of atmospheric carbon."
