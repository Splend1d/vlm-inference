H. when he lost control of the car and jumped a curb, striking a woman who was walking along the sidewalk. As a result of the collision, the woman suffered severe internal injuries and fractured both legs. She was hospitalized for 11 months and became permanently disabled. If the defendant is charged with attempted murder, he should be found\n\nA. guilty, because a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts.\nB. guilty, because criminal liability is predicated upon the defendant's willful and wanton disregard for the safety of others.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant did not intend to kill the woman.\nD. not guilty, because he lost control of the vehicle.\n"

This action clearly falls within the definition of \"willful and wanton\" conduct required for an attempted murder charge under most legal systems. The fact that the defendant lost control of his vehicle does not absolve him of responsibility if it can be proven that his actions were intentional or reckless enough to cause such harm. Therefore, the defendant would likely be found guilty based on the evidence presented during trial."
