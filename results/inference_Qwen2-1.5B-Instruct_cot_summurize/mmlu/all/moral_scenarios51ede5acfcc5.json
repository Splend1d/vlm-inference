Therefore, making your partner scream for help the entire evening would be considered morally wrong. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that both scenarios are morally neutral, but one is considered morally wrong while the other is not. Option C is also incorrect because it suggests that neither scenario is morally wrong, which contradicts the information provided about the second scenario. Option D is also incorrect because it suggests that both scenarios are morally neutral, which is not supported by the information provided."
