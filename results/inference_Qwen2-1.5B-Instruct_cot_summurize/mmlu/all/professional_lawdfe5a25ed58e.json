A short while later at home, the shopper was preparing a sardine sandwich when she opened the can and, to her astonishment, she saw a decomposed mouse. The shopper became nauseated and vomited upon seeing the mouse. After consulting her attorney, the shopper initiated a strict liability action against the company. At trial, the shopper presented into evidence the sardine can with the company's label, along with other corroborating evidence. The attorney representing the company objected to the introduction of the label on the can. The trial court should\n\nA. overrule the objection, because the label is self-authenticating.\nB. overrule the objection, because the label is the best evidence showing that the can was produced by the company.\nC. sustain the objection, because there is no corroborating evidence that the company placed the label on the can.\nD. sustain the objection, because the shopper's proper cause of action is for infliction of emotional distress, not strict liability.\n"

Sustain the objection, because the shopper's proper cause of action is for infliction of emotional distress, not strict liability.\n\nStrict liability refers to a legal doctrine under which an individual or entity may be held liable for damages caused by their actions even if they did not intend to do so. In this case, the shopper is seeking compensation for emotional distress rather than damages caused by the product itself. Therefore, the shopper cannot establish a claim based on strict liability.\n\nIt is important to note that the label on the can does not provide any corroborating evidence about whether the company actually produced the can containing the decomposed mouse. The label simply states that the can contains sardines, but it does not contain any information about the contents inside the can. Corrobating evidence would include information from the manufacturer, supplier, or distributor of the sardines, as well as any records or documentation related to the production process.\n\nIn summary, the shopper's attorney has the right to object to the introduction of the label on the can because it does not provide corrobating evidence about whether the company actually produced the can containing the decomposed mouse. The shopper's proper cause of action is for infliction of emotional distress, not strict liability."
