Instead, it provided for the gradual emancipation of slaves in certain areas where they could safely live and work without fear of being caught by Confederate forces.\n\nThe proclamation was designed to provide temporary freedom to enslaved people within the United States, as well as in some territories held by foreign powers (such as Cuba), while also preserving the Union against the threat posed by the Confederacy. It did not apply to all slaves throughout the country; rather, it focused on freeing those who lived in areas controlled by the Union and who were able to remain there after the Civil War began.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nA. were living in the areas still in rebellion"
