The presence of folds, villi and microvilli on the surface of enterocytes magnifies the absorptive area\n\nThe absorptive area of the human intestine refers to the part of the intestinal wall where nutrients can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This area is highly specialized and includes folds (known as villi) and microvilli, which help to increase the surface area available for nutrient absorption.\n\nFolds and villi increase the contact area between the intestinal lining and the food being digested. This allows for more efficient absorption of nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and fatty acids.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most accurate statement about the absorptive area of the human intestine."
