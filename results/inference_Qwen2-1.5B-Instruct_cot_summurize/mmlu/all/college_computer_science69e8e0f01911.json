A particular compilation requires 30 seconds of computation and 200 file page accesses.

The total time for a compilation running on both workstations would be:\n\n- Time for computation: \\(T_{comp} = 30\\) seconds.\n- Time for file access: \\(T_{access} = N \\times 0.05\\) seconds.\n\nOn the file server, since all file pages are retrieved at once, the total time would be the sum of the times for computation and file access:\n\n\\[T_{total}_{FS} = T_{comp} + T_{access}\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[T_{total}_{FS} = 30 + N \\times 0.05\\]\n\nOn the local disk workstation, each file page can be accessed independently without any overlap, so the total time for accessing all pages would be \\(N \\times 0.1\\) seconds.\n\nThe ratio of the total time required on the file server compared to the local disk workstation is:\n\n\\[\\frac{T_{total}_{FS}}{T_{total}_{WD}} = \\frac{30 + N \\times 0.05}{N \\times 0.1}\\]\n\nSimplifying this expression gives us the ratio in terms of \\(N\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{T_{total}_{FS}}{T_{total}_{WD}} = \\frac{30}{N} + \\frac{0.05}{N}\\]\n\nWe want to find the value of \\(N\\) such that this ratio equals 1, which means there is no overlap between the two workstations' computations and file access:\n\n\\[\\frac{30}{N} + \\frac{0.05}{N} = 1\\]\n\nMultiplying through by \\(N\\) to clear the denominators:\n\n\\[30 + 0.05 = N\\]\n\n\\[30.05 = N\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the total time required by this compilation if run on the diskless (file server) workstation to the total time required if run on the workstation with the local disk is:\n\n\\[\\frac{30}{N} + \\frac{0.05}{N} = \\frac{30}{30.05} + \\frac{0.05}{30.05} = \\frac{100}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} = 20 + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{121}{6} = \\frac{53}{6}\\]\n\nThis simplifies to approximately \\(8.83\\), but we're looking for a whole number, indicating our calculation was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the simplified form:\n\n\\[T_{total}_{FS} = 30 + 0.05N\\]\n\\[T_{total}_{WD} = 200\\]\n\nFor the ratio to be 1, \\(T_{total}_{FS}\\) must equal \\(T_{total}_{WD}\\):\n\n\\[30 + 0.05N = 200\\]\n\nSolving for \\(N\\):\n\n\\[0.05N = 200 - 30\\]\n\\[0.05N = 170\\]\n\\[N = 170 / 0.05\\]\n\\[N = 3400\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratio again using the correct value of \\(N\\):\n\n\\[T_{total}_{FS} = 30 + 0.05(3400)\\]\n\\[T_{total}_{FS} = 30 + 170\\]\n\\[T_{total}_{FS} = 200\\]\n\nAnd for the local disk workstation:\n\n\\[T_{total}_{WD} = 200\\]\n\nSo the ratio of the total time required by this compilation if run on the diskless workstation to the total time required if run on the workstation with the local disk is:\n\n\\[\\frac{T_{total}_{FS}}{T_{total}_{WD}} = \\frac{200}{200} = 1\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **A. 1/1**."
