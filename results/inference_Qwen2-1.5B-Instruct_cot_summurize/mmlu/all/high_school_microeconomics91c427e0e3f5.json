Subsidize the firm or its customers.\n\nSubsidizing the firm would provide financial assistance to the producer, making their product more affordable and thus increasing consumer demand for it. This can lead to higher production levels, greater output, and potentially lower prices, as well as reduced negative externalities such as pollution or congestion in urban areas. It's important to note that while subsidies may be beneficial in certain cases, they should not be used excessively because they can distort markets and lead to inefficiencies if they become too prevalent."
