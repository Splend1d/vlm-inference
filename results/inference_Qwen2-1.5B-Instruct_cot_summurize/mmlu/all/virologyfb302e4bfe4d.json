This rash then clears up on its own without any complications.\n\nHowever, some individuals may experience more severe symptoms, including fever, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sometimes even pneumonia or bronchitis. In rare cases, the virus can lead to serious complications such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), and sometimes even death.\n\nIn addition to the rash and encephalitis, the MMR vaccine can also cause mild side effects such as sore throat, headache, and low-grade fever. However, these are not considered to be part of the rubella syndrome."
