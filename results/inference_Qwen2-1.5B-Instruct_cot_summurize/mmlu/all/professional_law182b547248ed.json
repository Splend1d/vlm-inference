Murder.\n\nMurder is the most serious offense under criminal law because it involves intentional or premeditated killing of another person without justification. Felony murder occurs when a death occurs as a result of a felony committed during the commission of that felony. Involuntary manslaughter may occur if the defendant did not intend to kill but their actions led to the death of another person. Voluntary manslaughter occurs when the defendant acted with malice aforethought, but the death occurred due to an unforeseeable event."
