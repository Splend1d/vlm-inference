Attention to handwashing and hygiene\n\nHand washing with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom or before eating, can help prevent the spread of norovirus and other infectious diseases. Additionally, proper disposal of used tissues and avoiding contact with sick people can also reduce the risk of spreading the virus.\n\nAntiviral drugs may be effective in treating certain types of norovirus infections, but they do not provide long-term immunity against the virus. Norovirus vaccines have not yet been developed, although some studies are ongoing. \n\nQuarantine involves isolating individuals who are suspected of having an infectious disease from others to prevent the spread of the infection. While this can be effective in reducing the spread of certain diseases, it does not address the underlying cause of the illness."
