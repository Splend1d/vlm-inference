The action turned on the scope of the work covered by the contract. The contractor and the homeowner were the only witnesses at the bench trial, and they strongly disagreed about the scope of the work. At the end of the trial, the judge stated findings of fact on the record but never issued a written opinion. Neither party objected to the findings. The judge found in favor of the homeowner, and the contractor appealed. Is the appellate court likely to overturn the findings?\n\nA. No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.\nB. No, because the contractor failed to object to the findings when the judge stated them in open court.\nC. Yes, because a judge must set forth findings of fact in a written opinion or memorandum of decision.\nD. Yes, because there were disputed issues of fact at trial.\n"

Yes, because a judge must set forth findings of fact in a written opinion or memorandum of decision.\n\nThe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that findings of fact be included in the judge's written opinion or memorandum of decision. If the judge did not issue a written opinion, it is presumed that the judge found in favor of one side based on their testimony alone. This would violate the requirement of due process under the Sixth Amendment. Therefore, the appellate court is likely to overturn the findings if it believes the judge should have provided more than just factual statements in the written opinion."
