A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. If this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase?\n\nA. Chance of a type I error\nB. Chance of a type II error\nC.

This is because there will be less variability in the data and the effect of the treatment may not be detectable if the sample size is small. Therefore, increasing the sample size can help reduce the chances of committing a Type II error by providing enough evidence to support the conclusion that the treatment is effective."
