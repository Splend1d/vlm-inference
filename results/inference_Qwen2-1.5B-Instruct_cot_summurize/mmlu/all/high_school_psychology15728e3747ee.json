This is because people tend to draw on existing knowledge and experiences when processing new information, and if the new information does not fit into their existing schema or understanding, they may find it difficult to recall or process it effectively. \n\nB. People will not recall information unless it is stored in working memory is incorrect. While it is true that short-term memory (working memory) plays a role in encoding and storing information for later retrieval, it is not necessary for all types of information to be processed through this mechanism. For example, some memories can be encoded directly without going through working memory.\n\nC. People have no ability to recall information that has been extinguished is also incorrect. Extinction refers to the loss of a memory due to lack of use or reinforcement over time. However, extinction can occur even after the memory has been retrieved before. The brain retains traces of memories, even when those memories have been forgotten.\n\nD. People will recall nonsense syllables more rapidly than they will sets of numbers is also incorrect. Nonsense syllables are typically less meaningful and easier to ignore than numbers, so recalling them would take longer compared to recalling a set of numbers."
