His pulse is 130/min, respirations are 8/min and shallow, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Examination shows a 2-cm wound at the left sixth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. The trachea is at the midline. Heart sounds are not audible. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Chest x-ray\nB. Echocardiography\nC. Bronchoscopy\nD. Pericardiocentesis\n"

This procedure involves inserting a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) into the airway through the mouth or nose to visualize and potentially treat any damage to the lungs caused by the injury. It can also help determine if there are any complications such as bleeding or infection that need immediate attention. Other options like chest x-ray, echocardiography, pericardiocentesis, or bronchoscopy are all related to the specific problem being addressed but are not necessarily the first-line treatment in this case."
