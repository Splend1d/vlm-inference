Price level and real GDP.\n\nWhen there is an increase in aggregate demand, the economy moves towards the higher point on the aggregate supply curve. This means that more resources (e.g., labor, capital, etc.) are used to produce goods and services. As a result, prices tend to rise as well, leading to an increase in the price level.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that real GDP will increase. In fact, when aggregate demand increases, the economy may not be able to produce enough goods and services to meet the increased demand if the economy is already producing at full capacity. Therefore, the increase in aggregate demand can lead to a decrease in real GDP.\n\nSo, while both price level and real GDP can increase, it's important to note that they do so for different reasons. The key factor that determines whether these two variables increase or remain constant is the economy's ability to produce goods and services to meet the increased demand."
