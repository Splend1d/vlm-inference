Additionally, the professor should not be permitted to introduce evidence that shows the graduate submitted a plagiarized paper in a moot court brief or that his reputation among his fellow classmates is that he frequently cheats on law school examinations because these facts are not relevant to the issue of whether the graduate cheated on an exam in the entertainment law class. Instead, the professor should focus on introducing evidence that shows that the graduate was aware of the seriousness of his actions and that he took steps to rectify them after they were discovered."
