In the case of sarcoidosis, it is possible that the corticosteroids being used to treat the disease may have caused bone loss or weakened the bones. However, without further testing such as bone density scans or imaging studies like CT or MRI, it is difficult to confirm a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Therefore, based on the available information, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is osteoporosis."
