This process involves several steps, including the release of proteolytic enzymes from the oocyte (egg) to prevent polyspermy (the formation of multiple nuclei). These enzymes also help to stabilize the nucleus during the fusion process. Once the zygote has formed, it undergoes further development and differentiation before eventually becoming an adult organism."
