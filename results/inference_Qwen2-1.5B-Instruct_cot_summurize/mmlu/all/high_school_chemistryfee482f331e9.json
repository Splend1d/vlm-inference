Then, you would add 600 mL of the stock solution to the flask and swirl it to ensure that all of the solution is mixed well.\n\nAfter this, you can fill the flask the rest of the way with distilled water and shake gently to ensure that the solution is evenly distributed throughout the flask. This will give you a final concentration of 3.0 M H2SO4 in your volumetric flask."
