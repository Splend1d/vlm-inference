This is because the safety of a food additive is evaluated based on whether there is no evidence of human toxicity after prolonged exposure over an extended period of time.\n\nThe other options listed do not necessarily guarantee the safety of a food additive:\n\n- Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) from its presence in food is less than its ADI: This is also important, but it does not guarantee safety. The ADI represents the maximum level of exposure that can be safely ingested without causing harm, and even if the EDI is below the ADI, there may still be potential health risks.\n- Its toxic effects are observed only at doses 100x the EDI: This is another important consideration, as it indicates that even very high doses would not cause harmful effects. However, this alone is not sufficient to ensure safety.\n- Its benefits outweigh its risks: While this is an important factor to consider, it should not be used as the sole basis for determining the safety of a food additive. Safety must be evaluated based on multiple factors, including risk assessment and regulatory standards."
