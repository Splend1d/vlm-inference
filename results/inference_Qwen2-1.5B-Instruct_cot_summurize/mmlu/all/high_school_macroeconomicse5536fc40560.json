This causes the equilibrium price (the point where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied) to fall below its previous level. At the same time, when the supply increases, it means producers are willing to sell more units at any given price, causing the supply curve to shift to the right. Since the new equilibrium price is lower than before, the new equilibrium quantity is also higher than the old one, resulting in an indeterminate equilibrium quantity."
