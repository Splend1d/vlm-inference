(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nAll four options are disadvantages of the Dickey-Fuller / Engle-Granger approach to testing for cointegration and modeling cointegrating relationships:\n\n(i) Only one cointegrating relationship can be estimated - This means that if there are multiple cointegrating relationships, the test may only detect one or none of them.\n(ii) Particularly for small samples. There is a high chance of the tests suggesting that variables are not cointegrated when they are - This suggests that the test may fail to detect non-cointegrated relationships even when they exist.\n(iii) It is not possible to make inferences on the cointegrating regression - This means that the test does not provide any information about the strength or direction of the cointegrating relationships between the variables being tested.\n(iv) The procedure forces the researcher to specify which is the dependent variable and which are the independent variables - This means that researchers must choose which variable will be the dependent variable, making it difficult to use the test for more than two variables at once."
