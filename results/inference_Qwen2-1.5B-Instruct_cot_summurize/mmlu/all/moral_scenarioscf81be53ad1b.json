The person has taken on excessive debt by going into gambling, which is an act of self-destruction and greed rather than enjoyment or entertainment. Therefore, this scenario involves a clear violation of moral norms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no mention of morality in the given options.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because while taking out a gun may seem like a necessary action for cleaning, it still goes against ordinary moral standards as it involves a potentially dangerous activity without proper justification or consideration for others' safety.\n\nOption C is correct because taking out a gun to clean it would be seen as a morally wrong act due to its potential risks and dangers involved with such actions. It's important to remember that even seemingly harmless activities can have serious consequences when they are performed recklessly or without proper consideration for others.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis provided, option C is the most appropriate answer, indicating that Scenario 1 is morally wrong."
