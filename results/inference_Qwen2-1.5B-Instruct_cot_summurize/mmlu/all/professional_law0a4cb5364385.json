The offeree sent a notification to the offeror stating, \"We have received your offer to sell landscaping stone per specified terms this date.\" The offeror shipped the goods upon receiving that notification. On the date of shipment, the offeree posted an acceptance form with slight modifications to the terms. After the goods arrived, the offeree called the offeror's manager and told him that the company was unable to accept the offer at this time, he was shipping the goods back, and to \"ignore any paperwork we sent.\" The offeror sued the offeree for breach of contract. Who will prevail?\n\nA. The offeror will prevail because the posting of the acceptance finalized a contract between the parties.\nB. The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.\nC. The offeror will prevail because it shipped the goods when it received the first acceptance.\nD. The offeree will prevail because it rejected the offer when it called the offeror's manager.\n"

The offeree will prevail because it never accepted the offer on the same terms specified.\n\nWhen the offeree receives the notification from the offeror specifying the terms of sale, they have no choice but to comply with those terms or face potential legal consequences. By sending the acceptance form with slight modifications after the goods were shipped, the offeree did not actually accept the terms as originally stated in the offer. Instead, they made a counteroffer which the offeror could either accept or reject. Since the offeree rejected the original offer by sending their counteroffer, the offeror has the right to reject the offer and sue for breach of contract if the offeree fails to honor the rejection."
