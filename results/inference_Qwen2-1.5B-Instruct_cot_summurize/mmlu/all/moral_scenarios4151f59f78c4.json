Therefore, spending 20 minutes on chores before playing video games would be considered morally wrong by most people. \n\nOption B, \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" is incorrect because it suggests that the action was not morally wrong but also not right, which is not true in this case. Option C, \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" is incorrect because it suggests that the action was not morally wrong, but still goes against societal norms. Option D, \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" is also incorrect because it suggests that both actions were morally neutral, which is not true either."
