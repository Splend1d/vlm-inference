Intrusive, Artificial, Consumerism, Insecurity, Social Stereotypes. \n\nMarketing communications can be intrusive in nature, as they often require consumers to make decisions about their purchases based on information presented by companies. This can lead to artificial needs being created, as consumers feel pressure to purchase certain products or services in order to fit in with societal norms or expectations. \n\nAdditionally, marketing messages may reinforce consumerist values, such as the belief that material possessions bring happiness and security. However, this can also contribute to feelings of insecurity among consumers who struggle to meet these societal standards. Finally, marketing messages may perpetuate social stereotypes, which can be harmful and limiting for individuals from marginalized groups."
