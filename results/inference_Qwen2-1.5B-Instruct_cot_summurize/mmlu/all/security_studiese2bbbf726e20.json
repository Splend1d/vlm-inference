Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system.\nB. Peace research, in contrast to university IR, was under a great deal of pressure to deal with relevant issues with a high expectation of immediate delivery of policy answers.\nC. There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.\nD. The setting was simultaneously informed by political theory as the dominant discipline and isolated from developments in theory in the different disciplines.\n"

This meant that researchers had to draw on knowledge from multiple fields such as sociology, psychology, economics, law, and politics to understand complex global problems.\n\nAdditionally, the period saw a growing interest in non-violent conflict resolution, which led to the development of new theories and methodologies for studying peace. Researchers also became more involved in policy-making, using their findings to inform government policies and practices aimed at promoting peace and preventing conflicts.\n\nWhile peace research was not directly accountable to the major powers of the political system, it played an important role in shaping public opinion and influencing policymakers' decisions regarding international relations. It also contributed to the growth of European security studies, which gained political relevance during the period defined by the peace movement.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct."
