The results of the exam are sent to a government data information center for the purpose of keeping information about men who may be drafted into the military. A 25-year-old law school graduate has herpes. He has recently sent resumes to many governmental agencies. Fearful that the information about his herpes condition will become available, he seeks a declaratory judgment that would forbid the government from requiring him to take a physical examination. Which of the following is the best constitutional basis in support of the federal law?\n\nA. The commerce clause.\nB. The dormant commerce clause.\nC. To raise and support an army and navy.\nD. To provide for the general welfare.\n"

To raise and support an army and navy.\n\nThis provision of the Constitution allows Congress to regulate interstate commerce, which includes matters affecting trade, transportation, and communications. In this case, the requirement that all males between the ages of 18 and 30 undergo a physical examination as part of their service in the military falls under the category of trade and commerce. Therefore, it can be argued that Congress has the authority to enact such a law, even if it affects individuals beyond the borders of the United States."
