Marquesses of England, Earls of Great Britain, King's Brothers.\n\nMarquesses and earls are members of the peerage, which is a system of hereditary nobility that existed in many countries until it was abolished or reduced in size during the 19th century. The title \"King's brother\" refers to a person who is a descendant of a king, typically through his father or mother.\n\nTherefore, from highest to lowest status, the members of the upper class would be:\n\n1. King (or monarch)\n2. Prince (son of a king)\n3. Duke (descendant of a duke or other high-ranking noble family)\n4. Marquis (descendant of a marquis or other high-ranking noble family)\n5. Earl (descendant of an earl or other high-ranking noble family)\n\nNote: This answer assumes that the question is referring to a specific context where each title has a specific meaning and application. In reality, the peerage system varies widely across different countries and eras, and some titles may have different meanings depending on the country and time period."
