Studies have shown that people with split-brain injuries often have difficulty performing tasks that require visual-spatial reasoning or problem-solving skills, such as drawing a picture or solving a puzzle, because they tend to rely more heavily on their left brain hemisphere. However, when it comes to tasks that require the use of both hemispheres, such as language processing and spatial reasoning, individuals with split-brain injuries may show improved performance compared to those without the injury."
