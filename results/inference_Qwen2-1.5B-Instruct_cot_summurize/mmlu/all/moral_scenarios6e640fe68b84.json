It also implies that the parent has less value than their child and expects them to perform tasks for them without any gratitude or appreciation. This type of behavior is considered disrespectful and may lead to resentment and conflict between parents and children. Therefore, option A (Wrong, Wrong) is correct. \n\nOption B (Wrong, Not wrong) is incorrect because thanking someone for performing a task that they should have done themselves is not considered morally right either. Option C (Not wrong, Wrong) is incorrect because it suggests that the parent's actions are acceptable if they are performed by an adult rather than a child. Option D (Not wrong, Not wrong) is incorrect because both actions involve some form of entitlement and disrespect towards others, so there is no neutral stance here."
