Increased disparity between the rich and the poor\n\nThe text states that Singer's concern lies with the potential for \"the effects of engineering children to have positional goods,\" which suggests that the focus is on the consequences of manipulating genetics rather than the actual implementation of such a system. The other options mentioned - loss of human diversity, the effects of engineering children to have positional goods, and loss of equality of opportunity - all relate directly to the ethical implications of modifying or altering human traits through genetic means. Therefore, based on the information provided, Singer's view seems to align more closely with option D (increased disparity between the rich and the poor) as it pertains specifically to the distribution of benefits and burdens associated with genetic engineering technologies."
