                    "text": "The correct answer is B. [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-]. \n\nThis is because sulfuric acid (H2SO3) dissociates into two hydrogen ions (H+) and one sulfuric ion (HSO3-) in water. The concentration of SO32- ions can be calculated using the stoichiometry of the reaction:\n\n\\[ \\text{SO}_3^{2-} + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4 + \\text{OH}^{-} \\]\n\nSince there is only one molecule of water per product ion, the overall ratio of products to reactants must be 1:1, meaning that the number of H+ ions produced is equal to the number of SO32- ions consumed. Therefore, the concentration of SO32- ions will be less than or equal to the concentration of H+ ions.\n\nIn addition, since H2SO3 is a weak acid, it will have a higher concentration than the strong acids like HCl or HNO3. This means that HSO3- ions will be more concentrated than H2SO3 itself.\n\nFinally, since H+ ions will outnumber H2SO3 molecules, the concentration of H2SO3 will be lower than the concentration of HSO3-."
