This reaction releases heat and creates a fizzing sound, making it a visible example of a chemical change. \n\nTearing up a piece of paper (option A), melting ice (option B), and filling a balloon with air (option D) do not involve any substances changing into different substances or undergoing a physical change; they are all simple physical changes that do not involve a chemical reaction."
