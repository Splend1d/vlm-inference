Respiration\n\nThe thoracic cage, also known as the ribcage or chest cavity, plays a crucial role in respiration by providing a structure to hold and protect the lungs, allowing air to enter and exit the body efficiently. This function is essential for maintaining proper oxygen intake and carbon dioxide elimination, both of which are critical for the survival and functioning of the body."
