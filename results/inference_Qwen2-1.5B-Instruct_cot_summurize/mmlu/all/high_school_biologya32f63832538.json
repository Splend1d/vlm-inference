                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The surface water temperature remains unchanged.\n\nWhen water evaporates from the surface of a pond, the remaining liquid water (the pond water) will cool down as it loses heat energy due to evaporation. This process is known as evaporation cooling.\n\nThe pH of the remaining water does not decrease during evaporation because the pH of pure water (which is 7) remains constant at all temperatures and under all conditions. Therefore, the pH of the remaining water remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect because it suggests that the surface water cools, which contradicts the fact that the pond water itself cools down due to evaporation. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that the surface water warms up, but this is not true either since the water is losing heat energy through evaporation. Option D is incorrect because it suggests that the pH of the remaining water decreases, but this is not necessarily true either, as mentioned above."
