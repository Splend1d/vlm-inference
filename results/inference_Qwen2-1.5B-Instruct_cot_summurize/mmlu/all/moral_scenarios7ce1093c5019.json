However, it's important to note that the context of the situation could be seen differently by different people or cultures. \n\nScenario 2 involves an unexpected and potentially hurtful question from the mother, which can be viewed as inappropriate and insensitive. While it's not necessarily morally wrong, it may still be seen as disrespectful or unkind. Therefore, based on the information provided, both scenarios involve actions that could be considered morally wrong depending on the specific circumstances and cultural norms."
