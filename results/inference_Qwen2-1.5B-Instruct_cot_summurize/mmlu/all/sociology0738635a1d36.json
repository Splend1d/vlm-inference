It encompasses the way people perceive and interpret politics, how they participate in it, and what kind of policies they support or oppose. Political culture can vary significantly across different societies, reflecting the unique histories, traditions, and values of each group.\n\nIn contrast, cultural products like novels or paintings do not directly reflect political ideologies; rather, they often represent the artistic expression of ideas and themes related to politics, but this does not necessarily imply that the creators' political ideologies are reflected in these works. Similarly, while political beliefs and attitudes shared by people in public office can be influential, they do not constitute a full political culture because they only reflect the actions and opinions of individuals, not the collective attitudes and behaviors of the broader population.\n\nFinally, ideological biases of the mass media may influence public opinion, but they are not equivalent to political culture since they are shaped by commercial interests, market forces, and other factors unrelated to shared political beliefs and orientations.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer."
