The light for the carpenter was green, so the carpenter proceeded to drive through the intersection. A bus entered the intersection from the west and slammed into the carpenter's car. The carpenter was seriously injured in the crash and missed several weeks of work while recovering from the injuries. Which of the following facts or inferences, if true, would be most helpful in an action by the carpenter against the driver of the bus?\n\nA. The bus driver had received three speeding tickets in the past.\nB. The carpenter's car was in good condition, and it had passed a safety inspection just a week before the accident.\nC. The traffic signal at the intersection had been inspected the day before the accident and found to be functioning properly.\nD. The bus driver was operating the bus without a driver's license in violation of the State Motor Vehicle Code.\n"

This could potentially be useful in proving that the carpenter did not cause the accident himself. However, this does not directly relate to the question of negligence or liability for the bus driver.\n\nOption C states that the traffic signal at the intersection had been inspected the day before the accident and found to be functioning properly. While this information may provide some context about the safety conditions of the intersection, it does not specifically address the issue of negligence or liability for the bus driver.\n\nOption D states that the bus driver was operating the bus without a valid driver's license in violation of state law. This information suggests that the bus driver did not have the necessary qualifications to operate the bus, which could be considered evidence of negligence. However, this information alone does not necessarily prove that the bus driver caused the accident.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: the fact that the bus driver had received three speeding tickets in the past. This information could suggest that the bus driver was not paying attention to their speed or was otherwise distracted, which could contribute to the accident."
