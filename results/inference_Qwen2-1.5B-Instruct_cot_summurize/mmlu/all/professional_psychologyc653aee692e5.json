This includes practices such as language, customs, food, clothing, music, dance, art, and religion. Ethnic identity can also refer to the recognition and acceptance of one's own cultural heritage, even if it may differ from mainstream society.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that ethnic identity is solely based on cultural practices and beliefs that are non-Western in orientation and perspective. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that ethnic identity is solely based on the collective cultural practices, traditions, and orientations of ethnic minority communities. \n\nOption C is partially correct but does not fully capture the essence of what ethnic identity means. While it is true that some individuals may reject Caucasian social, cultural, and institutional standards, this does not necessarily reflect their entire ethnic identity. Therefore, option C is not entirely accurate.\n\nOverall, the correct answer is D. the extent to which an individual endorses and practices the ethnocultural traditions of a given group."
