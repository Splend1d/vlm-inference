A decline in the birth rate, greater life expectancy, and an ageing population\n\nThe demographic transition is a social trend characterized by changes in the birth and death rates over time. It refers to a pattern where there is initially a high fertility rate (many children born per woman) followed by a period of declining fertility rates as societies progress technologically and economically, with lower birth rates being replaced by higher death rates as people live longer and healthier lives. This leads to a gradual decrease in the proportion of young people relative to older people."
