Increase the concentration of solutes in the cytosol.\nB. Change the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails.\nC. Replace phospholipids with glucose molecules.\nD. Exchange phospholipids from one side of the plasma membrane to the other.\n"

Exchange phospholipids from one side of the plasma membrane to the other.\n\nThis is because the plasma membrane is a selectively permeable structure that regulates the exchange of substances between the cell and its environment. By exchanging phospholipids, it allows for the movement of certain molecules into or out of the cell, maintaining homeostasis even in changing environmental conditions. This strategy helps ensure that the cell's internal environment remains stable, despite fluctuations in external temperatures."
