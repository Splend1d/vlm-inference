All of the above.\n\nConsequentialist theories of punishment argue that the moral worth of a punishment depends on its ability to produce the best outcome for society as a whole. Therefore, a lawbreaker should be punished only if it produces as much overall intrinsic value as would any other alternative punishment. Additionally, such punishments must also be consistent with treating the person as an end in himself-or herself and being proportionate to the wrongness of the crime."
