This is known as the law of demand elasticity. \n\nOn the other hand, if the demand for a good is inelastic and the supply is elastic, then the tax burden would fall mostly on producers because they have less bargaining power and may be forced to accept lower prices to sell their goods. This is known as the law of supply elasticity."
