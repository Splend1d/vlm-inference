Sublimation occurs when a solid changes directly into a gas without first going through the liquid state. In this case, the reaction between the reactants and products becomes spontaneous due to the decrease in temperature, causing the substances to sublimate before they can form an equilibrium mixture.\n\nThis change results in:\n\n- A decrease in entropy (\u0394S) because the molecules move more freely.\n- An increase in enthalpy (\u0394H) as heat is released during the sublimation process.\n- No change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) since the change in entropy is greater than the change in volume (which is zero for a fixed amount of gas).\n\nTherefore, the combination that applies to this reaction is \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0, and \u0394G > 0."
