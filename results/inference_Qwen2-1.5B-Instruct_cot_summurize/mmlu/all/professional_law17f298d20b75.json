The defendant was taken directly from the scene of the crime in a patrol car to the police station where he was placed, still handcuffed, in an interview room. He waited for about an hour, and a detective finally came in. The detective gave the defendant his Miranda warnings, and the defendant agreed to sign the waiver and speak to the detective. The defendant then confessed to the robbery. Which of the following allegations would be LEAST helpful in suppressing his statement?\n\nA. Before the defendant gave the statement he was refused permission to use the bathroom.\nB. The defendant had a private lawyer on retainer at the time he gave his statement.\nC. The defendant's arrest was not based on probable cause.\nD. The defendant could not speak English, and the warnings were given in English.\n"

This allegation may be relevant if the defendant understood enough English to understand the rights being explained to him but did not fully comprehend them due to language barriers. However, it is less likely to be effective as an argument against suppression compared to other options that specifically address issues related to the defendant's ability to communicate or understand their rights. For example, option A addresses an issue with the timing of the interrogation, while option B addresses the defendant's right to have a lawyer present during questioning. Option C addresses a constitutional violation by the police not having probable cause before arresting the defendant."
