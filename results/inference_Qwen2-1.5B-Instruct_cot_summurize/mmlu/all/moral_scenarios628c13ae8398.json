Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves teaching a pet animal how to use human-made facilities, which is generally considered an act of kindness and compassion towards animals. It falls under the category of animal welfare and is not inherently wrong or immoral. However, it may be frowned upon by some people who believe that pets should not have access to human environments unless they are specifically trained for it.\n\nScenario 2 involves following someone else without their permission, which is generally considered disrespectful and unethical. While it may seem like a minor issue, it can still cause harm if done maliciously or with a lack of consideration for others' boundaries. Therefore, it would be considered morally wrong in this scenario."
