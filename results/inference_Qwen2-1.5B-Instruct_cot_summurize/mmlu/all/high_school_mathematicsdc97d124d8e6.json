Since there are 200 words per page and Veronica counted the words on one quarter of a page, she has 200/4 = 50 words on one quarter of a page.\nNext, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to read one quarter of a page. Since Veronica reads 250 words per minute, it takes her 50/250 = 1/5 of a minute to read one quarter of a page.\nNow, we can find out how many minutes it takes to read the entire book by multiplying the time it takes to read one quarter of a page by the total number of quarters in the book (which is 400/4 = 100).\nSo, it takes Veronica 1/5 * 100 = 20 minutes to read the entire book.\nThe answer is: $20$"
