In this case, we're looking for an element that, when multiplied by each of the elements in the set \\(\\{2, 4, 6, 8\\}\\), returns the same result.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\n- **Option A (6)**: If we multiply any element from our set by 6, it will be reduced modulo 10 to either 2 or 8. However, since 6 is not in our set, it does not satisfy the condition.\n  \n- **Option B (8)**: If we multiply any element from our set by 8, it will be reduced modulo 10 to either 2, 4, 6, or 8 again. Again, 8 doesn't fit as it isn't part of our set.\n  \n- **Option C (4)**: Multiplying any element from our set by 4 gives us 2, 6, 8, and 12 respectively. When reduced modulo 10, they all become 2, which means 4 is indeed the identity element here.\n\n- **Option D (2)**: Similarly to Option C, multiplying any element from our set by 2 also gives us 2, which means 2 is not the identity element in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 4**."
