While both methods can be used to make inferences about the population parameters, they may provide different results due to their assumptions and limitations. For example, the test of significance assumes that the sample data follows a normal distribution, which may not always be true, while the confidence interval approach uses statistical sampling techniques to estimate the population parameter with a certain level of precision."
