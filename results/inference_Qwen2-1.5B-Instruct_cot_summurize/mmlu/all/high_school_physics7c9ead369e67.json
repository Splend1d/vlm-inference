                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Real, upright, height = 1 cm.\n\nWhen light enters through a lens, it bends towards the normal when going in and away from it when coming out. The focal length (f) of a convex lens is given by f = -R/2 where R is the radius of curvature. For a bi-convex lens with a radius of curvature of 20 cm, the focal length would be:\n\nf = -20/2 = -10 cm\n\nSince the focal length is negative, the lens is concave, not convex. However, for our purposes, we can consider it as if it were convex to determine the image formation scenario based on its properties.\n\nFor an object at any distance from the lens, the magnification (m) of the image is given by m = 1/f. In this case, the object's height is 2 cm and the distance from the lens is 30 cm, so the image will be real and upright since the object is closer than the focal point. Thus, the magnification will be positive.\n\nGiven that the focal length is -10 cm, the object's height is 2 cm, and the distance from the lens is 30 cm, the image will have a height of:\n\nheight = 2 * m = 2 * (-10 / 30) = 0.2 cm\n\nTherefore, the image formed is virtual, upright, with a height of 0.2 cm. \n\nSo the correct answer is B. Virtual, upright, height = 0.25 cm. However, given the context of the problem and the properties of a bi-convex lens, the correct answer should be C. Real, upright, height = 1 cm. Therefore, the answer provided is incorrect but consistent with the context of the problem."
