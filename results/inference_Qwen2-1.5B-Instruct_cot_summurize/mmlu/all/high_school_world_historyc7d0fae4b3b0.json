They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nWhich of the following developments from the period 1750\u20131900 C.E. most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The Industrial Revolution\n\nIn the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution brought significant changes to European economies and societies, leading to increased demand for raw materials like cotton, wool, and tin. These resources became increasingly valuable as Europe's industrial revolution developed, pushing European nations to seek new markets to sell these products.\n\nThe passage from the 1750s-1900s discusses the Portuguese trade with Japan during the early modern period, where they would import goods such as silk, musk, gold, and porcelain. This trade was disrupted by the Industrial Revolution, as Europe began to shift its focus towards producing these commodities itself through advancements in technology and production methods. As a result, the demand for these items declined, and their prices fell relative to those produced within Europe. This shift led to the end of the trade pattern described in the passage.\n\nTherefore, option B (Enlightenment revolutions in Europe and the Americas) and option D (colonization of Africa) do not directly undo the trade patterns mentioned in the passage. Option A (the discovery of certain goods that the Chinese were interested in purchasing from European merchants) could indirectly affect the trade patterns by influencing Chinese preferences or demands, although it does not specifically address the period between 1750-1900.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. The Industrial Revolution"
