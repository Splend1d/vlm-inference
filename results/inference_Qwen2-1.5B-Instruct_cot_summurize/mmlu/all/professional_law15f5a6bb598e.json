There were two farms situated on the property, one farm on the eastern half and one farm on the western half of the property. The farmer recorded a general warranty deed conveying the property to his son. Two years later, the son obtained a mortgage, secured by the farm property, in favor of his friend. The friend promptly recorded the mortgage. Twenty years later, the son sold the property to an investor by a general warranty deed, with the investor assuming the friend's mortgage. The following year, the investor subdivided the property and sold the western farm to a developer, while retaining the eastern farm. There was no mention of the mortgage in the general warranty deed between the investor and developer. The developer was unable to rezone the property to build houses as he had planned, so the developer sold the western farm to a florist. The conveyance to the florist made no mention of the friend's mortgage. Three years later, the florist entered into a contract with a rancher, pursuant to which the rancher would purchase the western farm for $75,000. The closing date for the deal was set for January 15. Assuming that on January 10, the rancher conducted a title search that revealed the friend's mortgage on the property, which of the following is correct?\n\nA. The rancher would be entitled to rescind the real estate contract with the florist immediately.\nB. The encumbrance renders title to the western farm unmarketable.\nC. The mortgage would only encumber the eastern farm, not the western farm, because the investor's partition of the property created a joint tenancy.\nD. The encumbrance would not entitle the rancher to rescind the real estate contract until closing on January 15.\n"

The encumbrance may have implications for the sale of the western farm, but it does not necessarily affect the ability of the rancher to sell the property at all. Therefore, option A is incorrect. \n\nOption B is also incorrect. The encumbrance of the friend's mortgage on the western farm does not automatically make the property unmarketable. It may impact the ability to sell the property, but it does not necessarily prevent any party from selling the property altogether.\n\nOption C is also incorrect. The encumbrance of the friend's mortgage on the western farm does not automatically render the property unmarketable. It may impact the ability to sell the property, but it does not necessarily prevent any party from selling the property altogether.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The encumbrance would not entitle the rancher to rescind the real estate contract until closing on January 15."
