The Civil Rights Act of 1964 hastened school desegregation by cutting off federal funds to discriminatory school systems.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a landmark piece of legislation that aimed to end racial discrimination and segregation in all areas of American life, including education. It prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment, housing, and public accommodations, among other things. However, the act did not include specific provisions for school desegregation. Instead, it left the issue of school integration up to individual states and local communities.\n\nAs a result, many Southern states were slow to implement the new civil rights laws, and desegregation efforts in schools remained a contentious issue throughout the 1960s. However, with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which required federal approval for changes in voting laws and practices, Congress began to take more action to enforce its civil rights legislation.\n\nIn summary, while the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a significant step forward in ending segregation, it did not provide specific enforcement mechanisms for desegregation in schools. As such, the act helped to accelerate the process of school desegregation in some areas but did not ensure complete compliance across the country."
