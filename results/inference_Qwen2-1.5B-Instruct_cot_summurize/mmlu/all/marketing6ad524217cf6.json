Competitor orientation.\n\nMarket orientation refers to the view that a company's success depends on understanding and responding to customer needs and wants, rather than focusing solely on profits or competitors. It involves a shift in focus from product and price competition to customer satisfaction and loyalty. \n\nCompetitive orientation, on the other hand, focuses on maintaining a competitive edge by constantly improving products and services, often at the expense of customer satisfaction. It is characterized by a strong emphasis on profit margins and cost-cutting measures.\n\nTherefore, competitor orientation is not a component of market orientation."
