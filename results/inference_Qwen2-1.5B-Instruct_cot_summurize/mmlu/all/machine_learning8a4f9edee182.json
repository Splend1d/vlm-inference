It is commonly used for analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns, and making predictions. In the context of predicting the amount of rainfall based on various cues, clustering can help identify different weather conditions that lead to precipitation. Similarly, detecting fraudulent credit card transactions involves grouping transactions with similar characteristics and behaviors, which can help identify anomalies and potential fraud. Finally, training a robot to solve a maze involves clustering techniques to group related movements and actions, which can improve the robot's navigation abilities. Therefore, all of the given options (A, B, and D) can be effectively solved using clustering."
