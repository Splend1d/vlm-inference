Four legs and a seat are common features for chairs used in homes, schools, and workplaces. The inclusion of a desk or table may also be desirable depending on the purpose of the chair. However, the mention of \"anxiety associated with school\" does not necessarily imply that the chair has any particular design elements related to school or education."
