The existence of isotopes\n\nMass spectrometry can be used to identify and quantify different isotopes in a sample, allowing for the determination of their relative abundances and thus supporting the identification of isotopes. This information is not typically provided by other analytical techniques such as atomic size or ionization energy trends, nor does it support the common oxidation states of elements or the periodic table's atomic size trends."
