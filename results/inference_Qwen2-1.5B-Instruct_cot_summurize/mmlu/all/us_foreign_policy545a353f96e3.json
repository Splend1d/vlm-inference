This policy was characterized by a focus on promoting democracy, human rights, and freedom around the world, as well as strengthening alliances with democratic nations. The emphasis on anticommunism was central to this approach, as it was seen as necessary to protect American interests and prevent the rise of communist regimes in countries like China and Vietnam."
