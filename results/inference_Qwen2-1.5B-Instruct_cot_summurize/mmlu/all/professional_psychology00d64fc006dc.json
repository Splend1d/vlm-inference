If someone's self-esteem is low, they may feel more secure if they receive consistent positive feedback from their partner. Therefore, the answer would be A: not comment on his abilities, weight, and mood. This way, he feels validated and less likely to feel insecure or threatened by his partner's observations. However, it's important to note that this theory does not necessarily predict how a person will react to criticism or negative feedback. Other factors such as relationship dynamics, communication style, and individual differences can also play a role in how a person responds to these types of situations."
