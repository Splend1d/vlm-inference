Bradycardia, also known as slow heart rate, can be a symptom of many other conditions such as anxiety or stress. Anaphylaxis typically involves symptoms such as swelling in the mouth and throat (stridor), difficulty breathing (severe wheezing), and rash. It's important to seek medical attention immediately if you suspect an allergic reaction."
