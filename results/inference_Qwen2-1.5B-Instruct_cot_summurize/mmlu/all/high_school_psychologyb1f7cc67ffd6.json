Down syndrome\n\nDown syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, resulting in an increased number of chromosomes (47) and specific physical characteristics such as short stature, heart defects, and learning disabilities. It can also lead to certain mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety. However, it is not associated with bipolar disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Huntington's chorea is a genetic disorder that affects movement and cognitive function, often leading to dementia and death. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental health condition characterized by recurrent, unwanted thoughts or behaviors, which may cause distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."
