He allowed her husband to drive the car home but arrested her for driving under suspension. After securing her inside the squad car, he conducted a search of her vehicle. The officer found a bag of cocaine inside a zippered jacket on the back seat. He arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because she was secured in the squad car and the police could not expect to find evidence relating to the current arrest in the car.\nB. No, the motion will be denied because there is no expectation of privacy toward property inside one's car.\nC. No, the motion will be denied because this was a valid search incident to an arrest.\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n"

Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n\nWhen law enforcement officers stop a vehicle and suspect that the occupants have committed or are committing a crime, they can conduct a \"search incident to a lawful arrest.\" This means that they can search the vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that there is evidence of a crime within the vehicle. However, if the arrest is unlawful (e.g., if the driver was not properly advised of their Miranda rights), then the search of the vehicle is invalid and any evidence found during the search may be excluded from evidence at trial.\n\nIn this case, the officer conducted a search of the driver's vehicle after arresting her for driving under suspension. The officer did not have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained evidence of the current arrest. Therefore, the search of the vehicle was invalid, and the cocaine found in the zippered jacket on the back seat cannot be used as evidence against the driver. The trial court will likely grant the suppression motion based on the lack of probable cause for the search of the vehicle."
