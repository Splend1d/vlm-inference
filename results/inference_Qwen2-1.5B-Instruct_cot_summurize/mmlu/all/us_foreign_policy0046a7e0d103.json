This was part of the broader effort by the United States to liberalize trade and investment in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile there were some concerns about privatization and the potential for corruption, the overall goal was to create a more competitive economy that would attract foreign investment and reduce dependence on the state-controlled sector. This approach was seen as necessary to foster economic growth and improve living standards for the Russian people.\n\nIt is important to note that the Clinton administration also pursued other policies aimed at promoting democracy and human rights in Russia, such as the support for opposition movements and efforts to strengthen civil society organizations."
