                    "text": "The correct answer is B. by contracting, changing gravitational potential energy into thermal energy.\n\nJupiter's internal heat is generated through the process of convection. As Jupiter rotates, it heats up from the inside out, and this heating causes the gas in the outer layers to expand and rise. The rising gas cools as it falls back down to the planet's surface, and this cooling process releases latent heat, which is then converted into thermal energy by the planet's core.\n\nThis process also explains why Jupiter has such strong gravity: the mass of the planet is being pulled together by the force of its own rotation. This is similar to how Earth's gravity is caused by the rotation of the planet.\n\nSo, option B is the correct answer."
