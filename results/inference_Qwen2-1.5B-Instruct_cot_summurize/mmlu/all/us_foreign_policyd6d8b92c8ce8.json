Reagan encouraged engagement with the Soviet Union.\n\nReagan's policies of d\u00e9tente and arms control were aimed at reducing the likelihood of nuclear war and encouraging the two superpowers to negotiate. This policy was not just about winning the Cold War, but also about preventing it from happening in the first place. By engaging with the Soviet Union, Reagan hoped to reduce tensions and build trust between the two sides, which could lead to a peaceful resolution of the conflict."
