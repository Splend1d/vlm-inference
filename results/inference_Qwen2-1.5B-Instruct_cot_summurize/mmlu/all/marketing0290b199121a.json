Social pressure to develop more fuel-efficient vehicles with fewer dangerous emissions. \n\nToyota and Honda were among the first automakers to recognize the environmental impact of their gasoline-powered vehicles and began investing heavily in research and development for hybrid technology. This was driven by social pressure to reduce carbon emissions and promote cleaner air. The Prius and Civic Hybrid became popular not only due to their efficiency but also because they were seen as socially responsible choices. They appealed to consumers who wanted to do their part in fighting climate change while still enjoying the luxury and convenience of owning a car."
