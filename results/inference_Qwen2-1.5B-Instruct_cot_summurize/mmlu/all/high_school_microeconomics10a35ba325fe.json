This is because both Bob and Nancy are using the coupon to get a discount on their purchases, but only one of them is using it. Price discrimination refers to when companies charge different prices to different customers based on their willingness to pay or other factors such as demand and supply. In this case, there is no indication that either Bob or Nancy is charging a higher price than another customer for the same product."
