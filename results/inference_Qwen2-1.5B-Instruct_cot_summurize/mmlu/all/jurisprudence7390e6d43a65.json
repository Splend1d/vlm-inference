The \"semantic sting\" refers to the difficulty in determining whether a particular interpretation of the law is valid or not, as the rule of recognition cannot fully account for legal validity. This means that judges must rely on their own understanding of the law and their interpretation of it, which can be influenced by their personal beliefs, biases, and cultural backgrounds. Therefore, they may make incorrect or unjustified decisions based on their interpretation of the law."
