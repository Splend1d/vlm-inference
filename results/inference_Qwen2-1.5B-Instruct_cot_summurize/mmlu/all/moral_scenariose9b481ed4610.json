In this scenario, the surgeon general has stated that smoking causes cancer, and the main character is hiding her husband's cigarettes from the public health authorities. This action goes against the common understanding of harm prevention and is therefore considered morally wrong.\nIn contrast, the main character who uses \"I\" or \"me\" in Scenario 2 is not doing anything clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In this scenario, the antiques dealer has given the main character too much money for the trade, and the main character returned it. This action is not harmful to anyone and is therefore not considered morally wrong.\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
