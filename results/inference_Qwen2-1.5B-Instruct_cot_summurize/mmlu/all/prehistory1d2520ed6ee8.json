Among the options given:\n\n- A. Jericho in Israel: This ancient city was built around 10,500 years ago, making it one of the oldest known cities in the world.\n  \n- B. Caral in Peru: Although not as well-known as some other early urban centers, such as Chav\u00edn de Huantar or Chichen Itza, Caral is considered to be one of the first major urban centers in Mesoamerica.\n\n- C. Stonehenge in England: This prehistoric monument dates back to about 2500 BCE, but its exact age is uncertain due to the lack of radiocarbon dating techniques at that time.\n\n- D. Olmec along the Gulf Coast: The Olmecs were an advanced civilization that flourished from approximately 1300 BCE to 430 CE. They are known for their monumental architecture, including pyramids, ball courts, and colossal stone heads called Moai.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the earliest example of a complex society would be Jericho in Israel, followed by Caral in Peru, then Stonehenge in England, and finally the Olmecs in Mexico."
