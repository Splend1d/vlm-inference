The juvenile court judge found the youth guilty and sentenced him to five years in a detention center. The juvenile's lawyer objected that the evidence did not prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but the judge held that such proof was not required in a juvenile proceeding. Will the state's appellate court affirm the ruling of the juvenile court judge?\n\nA. Yes, a juvenile does not get all of the rights enjoyed by adults and proof does not have to be beyond a reasonable doubt.\nB. No, a juvenile cannot be convicted of a crime in a juvenile proceeding except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nC. Yes, the reasonable doubt standard does not in any event rise to a constitutional right under our system in which each state can declare its own constitutional mandates.\nD. No, a juvenile court proceeding is always followed by a de novo proceeding in adult court in which the reasonable doubt standard is guaranteed.\n"

In a juvenile proceeding, the burden of proof is on the prosecution to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but this does not mean that a conviction must be based solely on circumstantial evidence. The judge may consider other factors such as the youth's age, maturity, and previous behavior when making a decision about the appropriate sentence. It is up to the judge to determine whether the evidence presented meets the legal standard of proof required for a conviction."
