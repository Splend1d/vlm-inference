None of the above.\n\nLincoln opposed the Southward Expansion of the United States because he believed it would lead to conflict and division between the North and South, which would ultimately harm the country as a whole. He was concerned that if the South continued to push for greater rights and representation in Congress, it could eventually lead to secession or even rebellion against the Union. Additionally, Lincoln was committed to the principle of states' rights and believed that the federal government should not be overstepping its boundaries and interfering with the affairs of individual states. Therefore, he opposed any efforts to expand the territory into the South, as he believed it would only exacerbate tensions between the North and South and threaten the stability of the Union."
