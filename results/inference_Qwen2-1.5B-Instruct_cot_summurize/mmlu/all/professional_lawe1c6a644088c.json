A woman made the highest bid, which was $100, and the auctioneer slammed the gavel down, completing the transaction. Before the day's auction ended, an art historian told the auctioneer in private during a break that the piece was an original by Claude Monet, worth about $1 million. The auctioneer quickly told the successful bidder that the amount was rejected by the seller and that the piece would be withdrawn from the sale that day. The woman sued the auctioneer, claiming that there was a binding contract and requesting specific performance. Based strictly on the rules of offer and acceptance, is the auctioneer in danger of losing the painting to the successful bidder and, if so, why?\n\nA. No, the auctioneer can always reject an offer made by a bidder at a public auction sale.\nB. No, the auctioneer is the offeree at a no-reserve auction and, as such, the offeree has the absolute power to reject the offer if it is not accepted by the owner.\nC. Yes, in a no-reserve auction there is a binding contract based on the highest amount offered by the winning bidder.\nD. Yes, in a no-reserve auction there is a binding contract as soon as the bidding starts, with each bid being a new binding contract.\n"

No, the auctioneer is the offeree at a no-reserve auction and, as such, the offeree has the absolute power to reject the offer if it is not accepted by the owner.\n\nIn a no-reserve auction, the auctioneer accepts all bids and the highest bidder wins the item without specifying a price. This means that once the auctioneer accepts a bid, it becomes a binding contract between the buyer and the seller. Therefore, the auctioneer cannot reject the highest bid simply because they did not like the artwork or because they want more money for it.\n\nIn this case, the auctioneer was caught off guard by the high bid and immediately rejected it, but this does not change the fact that there was a binding contract between the two parties. The auctioneer is therefore in danger of losing the painting to the successful bidder, even though they initially rejected the highest bid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
