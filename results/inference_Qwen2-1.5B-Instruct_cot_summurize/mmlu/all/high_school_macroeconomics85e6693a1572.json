The amount of money that banks must hold as reserves is equal to their deposits minus their lending. When banks sell securities to the Fed, they are essentially paying down their loans and increasing their reserves. This process of selling securities and reducing reserves increases the money supply and decreases the interest rate, which encourages more spending and investment. Therefore, the money supply will increase by $2.9 million."
