One in which each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations.\n\nA three-way, set-associative cache is a type of cache that allows multiple words from main memory to be stored at different cache locations. This allows for better utilization of cache space and reduces the amount of data that must be transferred between the CPU and memory. The other options listed are not necessarily true:\n\n- B. Effective only if 3 or fewer processes are running alternately on the processor: This statement is incorrect as it assumes that the cache is limited by the number of processes running, but the cache size is independent of the number of processes.\n- C. Possible only with write-back: While a write-back cache can provide good performance for frequently written-to cache lines, it may not always be necessary or practical for all types of applications.\n- D. Faster to access than a direct-mapped cache: This statement is also incorrect as the speed of accessing data from a cache depends on various factors such as the cache size, cache line size, and the type of cache (direct-mapped vs. set associative)."
