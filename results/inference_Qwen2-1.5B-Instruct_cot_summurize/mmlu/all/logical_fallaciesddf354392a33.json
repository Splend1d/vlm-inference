This fallacy occurs when one argues that something must be true for all members of a group, without considering the possibility that some individuals may have been excluded from the analysis. In this case, Professor Jones is making the argument that because he believes all of his students performed well, it follows that no individual student failed. However, this conclusion ignores the possibility that some students may have been omitted from the analysis or given a different treatment than others. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Fallacy of Composition."
