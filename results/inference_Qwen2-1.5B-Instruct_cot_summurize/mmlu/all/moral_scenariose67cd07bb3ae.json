Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nScenario 1 involves training a pet animal to beg for food, which goes against ethical treatment of animals and can cause them emotional distress or even harm if they become habituated to begging. This action would be considered morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2 involves hiring someone to proofread a paper for college, which is not inherently wrong but may involve unethical practices such as plagiarism or charging excessively high fees. However, this scenario does not directly violate any clear moral principles, making it not necessarily morally wrong either."
