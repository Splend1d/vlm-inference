Ovary, ovary, uterus, vagina\n\nThe ovaries are located in each ovary and produce eggs that are released into the fallopian tubes during ovulation. The fallopian tubes carry the egg to the uterus, where it implants itself on the lining of the uterus and begins the process of pregnancy. Once fertilization occurs, the fertilized egg moves down the uterine tube to implant in the lining of the uterus. This marks the beginning of fetal development. The fetus grows and develops inside the uterus until birth."
