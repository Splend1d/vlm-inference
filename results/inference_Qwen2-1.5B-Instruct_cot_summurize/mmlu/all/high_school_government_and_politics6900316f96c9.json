In the House of Representatives, debates on legislation are typically limited to 10 minutes each, and there is no filibuster. This means that members cannot simply speak indefinitely without any limit or consequence. On the other hand, in the Senate, debates can last up to 24 hours, and there is no time limit on speaking. Therefore, it is more likely for a filibuster to occur in the Senate rather than the House of Representatives."
