Under the LIFO method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the earliest acquired goods.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily true:\n\n- A. In periods of rising prices, the LIFO method results in a lower cost of sales and higher taxable income, when compared to the FIFO method: This statement is incorrect. Under the LIFO method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the earliest acquired goods, which may result in a lower cost of sales and higher taxable income in some cases, but it does not necessarily guarantee that this will happen under all circumstances or over time.\n- B. The taxpayer is required to receive permission each year from the Internal Revenue Service to continue the use of the LIFO method: This statement is incorrect. While the IRS has guidelines and requirements related to the LIFO method, there is no requirement for taxpayers to obtain permission each year to continue using the LIFO method.\n- C. The LIFO method can be used for tax purposes even if the FIFO method is used for financial statement purposes: This statement is partially correct. It is possible for a company to use the LIFO method for both tax purposes and financial statement purposes, although this requires careful planning and management to ensure that the two methods do not result in different tax consequences."
