As the customer handed the deposit to the woman, she saw that he had a misprinted $5 bill in his possession. The woman knew that the $5 bill, which had President Lincoln's picture upside down, was worth $500 to bill collectors. The woman then asked the customer if he would like to exchange \"that old $5 bill for a new bill. \" The customer accepted the woman's offer and handed her the misprinted bill for a new one. One week later, the customer learned that the $5 bill that he gave the woman was valued at $500. If the customer asserts a claim against the woman for deceit, will he prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the customer was the true owner of the misprinted bill and, therefore, he was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.\nB. Yes, because the woman did not disclose the true value of the misprinted bill.\nC. No, because the woman made no false representation of fact.\nD. No, because the customer was not justified in relying on the woman's offer.\n"

No, because the customer was not justified in relying on the woman's offer.\n\nIt is not uncommon for people to be tricked into making deals or transactions with others, especially when they are unfamiliar with the situation. In this case, the customer was tricked by the woman into exchanging his misprinted $5 bill for a new one, but it does not mean that he was justified in doing so. He should have known that the bill was worth more than what he paid for it, and he could have refused the offer instead of accepting it. Therefore, he cannot assert a claim against the woman for deceit."
