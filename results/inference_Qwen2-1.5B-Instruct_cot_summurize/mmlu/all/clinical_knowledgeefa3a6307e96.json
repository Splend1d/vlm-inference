Understanding others' speech.\n\nThe frontal lobe, also known as Broca's area or Wernicke's area in different regions of the brain, plays a crucial role in language processing and comprehension. It is involved in tasks such as understanding spoken words, recognizing faces, and interpreting other forms of communication. However, it does not directly influence the sleep-wake cycle or visual perception, which are controlled by other areas of the brain. Drawing shapes may be influenced by the motor cortex located elsewhere in the brain, but it is not specifically associated with the frontal lobe."
