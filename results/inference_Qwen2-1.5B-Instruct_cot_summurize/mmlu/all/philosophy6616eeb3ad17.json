It is impossible to do that which is good and not to approve of it.\n\nButler's moral philosophy suggests that we should not approve of the actions of others or ourselves if they conflict with our own values and beliefs. He argues that true benevolence requires us to act in accordance with our own moral principles, even if those principles may not align with what others consider to be morally right.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible for someone to approve of the actions of others without also approving of their own actions. This is because approval of the actions of others would require us to conform to their moral standards, which goes against Butler's belief that we should only act in accordance with our own moral principles."
