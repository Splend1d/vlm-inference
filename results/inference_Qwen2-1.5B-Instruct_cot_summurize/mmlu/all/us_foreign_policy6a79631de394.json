These organizations merely identify those states who already support human rights, as this does not necessarily mean that they promote human rights in practice. While it is true that some governments may already prioritize human rights and may be more receptive to international pressure, this does not guarantee that all governments will do so consistently or effectively. Therefore, it is important for intergovernmental organizations to also identify and address the systemic issues within countries that prevent them from fully upholding human rights."
