Memory cells\n\nWhen an individual is exposed to a pathogen like the flu virus, their immune system produces memory cells that can recognize and respond to that particular pathogen later on when it reenters the body. These memory cells are particularly important because they allow the body to mount a faster and stronger response upon exposure to the same pathogen again. This rapid recovery from the flu is due to the fact that the body has already developed these specialized memory cells."
