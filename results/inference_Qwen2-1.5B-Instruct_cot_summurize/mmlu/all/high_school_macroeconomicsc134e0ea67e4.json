Increasing money spent to pay for government projects\n\nContractionary fiscal policy typically involves reducing spending or raising taxes in order to reduce inflation and stimulate economic growth. A decrease in money spent on social programs, an increase in income taxes, and canceling annual cost of living adjustments to government employees can all contribute to a contractionary fiscal policy by reducing aggregate demand and slowing down the economy. However, increasing money spent to pay for government projects is not an example of contractionary fiscal policy because it does not involve reducing spending or raising taxes. Instead, it is an example of expansionary fiscal policy, which increases aggregate demand and stimulates economic growth."
