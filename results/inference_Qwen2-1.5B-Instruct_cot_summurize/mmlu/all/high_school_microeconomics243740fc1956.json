When opportunity cost is constant across all production levels, this means that the marginal rate of technical substitution is also constant, which implies that the PPF is a straight diagonal line. The slope of the line indicates how much more one unit of output can be produced with each additional unit of input, and since the opportunity cost remains constant, the slope will always be negative, indicating a downward-sloping line. Therefore, option D is correct."
