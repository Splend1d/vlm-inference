However, it is generally believed that people who have healthier lifestyles tend to live longer. This includes factors such as regular exercise, healthy eating habits, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, and managing stress levels. Additionally, having access to healthcare resources can also play a role in longevity. Ultimately, it is impossible to predict an individual's lifespan with certainty based on these factors alone, but it is possible to make informed guesses based on available data."
