                    "text": " Let's denote the probability of rolling an odd number on a fair six-sided die as $p$, and the probability of rolling an even number as $q$. We know that $p + q = 1$ because there are only two outcomes for each throw.\n\nThe probability of rolling an odd number is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$, so $q = 1 - p = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow we need to find the probability of rolling a 5 on the first throw and a 6 on the second throw. This can happen in two ways:\n\n1. The first throw is a 5 and the second throw is a 6.\n2. The first throw is not a 5 and the second throw is a 6.\n\nFor option A, the probability of rolling a 5 on the first throw is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of rolling a 6 on the second throw is also $\\frac{1}{6}$. So the probability of both events happening is $\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{36}$.\n\nFor option B, the probability of not rolling a 5 on the first throw is $\\frac{5}{6}$, and the probability of rolling a 6 on the second throw is still $\\frac{1}{6}$. So the probability of both events happening is $\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{5}{36} = \\frac{5}{36}$.\n\nAdding these probabilities together gives us the total probability of getting a 5 on the first throw and a 6 on the second throw:\n$$\\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{5}{36} = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{3}.$$\nHowever, this does not match with the options given. Let's reevaluate our calculations.\n\nUpon closer inspection, we realize that we made a mistake in calculating the probability of the second event. The correct calculation should be:\n$$\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}.$$\nSo the probability of getting a 5 on the first throw and a 6 on the second throw is indeed $\\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{36}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A, with a probability of $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
