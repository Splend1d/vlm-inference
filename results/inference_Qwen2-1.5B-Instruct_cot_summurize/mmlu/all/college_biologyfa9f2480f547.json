                    "text": "The correct answer is C. An increase in venous pressure and an equal but opposite decrease in arterial pressure.\n\nDuring the cardiac cycle, blood is pumped from the left ventricle into the aorta, which is a much larger vessel than the veins. The blood then flows through the arteries, which are smaller vessels that have a higher resistance compared to the veins. As the blood flows through these vessels, it experiences a reduction in its velocity due to the increased resistance. This causes the blood to become more compressed and therefore has a lower pressure.\n\nAs the blood reaches the capillaries (small blood vessels) at the end of the arteries, it releases some of its oxygenated blood and picks up carbon dioxide as it passes through the walls of the capillaries. This process is called gas exchange and occurs between the red blood cells and the surrounding tissue. At this point, the blood's pressure drops even further because there is no longer any flow of blood from the heart to fill the veins.\n\nTherefore, during the cardiac cycle, the venous pressure decreases while the arterial pressure increases. This transfer of fluid between the two compartments results in an increase in venous pressure and an equal but opposite decrease in arterial pressure."
