Genes are exchanged with other populations.\n\nGenes are only able to exchange between populations if they have a common ancestor in both populations. This means that there must be some form of genetic drift or migration between the two populations that allows genes to move between them.\n\nIf genes are not exchanged between populations, then the Hardy-Weinberg law will not apply because it assumes that genes are randomly distributed within and between populations. Without this assumption, the observed frequencies of alleles in a population can differ from what would be expected under the law of random mating."
