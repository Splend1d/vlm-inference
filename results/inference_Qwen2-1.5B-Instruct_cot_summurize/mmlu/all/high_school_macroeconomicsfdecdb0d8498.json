This can lead to a decrease in domestic demand for goods and services, which can result in lower real GDP.\n\nOn the other hand, removing tariffs and quotas or increasing investment in human capital can have positive effects on the economy, but they may not necessarily cause a decrease in real GDP. Similarly, increasing the money supply can also have some positive effects, such as stimulating economic growth, but it may not necessarily cause a decrease in real GDP either.\n\nIn summary, the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies is the only factor that could potentially cause a decrease in real GDP under the given conditions."
