Specifically, we know that the number of 7-Sylow subgroups must divide 159 and be congruent to 1 mod 7. By counting the possibilities, we find that there are only two possibilities for the number of 7-Sylow subgroups: 3 or 158. If there are three 7-Sylow subgroups, then by the Sylow Theorems, there exists an element of order 159 (since the order of any 7-Sylow subgroup divides 159). However, if there is only one 7-Sylow subgroup, it cannot have order 159 since its index in the group would be greater than 1. Therefore, every group of order 159 is cyclic.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\nThis statement is false. There are groups of order 102 with no nontrivial proper normal subgroups. For example, consider the quaternion group Q_8. This group has order 8 = 2^3, so it has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup. Since the quotient group Q_8/Z(Q_8) = Z_4 does not have any nontrivial proper normal subgroups, the original group Q_8 also does not have any nontrivial proper normal subgroups."
