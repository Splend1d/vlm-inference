Based upon the following table what action should Skytop take regarding acquisition of the machine and why? Future value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $1.464 Present value of $1 for 4 years at 10% $0.683 Future value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $4.641 Present value of $1 ordinary annuity for 4 years at 10% $3.170 Acquire: Reason:\n\nA. Yes Net cash flow is $20000\nB. Yes Net future value is $36025\nC. No Net present value is ($750)\nD. No Net present value is ($8750)\n"

The correct answer is option D, \"No Net present value is ($8750).\""
