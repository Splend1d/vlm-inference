However, retributivism typically involves a focus on punishment as an end in itself and the idea that individuals should be punished for their crimes according to their moral or legal culpability. So, if Nathanson supported retributivism, it would likely involve some form of proportionality or retaliation. It is possible that Nathanson might support a more nuanced approach to retributivism, such as one that emphasizes rehabilitation and forgiveness, but without any specific details provided, it is impossible to say for certain."
