However, in each case, there were potential negative consequences that could have been avoided by making different choices. For example, pulling the plug from the ICU may have caused unnecessary distress for the patient and their family. Similarly, performing trust falls without proper training could have put others at risk. Therefore, while neither scenario directly breaks any moral rules, they can still be considered morally questionable due to the potential harm they could cause."
