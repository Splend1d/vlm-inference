Control risk, on the other hand, refers to the risk that errors or fraud will not be detected through the implementation of controls. \n\nDetection risk refers to the risk that errors or fraud will be detected during the course of the audit. It depends on both inherent risk and control risk, but it does not depend on the auditor's judgment about materiality."
