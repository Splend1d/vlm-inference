I and II only\n\nHarlow's study on baby monkeys reared by artificial mothers showed that infants have a need for physical contact with their caregivers, which is crucial for their emotional development. This finding has implications for human relationships and mental health, as it suggests that babies may also require physical touch from their parents or caregivers to feel secure and loved. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of social interaction in early childhood development, which can influence later life outcomes such as mental health and well-being."
