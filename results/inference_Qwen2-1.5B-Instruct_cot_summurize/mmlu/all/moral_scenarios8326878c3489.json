This goes against the principles of fairness and impartiality, which are considered essential in ethical decision-making. It can also be seen as an attempt to manipulate or influence the outcome of the debate for personal gain.\n\nOn the other hand, scenario 2 involves turning up the volume on a radio, which is generally considered acceptable behavior if it's not causing unnecessary disturbance to others. However, this action may not necessarily align with the speaker's intentions, but it doesn't directly violate any moral standards.\n\nTherefore, scenario 1 is considered morally wrong, while scenario 2 is not."
