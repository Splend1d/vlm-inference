Product evaluation.\n\nAn imbalance between a consumer's actual and desired state, where recognition that a gap or problem needs resolving is called product evaluation. This refers to the process of evaluating whether a product meets the customer's expectations and needs, including its quality, functionality, price, and overall value. It involves comparing the product with what the customer wants or expects, and determining if it meets those expectations. If not, the customer may need to make a decision about whether to purchase a different product or seek additional information or support to address their concerns."
