Therefore, if $r \\in R$, we can write $r = rs$ for some $s \\in U$. This shows that $rs \\in U$ as well. So $R$ contains all its multiples, implying that $R$ is commutative.\n\n2. A right ideal $U$ of a ring $R$ is closed under multiplication by every element of $R$. In particular, if $r \\in R$, then $sr \\in U$ for all $s \\in U$. However, since $R$ also contains all its multiples, this means that $R$ is a division ring, where each non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Thus, option II is also true.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that necessarily follows from the given information is that $R$ is commutative and a division ring. The fact that $R$ is finite or infinite does not follow directly from the given conditions."
