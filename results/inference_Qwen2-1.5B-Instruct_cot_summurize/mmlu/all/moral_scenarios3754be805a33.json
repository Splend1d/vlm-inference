This is generally considered a positive action and helps protect the person's devices from potential harm. Therefore, this scenario does not involve doing anything clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves leaving the fireplace unattended while a chimney cleaner works inside. Leaving the fireplace unattended can be dangerous if there is any risk of smoke or fire. Additionally, not having a proper fire extinguisher available might also be considered a concern. However, this scenario does not directly involve any illegal activity or causing harm to others, so it is not necessarily morally wrong either."
