H+ / Cl\u2212.\n\nH+ and Cl\u2212 are both protonated (or negatively charged) species, so they form an acid-base pair where one is a base and the other is an acid. In this case, H+ acts as the base and Cl\u2212 acts as the acid. The bond between them is hydrogen bonding, which is stronger than ionic or covalent bonds. Therefore, it's classified as a conjugate acid-base pair."
