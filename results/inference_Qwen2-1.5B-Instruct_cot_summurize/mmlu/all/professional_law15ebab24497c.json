At trial the prosecution offered evidence that the man was convicted of two prior sexual assault charges against two other women, both occurring about two years earlier. The allegations and the man's modus operandi in those convictions were almost identical to the instant case. Defense counsel objected to the evidence on the basis that its highly prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. Based on the Federal Rules of Evidence, what will the court most likely rule regarding this issue?\n\nA. The evidence is too prejudicial and must be excluded.\nB. The evidence is inadmissible because it is not relevant to the present charges and has a low probative value.\nC. The evidence is admissible because present public policy strongly favors the apprehension and prosecution of sexual predators.\nD. The evidence is admissible due to the factual similarity with the present charge, which gives the evidence strong probative value.\n"
