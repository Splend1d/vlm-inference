It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following would most directly result from the foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph?\n\nA. The establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers\nB. The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment\nC. The development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism\nD. The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies\n"

This is because foreign investment can bring in resources that can support economic growth and development, which can ultimately lead to improvements in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and overall governance.\n\nHowever, the text does not provide enough context to determine if option C (the development of globalization and the spread of culture through consumerism) would also occur as a direct result of foreign investment from capitalist countries. While this could potentially happen, there is no clear evidence provided in the text to support this conclusion.\n\nOption A (establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers) seems unlikely given the text's focus on non-alignment policies and the role of national planning. Option D (reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies) is more plausible since foreign investment can help stabilize governments and economies, reducing the likelihood of political upheaval.\n\nTherefore, the answer is most likely:\n\nB. The establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment."
