Because Aristotle believed that man is a 'social animal'\n\nCommunitarianism is based on Aristotle's idea of the \"polis\" (city-state) and his concept of the \"virtuous community\". In his work \"Nicomachean Ethics\", Aristotle argues that the purpose of society is to promote the well-being of its members, and that individuals should be guided by moral virtues such as justice, courage, wisdom, and temperance.\n\nKant's philosophy, on the other hand, emphasizes individual autonomy and rationality over communal cooperation. He argued that individuals have a duty to act according to their own reason and desires, rather than conforming to external rules or institutions. This leads some to believe that Kant's philosophy resembles individualism more than communalism.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Aristotle himself was not an advocate for slavery, nor did he view man as a \"social animal.\" Instead, he believed in the importance of individual freedom and responsibility within a virtuous community. Therefore, while Aristotle's ideas may seem similar to communitarianism, they do not necessarily justify or endorse any particular form of political or social organization."
