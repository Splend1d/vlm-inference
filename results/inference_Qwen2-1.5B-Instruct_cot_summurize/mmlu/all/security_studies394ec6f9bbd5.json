The increased levels of globalization in trade, finance, and movement have produced an environment conducive to TNC by making it easier for criminals to move illicit profits and illegal goods, provide service, and smuggle persons across borders.\nB. The wave of political transitions to democracy and economic transitions to free market capitalism since the 1980s - a phenomenon which frequently occurred simultaneously in the same country - have undermined state capacity to enforce rule of law and created new opportunities for organized crime groups to penetrate societies in transition.\nC. The sharp increase in civil conflicts around the globe also created a new generation of refugees. These diasporas have provided the family and ethnic ties that help facilitate a transnational criminal enterprise.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Increased levels of globalization have made it easier for criminals to move illicit profits and illegal goods across borders, providing them with new opportunities to operate without fear of detection or punishment.\n\n2. Political transitions to democracy and economic transitions to free market capitalism have often led to weak or ineffective government institutions, creating openings for organized crime groups to infiltrate societies in transition.\n\n3. The rise of civil conflicts around the world has resulted in the displacement of millions of people, many of whom become vulnerable to recruitment by criminal organizations seeking to exploit the instability.\n\n4. As a result of these factors, there has been a significant increase in transnational criminal activity, including trafficking in human beings, drugs, weapons, and other contraband.\n\nOverall, these developments have weakened the ability of states to maintain control over their territories and populations, leading to greater vulnerability to criminal activities that can undermine social stability and security."
