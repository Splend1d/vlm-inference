The high school is a public school, and the school has a policy that all student athletes are required to sign an authorization form by which they consent to undergo random drug testing. All the basketball players on the school team, except the teenager, signed the authorization. In the third game of the season, the team beat their archrival, and the teenager scored a record high 69 points. In the locker room following the game, the basketball coach approached the teenager and requested that he provide a urine sample for a random drug test. The teenager refused. He had smoked some marijuana the previous day and was afraid that a positive test result might jeopardize his being awarded a basketball scholarship to college. Thereafter, the teenager was suspended from the team for failing to comply with the coach's request. The coach later admitted that he did not have any individualized suspicion that the teenager was under the influence of drugs. The teenager has filed a motion challenging the suspension and seeking reinstatement on the basketball team. The court will most likely rule in favor of\n\nA. the school, because a urine sample does not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.\nB. the school, because drug testing is not an intrusion on his Fourth Amendment right of privacy.\nC. the student, because he didn't consent to the drug test.\nD. the student, because the coach admitted that he did not have any individualized suspicion that the student was under the influence of drugs.\n"

This means that the coach's suspicion must be reasonable based on the evidence available at the time of the test. Without more information about the circumstances surrounding the student's refusal to take the drug test, it is impossible to determine whether the coach's suspicion was reasonable or not. Therefore, the court may consider the student's claim that he was not given enough information about the potential consequences of refusing the drug test before deciding whether the suspension was justified."
