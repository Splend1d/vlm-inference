Therefore, it is likely that he would be described as an \"avoidant\" or \"anxious-ambivalent\" lover according to attachment theory.\n\nAn \"avoidant\" lover tends to withdraw from relationships when they become emotionally intense or distressing for them. They may also avoid intimacy and express feelings of insecurity or fear of abandonment.\n\nAn \"anxious-ambivalent\" lover, on the other hand, can be both anxious and ambivalent about their relationship. They may experience anxiety around potential loss in the relationship but also feel some level of attachment and desire for closeness.\n\nIn summary, based on the given information, it is most likely that Joe would be described as an \"avoidant\" or \"anxious-ambivalent\" lover according to attachment theory."
