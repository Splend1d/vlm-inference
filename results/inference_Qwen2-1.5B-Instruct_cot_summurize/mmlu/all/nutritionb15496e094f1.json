The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages.\n\nThis is because adult body weight, activity levels, and other factors make it difficult to determine specific amino acid requirements for different age groups. Therefore, the assumption is made that an average adult's dietary needs can meet the requirements of all age groups.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the amino acid requirements for adults may not necessarily match those required for children or older individuals.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because breast milk contains its own unique amino acid composition and does not follow the same amino acid requirements as human tissue proteins.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the amino acid pattern of human tissue protein may vary depending on the type of tissue (e.g., muscle vs. liver) and the individual's age, sex, and health status. However, this variation is likely to be small compared to the differences between different types of foods."
