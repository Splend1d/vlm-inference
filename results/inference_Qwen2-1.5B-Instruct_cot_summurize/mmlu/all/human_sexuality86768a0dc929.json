This system has been practiced by various Eastern religions such as Buddhism and Jainism, as well as Christian orders like the Benedictine Order. The monastics within these orders often choose celibacy, virginity, and poverty as part of their ascetic lifestyle.\n\nLegalism refers to a set of moral rules derived from religious texts or teachings, which may include restrictions on behavior or actions considered immoral. Situationism is a philosophical approach that suggests that ethical decisions should be made based on what is most appropriate given specific circumstances. Hedonism is an ethics system that advocates for pleasure as the highest good and seeks to maximize personal happiness and satisfaction through desires and pleasures.\n\nNone of these systems directly apply to the ethical principles of asceticism, which focuses on the spiritual purification and discipline achieved through rigorous self-denial and ascetic practices."
