If EP is positive, it indicates that as the price of one good increases, the quantity demanded of the other good decreases.\n\nGiven that the cross-price elasticity of demand between goods X and Y is +2.0, this suggests that an increase in the price of good X leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded of good Y, indicating that they are substitutes for each other.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. goods X and Y are substitute goods."
