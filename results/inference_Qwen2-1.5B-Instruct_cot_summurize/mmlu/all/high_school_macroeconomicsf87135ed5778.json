Therefore, the correct interpretation for the given information would be:\n\nA. The marginal propensity to consume is .80.\n\nThis means that for every $100 increase in disposable income, 80% of it will be spent on consumption, and only 20% will be saved.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. The marginal propensity to consume is .80."
