According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, telling a hurtful joke at a funeral would be considered morally wrong because it can cause emotional distress and pain to those who have lost someone close to them. Wringing a wet salamander is generally considered harmless and not morally wrong. However, depending on the context and the circumstances surrounding the action, there may be some ethical considerations or moral implications involved."
