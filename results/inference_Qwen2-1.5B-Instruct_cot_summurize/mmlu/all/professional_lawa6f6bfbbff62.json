The husband was present and denied the allegation. Police asked for permission to search the premises for drugs, which was consented to by the wife. The husband, however, refused to consent to the search. The police went ahead anyway and found drugs in the husband's belongings. After being arrested on drug charges, the husband filed a motion for suppression of the evidence based on lack of consent. What should be the likely decision of the trial court?\n\nA. The search was invalid and the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant of the premises was present and specifically refused to give consent to the search.\nB. The search was valid because the cases say that one occupant's consent to the search overrules the other occupant's refusal to consent.\nC. The search was valid because the wife's statement established probable cause that a crime was being committed \u0080\u0093 this created exigent circumstances for the search.\nD. The search was invalid because, even though consent was given, the police must first attempt to get a search warrant to enter a home.\n"

The search was invalid and the evidence must be suppressed because the co-occupant of the premises was present and specifically refused to give consent to the search.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures without probable cause or a warrant. In the case of domestic disputes involving co-occupants, courts have held that a co-occupant who refuses to give consent to a search can override the consent of another co-occupant, rendering the entire search void.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome would be a ruling that the search conducted without the husband's consent was invalid due to his refusal to provide consent. This finding could result in the suppression of any evidence obtained as a result of the search, including the drugs found in his belongings."
