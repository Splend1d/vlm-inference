Older people are no more likely to have low haemoglobin concentration than younger people.\n\nHaemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen, can decrease as we age due to a condition called iron-deficiency anemia or a decrease in production by the body's own haemoglobin production mechanisms. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness. However, there is not enough evidence to support that older people are at increased risk for low haemoglobin levels compared to younger individuals. It is also important to note that other factors like lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption), genetic predispositions, and chronic diseases can affect haemoglobin levels in older adults. Therefore, it is essential to consider multiple factors when assessing the overall health status of older populations."
