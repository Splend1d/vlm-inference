Therefore, options A and C cannot be correct. \n\nSome breeds of dogs may exhibit some signs of reproductive behavior such as estrus (the period when they are receptive to mating), but again, their menstrual cycles do not align with human menstrual cycles. Therefore, option B is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. a and b only."
