The components of the electron transport chain. \n\nThe inner mitochondrial membrane is responsible for the transport of electrons generated by the Krebs cycle to the electron transport chain, which ultimately leads to the production of ATP through the electron transport chain. This process involves the movement of protons across the mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient that drives the flow of electrons through the chain and generates ATP."
