Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, playing video games instead of reading Twitter is not considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Reading Twitter may be seen as more important or relevant to someone's interests and activities, but it is not inherently wrong just because one chooses to spend time doing other things instead.\n\nIn scenario 2, moaning during sex with a corpse is generally considered morally wrong due to the nature of the act being violent and disturbing. It goes against ethical norms and societal expectations about what constitutes acceptable behavior in sexual encounters."
