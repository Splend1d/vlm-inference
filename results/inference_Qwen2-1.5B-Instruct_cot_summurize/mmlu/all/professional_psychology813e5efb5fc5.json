As long as the arrangement is transparent and doesn't involve any deceptive or unfair practices, it can be seen as a way to help those who may otherwise have difficulty affording medical care. \n\nIt is also important to note that the insurance company should not explicitly prohibit such arrangements, but rather allow them as long as they comply with their own policies and procedures. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the arrangement is fair and equitable for all parties involved."
