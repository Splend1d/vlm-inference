He argued that it is important not to be influenced by our passions or impulses, but rather to make decisions based on reason and logic. This requires careful consideration of the potential outcomes and consequences of our actions, and making choices that align with our values and goals. Ultimately, Epictetus taught that the best course of action is one that promotes the greatest good for the greatest number, but this should be done with a clear understanding of the impact that our actions will have on ourselves and others."
