The defendant eventually stumbled into the bathroom where he spotted a purse lying on the floor under the sink. Wondering vaguely if it might contain more beer, he opened it up and found his friend's wallet. He grabbed some money from the wallet and left the bathroom. As he was descending the stairs with the money in his hand, his friend spotted him. She was initially concerned he might tumble down the stairs but upon seeing the money in his hand, she asked him where he got it. The defendant responded, \"Ha! Your money or your life!\" Not taking him seriously, the friend let him pass by. It wasn't until later that she realized that the defendant had taken the money from her wallet. The defendant should be charged with which of the following crimes?\n\nA. Larceny.\nB. Larceny and burglary.\nC. Larceny and attempted extortion.\nD. Robbery and extortion.\n"

In this scenario, the defendant took the money from his friend's wallet, which constitutes larceny. However, since the friend did not notice the theft while the defendant was present, it could also be considered as an act of attempted extortion because the friend did not know about the theft when she asked about it. Therefore, the correct answer is either A (larceny) or C (larceny and attempted extortion)."
