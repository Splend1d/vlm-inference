At the jury trial, the man presented evidence that he had paid all premiums on the insurance policy and that the policy cov-ered personal-injury-related medical expenses arising from accidents. After he rested his case, the company presented evidence that a provision of the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured's \u00d2unduly risky\u00d3 behavior. The company also presented a witness who testified that the accident had occurred in an area where posted signs warned bikers not to enter. The man did not cross-examine the witness. After resting its case, the company moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the court grant the motion?\n\nA. No, because a motion for judgment as a matter of law must first be made at the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief.\nB. No, because whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.\nC. Yes, because the company's uncontradicted evidence of the man's unduly risky behavior means that no reason-able jury could find that the policy covers his injuries.\nD. Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing the \u00d2unduly risky\u00d3 policy provision in his case-in-chief.\n"

Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing the \u00d2unduly risky\u00d3 policy provision in his case-in-chief.\n\nWhen a party makes a motion for judgment as a matter of law, they must make it before the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief. This means that the party must have exhausted their opportunity to present evidence in support of their claim or defense. In this case, the man failed to address the \u00d2unduly risky\u00d3 policy provision during his case-in-chief, which allowed the company to argue that the man's behavior was indeed unduly risky.\n\nTherefore, the court should grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law."
