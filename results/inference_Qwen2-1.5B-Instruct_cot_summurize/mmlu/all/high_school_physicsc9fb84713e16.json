The person standing on a scale in an elevator will notice their weight being less than their usual weight if the elevator is moving upward and slowing down. This is because the person's weight is affected by gravity, which causes them to accelerate downwards with each floor they pass. If the elevator is going up and slowing down, it means that the person's acceleration due to gravity is greater than zero (upwards) and negative (slowing), resulting in a net force upwards and a decrease in weight."
