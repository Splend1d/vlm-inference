This means that the results from one period may not accurately reflect what would have happened if the program had been implemented continuously without interruptions. \n\nCampbell and Stanley argue that when there are significant differences between test scores before and after the program was implemented, it suggests that the program may not have been effective or that some other factor may be influencing the outcomes. Therefore, if the test-retest reliability is poor, it may indicate that the program's effectiveness is being influenced by factors beyond its control, such as participant dropout or aging effects."
