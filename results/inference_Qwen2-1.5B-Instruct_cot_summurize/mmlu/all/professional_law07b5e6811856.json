At trial, the shopper's housekeeper testified that the shopper was bedridden and unable to work for a month because of the sprained back she suffered when she fell at the mall. The housekeeper also testified that about one week after the shopper returned home from the hospital, the shopper told her, \"My back is really killing me. The pain is excruciating. It'll be a miracle if I can ever stand up again. \" The mall's counsel then moved to strike the housekeeper's testimony. The motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the housekeeper's testimony is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nB. granted, because the housekeeper's testimony would be self-serving.\nC. denied, because the housekeeper's testimony would be admissible as an adoptive admission.\nD. denied, because the shopper's statement to her housekeeper would be admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition.\n"

In this case, the shopper's statement to her housekeeper could be admitted as a declaration of present bodily condition if the court determines that it meets the requirements of Rule 803(1)(c).\n\nIt is important to note that the court must make a determination regarding the admissibility of the witness' testimony based on the totality of the circumstances. Therefore, the court will consider whether the witness's testimony is relevant, reliable, and consistent with other evidence presented at trial. Additionally, the court will weigh the probative value against the potential for prejudice or confusion to the jury."
