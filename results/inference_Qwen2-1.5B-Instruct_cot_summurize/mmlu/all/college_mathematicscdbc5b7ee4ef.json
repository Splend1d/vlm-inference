A subset of the real line R that contains only rational numbers (and no irrational numbers) will always be an open set because it is composed entirely of points with non-zero coordinates. In other words, every point in the set has a neighborhood that does not contain any points outside the set. This property is what makes an open set in general: if you have a point x in the set, there exists a neighborhood N(x) such that N(x) \u2286 A.\n\n2. Since A contains all rational numbers, we can conclude that A is uncountable because there are more real numbers than there are rational numbers. Therefore, A is also open by definition since it contains all its limit points (the rationals).\n\n3. The fact that A is uncountable implies that it cannot be closed, as closure involves having a countably infinite number of points within the set. However, this property does not contradict our previous conclusion that A is open, as being open and uncountable are two distinct properties that do not require one another.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is D. If A is uncountable, then A is open."
