During exercise, muscles switch to using anaerobic pathways for energy production, leading to an accumulation of lactate in the bloodstream. This can lead to an increase in blood lactate concentration over time, especially during prolonged or intense exercise.\n\nIt's important to note that the exact level and timing of lactate build-up can vary depending on factors such as individual fitness levels, training intensity, and the specific sport being played. However, in general, lactate concentrations tend to increase with increased physical demand and may peak during the second half of a match or after periods of rest and recovery."
