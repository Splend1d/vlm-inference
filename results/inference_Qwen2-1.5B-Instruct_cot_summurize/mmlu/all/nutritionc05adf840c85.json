Deficiency of vitamin K can lead to an increase in the time it takes for blood to clot, which is known as thrombocytopenia. This is because the proteins required for blood clotting cannot be synthesized properly due to the lack of vitamin K. However, this effect on clotting time is not related to changes in the levels of calcium or phosphorus, which are also important for blood clotting."
