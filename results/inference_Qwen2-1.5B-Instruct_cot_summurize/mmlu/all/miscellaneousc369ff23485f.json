Take periodic breaks to view natural lighting. \n\nScreen-induced eyestrain can be caused by prolonged exposure to bright screens, which can cause strain on the eyes and lead to fatigue and discomfort. Taking regular breaks to look at something that is not a screen (such as nature or a book) can help reduce this strain and improve overall eye health. Using eye drops may also help relieve dryness and irritation caused by prolonged screen use, but it's important to consult with an ophthalmologist before using any eye drops. Changing the choice of software programs and adjusting the resolution on the monitor may not necessarily alleviate screen-induced eyestrain."
