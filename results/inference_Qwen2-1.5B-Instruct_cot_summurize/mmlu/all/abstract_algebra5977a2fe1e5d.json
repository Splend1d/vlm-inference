In this case, we have two fields: $Q(\\sqrt{2})$ and $Q(\\sqrt{3})$.\nThe sum of the degrees of these extensions is equal to the degree of the extension $Q(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$ over $Q$.\nSince $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are both algebraic over their respective roots, they do not affect the degree of any extension between them.\nTherefore, the degree of the extension $Q(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})$ over $Q$ is simply the sum of the degrees of $Q(\\sqrt{2})$ and $Q(\\sqrt{3})$, which is $2 + 2 = 4$.\nSo the answer is B. 4."
