While genetics and evolution were indeed considered, the idea that height could be used to explain differences between races has been widely rejected by modern science. Brain size, on the other hand, has been a topic of much debate and research in evolutionary biology, with some arguing that it can provide evidence for or against the theory of evolution by natural selection."
