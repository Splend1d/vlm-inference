Acting as a Good Samaritan, the pedestrian approached the boys and tried to intercede. The boy stumbled and accidentally fell into the pedestrian, knocking him to the ground.

Not prevail, unless the boy was negligent.\n\nIn this scenario, the pedestrian's belief that the boy was about to injure his brother was reasonable, but it does not automatically lead to liability on the part of the boy. The doctrine of transferred intent suggests that if someone intervenes in an assault or battery, the person who intervenes may be held liable for the injuries caused by the attacker. However, the pedestrian did not intervene voluntarily; instead, he acted as a Good Samaritan who was trying to prevent harm from occurring. Therefore, the pedestrian cannot sue the boy for his injury under the doctrine of transferred intent.\n\nAdditionally, the pedestrian assumed the risk of the incident. When someone intentionally provokes another party, they assume the risk of any harm that may occur. In this case, the boy provoked his brother, so the pedestrian can only sue the boy for negligence if he was also negligent himself."
