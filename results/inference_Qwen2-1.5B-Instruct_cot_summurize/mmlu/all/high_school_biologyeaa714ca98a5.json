Mitochondria produce cellular energy through the process of oxidative phosphorylation, which involves the breakdown of ATP from ADP and NADH. Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, which is essential for all cell functions, including those involving hydrogen peroxide.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: Peroxisomes, mitochondria, and ribosomes."
