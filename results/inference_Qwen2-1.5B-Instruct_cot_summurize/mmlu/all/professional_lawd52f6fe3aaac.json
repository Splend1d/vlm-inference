However, the judge may consider the witness's testimony as evidence of his reliability and the credibility of his testimony, which could affect the outcome of the case. The judge may also rule on whether the witness's mental illness makes it unfair to permit him to testify at all. If the judge determines that the witness cannot testify competently due to his mental illness, the judge may exclude his testimony altogether. If the judge rules that the witness's mental illness does not make it unfair to permit him to testify, but the witness's testimony is otherwise unreliable or inadmissible, the judge may admit the testimony only after ruling on its admissibility."
