Mass, velocity, and acceleration.\n\nTo determine the tension in the cables pulling an elevator, we need to know the mass of the elevator, its velocity, and the acceleration due to gravity. This information will allow us to calculate the force acting on the elevator, which is equal to the weight of the elevator. The tension in the cables is then the difference between this force and the weight of the elevator. \n\nTherefore, the values that would be needed for determining the tension in the cables are:\n\n- Mass of the elevator\n- Velocity of the elevator\n- Acceleration due to gravity\n\nThese values can be obtained from various sources such as sensors or accelerometers attached to the elevator's structure."
