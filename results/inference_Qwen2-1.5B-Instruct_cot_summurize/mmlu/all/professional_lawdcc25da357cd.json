According to the policy contract, the insured was required to notify the insurance company within 10 days following any loss due to fire or other catastrophe. The owner sued the insurance company to recover $750,000, which was the face amount that his home was insured for. The insurance company admitted that the owner's house was insured for that amount, though the company denied liability because it claimed that it had not received notice of the fire within the 10-day period as required by the policy. At trial, the owner calls his bookkeeper to testify. The bookkeeper proposes to testify that on March 11, the owner handed her an envelope and told her it contained a notice form for the insurance company, and that she mailed the envelope on his behalf. If the bookkeeper intends to establish that the envelope that the owner handed her contained the notice of fire loss, her proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because the owner's statement to her is non-hearsay.\nB. admissible, because a letter properly mailed is presumed received in due course.\nC. inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is not the best evidence.\nD. inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.\n"

Inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.\n\nHearsay is defined as a statement offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Exceptions to the hearsay rule include statements made under oath (such as sworn affidavits), statements made at a previous court hearing, and statements made by a person who has firsthand knowledge of the event.\n\nIn this case, the bookkeeper's testimony is not considered to be a statement made under oath, nor is it a statement made at a previous court hearing. Therefore, the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is not admissible under any exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nAdditionally, even if the owner's statement to the bookkeeper were admissible, the insurance company would still have the burden of proving its defense, which means that they would need to show that the owner did not receive notice of the fire within the 10-day period required by the policy."
