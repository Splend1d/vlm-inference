He argued that this behavior leads to conflict and violence, and that it is necessary to establish rules and institutions to prevent these conflicts from escalating into wars.\n\nTherefore, Hobbes' philosophy suggests that the best way to achieve happiness is through virtuous living, which involves acting in a manner that promotes the well-being of oneself and others. This includes treating others with kindness and respect, avoiding harm or aggression towards them, and striving for moral and ethical behavior. By doing so, individuals can create a more peaceful and just society where everyone's needs and desires can be met."
