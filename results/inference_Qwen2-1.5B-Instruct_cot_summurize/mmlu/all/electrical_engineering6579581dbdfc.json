The resistance of a conductor depends on several factors including its length, cross-sectional area, material, and temperature. Changing the cross-sectional area can increase or decrease the resistance depending on these other factors. Therefore, option B is correct. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that changing the resistance does not necessarily change the reluctance of the conductor as well because reluctance is more related to the magnetic properties of the material rather than its physical dimensions. So, options A and C are incorrect."
