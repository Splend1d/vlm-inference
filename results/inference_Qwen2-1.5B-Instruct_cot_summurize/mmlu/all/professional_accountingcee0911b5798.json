So, the Code Sec. 1244 stock loss was \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 20,000 = \\$15,000 \\).\n\n3. **Current Year Income and Loss**: Summer earned $80,000 this year but also sustained an additional loss of $50,000 on Code Sec. 1244 stock.\n\n4. **Total Loss for Current Year**: To find out how much of her $50,000 loss can be deducted this year, we need to subtract her $80,000 income from her total loss of $50,000.\n\n   Total loss for current year = $50,000 - $80,000 = -$30,000\n\nHowever, since losses cannot be negative, it means that she actually had a net gain of $30,000 this year, not a loss. This discrepancy indicates there might have been some misunderstanding or error in interpreting the question as originally stated.\n\nAssuming we're looking at a correct interpretation where she actually lost money rather than gained, let's calculate the actual loss amount:\n\n- The initial NOL was $20,000.\n- The Code Sec. 1244 stock loss was $15,000.\n- Her income for the current year was $80,000.\n- Her total loss for the current year would thus be the sum of these two amounts minus her income:\n   Total loss for current year = $20,000 + $15,000 - $80,000 = -$30,000\n\nThis calculation shows that she actually did incur a loss of $30,000 on her Code Sec. 1244 stock this year, which matches the original scenario if you assume the loss occurred in the current year.\n\nGiven that her total loss for the current year is indeed a loss, the Code Sec. 1244 loss that she can deduct for the current year is simply the Code Sec. 1244 stock loss, which is $15,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. $35,000 capital loss**."
