If an action has a good motive but a bad consequence, it may still be considered morally right if the overall impact is positive. Conversely, if an action has a bad motive but a good consequence, it may still be considered morally wrong even if the outcome is negative. Therefore, Bentham's philosophy emphasizes the importance of considering both the intentions behind an action and its outcomes when determining whether it is morally right or wrong."
