Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed.\n\nWhen countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market, it can be because they believe that doing so will lead to higher profits for domestic firms and therefore better economic outcomes for the country as a whole. This belief may be based on the idea that protectionist policies will reduce competition and ensure that domestic firms have access to resources and markets that would otherwise be available only to foreign competitors.\n\nHowever, while protectionism can sometimes lead to short-term gains for domestic firms, it ultimately leads to long-term negative consequences for the economy. When countries restrict imports or impose high tariffs on imported goods, this can lead to reduced economic growth and lower living standards for citizens. It also reduces the ability of domestic firms to learn from other industries and adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nFurthermore, international trade has become an essential part of global economics, and countries that do not participate in it risk being left behind economically. Therefore, it is generally considered irrational for countries to try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market."
