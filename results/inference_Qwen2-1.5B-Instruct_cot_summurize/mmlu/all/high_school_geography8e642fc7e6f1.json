Mongolia\n\nMongolia is located in the Asia-Pacific region, which is known for its vast and diverse geography with many countries facing significant trade disadvantages due to their location. Mongolia's geographical isolation has made it difficult for it to access markets and trade easily, leading to a lack of competitiveness in global commerce. Additionally, Mongolia's small size and limited resources make it less attractive to foreign investors and traders compared to other countries in the region."
