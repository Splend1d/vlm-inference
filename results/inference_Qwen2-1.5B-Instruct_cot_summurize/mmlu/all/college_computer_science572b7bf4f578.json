                    "text": "We cannot determine which statement is true without knowing the specific instruction sets implemented by M-5 and M-7. However, we can make some general observations:\n\n1. If both processors have the same number of stages in their pipelines, then the maximum throughput will be determined by the longest stage in each processor's pipeline. In this case, both processors have a 5-stage pipeline, so M-7's pipeline would have better maximum throughput than M-5's pipeline.\n\n2. A higher clock frequency can increase the speed of an instruction set, but it may also increase its latency. Since the clock cycles for M-5 and M-7 are different, it is possible that M-7 has a lower clock frequency than M-5, which could result in longer latencies for certain instructions. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that the latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7's pipeline than on M-5's pipeline.\n\n3. The execution time of a program depends on many factors, including the instruction set being used, the complexity of the program, and the available resources such as memory bandwidth and cache sizes. It is not possible to say with certainty whether programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5 based solely on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. II and III."
