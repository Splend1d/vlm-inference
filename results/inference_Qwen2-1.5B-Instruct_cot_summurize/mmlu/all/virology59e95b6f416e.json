The HPV virus can replicate in dividing cells by integrating its own genetic material into the host cell's DNA. This integration can lead to the expression of oncogenes that can promote uncontrolled cell growth and division.\nIn addition to integrating its own DNA into the host cell's genome, the HPV virus also contains oncoproteins that can interact with other cellular proteins and enhance their function or activity. These oncoproteins can include E6, which has been shown to promote tumor progression and E7, which is associated with the development of cervical cancer.\nOverall, the HPV virus causes cancer through a combination of integrating its own genetic material into the host cell's DNA and expressing oncoproteins that can enhance cellular proliferation and promote tumor formation."
