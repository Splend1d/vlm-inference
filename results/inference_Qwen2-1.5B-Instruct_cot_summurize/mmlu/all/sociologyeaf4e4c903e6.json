Leisure time became more important due to the increased productivity and efficiency brought about by industrialization. People had more free time to pursue hobbies, interests, and other forms of recreation. Additionally, industrial capitalism led to the growth of civic and municipal cultures through public libraries, museums, and art galleries. These institutions provided opportunities for people to engage in cultural activities and learn new skills, which helped to shape their leisure time. Finally, industrial capitalism also led to the development of consumer goods, which allowed people to have access to leisure-time entertainment such as movies, music, and sports."
