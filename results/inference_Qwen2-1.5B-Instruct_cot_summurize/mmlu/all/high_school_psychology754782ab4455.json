Perception is the interpretation of that information in terms of meaning or understanding.\n\nConduction refers to the movement of electrical signals through the body's tissues, while transduction involves the conversion of one form of energy or signal into another. Energy refers to heat, light, or other forms of electromagnetic radiation, while chemical refers to taste, smell, or touch.\n\nBichromatic refers to the use of two colors to represent all possible shades of gray, while trichromatic refers to the use of three colors (red, green, and blue) to create the full spectrum of colors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. sensation and perception."
