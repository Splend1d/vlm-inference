The question asks how many female renouncers were under her tutelage. There is no information provided about the number of female renouncers under her tutelage, so we cannot determine the correct answer based on the given options. Therefore, option A (36,000) is incorrect, and options B (12,000), D (7,000), and C (24,000) are all possible answers. However, without additional information, it is not possible to determine which one is correct."
