The categories are not numerical for either variable. \n\nContingency tables for chi-square tests for independence involve two categorical variables that are independent of each other. This means that the occurrence of one variable does not affect the occurrence of the other variable.\n\nFor example, if you have a table with two columns (e.g., gender and occupation) where there are multiple rows (people), then it's important to make sure that all the values in each row are unique (i.e., no person can belong to more than one category). This ensures that the variables are truly independent.\n\nIn contrast, when discussing numerical data such as age or income levels, these values can be numerical and therefore may not always be whole numbers. For example, someone could be 17 years old, which would be considered an integer value rather than a floating-point number. However, for the purposes of chi-square tests for independence, numerical data is typically assumed to be continuous and whole numbers, unless stated otherwise by the researcher."
