Let's re-evaluate the calculation considering that the parent initially provided securities with an adjusted basis of $10,000 and later they were sold at $7,000. \n\nIf the parent provided the securities with an adjusted basis of $10,000, then the selling price of $7,000 indicates a loss on sale, which means the child would have a gain rather than a loss. The correct interpretation should reflect this understanding.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 0** since the securities were sold at a loss, so the basis for the securities sold (the amount by which the selling price exceeds the adjusted basis) is zero."
