                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.\n\nIn the short run, nominal wages are sticky in response to changes in prices, meaning that firms have difficulty immediately adjusting their wage rates to reflect changes in the price level. As a result, the short-run aggregate supply curve is typically downward-sloping, with nominal wages on the horizontal axis and real GDP (output) on the vertical axis. This means that at each point on the curve, nominal wages are above the market-clearing level, and output is below potential output because workers are paid too much for the amount of labor they can produce.\n\nIn contrast, the long-run aggregate supply curve is generally upward-sloping, reflecting the fact that nominal wages are flexible and adjust quickly to changes in the price level. At any given point on this curve, nominal wages are at or near the market-clearing level, and output is at its potential value. The long-run aggregate supply curve reflects the concept of \"wage flexibility,\" where employers are able to hire and fire workers more easily than in the short run."
