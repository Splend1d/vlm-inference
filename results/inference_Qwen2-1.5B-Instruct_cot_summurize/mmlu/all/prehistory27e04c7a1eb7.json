The Hassunun site was associated with the ancient city of Nineveh, which was known for its prosperity as a major trading center during the Hittite and Assyrian periods. It is believed that many of the artifacts found there were used by wealthy traders or royalty. The Samarra site, located near Baghdad, was also a significant center of trade and culture during the Abbasid period. Both sites are known for their impressive monumental architecture, including temples, palaces, and other structures."
