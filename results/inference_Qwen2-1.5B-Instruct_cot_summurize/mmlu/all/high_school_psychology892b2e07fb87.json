Skinner\n\nWilliam James, Wilhelm Wundt, and Carl Rogers were all early 20th-century psychologists who made significant contributions to the field, but none of them would be expected to agree with the statement you provided. \n\nB.F. Skinner was a behaviorist psychologist known for his work in operant conditioning, which focuses on the consequences of actions rather than innate psychological states. He developed the Skinner box as an experimental tool that allowed him to manipulate reinforcement and punishment in controlled environments.\n\nOn the other hand, William James believed in the idea that human nature is determined by the environment it lives in, while Wilhelm Wundt was interested in the development of psychology through natural science methods. Carl Rogers focused more on the individual's experience and perspective, emphasizing empathy and emotional intelligence.\n\nTherefore, based on their theories and methodologies, B.F. Skinner would most likely agree with your statement about the combination of reinforcers and punishers influencing behavior."
