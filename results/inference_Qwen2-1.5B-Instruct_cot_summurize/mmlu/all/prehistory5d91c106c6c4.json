They may have some information about the timing of the arrival of humans into other parts of the world, but they would not necessarily have that same level of knowledge regarding the specific timeline of the arrival of humans to the Americas.\n\nTherefore, options A, C, and D are not necessary for determining when people entered the Americas from Siberia based on current research. Option B, however, could be relevant if there were changes in the landscape or climate that made it easier or more dangerous to travel across the Bering Strait at different times throughout history."
