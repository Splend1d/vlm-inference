All of the above\n\nGardiner's analysis of climate change suggests that it is a complex problem with multiple contributing factors and effects, each of which can have significant impacts on society. The problem is not adequately addressed by any single institution or agency, but rather requires collaboration between different stakeholders to develop effective solutions.\n\nIn addition to institutional inadequacy, Gardiner also notes the dispersion of causes and effects, where various factors contribute to climate change, but none of them is solely responsible for causing it. Finally, he highlights the fragmentation of agency, where different actors within government have different responsibilities for addressing climate change, leading to inefficiencies and lack of coordination.\n\nTherefore, D. All of the above accurately describes the characteristics of the climate change problem as identified by Gardiner."
