While comprehensive schools were designed to provide equal opportunities for all students regardless of their background, they were still subject to the same educational standards and assessments as private schools. This meant that some children who had previously been excluded or disadvantaged due to their class background may have been placed in more challenging classes or subject areas, which could exacerbate existing inequalities.\nSelective schools also continued to exist and recruit the most academically gifted pupils, further perpetuating class inequality. However, it was the introduction of national tests and league tables that made the new comprehensive schools highly competitive and selective, leading to a widening gap between the rich and poor in terms of access to quality education."
