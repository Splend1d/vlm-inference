This property allows for easy mixing and dissolving of the solutes in the solvent. However, this does not necessarily mean that the mixture will have the same physical properties as the individual solvents. The physical properties of the mixture may depend on factors such as temperature, pressure, and concentration. Therefore, option B (a mixture that has the same physical properties as the individual solvents) is incorrect.\n\nOption D (a colorless mixture) is also incorrect because color is an important property of a solution and can affect its use and application in various fields. For example, a clear solution may be used for optical applications while a colored solution may be used for chemical reactions or industrial processes. Therefore, options A and D are not suitable answers to the question."
