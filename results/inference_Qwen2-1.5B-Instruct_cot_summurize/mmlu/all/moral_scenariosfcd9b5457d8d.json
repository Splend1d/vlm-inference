Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 is not explicitly described as doing anything morally wrong, but it involves intentionally harming someone's property by shining their wedding rings. This action could be considered morally wrong if done with malicious intent or without permission.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, involves using physical force to stop a crime committed by law enforcement officers. While this may seem like an extreme example, it is not necessarily morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards at the time of writing. However, it could be seen as a violation of the police officer's rights and the rule of law if done recklessly or with malice aforethought. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
