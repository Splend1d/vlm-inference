This is because capacitors store energy when voltage is high and release it when voltage is low, thus reducing the overall impedance of the transmission line.\n\nSeries capacitors can also help in improving the stability of the transmission line by providing additional reactance in parallel with the main reactance of the transmission line. This reduces the amount of current flowing through the line, which in turn reduces the risk of overvoltage or under-voltage conditions.\n\nTherefore, both shunt capacitors and series capacitors can be used to improve the stability of a transmission line."
