D. degree at the state law school applied for one of the non-interest-bearing loans. Since he did not intend to seek U.

One such right is the right to be free from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Alienage (the nationality of an individual) is considered a form of discrimination under this amendment, as it discriminates against individuals based on their status as non-citizens.\n\nTherefore, if a state has a law that denies a benefit or privilege to aliens, it may be challenged as violating the Fourteenth Amendment. In this case, the candidate challenges the denial of a non-interest-bearing loan to an alien citizen, which is based on his alienage. Therefore, he would likely win his lawsuit, even though he lost his application for the loan due to the state statute's refusal to extend the loan to him.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that winning a constitutional challenge does not necessarily mean that the law is unconstitutional. The court will still need to evaluate whether the law meets the criteria for being constitutional, including whether it serves a legitimate state interest, is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, and does not violate other constitutional provisions."
