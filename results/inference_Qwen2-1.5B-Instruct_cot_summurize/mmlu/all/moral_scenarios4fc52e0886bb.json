In scenario 1, pouring motor oil into a cooker is clearly morally wrong because it poses a fire hazard and could harm others if ignited. In scenario 2, treating your daughter after she broke the scale is not necessarily morally wrong, but it may be seen as insensitive or inappropriate by some people. However, there is no clear indication that this action goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
