A considerable amount of energy still remains in ethanol, yet ethanol is a waste product for the yeast cells that produce it. What, then, is the purpose of fermentation?\n\nA. Fermentation provides CO2 for photosynthesis.\nB. Fermentation provides CO2 for cellular respiration.\nC. Yeast cells excrete ethanol in order to provide a defense against invading bacteria.\nD.

Fermentation provides CO2 for cellular respiration.\n\nFermentation is an anaerobic process where yeast and other microorganisms convert sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide produced during fermentation can be used by the cell for cellular respiration, which is the process by which cells obtain energy from glucose or other organic molecules. This is why fermentation is often referred to as \"the second metabolism\" after photosynthesis."
