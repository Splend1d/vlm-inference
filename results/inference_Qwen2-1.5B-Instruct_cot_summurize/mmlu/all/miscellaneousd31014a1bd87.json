The sudden demise of the dinosaurs\n\nThe Late Cretaceous period is known for its rapid extinction events, including the mass extinction that wiped out most species in the world, including the dinosaurs. This event is believed to have been caused by a combination of factors such as an asteroid impact or a series of volcanic eruptions that led to widespread destruction of the Earth's ecosystems. As a result, many species were unable to adapt quickly enough to survive these changes, leading to their eventual demise."
