Fifteen engineers work in the Atlanta office, and 14 engineers work in the New Orleans office. The business manager decided to use a 2-sample t-test to compare the mean salaries of engineers in the two offices. Because there were only 15 engineers in one office and 14 engineers in the other, he used the salaries of all the engineers in the computation. Is the 2-sample t-test an appropriate inferential technique in this situation?\n\nA. Yes, because he is comparing the means of two small groups.\nB. Yes. Both Atlanta and New Orleans are large cities, so the salaries are comparable.\nC. Yes. Because Atlanta and New Orleans are about 500 miles apart, the two groups of engineers can be assumed to be independent.\nD. No, because the entire population information was used from both offices. Because no samples were taken, a t-test should not be used.\n"

Yes, because he is comparing the means of two small groups.\n\nIn this scenario, the business manager is using the entire population information from both offices (Atlanta and New Orleans) to determine if the salaries of engineers are different between the two locations. This approach is valid for a 2-sample t-test as long as the sample sizes are small enough to meet the assumptions of the test, such as having less than 30 degrees of freedom and being randomly selected from the populations.\n\nIt's important to note that the assumption of independence between the groups does not apply here since the engineer salaries are not randomly selected from each group but rather based on the total number of employees in each location. However, assuming that the salaries are representative of the overall salary distribution in each city, the sample size is small enough for a t-test to be appropriate."
