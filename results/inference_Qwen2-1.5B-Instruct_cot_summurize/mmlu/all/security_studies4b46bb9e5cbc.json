The European school is based on a hegemonic form of knowledge. Knowledge is conceived as the understanding of causal mechanisms in relation to the material on which they act.\nC.

                    "text": "Theorizing on both sides of the Atlantic has evolved significantly over time, leading to various differences in approaches and perspectives.\n\nOption A correctly identifies that from a U.S. perspective, the main voice of security is often considered to be external. This approach places more emphasis on external threats such as terrorism, espionage, and cyber attacks rather than internal security concerns like crime, public health, and environmental issues. Additionally, there is a debate about whether certain aspects of national security (such as surveillance) can be justified under the guise of protecting individuals' rights and freedoms.\n\nOption B accurately reflects the European approach to security theory. It emphasizes the role of institutions, particularly the European Union, in shaping policies related to security and defense. The European school also places greater emphasis on the concept of \"hegemony,\" where power relations between states influence security dynamics. This contrasts with the United States, where the focus is often on the balance of power and deterrence strategies.\n\nOption C highlights the difference in approaches between the two schools. In the U.S., the problem-solving tradition prioritizes solving problems through evidence-based analysis and empirical data. In contrast, the European approach often involves a more critical study of the causes and effects of security-related events, focusing on the broader societal implications of security decisions.\n\nOption D accurately captures the parallel theoretical forms of knowledge that have developed based on these differing approaches. For example, American security theorists might rely heavily on quantitative methods and empirical research to understand security issues, while European scholars may use qualitative methods and case studies to analyze security phenomena. These differences reflect the distinct cultural and institutional contexts that shape each school's theoretical framework."
