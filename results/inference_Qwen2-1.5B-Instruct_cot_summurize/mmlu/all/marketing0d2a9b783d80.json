Early adopter.\n\nEarly adopters are individuals or organizations that are willing to take risks and try out new products or technologies at an early stage, often before they become mainstream or widely accepted by others. They tend to be more innovative and forward-thinking than those in the late majority or laggard groups, but less so than those in the early majority group. Early adopters may also have a higher tolerance for risk and uncertainty, which can help them to stay ahead of the curve and gain a competitive advantage in their industry."
