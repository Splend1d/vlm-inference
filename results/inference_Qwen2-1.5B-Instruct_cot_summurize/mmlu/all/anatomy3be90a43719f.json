This is because the right main bronchus is narrower and more horizontal than the left. The bronchi are muscular tubes that carry air from the lungs to the alveoli (tiny air sacs) where gas exchange occurs. They are also responsible for delivering oxygen to the bloodstream. The bronchi have different widths and angles depending on their location and function. In general, the right main bronchus is narrower and more horizontal than the left, which makes it less likely to be obstructed by a foreign object like a fractured tooth. However, this is not a guarantee and other factors such as the presence of a foreign object in the mouth can still cause it to be aspirated into either lung."
