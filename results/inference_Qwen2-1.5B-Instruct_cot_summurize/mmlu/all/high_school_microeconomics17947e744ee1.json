                    "text": "The answer is A. If the demand curve is perfectly elastic, the price rises by the amount of the tax.\n\nWhen an excise tax is imposed on the production of good X, it reduces the quantity supplied and increases the quantity demanded for good X. Since the demand curve for good X is perfectly elastic, any increase in the price due to the tax will cause a proportional increase in the quantity demanded. Therefore, the price of good X will rise by the amount of the tax.\n\nThis means that the consumer's burden of the tax (the difference between the original price and the new price) will also rise proportionally. In other words, if the original price was $10 per unit and the tax was $2 per unit, then the consumer would pay $8 per unit instead of $12 per unit after the tax is applied. This means that the consumer's burden of the tax rises as the demand curve is perfectly elastic.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the consumer's burden of the tax does not necessarily rise as the demand curve becomes more elastic. Option C is incorrect because the consumer's burden of the tax does not necessarily rise as a result of the tax. Option D is incorrect because the demand curve can be inelastic or even inelastic, but it cannot be perfectly elastic."
