This path will consist of \\(h\\) nodes (including the root) plus one more node leading to the leaf. The maximum length of this path is \\(2^h + 1\\).\n\nThus, the length of the longest path between any two nodes is at most \\(2^h + 1\\). However, since the ratios are bounded above by \\(c\\), the actual length of the longest path must be less than or equal to \\(c(2^h + 1)\\).\n\nSince \\(2^h + 1\\) grows exponentially as \\(h\\) increases, it follows that the length of the longest path between any two nodes also grows exponentially as \\(h\\) increases. Therefore, the height \\(h\\) cannot grow faster than linearly with respect to \\(N\\), meaning:\n\n\\[ h \\leq \\log_2{\\frac{N}{2}} \\]\n\nThis implies that option A: \\(h \\leq \\log_2(N)\\) is correct."
