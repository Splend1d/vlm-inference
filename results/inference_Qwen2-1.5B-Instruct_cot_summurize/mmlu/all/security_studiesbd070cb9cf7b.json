In its advocacy of global political institutions, the Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary.\nB. Theories of Westphalian sovereignty decree that principles of non-intervention are paramount to achieving security; this has been extended into the contemporary global security environment in which international bodies such as the UN condemn humanitarian intervention, regarding it as detrimental to state-centric security.\nC. State sovereignty and principles of non-interference that underpin the Westphalian approach can be disregarded, provided that there is a consensus amongst international actors that human life within the state is at risk, and where that risk is from the actions of the state itself.\nD. The international society is governed by norms of Westphalian sovereignty that advocate non-intervention and the respect of state sovereignty as a means of achieving security. These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN.\n"

These norms are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which bans the use of force between states except in self-defence or when authorized by the UN.\n\nWestphalian sovereignty refers to the idea that each nation has the right to govern itself according to its own laws and customs, free from external interference. This principle is based on the belief that a state's internal affairs should not be subject to foreign control or influence.\n\nIn practice, this means that countries have the right to make their own decisions about how they should be governed, including whether to intervene in other countries' affairs or to allow humanitarian interventions if they believe it is necessary to protect human rights or prevent mass atrocities. However, there are also limits to this principle, such as the prohibition of the use of force between states except in self-defense or when authorized by the UN.\n\nOverall, the relationship between Westphalian sovereignty and humanitarian intervention is complex and multifaceted. On one hand, the principle of sovereignty allows for the exercise of state power within national borders without external interference. On the other hand, humanitarian interventions may sometimes be necessary to protect the lives of civilians who are suffering from persecution or genocide, even if it goes against the principle of state sovereignty."
