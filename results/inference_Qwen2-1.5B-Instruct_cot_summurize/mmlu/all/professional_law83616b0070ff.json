A pediatrician informed the infant's father that unless his daughter received immediate medical treatment, she would die. The father, who was very religious, refused to permit the pediatrician to administer the necessary treatment. He explained that his faith in his religion would restore his daughter to good health. As a consequence, the pediatrician sought an order from the state court, where the father was present, permitting the pediatrician to provide the necessary medical treatment to the infant. Which of the following is the father's strongest constitutional argument against the court order?\n\nA. The order violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The order violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC. The order violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The order violates the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

In this case, the father argues that the pediatrician's proposed medical treatment goes against his religious beliefs and therefore violates his freedom of religion. The court must balance the father's religious beliefs with the child's need for medical treatment. If the court determines that the medical treatment is essential for the child's health and well-being, it may issue an order allowing the pediatrician to proceed. However, if the court finds that the medical treatment conflicts with the father's religious beliefs, it may rule that the order is unconstitutional. This is because the court has no power to force someone to follow a particular religion, but rather only to ensure that the individual's rights are protected under the law."
