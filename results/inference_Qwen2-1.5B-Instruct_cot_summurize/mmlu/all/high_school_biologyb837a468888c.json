They change the habitat in a way that makes it more habitable for other organisms.\n\nOrganisms that are the first to colonize a habitat undergoing ecological succession tend to be those that have adaptations suited to the new environment, such as being able to tolerate high temperatures or low oxygen levels. These organisms may also be better at exploiting resources available in the new habitat than the previous inhabitants. As they thrive and reproduce, they can help to shape the ecosystem over time, potentially leading to changes in the composition and structure of the community."
