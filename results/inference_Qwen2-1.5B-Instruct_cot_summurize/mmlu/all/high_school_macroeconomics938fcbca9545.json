There exist many unemployed resources so that output can be increased without increasing wages and prices.\n\nThis is because when the economy is operating at full employment, additional workers will not necessarily result in higher wages or prices due to the law of diminishing marginal productivity. In other words, as more workers enter the labor market, the marginal product of each worker decreases, meaning that even if you hire more people, their productivity may decrease relative to the previous hires. This means that increasing the number of workers beyond full employment would not necessarily lead to an increase in wages or prices. Instead, it could potentially lead to a situation where the economy is operating at capacity and further hiring would not lead to an increase in output or employment. Therefore, the short-run aggregate supply curve would be horizontal at this point."
