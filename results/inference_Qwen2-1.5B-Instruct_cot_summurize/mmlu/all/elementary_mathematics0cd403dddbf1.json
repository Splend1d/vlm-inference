According to the information given:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{x} = 5\\% \\]\n\nSince 5% means \\(0.05\\), we can write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{7}{x} = 0.05 \\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), multiply both sides by \\(x\\) and divide by 0.05:\n\n\\[ 7 = 0.05x \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{7}{0.05} \\]\n\\[ x = 140 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of coins in Kate's coin collection is 140. The correct answer is D. 140."
