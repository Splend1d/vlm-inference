                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers (l, m_l, s, and m_s), where l is the angular momentum quantum number, m_l is its magnetic quantum number, s is the spin quantum number, and m_s is its magnetic spin quantum number. This means that if two electrons have parallel spins, they cannot be occupied by the same atom at the same time.\n\nIn the case of the helium atom, the two electrons have opposite spins due to their parities, making them orthogonal or anti-aligned. However, this does not necessarily mean that they will occupy the same orbital. In fact, the energy levels of the ortho- and para- states of the helium atom are different because of the Pauli exclusion principle. The para-state is more stable because it minimizes the overlap between the two electrons' wave functions, while the ortho-state requires more energy to achieve alignment with each other. Therefore, the ortho-state has lower energy than the corresponding para-state."
