                    "text": "The answer is D. Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes.\n\nThis selection process would favor organisms with traits that allow them to survive longer in competition with the pike-cichlid predators. Larger individuals may not have as much chance of survival if they get caught up in the predator's feeding frenzy. Therefore, it is unlikely that there would be an increase in the size of the algae-eaters due to this selective pressure.\n\nOption A is incorrect because selection for drab coloration could lead to a decrease in the number of algae-eaters as they blend into the background better, making them less visible to the predators.\nOption B is also incorrect because nocturnal algae-eaters might indeed evolve under selective pressure, but the question specifies that the algae-eaters are being affected by predation pressure from pike-cichlids, so the evolution of nocturnal behavior might not occur without further information about how the pike-cichlids interact with the algae-eaters during daylight hours.\nOption C is correct because the increased likelihood of having larger, more successful offspring increases the chances of passing on advantageous traits through reproduction, which would help the algae-eaters adapt to the selective pressures they face."
