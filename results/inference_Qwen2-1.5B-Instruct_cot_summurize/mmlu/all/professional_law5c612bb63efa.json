The boyfriend was also an avid baseball fan and had a fanatic devotion to his favorite team. One evening, the boyfriend was watching his beloved team play their archrival on television. His favorite team lost in extra innings. After the game, the boyfriend became despondent and told his girlfriend that he was so disgusted that he was going to kill himself. The boyfriend took one of the pistols from his gun collection and shot himself in the head. As the boyfriend fell to the floor, wounded, his girlfriend couldn't believe her eyes. At first she thought that she should call 911 for an ambulance. But she was afraid that the police might think that she was responsible for the shooting. Consequently, she decided to do nothing. She proceeded to leave the apartment and spent the night at her mother's home. The boyfriend did not immediately die from the gunshot wound. A subsequent medical examiner's report concluded that the boyfriend died from loss of blood approximately two hours after the shooting. If the girlfriend had sought immediate medical assistance, the boyfriend would have lived. The girlfriend is subsequently prosecuted for her boyffiend's death. She should be found\n\nA. guilty of first-degree murder.\nB. guilty of second-degree murder.\nC. guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\nD. not guilty, because she had no legal duty to render assistance.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C: guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter occurs when a person causes the death of another through \"actus reus,\" or intentional actions, but does so without malice aforethought (intent to kill). In this case, the girlfriend's failure to seek immediate medical help can be seen as an actus reus that resulted in the boyfriend's death.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's decision not to call 911 for an ambulance was not intentional; it was motivated by fear of being held responsible for the shooting. This fear of responsibility may be considered an element of mens rea, or intent, in some jurisdictions, but it does not negate the fact that the girlfriend's action was still a violation of the law.\n\nTherefore, the girlfriend should be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter."
