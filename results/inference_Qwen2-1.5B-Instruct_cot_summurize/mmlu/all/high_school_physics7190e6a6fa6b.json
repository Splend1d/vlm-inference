It will fall with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\n\nIn free fall, an object accelerates due to gravity, but also decelerates due to air resistance. As the object falls, its speed increases until it reaches terminal velocity, where the net force on the object is zero (assuming no other forces act on it). At this point, the object continues to accelerate downward at a constant rate due to gravity, but it also decelerates due to air resistance. The rate of acceleration decreases as the object approaches the ground, causing the speed to decrease.\n\nTherefore, the motion of a real object in free fall can be described as falling with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration."
