Additionally, asking questions about shopping habits and preferences across various types of shops (such as clothing stores, electronics stores, etc.) can provide a more comprehensive understanding of what customers value and prefer. Conducting the survey at only one type of store or a specific area of the mall may limit the representation of different customer segments and shopping behaviors."
