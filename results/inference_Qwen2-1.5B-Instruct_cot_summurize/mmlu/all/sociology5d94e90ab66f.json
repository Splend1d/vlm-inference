Postmodernists argue that the world we live in is full of fragmentation, ambiguity, and subjectivity, and that traditional theories of knowledge cannot adequately capture these complexities. They also argue that the idea of \"objective truth\" is itself a product of an outdated, Eurocentric worldview, and that we need to develop new forms of understanding that acknowledge the multiplicity and interconnectedness of human experience. As a result, they reject the idea that there is one correct way to understand the world or any particular theory, and instead embrace a more pluralistic and flexible approach to knowledge."
