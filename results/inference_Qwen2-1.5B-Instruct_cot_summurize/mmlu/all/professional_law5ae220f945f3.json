According to the hotel, the security camera displayed him \"wandering aimlessly\", and at times \"suspiciously\" handling various items offered for sale. They seized the man's paper bags which contained various items sold by the convention vendors; due to being surprised and disoriented, he could not immediately locate his receipts. The officers made him sit on a chair in the hallway until the police arrived 20 minutes later. The man later produced receipts for the items and was released. He sued the hotel for the tort of false imprisonment. Will the court allow the case to go to the jury?\n\nA. No, there was probable cause for an arrest and there can therefore be no false imprisonment.\nB. No, the failure to immediately provide receipts gave the security personnel justification to confine him.\nC. Yes, when one is told to sit in one place until further notice that is always false imprisonment.\nD. Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established \u0080\u0093 there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.\n"

Yes, the elements of false imprisonment are sufficiently established - there was an intentional illegal confinement that caused harm.\n\nFalse imprisonment occurs when someone is confined or restrained against their will by another person without lawful authority. In this case, the man was arrested by security officers who claimed they had evidence that he had stolen from the convention vendors. The officers then detained him and seized his belongings, including his papers containing receipts for the items he purchased.\n\nWhile it may seem like the man was given time to produce receipts, the fact that he was told to sit on a chair in the hallway until the police arrived suggests that he was not free to leave. This is sufficient to establish that the man was confined against his will, even if there was some confusion about what happened next.\n\nTherefore, the court would likely allow the case to proceed to the jury, as the elements of false imprisonment have been met."
