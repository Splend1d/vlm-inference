This reaction is typically involved in regulating cellular processes such as cell growth, cell division, and signal transduction pathways. Kinases can be classified into different types based on their specificity for specific substrates and the type of phosphate group they add, but generally, they all require ATP (adenosine triphosphate) as a source of energy to drive the reaction."
