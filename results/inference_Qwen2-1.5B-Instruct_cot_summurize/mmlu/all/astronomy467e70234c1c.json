                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices which sublimate into an atmosphere near perihelion.\n\nPluto has a very thin atmosphere made mostly of nitrogen (79%) and methane (15%). The rest of the atmosphere consists of carbon monoxide (3%), argon (2%), neon (1%), krypton (1%), and xenon (1%).\n\nThese gases form a stable layer at the surface due to their low boiling points, allowing them to remain liquid on Pluto's icy surface. When the temperature rises above the freezing point, these gases sublimate or \"freeze out\" of the surface, forming clouds and other atmospheric features.\n\nIt's important to note that while Pluto's surface is indeed covered in ice, it's not primarily composed of water ice. Water ice is only present in certain regions of Pluto's north polar cap, where temperatures are high enough for the ice to melt and then re-freeze when the temperature drops again."
