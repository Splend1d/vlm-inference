However, it does not directly regulate respiration on its own. \n\nAn increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood, a decrease in the amount of oxygen in the blood, and a decrease in the plasma pH level all play important roles in regulating respiration. Therefore, options A, B, and C are all relevant factors that affect respiration in humans."
