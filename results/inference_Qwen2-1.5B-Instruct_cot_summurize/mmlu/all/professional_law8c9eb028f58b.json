The state adopted the so-called \"disaffiliation\" statute in order to have intraparty feuds resolved in primary elections rather than in the general election. Moreover, the state's elections director strongly supported the law and argued that it was necessary to avoid voter confusion and to ensure that the general election winner received a majority. A man, who was a registered Democrat in 2008, now wishes to run as an independent candidate in the November, 2009, general election. However, the elections director ruled that his candidacy violated the state's \"disaffiliation\" statute and barred him from appearing on the ballot. If the man files suit in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state's election statute, which of the following best states the burden of persuasion?\n\nA. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further an important state interest under equal protection analysis.\nB. The state must demonstrate that the law is necessary to further a compelling state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\nC. The man must demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to any legitimate state interest under fundamental rights analysis.\nD. The man must demonstrate under fundamental rights analysis that the state has less restrictive alternative means available for independent candidates to get a ballot position.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D: The man must demonstrate under fundamental rights analysis that the state has less restrictive alternative means available for independent candidates to get a ballot position.\n\nThis is because the man is challenging the constitutionality of the state's election statute, specifically the \"disaffiliation\" statute, which prohibits a person from being an independent candidate in a general election if they had either registered with a political party during the year prior to the immediately preceding primary, or voted in that primary. The man argues that this statute violates his fundamental right to vote as an independent candidate.\n\nUnder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the government may not deny to any citizen the equal protection of the laws. This clause requires that laws be applied equally to all persons without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In this case, the man argues that the disaffiliation statute discriminates against him based on his political beliefs, which is a violation of his fundamental right to vote independently.\n\nTherefore, the man must demonstrate that the state has less restrictive alternative means available for independent candidates to get a ballot position before he can succeed in his challenge. This means that the state must show that there are other ways for independent candidates to get a ballot position that do not involve violating their fundamental rights."
