Since the temperature remains constant, the volume change corresponds to a decrease in the number of moles by the same factor as the volume change:\n\n\u0394n = V_new/V_old = 5 cm^3 / 20 cm^3 = 1/4\n\nSo, the new number of moles is:\n\nn_new = n + \u0394n\nn_new = 6.469 \u00d7 10^-2 mol + (1/4) \u00d7 6.469 \u00d7 10^-2 mol\nn_new = 6.469 \u00d7 10^-2 mol + 1.617 \u00d7 10^-2 mol\nn_new = 8.086 \u00d7 10^-2 mol\n\nUsing the ideal gas law again, but now with the new number of moles:\n\nPV = nRT\nP = (n_new * R * T) / V\n\nWe already know that n_new = 8.086 \u00d7 10^-2 mol, R = 8.314 J/(mol*K), and T = 298 K.\n\nP = ((8.086 \u00d7 10^-2 mol * 8.314 J/(mol*K) * 298 K) / 2e-3 m^3)\nP \u2248 8 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 8 \u00d7 10^5 Pa."
