The subjects are randomly assigned to either the exercise group or the control group, which helps to ensure that any differences in resting heart rate observed between these groups are due to exercise rather than other factors such as age, gender, or pre-existing health conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is A. An experiment with a control group and blinding."
