It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nThe tone of the journal best reflects which of the following developments in the Indian Ocean trade network?\n\nA. The ability of commerce to foster cultural diffusion\nB. The superiority of Arabian port cities\nC. The increasing difficulty caused by language barriers\nD. The overproduction of cash crops\n"

The ability of commerce to foster cultural diffusion\n\nThe passage describes the port of Aden, which was an important hub for trade between the Indian Ocean region and the Middle East. The description of the port's location and the variety of goods traded there suggests that it facilitated cultural exchange and interaction among traders from different regions. The fact that the passage also mentions the presence of Indian and Egyptian merchants, along with the wealth and generosity of some merchants, further supports the idea that trade played a role in cultural diffusion."
