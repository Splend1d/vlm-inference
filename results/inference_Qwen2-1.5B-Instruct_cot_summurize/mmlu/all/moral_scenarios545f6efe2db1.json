This action goes against the principle of not harming others and promoting safety and responsibility.\nOn the other hand, the main character who used \"I\" in Scenario 2 is not doing anything clearly morally wrong because they are simply performing their job responsibilities by stirring the drink for the customer. This action promotes hospitality and service excellence, but it does not go against any moral or ethical principles.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
