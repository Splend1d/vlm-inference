They are particularly popular in Europe due to their high nutritional value, ease of storage and preparation, and versatility in cooking. While rice and squash also played important roles in European agriculture, they did not contribute as significantly to the region's overall agricultural output as potatoes did. Beans were also grown in South America but did not play a major role in Europe until later."
