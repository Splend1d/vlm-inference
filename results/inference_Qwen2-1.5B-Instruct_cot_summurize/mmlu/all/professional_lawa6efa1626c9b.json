In 2002, Goodboy Beverages purchased Daylight's deluxe cutting press model for $20,000. In 2002 and 2003, Daylight received a few complaints that other cutting press customers had experienced hazardous malfunctions. In response, Daylight created a safety device and offered it for $5,000 in a brochure sent to all their customers that mentioned that a few users had been injured in using the cutting press model. Goodboy received the brochure, but did not buy a $5,000 safety device. In 2004, a Goodboy worker was injured by the press. At trial, Daylight argued that if Goodboy had purchased the safety device the injury would not have occurred, and moved for a directed verdict. The court should\n\nA. Grant Daystar's motion, because Goodboy's refusal to purchase the safety device was an effective assumption of risk.\nB. Deny the motion, because Goodboy's negligence in failing to purchase the safety device was less than Daylight's negligence in manufacturing the unsafe press initially.\nC. Deny the motion, because a jury could find that Daylight could reasonably foresee that Goodboy would be unwilling to pay $5,000 for a safety device.\nD. Deny the motion, because since the press was inherently dangerous, Daylight was strictly liable.\n"

Deny the motion, because since the press was inherently dangerous, Daylight was strictly liable.\n\nIn this scenario, Daylight Corp. is held strictly liable for any injuries caused by the steel cutting press they manufactured, assembled, and marketed. This means that even if Daylight Corp. did not intend for the press to cause harm or knew about potential hazards, they cannot escape liability simply because the press was not designed with the specific intention of causing harm."
