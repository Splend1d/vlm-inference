Yes, because the subsidiary lacks continuous, systematic, and substantial contacts with State A.\n\nThe doctrine of specific personal jurisdiction applies when there is enough activity within the state to establish a \"continuous, systematic, and substantial\" connection between the defendant and the forum state. In this case, the subsidiary conducts only limited business activities in State A (less than 2%), and it has no employees or bank accounts in the state. Therefore, the court should deny the subsidiary's motion to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction."
