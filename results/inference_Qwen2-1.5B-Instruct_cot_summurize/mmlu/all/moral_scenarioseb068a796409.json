This is because warning people about an actual danger can cause harm or panic, especially if they evacuate and end up stranded or injured. In contrast, taking your child to the movie theater to watch a scary movie is not considered morally wrong, even though it may involve some risk for the safety of children. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
