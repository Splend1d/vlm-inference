In other words, it's a way of measuring how quickly a function grows without actually computing its value at any specific point.\n\nOut of the options given:\n\n- A. O(1) - This is not an asymptotic notation.\n- B. O(n) - This means that the function grows faster than linearly but slower than quadratically.\n- C. O(n^2) - This means that the function grows faster than quadratically (but still less than linearly).\n- D. O(log n) - This means that the function grows faster than logarithmically but slower than exponentially.\n\nTherefore, the smallest asymptotic notation among these choices is:\n\nD. O(log n)"
