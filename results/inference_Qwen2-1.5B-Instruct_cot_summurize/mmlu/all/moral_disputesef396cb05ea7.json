There may be other factors at play that make a particular practice more harmful or risky than others. For example, some practices may have higher rates of transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared to others, even though they are considered safer by traditional standards. In such cases, it would be incorrect to assume that the practice is inherently immoral or imprudent simply because it is safer than alternative options.\n\nTherefore, option B, which suggests that if a practice is risker than the alternatives, then that practice is immoral, imprudent, or otherwise to be avoided, is not a valid argument against homosexuality based on harm. Option A and C are also incorrect as they suggest that practices should only be pursued if they are less risky than alternatives, which could lead to further risks in some cases. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. None of the above."
