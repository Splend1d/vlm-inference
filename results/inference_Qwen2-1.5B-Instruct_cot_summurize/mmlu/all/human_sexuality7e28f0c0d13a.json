In some cases, these behaviors may have evolved in response to novel sexual stimuli, which could make males more attractive to potential partners and thus increase their chances of survival and reproduction.\n\nIt's worth noting that this theory does not explain why all individuals develop paraphilic behaviors, but rather only explains how they might have arisen. There are many other factors that can influence an individual's development of paraphilic behavior, including genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and psychological factors."
