Similarly, let's denote the degree of $g(x)$ as $m = 3$, so we can write $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$.\n\nNow, let's consider the expression $f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x))$. We know that the degree of $f(g(x))$ is $n = 6$, which means that it has terms of the form $a_6x^{6k}$ for some integer $k$. The term in $g(h(x))$ comes from substituting $x=h(x)$ into $g(x)$, so its degree is $3(m+1)=9$. Finally, the degree of $h(f(x))$ is $n=6$ (since $f(x)$ has this degree). Therefore, the sum of these three terms is a polynomial of degree $6 + 9 + 6 = 21$.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the resulting polynomial has degree $36$. This means that there must be another term in the expression that adds up to make a total of $36$. Since the highest degree term in $f(x)$ is $x^6$, the only way to achieve this degree is if the term in $h(f(x))$ is of the form $b_0x^6$. This gives us an additional factor of $x^6$ in the sum, making the total degree $21 + 6 + x^6 = 36$.\n\nTherefore, the degree of $h(x)$ is $\\boxed{12}$."
