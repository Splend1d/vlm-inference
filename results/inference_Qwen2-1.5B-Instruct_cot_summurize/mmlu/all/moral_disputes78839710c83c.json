                    "text": "The Marquis' argument for not killing a fetus based on moral or ethical principles, particularly regarding abortion and the treatment of human life in general, often revolves around the idea that every person has inherent worth and dignity from conception until death. This perspective emphasizes the concept of \"personhood,\" which suggests that each individual should be considered a living being with rights and responsibilities regardless of their age, size, or stage of development.\n\nOption A (the fetus can feel pain) is also a key factor in this discussion, as many argue that denying someone's right to live simply because they cannot experience pain contradicts fundamental human rights principles. \n\nOption B (abortion will harm the woman) might also be considered, but it is typically less common among those who advocate against abortion due to its potential emotional and physical effects on the mother.\n\nOption C (killing the fetus would deprive it of a valuable future) is a more nuanced argument, suggesting that while some may view abortion as necessary to prevent harm to the mother or society at large, others believe that the fetus deserves a chance to grow up and contribute positively to society.\n\nIn summary, the Marquis likely believes that the primary reasons why it is wrong to kill a fetus include the intrinsic value and worth of human life from conception, the possibility of pain experienced by fetuses during pregnancy, and the belief that each person deserves a chance to live. These arguments suggest that the act of abortion goes beyond mere medical necessity or personal autonomy; it is seen as an infringement on the rights and dignity of the unborn child."
