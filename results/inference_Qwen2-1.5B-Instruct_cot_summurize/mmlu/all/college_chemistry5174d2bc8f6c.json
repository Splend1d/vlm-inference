Most organic functional groups absorb in a characteristic region of the IR spectrum.\n\nInfrared (IR) spectroscopy is a technique used to study the vibrational motions of molecules, including their chemical structures. The key advantage of IR spectroscopy over other methods like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or mass spectrometry is that it allows the determination of the chemical structure of a molecule without the need for fragmentation. This makes IR spectroscopy particularly useful for analyzing small molecules and compounds with complex structures.\n\nMost organic functional groups have specific vibrational frequencies associated with them, which correspond to particular transitions between different electronic states within the molecule. These vibrations can be observed in the IR spectrum as distinct peaks. For example, the stretching modes of carbon-carbon double bonds typically result in absorption bands centered around 1650-2700 cm\u207b\u00b9, while the bending modes of hydrogen-bonded groups often appear in the 3400-3900 cm\u207b\u00b9 range. By comparing these peaks to known standards, one can determine the presence and identity of functional groups present in a sample.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct, as it accurately describes how infrared spectroscopy utilizes the characteristic regions of the IR spectrum to identify specific organic functional groups."
