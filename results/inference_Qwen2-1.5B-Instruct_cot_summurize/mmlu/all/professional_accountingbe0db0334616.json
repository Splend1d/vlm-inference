This is because it represents the change in fair value of the asset, not the cash flow that would be recognized in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nGiven that Cooley has an unrealized gain of $100,000 on its available-for-sale debt investment, this amount should be reported in OCI, not in net income or other comprehensive income. Therefore, option D is correct. The gain should be reported in OCI:\n\n- Other Comprehensive Income: $100,000\n\nThis means that Cooley will report a decrease in retained earnings by $100,000 and no change to OCI ($100,000)."
