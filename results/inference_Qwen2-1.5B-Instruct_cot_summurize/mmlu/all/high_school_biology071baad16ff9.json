Evolution occurs through genetic changes that occur at the level of the individual organism (individuals). However, these changes can be passed on to future generations within the same species if they have a favorable effect on survival and reproduction. This means that the gene pool within a population is important for the evolution of the species as a whole, even though each individual is subject to natural selection and other factors. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
