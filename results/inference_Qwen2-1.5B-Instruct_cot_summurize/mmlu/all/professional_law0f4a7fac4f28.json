The contract has many clauses, including one that prohibits generally the assignment of the contract or any of its terms. The distributor assigns its right to receive the funds anyway. Will a court enforce the bar against assignment under these circumstances?\n\nA. No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated.\nB. No, a bar of assignment is an unconstitutional deprivation of due process.\nC. Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable in all respects.\nD. Yes, a bar against the right to receive proceeds is a favored restriction unless otherwise stated.\n"

No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated.\n\nWhile a bar of assignment can be enforced if it is clearly and unambiguously stated in the contract, it cannot be enforced if it is implied or assumed by the parties' conduct. In this case, the clause prohibiting assignments was included in the contract as part of the agreement between the distributor and the medical treatment center. However, the distributor has chosen to assign its rights to receive the funds without the permission of the other party, which is considered a breach of the contract. Therefore, a court would likely not enforce the bar of assignment in this situation."
