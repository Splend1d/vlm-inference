This process is crucial for many cellular functions, including sugar transport in plants. In the case of transporting sugars into the phloem for transport, it requires ATP to drive the movement of protons and thereby move the sugar molecules across the membrane. The other options (passive, dependent on DNA, and translocating starch) do not accurately describe how this process works in plants."
