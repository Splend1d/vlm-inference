It is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats such as those found in nuts and fish. These foods have been linked to improved brain health and reduced risk of cognitive decline. While the Western diet may also be beneficial for overall health, it has been associated with higher levels of inflammation and oxidative stress, which can contribute to cognitive decline. Therefore, the Mediterranean diet is generally considered to be the healthier option for promoting good cognitive function throughout life."
