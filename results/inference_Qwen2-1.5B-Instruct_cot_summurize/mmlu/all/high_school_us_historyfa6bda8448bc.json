They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom. In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. . . .\n\"It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government.\"\n\u2014Ronald Reagan, First Inaugural Address, January 21, 1981\nThe conservative political revival that led to President Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 held the view that\n\nA. political leaders in the 1960s and 1970s did not do enough to challenge the racial and economic status quo.\nB. the United States had relied too heavily on military solutions and needed to pursue a more isolationist foreign policy.\nC. religious leaders had become too assertive in governmental policy and had blurred the separation of church and state.\nD. liberal laws and court decisions in the 1960s and a general moral decline were undermining the United States.\n"

He believed that the federal government should play a larger role in addressing these problems, rather than relying solely on military solutions or pursuing an isolationist foreign policy."
