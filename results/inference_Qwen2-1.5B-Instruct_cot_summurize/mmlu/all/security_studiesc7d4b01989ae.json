In light of the difficulties Western democracies have - sustaining popular support in conflicts not threatening their vital interests - opponents will regard Western threats to fight a prolonged war in such a scenario as a bluff. In practice this means that the coercer must be militarily superior and capable of denying their opponent the ability to realize their agenda and impose costs that directly threaten their interests.\nB. To maximize credibility a threat of quick defeat backed by the required military capability is insufficient. A deadline of compliance must accompany it. It follows that a failure to set a deadline for compliance will be interrelated as evidence that the coercer lacks the will to implement the threat.\nC. Assurance against new demands must be included to enhance the prospects of success. The incentive to comply will be significantly reduced if fears are justifiably present.\nD. All of these options. To make non-compliance too costly the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary to deny him his objectives quickly and with little costs. The threat is designed to accomplish two things: fear of unacceptable escalation; to make the threat credible.\n"

                    "text": "The Ideal Policy framework provides a comprehensive explanation of how previous understandings of the necessary conditions for successful coercive diplomacy actions can be understood. According to this framework, there are several key factors that must be taken into account when planning and executing coercive diplomacy actions:\n\n1. Military Superiority: A coercer must possess superior military capabilities to deter potential adversaries from challenging its authority or imposing costs on its interests.\n\n2. Credibility: A credible threat requires both a realistic assessment of one's own capabilities and a clear understanding of the consequences of non-compliance. A threat that is perceived as weak or uncertain is less likely to be effective.\n\n3. Timeliness: A deadline for compliance must be set, along with assurance that non-compliance will result in unacceptable consequences. Failure to adhere to this timeline may undermine the coercer's credibility and make it more difficult to achieve desired outcomes.\n\n4. Assurance Against New Demands: The coercer must also ensure that non-compliance will be met with significant costs, which will discourage future attempts at aggression. This ensures that the coercer has an incentive to maintain its position and prevent further conflict.\n\n5. Cost-Benefit Analysis: The coercer must carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of each action and decision, ensuring that they align with the strategic goals of the coercing state.\n\nBy considering these factors, policymakers can develop a more nuanced understanding of the necessary conditions for successful coercive diplomacy actions and develop more effective strategies to address complex international challenges."
