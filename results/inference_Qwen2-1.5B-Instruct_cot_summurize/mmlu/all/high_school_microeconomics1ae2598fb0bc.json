Air\n\nAir provides the largest total utility because it satisfies all of our basic needs, such as breathing, while also providing us with other benefits such as oxygen and clean air for outdoor activities. Additionally, air has no negative externalities that would decrease its value.\n\nHowever, air does not have any marginal utility since it is consumed in infinite quantities without diminishing returns. Therefore, the marginal utility per unit of air is zero. This means that we cannot improve the satisfaction from consuming more units of air, which is why it is considered to be the most valuable good among the given options."
