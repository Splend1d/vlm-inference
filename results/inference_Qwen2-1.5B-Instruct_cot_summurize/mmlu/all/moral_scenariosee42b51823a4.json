This action goes against the principles of compassion and respect for life, which are commonly accepted as morally right or good. Therefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong. \n\nIn scenario 2, the decision to dam the river is not necessarily morally wrong if it is done with the intention of benefiting the environment or society in some way. However, if the damming causes significant damage to the ecosystem or leads to negative consequences for nearby communities, then the action may be considered morally wrong. So, while there is no clear indication that scenario 2 involves any wrongdoing, it depends on the specific circumstances and intentions behind the damming. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
