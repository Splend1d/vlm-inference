Happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust.\n\nCross-cultural studies have indeed shown that these six facial expressions are universally recognized across different cultures. However, it's important to note that cultural context can influence how these expressions are interpreted or communicated. For example, in some cultures, happiness may be expressed through smiling rather than frowning, while in others, it might involve a more open expression of emotions. Similarly, other facial expressions like surprise or disgust may vary depending on cultural norms and social interactions."
