Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the \"stick\" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.\nB. Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.\nC. In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.\nD. Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.\n"

                    "text": "The problem with defining coercive diplomacy success is that it relies heavily on subjective judgments about what constitutes success. The definition of \"success\" in this context is based on the idea that the threat of force or limited use of force must be used in order to achieve compliance. However, this assumption may not always hold true, especially in cases where other methods of persuasion and negotiation may be more effective.\n\nFurthermore, the definition of success also depends on the specific goals of the government involved. For example, if the government's goal is to gain control over another country or territory, then the use of force may be seen as necessary. On the other hand, if the goal is to resolve a dispute peacefully, then less drastic measures such as economic sanctions may be more appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the definition of success may also depend on the political context of the situation. In some cases, the use of force may be seen as necessary to protect human rights or democracy, while in others it may be seen as unnecessary.\n\nFinally, the definition of success may also depend on the specific tactics used during the negotiation process. For example, using threats and sanctions may be seen as successful if they lead to a temporary halt in the conflict, while using limited force may be seen as successful if it leads to a long-term resolution of the issue."
