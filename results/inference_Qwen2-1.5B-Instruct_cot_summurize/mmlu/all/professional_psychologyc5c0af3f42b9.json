They are calculated using the formula z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where X is the individual's raw score, \u03bc is the population mean, and \u03c3 is the population standard deviation.\n\nSD stands for Standard Deviation, which is another measure of variability used in statistics. It represents the average distance between each data point and the mean of a dataset.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect because it refers to raw scores stated in SD terms instead of Z-Scores. The other options, B, C, and D, are all correct statements about the interpretation of Z-Scores."
