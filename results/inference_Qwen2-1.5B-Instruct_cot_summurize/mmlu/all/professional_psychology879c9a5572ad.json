These Z-scores represent the number of standard deviations an individual's raw score is from the mean of their respective test. Therefore, option A correctly states that a score of +1.0 on a T-score indicates it is 1 SD above the mean.\n\nOption B refers to the T-score on the MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory), not a standard score. Option C is incorrect because it does not mention SDs at all; instead, it talks about the range of the test being from 4 to 8. Option D also refers to the T-score on the MMPI, not a standard score.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement out of these options is:\n\nA.
