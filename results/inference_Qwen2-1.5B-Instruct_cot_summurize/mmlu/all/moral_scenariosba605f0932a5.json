This behavior goes against the principle of respect for others' feelings and can be considered morally wrong. In scenario 2, there is no clear indication that the main character did anything morally wrong, as they were simply playing a game and did not intend to harm anyone. However, hitting the ball at home plate could be seen as an aggressive or violent act depending on the context and the audience."
