It advertised that anyone who purchased the car in 2013 and did not get at least 50 miles per gallon average gas mileage during the first 60 days, would receive a payment of $10,000 cash from the company. Record-keeping and inspection procedures were required to assure accurate reporting by the vehicle owner. The promotion was widely publicized. A female customer purchased a hybrid model during the promotion period, followed all the rules, and recorded only 42 mpg in the first 60 days. She demanded the rebate but the company stalled for months and then stopped responding to her inquiries. Does she have a contractual right to collect the $10,000?\n\nA. Yes, because this is a classic bilateral contract, making it necessary that the company live up to its set of promises made to her.\nB. No, this was merely puffing, was not an offer to contract with any particular person and was without consideration.\nC. Yes, this was a unilateral contract in which the offeree acted upon the offer by performing the terms of the offer, thus creating a binding contract.\nD. No, because she did not formally notify the company that she was accepting the offer before she started performing.\n"

No, because she did not formally notify the company that she was accepting the offer before she started performing.\n\nIn order to create a binding contract, both parties must agree to the terms and conditions of the agreement. In this case, the company agreed to pay the customer $10,000 if they met certain criteria, while the customer accepted these terms and began performing them (i.e., recording only 42 mpg in the first 60 days).\n\nHowever, once the customer started performing the terms of the offer, such as recording the specific number of miles per gallon, they no longer had the power to change or withdraw their acceptance of the offer. Therefore, the customer cannot demand the refund of the $10,000 under any circumstances."
