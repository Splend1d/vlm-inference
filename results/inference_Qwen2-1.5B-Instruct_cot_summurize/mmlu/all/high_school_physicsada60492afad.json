First, we need to convert the capacitance from microfarads to farads because the units for the potential difference do not match up directly. \n\n1 \u03bcF = 1 x 10^-6 F = 1 x 10^-9 F\n\nSo,\n\nQ = 1 x 10^-9 F * 100 V = 0.01 C\n\nNow, plugging these values into our equation gives us:\n\nWork = 0.01 C * 100 V = 1 J\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 0.1 J."
