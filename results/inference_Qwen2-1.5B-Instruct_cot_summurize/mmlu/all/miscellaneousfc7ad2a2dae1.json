This is because the goal of a profit-maximizing firm is to maximize profits, which can only be achieved by producing at a level where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC), but also where MR > MC, and total revenue (TR) > TR - TVC, where TVC is total variable costs and TR is total revenue.\n\nTherefore, a profit-maximizing firm will continue to produce as long as MR > MC, and TR > TR - TVC. If the firm's marginal revenue (MR) is greater than its marginal cost (MC), then the firm should continue to produce until MR = MC or until total revenue (TR) begins to decrease relative to total variable cost (TVC). However, if MR < MC, then the firm should stop producing immediately, as continuing to do so would result in losses."
