The procedure is to obtain a random sample of principals from each of the districts rather than grouping all the lists together and obtaining a sample from the entire group. Which of the following is a correct conclusion?\n\nA. This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.\nB. This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.\nC. This is an example of systematic sampling, which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.\nD. This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n"

They ensure that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample, making them unbiased and efficient ways to collect data. In contrast, stratified sampling involves dividing the population into strata (groups) based on characteristics such as age, gender, or education level, then choosing individuals within each stratum at random. Cluster sampling divides the population into clusters, which are homogeneous groups, and selects one representative from each cluster. Systematic sampling involves systematically selecting items from a larger dataset."
