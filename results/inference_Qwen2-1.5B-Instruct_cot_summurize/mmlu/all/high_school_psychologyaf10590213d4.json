Magnitude of the resting potential: The resting potential of the receptor membrane is not mentioned in the options provided.\n2. Ions involved in their action potentials: The receptors in the retina transmit light signals to the brain through ion channels, while the receptors in the cochlea transmit sound vibrations to the brain through ion channels. Therefore, the ions involved in their action potentials are different.\n3. Types of energy they transduce: The receptors in the retina transduce light into electrical signals, while the receptors in the cochlea transduce sound into electrical signals. Therefore, the type of energy they transduce is different.\n4. Number of axons each cell possesses: The receptors in the retina have only one axon, while the receptors in the cochlea have multiple axons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. types of energy they transduce."
