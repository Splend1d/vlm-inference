Protons have positive charges, neutrons do not have a charge, and electrons carry negative charges. Electrons are distributed throughout an atom's nucleus and orbit around the atomic nucleus, but they do not contribute to the total mass of the atom itself. Therefore, less than 1/1000 of the mass of any atom is contributed by electrons or protons."
