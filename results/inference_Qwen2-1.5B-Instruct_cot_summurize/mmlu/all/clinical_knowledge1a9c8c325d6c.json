Any patient who is acutely unwell pre-operatively or post-operatively and those who have undergone major surgery.\n\nAn Early Warning Score (EWS) is used to assess the severity of a patient's condition and identify potential complications or adverse events that may require immediate intervention. It is typically used in hospitals, but can also be used in other settings such as clinics or emergency departments. The EWS is based on a set of predefined criteria for identifying patients who are at high risk of developing serious illness or death. These criteria include changes in vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms. Patients who meet these criteria are considered to be at high risk and may need to be closely monitored and evaluated by healthcare professionals."
