Adaptation is fully accounted for in the design of nitrogen balance studies.\nB. The adaptive metabolic demand means that the slope of N-balance studies underestimates the efficiency of protein utilization\nC. Variable adaptation between different N-balance studies is fully accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD\nD.

Variable adaptation between different N-balance studies is fully accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD\n\nIn other words, the difference in the amount of protein required due to variable adaptation between different N-balance studies (EAR + 2 SD) is used to determine the safe individual protein requirement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C."
