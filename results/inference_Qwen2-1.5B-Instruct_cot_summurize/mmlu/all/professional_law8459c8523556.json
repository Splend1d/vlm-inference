The defendant approached the bank teller, pointed her unloaded pistol at him and said, \"This is a stick-up. . . give me your money and no one will get hurt. \"While the teller was handing the money to the defendant, the victim, a bank patron who was in line, saw the defendant pointing the gun at the teller and fainted. He fell backward and cracked his head on the marble floor. This resulted in a fatal head injury. Moments later, the defendant left the bank with the money. Thereafter, the defendant was arrested.

This jurisdiction has adopted the Redline limitation to the felony murder rule.\n\nRedline refers to a principle of criminal law that holds that a person cannot be charged with felony murder if they were not the actual perpetrator of the underlying felony that led to the death. In other words, the person must have had no involvement in the killing itself, even if their actions contributed to its occurrence.\n\nIn this case, the defendant robbed a bank but did not actually kill anyone. However, she used an unloaded gun, which could potentially cause harm or death if it were discharged accidentally. Therefore, under the Redline limitation, the defendant would not be held liable for felony murder if she had no involvement in the killing itself, even if her actions contributed to its occurrence."
