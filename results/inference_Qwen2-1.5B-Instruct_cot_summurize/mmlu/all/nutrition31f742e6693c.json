Research focused on the problems of poor farmers and consumers is a 'public good' with little profit potential but high social benefits; public investment is needed to support it.\n\nAgricultural research plays a crucial role in reducing hunger and poverty by providing new technologies, techniques, and knowledge that can increase crop yields, improve soil health, and enhance food security. This research often targets small-scale farmers who may not have access to advanced equipment or training, making them vulnerable to food shortages and poverty.\n\nB. Agricultural research mainly benefits commercial farmers in developed countries is incorrect because this type of research tends to focus on improving productivity and efficiency for large-scale farms, rather than addressing the needs of small-scale farmers.\n\nD. Pro-poor research should only focus on organic farming is also incorrect. While organic farming can be beneficial for certain conditions, such as those in developing countries where land is scarce and chemical-intensive farming practices can harm the environment, pro-poor research should aim to provide solutions that benefit all farmers, regardless of their specific farming methods.\n\nIn summary, agriculture research should prioritize benefiting poor farmers and consumers, especially in developing countries, through research that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Public investment in this area is essential to ensure that everyone has access to nutritious food and can participate in sustainable agricultural practices."
