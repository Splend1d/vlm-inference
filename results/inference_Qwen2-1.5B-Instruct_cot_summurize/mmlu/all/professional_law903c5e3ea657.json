This search is known as a \"search incident to custody.\" In this case, Officer saw Stan running out of the liquor store and pursued him until he pulled over. Officer then searched the trunk of the car, finding cash and a baseball bat. \n\nStan argues that the cash and baseball bat should not be considered evidence because the search of the trunk was conducted outside of the reasonable time after the arrest, which violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment. However, the court would likely agree with Officer's argument that the search of the trunk was justified by the fact that Stan was arrested based on probable cause, which gave Officer the right to conduct a search incident to custody. Therefore, the cash and baseball bat would be admissible as evidence against Stan."
