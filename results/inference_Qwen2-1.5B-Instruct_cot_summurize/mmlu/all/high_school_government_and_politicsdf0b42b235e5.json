Women are more likely to vote Democratic than are men.\n\nResearch has shown that women tend to vote more consistently with their party and be more likely to vote in elections compared to men. However, this does not necessarily mean that women are more likely to vote for a particular political party over another. Additionally, there may be other factors influencing voting behavior beyond gender, such as age, education level, or personal beliefs. Therefore, it's possible that some women may still prefer to vote for the same candidates as their male counterparts, even if they have different views on certain issues."
