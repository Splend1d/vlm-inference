Since the curve $y = x^2$ lies above $y = x$, we integrate from $x = 0$ to $x = 1$. This gives us:\n\n\\[V = \\pi\\int_{0}^{1}(x - x^2)\\,dx\\]\n\nNow, we calculate this definite integral:\n\n\\[V = \\pi\\left[\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_0^1 = \\pi\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 0\\right) = \\pi\\cdot\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. \u03c0/3**."
