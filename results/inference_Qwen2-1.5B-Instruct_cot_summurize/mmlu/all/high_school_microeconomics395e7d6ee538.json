                    "text": "All statements are correct, but let's break them down:\n\n1. **TC = (AVC + AFC)Q**  \nThis equation represents the total cost function and it shows that total cost equals the sum of average variable costs (AVC) and average fixed costs (AFC). This relationship holds true for any level of production.\n\n2. **TFC = TC at all levels of output**  \nThe marginal cost (MC) does not equal total cost (TC), as stated in statement D. The marginal cost curve starts from zero at output 0 and increases up to the point where marginal revenue begins to exceed marginal cost (MR > MC), after which marginal cost begins to decrease. At some point, MC will reach a minimum, and then start decreasing again. Therefore, the marginal cost (MC) does not equal total cost (TC).\n\n3. **AVC + AFC = TC**  \nThis equation represents the relationship between average variable costs, average fixed costs, and total cost. It shows that average variable costs plus average fixed costs equals total cost.\n\n4. **MC = TC - TFC**  \nThis equation represents the relationship between marginal cost and total cost. It states that marginal cost equals total cost minus average fixed cost. This is a common formula used to calculate marginal cost in economics.\n\nIn summary:\n- A is true because the total cost function correctly shows the relationship between total cost and quantity produced.\n- B is false because the marginal cost curve starts at zero and decreases as output increases.\n- C is false because the relationship between average variable costs, average fixed costs, and total cost is represented by the first equation, not the second.\n- D is true because the marginal cost equals total cost minus average fixed cost, as stated in the fourth equation."
