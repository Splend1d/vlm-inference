However, if we assume that inflation is not an issue (i.e., we are assuming that the purchasing power of money remains constant), then doubling real GDP per capita would require a growth rate of approximately 50 percent per year.\n\nGiven that the growth rate is currently only 10 percent per year, it would likely take many more years for real GDP per capita to double. Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. 8 years."
