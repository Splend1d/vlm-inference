The closest integer value to 407/9 that also results in a whole number is 49 (since \\(49 \\div 9 = 5\\) and \\(5 \\times 9 = 45\\)), but since we want the smallest positive integer solution, it's actually 5 (because if you multiply 9 by 5 you get 45).\n\nThus, \\(8^{\\frac{407}{9}} = 8^{\\frac{5}{9}}\\). \n\nWe need to find the largest integer \\(n\\) such that \\(8^n < 1000\\). Since \\(8^{5}\\) is already greater than 1000, we look for the next smaller power of 8 that is less than 1000. This happens after \\(8^6\\), because \\(8^6 = 262144\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(8^{\\frac{5}{9}} = 8^{\\frac{6}{9}} = 8^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\). \n\nThis means that 8 squared (which is 64) is slightly larger than 1000, but not quite enough yet. To make sure it fits within the constraints, we need to find the next lower power of 8 that will bring us closer to 1000.\n\nCalculating \\(8^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\) directly is not straightforward without a calculator, but it should be close to 1000 given the constraints. Let's estimate:\n\n\\[ 8^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\approx 8^{\\frac{6}{9}} = 8^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\]\n\nSince \\(8^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\) is approximately 1000, and we're looking for something less than 1000, the next step is to round down to the nearest multiple of 8 that is greater than 1000, which is 964.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer \\(n\\) satisfying \\(8^n > 964\\) is \\(8^5\\), as \\(8^5 = 32768\\) and \\(8^6 = 262144\\), and \\(262144 > 964\\).\n\nSo, rounding up from \\(8^5\\) to \\(8^6\\) brings us very close to 1000, but not exactly. We need to continue rounding up until we reach or exceed 1000.\n\nRounding up from \\(8^5\\) to \\(8^6\\) does indeed bring us past 1000, but we need to keep going until we reach exactly 1000, which occurs at \\(8^7\\), as \\(8^7 = 2097152\\).\n\nTherefore, the earliest date at which all people in the town would be infected with the virus is:\n\n\\[ 8^7 = 2097152 \\]\n\nThis means that all 1,000 people would be infected by the 31st day of the month, considering the doubling every 3 days rule. Therefore, the correct answer is C. January 31st."
