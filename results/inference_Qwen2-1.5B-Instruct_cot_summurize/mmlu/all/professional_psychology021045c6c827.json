While Rett's disorder is a condition that affects girls, it does not typically cause behavior issues such as oppositional defiance or conduct disorder in boys. Conduct disorder is more commonly associated with boys and can be caused by factors such as trauma, abuse, or genetic predisposition. It is important for parents to seek professional help if they suspect their child has symptoms of conduct disorder or any other mental health issue."
