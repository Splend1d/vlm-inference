In this case, the lamp is illuminated by the same amount of light as if it were directly above the point where you are standing (since the angle between your eye and the lamp is essentially zero).\n\nGiven that the illumination at a point 5 meters below the lamp is 6 lux, which is equal to 600 lumens per square meter (lumen/m^2), we can use the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Candle Power} = \\frac{\\text{Total Illumination}}{\\text{Area}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- Total Illumination is the total luminous flux (lux) coming into the area.\n- Area is the area of the surface being illuminated (in this case, the 5-meter diameter circle below the lamp).\n\nHowever, since the lamp is illuminated by the same amount of light as if it were directly above the point where you are standing, we can simplify this calculation. Since the area is essentially the same for both cases, we can assume that the lamp illuminates an area of 5 meters squared.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ \\text{Candle Power} = \\frac{600}{5} = 120 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 140."
