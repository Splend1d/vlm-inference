The values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are scaled versions of each other with respect to the angle \\(t\\).\n\nTherefore, for any value of \\(t\\), the distance between two consecutive points on this circle would be equal to the radius of the circle, which is 1. This means that the parametric equations describe a circle with radius 1.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 2\u03c0"
