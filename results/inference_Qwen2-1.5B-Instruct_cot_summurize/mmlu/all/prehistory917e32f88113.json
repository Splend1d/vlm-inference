Associations that can be established between artifacts, ecofacts, and bone.\n\nPedestrian surveys are most useful when they allow researchers to establish connections between different types of finds (artifacts, ecofacts, and bone) that may have been left by the same person or group. These connections can help identify patterns, trends, and possible relationships between the various types of remains found during the excavation process. For example, if a pedestrian survey reveals that there is a high concentration of pottery shards in one area, it may suggest that this area was used as a communal space or storage area for artifacts. Similarly, if a pedestrian survey shows that there is a significant amount of bone fragments in one location, it may indicate that this site had a high number of fatalities or that people were buried there. Establishing these connections through pedestrian surveys can provide valuable insights into the social, cultural, and environmental contexts of ancient human settlements."
