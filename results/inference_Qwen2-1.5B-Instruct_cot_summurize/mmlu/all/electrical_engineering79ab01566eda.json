                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Low resistance when forward biased, while high resistance when reverse bias.\n\nA diode is a type of semiconductor device that allows current to flow in one direction but not the other. When a diode is forward biased (i.e., its terminals are connected to a higher voltage than its internal voltage), it becomes an open circuit and does not conduct any current. This is because the majority carriers (electrons) in the diode are pushed away from the depletion region by the applied voltage, causing the diode to behave like a short circuit. On the other hand, when a diode is reverse biased (i.e., its terminals are connected to a lower voltage than its internal voltage), it acts as a conductor and allows current to flow freely. The current flows in the opposite direction of the applied voltage, which is called the \"polarization\" of the diode. Therefore, the resistance of a diode varies depending on whether it is forward biased or reverse biased."
