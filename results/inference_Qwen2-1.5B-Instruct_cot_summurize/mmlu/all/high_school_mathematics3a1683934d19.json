                    "text": " Let's denote the horizontal length (along the diagonal) as \\(d\\) and the vertical length (along the diagonal) as \\(h\\). According to the problem, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{h} = \\frac{5}{3}\\]\n\nWe want to find out how much shorter the horizontal length is when measured along the diagonal instead of the horizontal length.\n\nThe relationship between the diagonal and the sides of a rectangle can be expressed by Pythagoras' theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. \n\nIn this case, the diagonal (\\(d\\)) is the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the length (horizontal), the height (vertical), and the diagonal itself. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ d^2 = h^2 + l^2 \\]\nwhere \\(l\\) is the length along the horizontal axis.\n\nGiven that the length to height ratio is 5:3, we can express the length along the horizontal axis (\\(l\\)) as:\n\n\\[ l = \\frac{5}{3}h \\]\n\nSubstituting this into our equation for \\(d^2\\):\n\n\\[ d^2 = \\left(\\frac{5}{3}h\\right)^2 + h^2 \\]\n\\[ d^2 = \\frac{25}{9}h^2 + h^2 \\]\n\\[ d^2 = \\frac{34}{9}h^2 \\]\n\nNow, let's substitute back the original ratio for \\(d/h\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{h} = \\frac{5}{3} \\Rightarrow \\frac{\\frac{34}{9}h^2}{h} = \\frac{5}{3} \\Rightarrow \\frac{34}{9}h = \\frac{5}{3}h \\]\n\nSolving for \\(h\\), we get:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{34}{9} \\times \\frac{9}{5} = \\frac{34}{5} \\]\n\nTo find \\(l\\), we use the relationship \\(l = \\frac{5}{3}h\\):\n\n\\[ l = \\frac{5}{3} \\times \\frac{34}{5} = 17 \\]\n\nSo, the horizontal length of the television screen is 17 inches. The difference between the horizontal length measured along the diagonal and the horizontal length measured along the diagonal is:\n\n\\[ 17 - 10 = 7 \\text{ inches} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 7."
