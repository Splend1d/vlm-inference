The lyrics suggest a sense of frustration with the power dynamics between different groups, which aligns with the populist movement's focus on social justice issues. Additionally, the reference to monopolies and political parties suggests a critique of the existing system, which was common among populists. Therefore, option C (a populist newspaper in the 1890s) is the most appropriate answer."
