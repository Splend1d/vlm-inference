The amino acid ornithine is regenerated through the urea cycle, and this process occurs in the same way as the regeneration of oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle. Both processes involve the conversion of one molecule into two or more molecules, with the loss of ATP energy. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Oxaloacetate."
