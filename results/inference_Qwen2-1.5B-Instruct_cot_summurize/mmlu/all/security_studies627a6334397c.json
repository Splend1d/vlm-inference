Historical materialism as a paradigm is opposed to the broad goals of the global justice movement, which advocates an expansion of neo-liberalism in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\nB. Historical materialism has an established history of supporting global justice and opposing inequality; during the Cold War it was the basis of opposition to repressive communist states.\nC. Historical materialism does not provide any unique perspective on capitalism, and is more concerned with the history of capitalist trade than with exploitation or alienation of populations in the system.\nD. Historical materialism can concern both human rights and economic rights. It has been an important part of anti-globalisation and alternative-globalisation movements, including the Occupy protests.\n"

The theory posits that social and political systems are determined by economic structures, and that these structures perpetuate inequality and oppression. This view aligns with some of the goals of the global justice movement, such as advocating for greater economic equality and the elimination of oppressive systems like imperialism and colonialism.\n\nHowever, it's also worth noting that the global justice movement itself is diverse and encompasses various perspectives and ideologies. While historical materialism may have provided a foundational understanding of the world, it doesn't necessarily provide a complete explanation of all aspects of global politics and social issues. Therefore, while it can inform and influence the thinking of those involved in the global justice movement, it's not necessarily the only factor shaping their positions and strategies."
