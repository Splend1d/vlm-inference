                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The pressures of the gases cannot be compared without knowing the number of molecules in each container.\n\nThis is because the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to the number of molecules in the container, but it is not affected by their mass or temperature. Therefore, if one container has more molecules than another, even though both have the same volume, they will have higher pressures. Similarly, if one container has fewer molecules than another, even though both have the same volume, they will have lower pressures. However, this does not necessarily mean that the average kinetic energy of the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas or that the average force exerted on the container by the hydrogen gas is greater than the nitrogen gas. These comparisons would depend on the specific values of the molecular masses and temperatures of the hydrogen and nitrogen gases in each container."
