The level of the sixth cervical vertebra is not high enough to cause significant damage to the spinal cord and affect breathing. However, if there is damage to other parts of the spine or nearby structures, such as the medulla oblongata, which controls respiratory muscles, then breathing may be affected. In this case, life support may be necessary to maintain oxygenation."
