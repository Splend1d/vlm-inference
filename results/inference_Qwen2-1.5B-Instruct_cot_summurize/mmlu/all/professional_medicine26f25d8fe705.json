Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic that can treat bacterial infections in the urinary tract, including those caused by E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial vaginosis and other bacterial infections in women. These medications are effective against the causative organism in this case and can help alleviate the symptoms of the infection. It's important to note that this patient should also receive medical management from a healthcare provider to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment."
