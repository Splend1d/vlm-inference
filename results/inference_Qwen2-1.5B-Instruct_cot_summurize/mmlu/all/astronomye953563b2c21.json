The Moon will be further from the Earth and the Earth's day will be shorter.\n\nThis is because the Sun and planets move around their common center of mass, which is the barycenter, and as the Sun expands due to nuclear fusion, it moves away from the barycenter, causing the distance between the Earth and the Moon to increase. As a result, the Earth's rotation slows down and the length of the day gets shorter. This effect is known as perihelion advance. \n\nSo, while the Moon may appear closer to the Earth than it does today, the Earth's day will actually get shorter over time due to the increased distance between the two celestial bodies."
