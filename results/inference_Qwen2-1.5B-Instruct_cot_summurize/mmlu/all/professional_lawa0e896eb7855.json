The land conveyed to the woman fronted on a public highway. The land retained by the man was landlocked. One year later, the man died intestate, leaving a cousin as his only heir. The cousin visited the man's land for the first time and discovered that it had no access to a public highway. A neighbor who owned adjoining land fronting on the public highway offered to sell the cousin a right to cross the neighbor's land for access to the highway. Although the neighbor's price was reasonable, the cousin rejected the offer. The woman has refused to allow the cousin to cross her land for access to the public highway even though the woman's land is still vacant. The cousin has sued the woman, seeking access across the woman's land to the public highway. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The cousin, based on necessity.\nB. The cousin, because the woman's land is still vacant.\nC. The woman, because the cousin could obtain an alternative access to the highway from the neighbor.\nD. The woman, because the man failed to reserve an easement in his deed to the woman.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The woman, because the man failed to reserve an easement in his deed to the woman.\n\nIn this scenario, the man conveyed the eastern half of a tract of vacant land to the woman by a warranty deed. However, he did not reserve any rights or privileges for the woman to use the landlocked western portion of the tract. This failure to reserve an easement is known as \"failure to convey\". When there is a failure to convey, the landowner retains all rights and interests in the property, including the right to deny access to third parties.\n\nTherefore, when the man died intestate and left a cousin as his sole heir, the cousin would have a right of access to the public highway through the neighbor's land if they can prove that the neighbor has an easement over their land. If the cousin rejects the neighbor's offer, then the cousin will be able to cross the neighbor's land for access to the public highway.\n\nHowever, if the cousin accepts the neighbor's offer and the neighbor sells them the right to cross the neighbor's land, the cousin would be entitled to cross the neighbor's land without needing to get permission from the woman. Therefore, the woman would not be able to prevent the cousin from accessing the public highway through the neighbor's land.\n\nThus, the cousin is more likely to prevail in obtaining access across the woman's land to the public highway."
