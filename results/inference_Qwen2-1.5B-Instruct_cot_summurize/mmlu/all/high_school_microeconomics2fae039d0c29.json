The marginal utility from eating the last cookie is zero.\n\nWhen a consumer stops eating cookies, it means that they have consumed enough cookies to reach their equilibrium point where the marginal utility per unit consumed is zero. At this point, the additional utility gained from consuming another cookie would be offset by the cost associated with doing so (e.g., increased hunger, discomfort, etc.). Therefore, the marginal utility from eating the last cookie is zero."
