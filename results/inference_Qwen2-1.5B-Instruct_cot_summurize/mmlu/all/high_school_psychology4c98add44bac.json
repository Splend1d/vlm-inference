An action potential occurs.\n\nAn action potential is the most fundamental and common type of electrical signal in neurons, which is triggered by the opening of ion channels on the membrane surface of a neuron. When a neuron receives a stimulus, it generates an action potential that propagates along the axon until it reaches the dendrites or synapses. This process is known as synaptic transmission. Once the action potential reaches the cell body, it can trigger other processes such as neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic terminal to the postsynaptic terminal, leading to the release of neurotransmitters that affect other cells in the nervous system."
