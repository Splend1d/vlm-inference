                    "text": "The answer is B. A predominance of gentle slopes. Alluvial landscapes are typically formed where there is a lot of sediment being carried by rivers, which tends to deposit in areas with gentle slopes. However, this does not necessarily mean that the river flow itself is gentle; it can be strong enough to erode the land and create steep slopes over time. So while gentle slopes may contribute to the overall shape of an alluvial landscape, they do not cause it to develop in the first place."
