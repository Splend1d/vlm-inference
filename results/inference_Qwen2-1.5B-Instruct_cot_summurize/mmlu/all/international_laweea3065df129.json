This is because international law is considered to be part of the legal system of each state and its citizens are bound by it. Therefore, if a state fails to comply with its international obligations, it can be held accountable internationally.\n\nHowever, it is possible for a country to rely on its own domestic law as an excuse to violate its obligations under international law. For example, a country may argue that its domestic laws provide a higher priority than its international obligations, or that certain provisions in its constitution override international agreements. However, this argument cannot be used to justify actions that are contrary to international law.\n\nIt is important to note that while domestic law may sometimes play a role in interpreting international law, it does not have the authority to override international agreements. If a country violates its international obligations, it can still face consequences such as sanctions or diplomatic pressure from other states."
