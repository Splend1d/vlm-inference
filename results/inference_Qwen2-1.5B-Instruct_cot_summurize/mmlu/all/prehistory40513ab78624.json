A forest fire burned away the dense vegetation that concealed the cemetery.\n\nThe discovery of the royal cemeteries of the Moche was made possible through archaeological exploration and excavation, rather than any form of natural disaster or human intervention. The Moche civilization thrived on the coastal plains of Peru for over 200 years before their collapse around AD 100. During this time, they built impressive cities with complex irrigation systems and extensive road networks. \n\nIt is believed that during the height of their power, the Moche people buried their elite members in elaborate tombs adorned with intricate carvings and painted murals. However, as the city declined, so did the need for these grand burials, leading to a decline in the size and complexity of the tombs. As a result, many of the royal cemeteries were eventually destroyed or lost to the ravages of time.\n\nOne method of discovering these sites was through aerial photography, which allowed archaeologists to identify areas where there may have been previously unknown burial sites. Another approach involved digging trenches along roads and other routes used by ancient people, hoping to uncover evidence of past settlements. Finally, some of the tombs themselves have been found through direct excavation, often after decades of careful preparation and research.\n\nSo while it's true that a forest fire could have helped reveal some of these hidden cemeteries, it wasn't the primary method used to discover them. Instead, archaeological exploration and excavation played a critical role in uncovering the secrets of the Moche civilization."
