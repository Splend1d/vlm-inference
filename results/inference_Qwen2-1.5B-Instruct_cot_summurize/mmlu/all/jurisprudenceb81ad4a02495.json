The POP will choose to protect the disabled.\n\nIn \"Justice as Fairness,\" John Rawls discusses the principles of justice and argues that a just society should provide for the basic needs of its members, including economic security and protection from harm. He also emphasizes the importance of protecting the rights of individuals and groups, such as the disabled, who may not have the same opportunities as others due to their disabilities or other factors.\n\nRawls suggests that a just society should prioritize the protection of these vulnerable groups and ensure that they are given equal consideration in decision-making processes. This means that the POP should prioritize the protection of the disabled and work towards creating a more equitable and just society overall."
