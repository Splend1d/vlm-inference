If we assume that all scores have increased to at least 75 after earning a 100, the sum of all scores would also increase. However, without knowing the specific scores, it's impossible to say for certain if the mean increases or decreases. For example, if all scores were 76 instead of 75, the mean would still be 76 because there are now 2 scores above 76, but the mean might not increase due to the additional scores being more spread out.\n\n**Statement C: The mean will decrease.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because we've already established that if all scores were 76 instead of 75, the mean would remain the same because there are only two points above 76 and they are evenly distributed among the set.\n\n**Statement D: The median will decrease.**\n\nThe median is the middle value when the data is arranged in order from smallest to largest. If all scores were 76 instead of 75, the median would also remain the same because there are no outliers that could skew the result towards a different median.\n\nTherefore, **none of the statements is true**, as none of them directly addresses how the mean or median would change with an increase in scores beyond 75."
