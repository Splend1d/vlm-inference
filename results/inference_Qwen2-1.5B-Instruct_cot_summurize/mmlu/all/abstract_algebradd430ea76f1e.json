This implies that the ring is finite, because the degree of any polynomial over the field of fractions is bounded by the characteristic of the ring.\n\nThus, while a characteristic p ring may have infinitely many elements, the degree of polynomials defining these elements over the field of fractions is necessarily finite, leading to a finite ring.\n\nThe correct answer is **B. False, False**."
