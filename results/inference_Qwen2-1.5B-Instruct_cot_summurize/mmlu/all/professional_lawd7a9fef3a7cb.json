His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter \"to share and share alike as tenants in common. \"At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. Now, the son claims the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate and brings an action against his sister to quiet title in himself. If the Midwestern states in which the property is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.\nB. The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.\nC. The son, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate.\nD. The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.\n"

The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.\n\nUnder the circumstances described, the son has effectively occupied the estate since 1985, and thus satisfies the statutory requirement for adverse possession under most jurisdictions. Adverse possession requires the possessor to exercise actual, open, notorious, continuous, and hostile possession of the property for a period of 20 years, with certain exceptions for co-tenants who share equally.\n\nIn this case, the daughter shares equally with her brother, so they both have an equal interest in the property. However, the son has exercised the type of occupancy typically associated with the owner of the property, including putting his name on the mailbox and paying the taxes and maintaining the property, indicating that he intends to hold the property as his own without sharing it with his sister.\n\nTherefore, based on the statutory requirements for adverse possession, the son should be granted title to the property, and the daughter would lose her claim to the estate."
