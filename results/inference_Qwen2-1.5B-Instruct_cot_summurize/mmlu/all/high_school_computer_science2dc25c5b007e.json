If the middle element is equal to the target value, we stop the search and return the index of the middle element. Otherwise, if the target value is less than the middle element, we perform the same operation on one half of the list; otherwise, we perform the same operation on the other half.\n\nSince we know that the list is already sorted, we can start by dividing it into two halves at each step until we have only one element left. This means that the maximum number of steps required to find the target value will be log n, where n is the size of the list.\n\nIn this case, since the list has 120 elements, the maximum number of steps required to find the target value (100) will be log 120. Since log 120 is between 9 and 10, the maximum number of elements that must be examined is either 8 or 9.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 8."
