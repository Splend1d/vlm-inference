By engineering the bridge to withstand a hurricane, the main character may have been trying to make the situation worse and increase their own chances of success, rather than addressing the actual issue at hand. This action could be seen as selfish and potentially dangerous, especially if they were not careful enough with the construction process. Therefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
