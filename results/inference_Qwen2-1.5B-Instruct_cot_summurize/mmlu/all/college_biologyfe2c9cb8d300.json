Capacity for long-distance dispersal\n\nLong-distance dispersal allows a species to move beyond its native range, allowing it to colonize new habitats and potentially establish itself as a new species. This can lead to a change in the species' ecological niche and may contribute to its becoming cosmopolitan in distribution."
