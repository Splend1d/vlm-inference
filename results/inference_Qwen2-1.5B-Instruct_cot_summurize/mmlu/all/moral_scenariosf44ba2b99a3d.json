Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 is considered morally wrong because leaving the hotel room's bed messy without taking responsibility for cleaning up after oneself can be seen as disrespectful and not respecting the property of others. It also goes against the basic principle of hospitality and consideration for others' belongings.\n\nScenario 2 is not considered morally wrong because encouraging someone to make a decision or proposal is generally considered a positive action. It shows respect for the other person's autonomy and willingness to listen to their ideas. Additionally, if the proposal turns out to be beneficial or leads to positive outcomes, then it could be considered morally right. However, if the proposal is harmful or unethical, then it might be morally wrong depending on the context and consequences."
