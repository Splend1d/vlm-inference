The external view and the internal view\n\nThe external view refers to the idea that our lives have meaning through our relationships with others, such as family, friends, and society at large. This view emphasizes the importance of community and social connection.\n\nThe internal view, on the other hand, suggests that our lives have meaning through personal values and goals we set for ourselves. This view emphasizes individual responsibility and self-improvement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The external view and the internal view."
