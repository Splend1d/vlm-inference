It aims to understand how changes in food intake in a population can impact overall health outcomes, including the prevention and management of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect, and option D is also incorrect because both A and B are indeed important aspects of nutritional epidemiology."
