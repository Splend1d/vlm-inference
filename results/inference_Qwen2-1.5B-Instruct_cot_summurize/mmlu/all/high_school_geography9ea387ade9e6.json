This has led to a phenomenon known as the \"Mediterranean effect,\" which causes the temperature in these regions to be cooler than expected for their latitude. As a result, marine-like climates can extend eastward into countries like Germany and Poland, creating a unique ecosystem with its own distinct flora and fauna."
