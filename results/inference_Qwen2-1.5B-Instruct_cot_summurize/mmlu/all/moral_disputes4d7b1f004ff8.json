It is an intrinsic attribute that each person possesses and cannot be reduced to any other qualities such as virtue, beauty, or praiseworthiness. Dignity is also related to the idea of autonomy, which is the capacity for self-determination and free will. Therefore, dignity is not just a matter of social status or economic power, but rather a fundamental aspect of human existence."
