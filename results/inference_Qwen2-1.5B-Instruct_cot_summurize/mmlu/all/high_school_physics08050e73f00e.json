                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The combination of mass (m) and charge (q) that results in a circular path with the largest radius is m = 20 u, q = -1 e.\n\nIn an electric or magnetic field, the centripetal force required to keep a charged particle moving in a circle is given by F = mv^2/r, where v is the speed of the particle and r is its radius. In this case, the only forces acting on the particle are the electric and magnetic fields. The magnitude of the electric force is E = kq^2/ r, where k is Coulomb's constant, and the magnitude of the magnetic force is F_B = qv x B sin(\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector. \n\nFor a particle to move in a circular path, the net force must be zero, so we can set up the equation:\n\nE + F_B = 0\n\nSubstituting the expressions for E and F_B gives:\n\nkq^2/r + qv x B sin(\u03b8) = 0\n\nSince the speed v is perpendicular to the magnetic field B, the term cos(\u03b8) = 1 cancels out, leaving us with:\n\nkq^2/r + qv x B = 0\n\nDividing both sides by kq^2 gives:\n\n1/v + Bsin(\u03b8) = 0\n\nThis equation represents a parabola that opens upwards, with the vertex at the origin. The x-coordinate of the vertex gives the value of v when the particle moves in a circular path. Setting the derivative of this function equal to zero gives the critical angle \u03b8:\n\nd/d\u03b8 [1/v + Bsin(\u03b8)] = 0\n\nSolving for \u03b8 gives:\n\ntan(\u03b8) = -B/v\n\nThe larger the value of tan(\u03b8), the smaller the value of v, and therefore the larger the radius of the circular path. Since B is positive, the larger the value of tan(\u03b8), the smaller the value of v, and therefore the larger the radius of the circular path.\n\nComparing the options:\n- A: m = 16 u, q = \u20135 e has v = sqrt(kq^2/m) = sqrt(9*1e^-12/16u) = sqrt(1/2e^-12) \u2248 0.73 e^-11\n- B: m = 17 u, q = \u20134 e has v = sqrt(kq^2/m) = sqrt(16*1e^-12/17u) = sqrt(1/11e^-12) \u2248 0.68 e^-11\n- C: m = 18 u, q = \u20133 e has v = sqrt(kq^2/m) = sqrt(16*1e^-12/18u) = sqrt(1/12e^-12) \u2248 0.66 e^-11\n- D: m = 20 u, q = \u20131 e has v = sqrt(kq^2/m) = sqrt(16*1e^-12/20u) = sqrt(1/10e^-12) \u2248 0.64 e^-11\n\nTherefore, the combination with the largest radius is D."
