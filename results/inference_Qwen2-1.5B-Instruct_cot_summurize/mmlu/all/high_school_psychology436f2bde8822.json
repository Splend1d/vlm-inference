It is responsible for processing sensory information and motor functions, including voluntary movement. The cerebral cortex is divided into two main regions: the frontal lobe, which controls cognitive processes such as attention, reasoning, and decision-making; and the parietal lobe, which deals with perception and spatial awareness. The temporal lobe contains areas that process auditory information, while the occipital lobe handles visual processing."
