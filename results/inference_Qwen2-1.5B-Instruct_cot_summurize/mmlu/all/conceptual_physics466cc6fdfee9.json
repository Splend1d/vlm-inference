To find their resultant, we calculate each component separately:\n\nFor the first vector (3N), its x-component is 3N, and its y-component is 0N since it's parallel to the x-axis.\nFor the second vector (4N), its x-component is 0N, and its y-component is 4N.\n\nNow, let's add them together:\n\nResultant_x = 3N + 0N = 3N,\nResultant_y = 0N + 4N = 4N,\n\nand finally, Resultant_z remains unchanged at 0N.\n\nTherefore, the resultant vector has a magnitude of \u221a(3^2 + 4^2) = \u221a9 + 16 = \u221a25 = 5N.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 5 N."
