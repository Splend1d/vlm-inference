However, I can offer some general guidance that may be relevant to your situation.\n\nDr. Shealy's advice suggests that there are several ways to improve one's well-being and quality of life:\n\n1. Staying in school: This is important as education is a key factor in personal development and career success.\n2. Eating the right foods: A healthy diet is essential for maintaining good health and overall well-being.\n3. Getting plenty of exercise: Regular physical activity can help improve physical and mental health, reduce stress, and promote better sleep.\n4. Finding a high-paying job: While having a good job is important, it is not the only way to achieve financial security and well-being.\n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to prioritize self-care and take steps to improve one's well-being in any way possible. This could include seeking out support from friends, family, or professionals, engaging in hobbies and activities that bring joy and fulfillment, and making time for relaxation and rest."
