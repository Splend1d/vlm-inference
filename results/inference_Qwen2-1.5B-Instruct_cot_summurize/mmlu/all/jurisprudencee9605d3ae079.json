For example, judges may rely on precedent and statutory interpretation when making decisions, but they may also use their own experience and intuition to arrive at a conclusion. Additionally, some cases may require judges to apply both formal and informal reasoning to arrive at a decision. Therefore, using the grand versus formal dichotomy can lead to oversimplification and misinterpretation of judicial reasoning."
