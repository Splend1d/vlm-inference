Since \\(6\\) is not in \\(Z_5\\), it means that there's no entry for this operation in \\(Z_5 \\times Z_5\\). \n\nHowever, since we're dealing with multiplication in \\(Z_5 \\times Z_9\\), where both groups have different multiplicities, we must consider the multiplicity of each element when multiplying them together.\n\nIn \\(Z_5\\), \\(3\\) has a multiplicity of \\(4\\) because \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 81 \\equiv 1 \\mod{5}\\). Therefore, the product of any number multiple of \\(3\\) by any other number in \\(Z_5\\) will be \\(1\\) modulo \\(5\\).\n\nIn \\(Z_9\\), \\(3\\) has a multiplicity of \\(3\\) because \\(3^3 = 27 \\equiv 0 \\mod{9}\\). So, if we take any number in \\(Z_9\\) that has a multiplicity greater than \\(3\\), its product will result in a number that's equivalent to \\(0 \\mod{9}\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the products:\n\n- \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) which is not in \\(Z_5\\).\n- \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) which is also not in \\(Z_5\\).\n\nTherefore, none of these operations can produce an element in \\(Z_5 \\times Z_9\\), making the correct answer \\(D.
