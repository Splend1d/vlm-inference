American exceptionalism refers to the belief that the United States has unique qualities and attributes that make it different from other nations, such as its freedom, democracy, and cultural heritage. This does not necessarily imply opposition to world government.\n\nHowever, it is true that some people may oppose world government for various reasons. For example, they may believe that a centralized or global government would infringe on their individual freedoms or that the current international system works well enough without intervention. Others may be concerned about the potential for corruption or abuse of power in a global government.\n\nTherefore, option A (its general anti-statism opposes centralized government) could potentially be relevant to this discussion, but it is not the only reason why some individuals may oppose world government."
