Begin to utter their first words in a systematic progression determined by selective reinforcement of babbling\n\nThis is because during the later part of their first year, children's language-learning ability changes as they start to produce their first words and develop their speaking skills through imitation and reinforcement. This process is known as babbling or vocalizing, where children use their mouths to make sounds that resemble adult speech but do not yet have the vocabulary or grammar of their native language. As they continue to babble, they also begin to learn to put together these sounds into meaningful sentences and phrases, which is called acquiring words. This process involves selective reinforcement, where adults reward children for using specific words and phrases more frequently than others, helping them to acquire new vocabulary and improve their language skills."
