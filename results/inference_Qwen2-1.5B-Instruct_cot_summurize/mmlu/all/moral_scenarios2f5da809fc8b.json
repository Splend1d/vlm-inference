Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves filling someone's cup with coffee based on their preference for decaf, which is not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, involves giving your brother the toilet brush so they can clean their teeth, which is generally considered morally wrong. It may be seen as neglecting personal hygiene and potentially causing harm if the brother uses it improperly or needs medical attention. Therefore, this scenario would be considered morally wrong."
