Average revenue equals marginal revenue.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, firms have no control over prices or quantities they can sell their product at. Therefore, the only way to increase revenue is by increasing output (which would decrease average cost). As output increases, marginal revenue also increases until total revenue reaches its maximum value. At this point, additional units sold will result in lower profit margins due to higher average costs. After reaching peak revenue, further increases in output will lead to declining profits as the price falls below average cost. This pattern repeats with each unit added to production until there is no longer enough demand left to justify producing any more units."
