As people become more affluent, they tend to consume more animal-based foods such as beef, pork, chicken, eggs, and milk. This trend is particularly evident in developing countries where access to affordable meat and dairy products has been limited in the past. However, it's important to note that while meat consumption may be increasing, there is also a growing movement towards plant-based diets and sustainable agriculture practices, which could potentially reduce overall demand for meat and dairy products."
