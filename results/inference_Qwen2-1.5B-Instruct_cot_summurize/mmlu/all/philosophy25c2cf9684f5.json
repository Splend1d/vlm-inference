This means that individuals create their own meaning and purpose in life through their choices and actions. Sartre believed that humans are free agents who must take responsibility for their own lives and make decisions based on their own beliefs and values. He argued that traditional ideas about objective reality and determinism were inadequate to explain human experience and that people should embrace their freedom and choose their own paths in life."
