Attribution theory\n\nAttribution theory is a psychological concept that explains why people attribute events to specific factors rather than attributing them to more general causes, such as luck or chance. In this case, if someone attributes the family's recent crisis to extreme financial distress, they may be using attribution theory to explain why the family has experienced difficulties financially. This could help the neighbor understand the perspective of the family and potentially provide support or resources to help alleviate their financial stress."
