Its administration favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbor for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.\"\nThucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E.\nWhich of the following correctly describes one of the primary reasons that Greek culture was disseminated widely around the Mediterranean region during the time period represented by the passage?\n\nA. The geography of Greece contains many natural resources that facilitated a profitable mining industry.\nB. The geography of Greece contains numerous freshwater lakes that facilitated a successful fishing industry.\nC. The geography of Greece contains prominent river valleys that facilitated widespread agriculture.\nD. The geography of Greece contains many natural harbors that facilitated trade and commerce.\n"

Thucydides' passage suggests that Greece's advantageous location on the Mediterranean Sea and its access to various bodies of water made it an ideal place for trade and commerce, allowing Greek culture to spread throughout the region. This was due to the availability of natural harbors, which facilitated maritime transportation and enabled Greeks to establish colonies and trade networks across the Mediterranean."
