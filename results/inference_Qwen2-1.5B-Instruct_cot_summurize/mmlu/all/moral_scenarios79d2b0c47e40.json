However, if one were to make an assumption based solely on the action itself, then it could be argued that it is not inherently morally wrong.\nScenario 2 is considered morally wrong. Writing someone else's essay without their permission is theft and plagiarism, which goes against ethical and legal principles. This type of behavior can cause harm to others and undermine academic integrity."
