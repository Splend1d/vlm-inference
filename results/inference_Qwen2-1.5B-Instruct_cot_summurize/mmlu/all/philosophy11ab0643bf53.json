This means that if we attribute certain outcomes or misfortunes to individuals based on their actions, it can lead to the idea that the individual's character or agency has been compromised, and they may not be able to fully control or influence those outcomes. This can create a sense of moral accountability for the individual, even if the outcome was outside of their control."
