The fact that only three fund managers out of 100 have shown significant returns suggests that there may be some degree of market efficiency or diversification among these funds. However, without more information about the specific strategies used by these fund managers or their overall performance over time, it is impossible to definitively conclude whether the market is efficient or not. Therefore, the correct response is D."
