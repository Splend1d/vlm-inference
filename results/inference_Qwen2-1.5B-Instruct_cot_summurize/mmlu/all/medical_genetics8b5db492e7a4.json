These mutations result in the production of abnormal beta-globin chains that do not fold properly and are unable to bind correctly with the iron needed for hemoglobin synthesis. This leads to a deficiency in hemoglobin production, resulting in anemia. The most common type of alpha-thalassemia is due to deletions or duplications in the HBB gene that affect the number of functional beta-globin chains produced. Point mutations in the HBB gene can also cause alpha-thalassemia, but they are less common than deletions or duplications."
