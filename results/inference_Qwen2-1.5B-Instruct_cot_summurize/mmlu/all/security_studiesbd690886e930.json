The crisis has revealed the failure of international cooperation to prevent a global catastrophe, in the form of massive economic collapse and contagion.\n\nThis option highlights one of the key criticisms of the liberalist approach to international relations: that it assumes that countries will act in their own self-interest and cooperate with each other to promote peace and prosperity. However, during the global economic crisis, many countries were unable or unwilling to work together effectively to address the challenges facing the world economy.\n\nFor example, there was little agreement on how to provide support to struggling economies, or on how to prevent the spread of the virus that caused the pandemic. This lack of coordination contributed to the severity of the crisis and its long-lasting effects.\n\nC. All of these options.\n\nThe other two options also highlight some of the negative consequences of the liberalist approach to international relations. For example, governmental cyberspace restrictions and increased state involvement in key industries can lead to surveillance and control over citizens' lives, which is not aligned with the values of liberalism.\n\nHowever, none of these options fully capture the full extent of the challenges posed by the recent global economic crisis. It is important to consider all aspects of this complex issue, including political, economic, social, and environmental factors, in order to understand the root causes of the crisis and its potential long-term impacts."
