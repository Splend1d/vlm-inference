It refers to the capacity to perform at high levels without fatigue or exhaustion. While other attributes such as strength and power can be important factors in achieving success in marathon running, they are not the sole determining factor. Staying motivated, having a strong mental attitude, and maintaining consistent training are also crucial for success in marathon running."
