Environmental change can be a cause of war between countries, largely centred on resource scarcity interrelated with conflict. There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity.\nB. Population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation can lead to environmentally caused conflict. There is therefore a linear link between population growth and environmental change, and environmental change is the critical determinant in the production of violence.\nC. Common findings in research organizations investigating environmental violence have failed to find quantifiable relationships between environmental and social variables and the cause of war. Analysis of aggregated data failed to establish a common causal mechanism. The extensity of possible variables being simply too vast, mitigating any definitive relationship.\nD. Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.\n"

There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity.\n\nEnvironmental change can lead to resource scarcity and competition over limited resources, which can trigger conflicts between countries. For example, access to water resources, such as fresh water or arable land, can be a source of conflict when one country's demand exceeds available resources. Similarly, disputes over mineral deposits, oil reserves, or other natural resources can also fuel conflicts.\n\nMoreover, environmental degradation can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, making it easier for extremist groups to mobilize and recruit supporters. This can create fertile ground for violent extremism and radicalization, leading to the outbreak of armed conflict.\n\nOverall, while environmental change is not a direct cause of war, it can contribute to the conditions that facilitate conflict by undermining stability, creating tensions, and providing a pretext for aggression. Therefore, addressing environmental challenges through sustainable development and conservation efforts can help reduce the risk of conflict and promote peace and stability."
