Less effective in X because the policy will decrease net exports.\n\nIn an open economy like Economy X, where there is free movement of capital and goods across borders, expansionary monetary policy can lead to an increase in the value of the currency (or exchange rate). This can have the unintended effect of decreasing net exports by making exports cheaper for foreign buyers and increasing imports.\n\nIn contrast, in a closed economy like Economy Y, where there is no free movement of capital and goods across borders, expansionary monetary policy would not have any direct impact on net exports. However, it could indirectly affect net exports through changes in interest rates and investment decisions.\n\nTherefore, while both economies might experience some degree of economic growth under expansionary monetary policy, the effectiveness of the policy would depend on how much the policy affects net exports in each economy. In general, the policy would be less effective in an open economy like Economy X than in a closed economy like Economy Y."
