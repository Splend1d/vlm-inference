A function that satisfies this property automatically preserves the compactness of \\(T\\) because it cannot map a non-compact set into a compact set (since a one-to-one function maps all elements of its domain to distinct elements of its codomain).\n\nFor example, consider a compact subset \\(K\\) of the real line \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) with the usual topology. If we define a function \\(f:\\mathbb{R} \\to K\\) by mapping each point \\(x\\) to the midpoint of \\(K\\) between its nearest points to \\(x\\), then \\(f\\) is a one-to-one function that maps the entire real line to \\(K\\), making \\(K\\) compact.\n\nTherefore, option D is the weakest condition necessary to ensure the compactness of \\(T\\)."
