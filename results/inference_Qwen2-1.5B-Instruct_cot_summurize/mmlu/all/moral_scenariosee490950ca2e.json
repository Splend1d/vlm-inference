In scenario 1, taking out the trash and including used paper plates is considered acceptable behavior. In scenario 2, purchasing diamonds with the intention of keeping them for oneself goes against ethical considerations regarding fair trade and environmental impact. Therefore, both scenarios can be considered morally neutral or even positive depending on one's values and beliefs. However, it's important to note that this answer is based on assumptions about what is considered \"morally wrong\" in the context of the United States as of 2020. The situation could vary depending on local customs and cultural norms."
