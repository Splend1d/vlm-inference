The industry will contract as firms exit the market. \n\nWhen the market price is above the average total cost (ATC) curve of a perfectly competitive firm, it means that the firm is making a profit. As a result, the firm may decide to increase production or hire more workers, leading to higher output and lower prices for consumers. This decrease in prices can lead to increased demand for the product, which can cause other firms to enter the market. However, if the entry of new firms leads to an oversupply of the product, prices will fall further, causing some firms to exit the market. As a result, the industry will contract.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer."
