The parties entered into a contract whereby the seller agreed to deliver to the buyer 1,000 flanges for $10,000. The contract stipulated that it was FOB at the seller's place of business. The seller then delivered the flanges to a delivery company, which was to transport them to the buyer. While en route, the vehicle that was transporting the flanges was involved in an accident and the flanges were destroyed. When the buyer received notice of the accident, the buyer immediately contacted the seller and demanded that it ship replacement flanges. The seller refused to do so. In an action by the buyer against the seller for breach of contract, the buyer will\n\nA. succeed, because the risk of loss was on the seller.\nB. succeed, because the carrier was the seller's agent.\nC. not succeed, because the risk of loss was on the buyer.\nD. not succeed, because of frustration of purpose.\n"

In this case, the seller delivered the flanges to the delivery company, but the risk of loss passed to the buyer upon delivery to the carrier. Therefore, the buyer is responsible for any loss or damage to the flanges during transportation, even if the seller had no control over the transportation method.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the seller refused to replace the damaged flanges does not absolve the seller of its contractual obligations. Even if the seller had no control over the transportation method, it still has a duty to fulfill its contractual obligations and replace the damaged flanges."
