A multinomial logit model.\n\nA multinomial logit model is used when there are multiple outcomes, and each outcome has its own set of probabilities. In this case, the outcomes could be choosing an equity fund, a bond fund, or a cash investment. The multinomial logit model allows us to estimate the probability of each outcome by adjusting for other factors that may affect the choice. This type of model is commonly used in economics and finance to analyze consumer behavior and make predictions about market trends."
