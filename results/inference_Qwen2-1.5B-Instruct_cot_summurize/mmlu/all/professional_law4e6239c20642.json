Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the widow died leaving no heirs. In her will, the widow left her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America. The cottage was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the widow died, the tenant, having learned of her death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts of America organization was unaware that the widow made a gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the cottage. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when\n\nA. the widow died.\nB. the tenant discontinued paying rent.\nC. the tenant's lease with the widow expired.\nD. the tenant subjectively believed that he no longer had permission to possess the cottage.\n"

This is known as \"adverse possession.\" However, the tenant must have been actually using the property without the consent of the rightful owner continuously for 20 years, without any interruption or break-in, and without the knowledge of the rightful owner during the entire time. \n\nIf the tenant did not use the property for 20 years continuously and without any interruption, then the tenant would lose their rights to the property through abandonment or eviction by the rightful owner. Therefore, if the tenant continued to occupy the property after the widow died without paying rent, it would likely result in the loss of their rights under adverse possession."
