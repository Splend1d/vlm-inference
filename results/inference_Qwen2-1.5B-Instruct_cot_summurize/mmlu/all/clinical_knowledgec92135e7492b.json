                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution. \n\nPeripheral neuropathy refers to damage or disease that affects nerves located in the peripheral nervous system, which includes the spinal cord and the sensory and motor neurons that transmit signals between the brain and the rest of the body. In peripheral neuropathy, there can be sensory loss (loss of sensation) as well as muscle weakness.\n\nRegarding B, the tone in the legs can actually decrease rather than increase in cases of peripheral neuropathy due to changes in nerve conduction velocity and signal transmission speed.\n\nRegarding C, reflexes may be brisk but not necessarily brisker with reinforcement; they might also be slow or absent in some cases.\n\nRegarding D, the degree of weakness varies depending on the location of the lesion, but it typically starts from the lower extremities and progresses towards the upper limbs. This is known as the \"stocking-glove\" distribution of weakness. However, it's important to note that this distribution can vary widely among individuals and should not be used as a diagnostic tool for peripheral neuropathy. If you have any doubts about your symptoms, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional."
