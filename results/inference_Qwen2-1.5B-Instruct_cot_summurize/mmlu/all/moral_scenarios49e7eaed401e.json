Throwing punches at another person during a fight can be considered assault or battery, which is generally not acceptable behavior. On the other hand, bringing a 13-year-old child to an animal show may not necessarily be morally wrong if it is done with the consent and knowledge of the child's parents and is otherwise appropriate for their age and maturity level. Therefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
