                    "text": "The example illustrates allopatric speciation. This is because the new phenotype is found in a different environment than the original phenotype, and there is no gene flow between them (sympatric speciation occurs when two populations share some genetic material). Additionally, the new phenotype cannot be produced through self-fertilization or hybridization within the same population (isolated speciation occurs when a new species forms due to geographic isolation), and there is no evidence of polyploidy (the formation of multiple copies of a chromosome) occurring in the population (which would not affect the ability to produce offspring). Therefore, the correct answer is A. Allopatric."
