Electrical stimulation of the brain can stimulate the release of endogenous opioids, which are natural painkillers produced by the body. This can help reduce pain and inflammation.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while electrical stimulation can be beneficial in some cases, it should not be used as a replacement for medical treatments or without proper guidance from a healthcare provider. It's also worth noting that the effectiveness of electrical stimulation for chronic pain varies depending on the individual and their specific condition."
