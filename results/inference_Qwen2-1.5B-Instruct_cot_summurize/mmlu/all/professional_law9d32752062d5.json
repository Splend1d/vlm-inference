At her death, developer had a two-year option to buy for $100,000. Shortly after her death, the farmhouse was destroyed by a fire. The developer sent a letter almost two years later in which it exercised the option. The estate refused to sell. The developer brought suit on the option and for the first time claimed a $20,000 credit for destruction of the farmhouse. The court in equity granted the developer's claim and ordered a sale for $80,000. The estate of the widow appealed. Will the appellate court affirm the equity court's ruling and order the $20,000 credit to the developer for the loss of the house?\n\nA. Yes, under equitable conversion the seller is trustee for the buyer and is responsible for the risk of loss.\nB. Yes, the developer had an equitable ownership interest in the property when it exercised its option and the seller must compensate for loss to that interest.\nC. No, the buyer acquired no equitable interest in the land or buildings until it exercised the option right before it expired; the court will order the sale at the full price without credit.\nD. No, the buyer gets no credit for the house because it was renting the land at the time of the fire and it is responsible for waste.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is B. The developer had an equitable ownership interest in the property when it exercised its option and the seller must compensate for loss to that interest.\n\nWhen the developer leased the property from the widow, it acquired an equitable ownership interest in the land and buildings. This means that the developer had a legal right to use and enjoy the property, even if the widow retained the right to live in the farmhouse. When the widow died, the developer had a two-year option to buy the property for $100,000. Even though the farmhouse was destroyed by a fire shortly after her death, the developer was still entitled to exercise its option and purchase the property.\n\nTherefore, the developer should be entitled to a credit for the loss of the house, as the seller (the widow) is responsible for compensating for the loss to the developer's interest in the property. The court in equity granted the developer's claim and ordered a sale for $80,000, which is the fair market value of the property. The estate of the widow appealed, but the appellate court is likely to affirm the equity court's ruling and order the $20,000 credit to the developer for the loss of the house."
