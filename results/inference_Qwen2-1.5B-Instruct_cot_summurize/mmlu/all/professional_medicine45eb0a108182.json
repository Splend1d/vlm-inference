Physical examination shows lesions that are most numerous in the flexural areas including the axillae and groin. The blisters do not break easily, and there are no oral lesions. These blisters are most likely the result of adhesion failure involving which of the following?\n\nA. Basement membrane\nB. Dermal papillae\nC. Langerhans cells\nD. Melanocytes\n"

They provide support for the cell and help maintain its shape. When they are damaged or disrupted, it can lead to blistering and other tissue damage. In this case, the repeated blistering suggests that the basement membrane may have been compromised in some way."
