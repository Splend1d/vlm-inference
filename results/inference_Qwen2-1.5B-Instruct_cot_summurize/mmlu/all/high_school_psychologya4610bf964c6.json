Behavior is under the control of external stimuli that either reinforce or punish actions, thereby affecting the likelihood of the occurrence of these behaviors.\n\nClassical behaviorism was a school of thought in psychology that believed that all behavior could be explained by observable patterns of responses to environmental stimuli. This view held that behavior is determined by what the individual does in response to external stimuli, rather than by internal mental processes or subjective experiences. The behaviorist would use experiments designed to isolate the effects of specific stimuli on behavior, and then infer the underlying cause based on those results. This approach contrasts with other theories of behavior such as operant conditioning (which emphasizes learning through rewards and punishments) and psychoanalytic theory (which focuses on unconscious motivations)."
