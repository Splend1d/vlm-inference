This is because the formation of water (H2O) from methane and oxygen is exothermic, which means that it releases energy as heat. The entropy of a system increases when there is an increase in its internal energy or when the temperature of the system increases. Therefore, the formation of water from methane and oxygen would result in a decrease in entropy."
