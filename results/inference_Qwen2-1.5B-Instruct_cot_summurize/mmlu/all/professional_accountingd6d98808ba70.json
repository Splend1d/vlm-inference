In this case, before the split, Alto had 10000 shares of $10 par value common stock issued and outstanding. So, the par value of the stock would have been $10 x 10000 = $1,000,000.\n\nAfter the split, the company issued new shares with a par value of $100 per share. Therefore, the par value of the stock after the split would be $100 x 10000 = $1,000,000.\n\nTo determine whether the par value remained at $10 or was reduced, we need to compare the original par value ($1,000,000) with the new par value ($1,000,000). Since both values are equal, the par value remains unchanged at $10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Remained at $10."
