The dominant allele B codes for black fur, the recessive allele b codes for brown hair. A second gene consisting of two alleles, E and e, codes for the deposition of pigment in the hair. In this case, the alleles for pigment deposition (E or e) are said to be epistatic to the gene that codes for black or brown pigment. If the dominant allele (E) is not present, regardless of the genotype at the black/brown locus, the animal's fur will be yellow.\n\nA. BBEe will be brown.\nB. BbEe will be brown.\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is C: Bbee will be brown. \n\nThis is because the gene for coat color is determined by two loci, one for the amount of melanin (B/E) and another for the deposition of pigment (E/e). The dominant allele for melanin (B) results in black fur, while the recessive allele (b) results in brown fur. However, the presence of the dominant allele (E) does not affect the expression of the gene for pigment deposition (E), as long as there is no dominant allele for melanin (B). Therefore, if an animal has only the recessive allele for melanin (b), but both the dominant allele for pigment deposition (E) and the recessive allele for melanin (b) are present, it will have brown fur."
