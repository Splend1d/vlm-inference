The owner of the motel is prosecuted for violating the statute by showing pornographic movies in the motel rooms.

In a 1972 decision, the Court ruled that the government could not suppress books merely because they contained words that some people found offensive. Similarly, the Court has held that the government cannot restrict speech based solely on its subject matter, such as obscenity or pornography, without first establishing a compelling governmental interest and providing a narrowly tailored means of achieving it. Therefore, even if the motel owner argues that the state has the authority to ban the showing of pornographic movies in public areas due to the state's police power, this argument would likely fail in court. Additionally, the owner's argument that the state's local standards should be used to determine whether the movie has redeeming literary, artistic, political, or scientific merit would also likely fail, as the government does not have the authority to impose local standards on speech. Finally, the argument that the motel owner's prosecution violates his right to view the films in private would also likely fail, as the First and Fourteenth Amendments protect the individual's right to engage in sexual activity in private, and the government cannot constitutionally regulate speech based solely on its allegedly obscene contents."
