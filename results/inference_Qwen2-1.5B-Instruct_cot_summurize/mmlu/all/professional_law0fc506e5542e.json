The woman then drove through a red light and struck a police car driven by a police officer, injuring him. At the time of the accident, the police officer was returning from an emergency dispatch. The police officer sued the woman to recover damages suffered in the auto accident. At trial, the police officer presented evidence that he was returning from an emergency scene when the woman drove through a red light and struck his patrol car. At the conclusion of the plaintiff's presentation of evidence, the woman moved for a summary judgment claiming the \"firefighter's rule\" barred recovery. The motion for summary judgment should be\n\nA. granted, because the accident would not have occurred but for the emergency.\nB. granted, because the police officer assumed the risk of injury by answering the emergency call.\nC. denied, because the police officer's injury was not related to any special danger of his job.\nD. denied, because the firefighter's rule does not apply to police officers.\n"

The firefighter's rule is a legal doctrine that allows firefighters to recover damages if they are injured while performing their duties as firefighters. In this case, the police officer was responding to an emergency call when the woman hit his patrol car, so it can be argued that he assumed the risk of injury by accepting the call. Therefore, the woman cannot recover damages from the police officer under the firefighter's rule."
