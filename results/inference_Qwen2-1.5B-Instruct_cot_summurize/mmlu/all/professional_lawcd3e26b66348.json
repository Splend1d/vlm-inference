If the condition of the land is artificial (such as a fence or sign), then the possessor has no duty to warn the trespasser about it. However, if the condition of the land is natural (such as a tree falling on the road), then the possessor owes a duty to warn the trespasser about it. Therefore, option B is correct and option C is incorrect. Option D is also incorrect because the possessor still owes a duty of care to warn the trespasser when the condition of the land is active (such as digging a hole)."
