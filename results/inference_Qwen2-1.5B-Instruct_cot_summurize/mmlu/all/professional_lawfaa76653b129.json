Exceptions to this include statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment, statements made during the course of legal proceedings, and statements made for the purpose of identifying a person. However, statements made for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted are generally admissible if they are offered by someone who is qualified to testify about them (such as a police officer).\n\nIn this case, the statement made by the drinking buddy does not fall under any of these exceptions. It is a statement that is offered to prove the defendant's intent at the time of the crime, which is not a matter of proof but rather a matter of inference based on the facts presented. Therefore, it cannot be admitted as hearsay and must be excluded from evidence."
