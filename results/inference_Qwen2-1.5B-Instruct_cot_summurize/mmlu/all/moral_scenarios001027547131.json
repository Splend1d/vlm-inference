In scenario 1, the main character's actions were intended to help raise funds for the zoo, but they went too far by allowing food servers to enter the dining hall without proper permission. This can be seen as an attempt to exploit the situation for personal gain.\nIn contrast, scenario 2 involves offering to watch over someone who is pregnant, which is generally considered a kind gesture. However, the fact that the person being watched has a heavy load of trash to take out may make it seem like the action is motivated by selfishness rather than kindness.\nTherefore, based on the given options, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong."
