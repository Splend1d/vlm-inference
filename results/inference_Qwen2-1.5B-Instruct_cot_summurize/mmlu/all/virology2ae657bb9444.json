They have to transcribe their genome RNA to a mirror image copy as a mRNA\n\nPositive-stranded RNA viruses have an RNA genome that cannot be translated directly into protein due to its double-stranded nature. To overcome this, they must transcribe their RNA genome into messenger RNA (mRNA) using ribonucleic acid polymerase (RNP). The resulting mRNA is then used by the virus to produce viral proteins."
