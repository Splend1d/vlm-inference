                    "text": "In 1985, a landowner, the undisputed owner of an apartment building, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the landowner died leaving no heirs. In her will, the landowner left her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America. The apartment building was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the landowner died, the tenant, having learned of the landowner's death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Girl Scouts of America organization was unaware of the landowner's gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Girl Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the apartment building. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. In an ejection action by the Girl Scouts of America against the tenant, the organization will prevail\n\nA. because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\nB. if the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he (the tenant) was called into military service.\nC. if the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.\nD. because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.\n\nUnder the doctrine of adverse possession, a person who has occupied real property for a continuous and open period of time without the owner's permission may acquire a fee simple title to the property. However, there must be a lack of permission from the owner at the time of occupation, and the occupant must continue to occupy the property under the same terms as before. \n\nIn this case, the tenant did not pay rent to the landowner after the latter's death, which means the landowner would have been aware that the tenant was occupying the property illegally. Therefore, the tenant would have violated the conditions necessary for adverse possession to occur, making them unable to assert any rights over the property.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the fact that the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years does not automatically disqualify him/her from claiming adverse possession. Similarly, option C is also incorrect because believing one's lease to be valid is not sufficient grounds for acquiring adverse possession.\n\nOption D is incorrect because simply not paying taxes on the property does not necessarily mean the tenant acquired adverse possession; it only shows the tenant was not entitled to occupancy of the property based on legal ownership or title.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
