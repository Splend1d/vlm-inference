State box.\n\nA state box is a component in control theory that represents the current state of an element or subsystem, and its behavior depends on the current state of other elements or subsystems. In other words, it acts as a \"switch\" that controls the flow of information between different parts of the system based on the current state of the entire system. This makes it useful for modeling and analyzing complex systems where multiple inputs and outputs interact with each other."
