                    "text": "The statement provided seems to be referring to a specific study conducted by psychologist David R. Rosenhan, known as the \"Pseudopatient Experiment.\" The experiment involved 100 individuals who were labeled as \"psychotic patients\" and were admitted into a psychiatric hospital for treatment. \n\nAccording to Rosenhan's findings, those individuals were not actually psychotic but were simply \"pseudo-patients,\" meaning they had been recruited from the general population through deception.\n\nRosenhan's research suggests that:\n\n- Labeling someone can indeed alter their behavior (option B).\n- It's possible that the environment or societal expectations can influence perception of an individual (option C).\n\nHowever, option A and D do not accurately summarize Rosenhan's research. While it's true that some studies have shown that labeling or classification can affect people's behavior, this does not necessarily mean that participation in a research study alters the behavior of research participants. Additionally, option A focuses too narrowly on labeling; it doesn't explain the broader implications of Rosenhan's work beyond the specifics of his experiment. Option D assumes that \"central traits\" have a more significant impact than others without providing evidence or context to support such a claim.\n\nIn summary, while Rosenhan's research did find that labelings can alter behavior, it's important to consider the broader implications of his study when discussing its significance."
