W \u2283 B\n\nThis statement can be read as: If it is true that Beth rides her bike, then it is also true that she gets to work earlier. This is equivalent to saying that getting to work earlier is a necessary condition for riding a bike. The other options do not accurately capture this relationship between the two statements. Option C, \"B \u2261 W,\" would mean that the truth of one implies the truth of the other, which does not capture the logical relationship described in the original sentence. Option D, \"Both A and B,\" refers to both statements being true at the same time, which is not necessarily the case with this sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is B."
