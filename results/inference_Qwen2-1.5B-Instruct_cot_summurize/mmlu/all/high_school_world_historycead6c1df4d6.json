Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe author of the above passage claims: \"Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest.\" What does he mean by this?\n\nA. The rulers became too rich and thus were overthrown.\nB. The empire became too large to control effectively.\nC. Decay begins the minute something begins to grow.\nD. Conquest and prosperity are mutually exclusive.\n"

                    "text": "The author means that when the empire becomes prosperous, it can lead to decay because the principles of decay (i.e., corruption and neglect) can become more prevalent. This is because prosperity creates opportunities for people to accumulate wealth and power, which can lead to corruption and abuse of power. As the empire grows larger, it becomes harder to maintain control and prevent decay, so the author suggests that prosperity may actually contribute to the downfall of the empire. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The empire became too large to control effectively."
