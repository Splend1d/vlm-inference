In this case, the nerve impulse traveling down the nerve ending of the skin is activated as the person scratches, which temporarily relieves their pain. However, once the scratch is stopped, the nerve impulse is no longer present, so the pain returns. This process can be thought of as an opponent process between the sensory input (the pain) and the motor output (scratching)."
