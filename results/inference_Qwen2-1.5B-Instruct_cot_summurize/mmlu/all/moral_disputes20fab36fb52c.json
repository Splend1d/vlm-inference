All of the above.\n\nAccording to Lukianoff and Haidt, instituting vindictive protectiveness in schools can have negative effects on students' mental health and academic performance. It can lead to a culture of fear and mistrust, where students are afraid to speak up or challenge authority. This can hinder their ability to think critically and independently, as well as their ability to learn from mistakes and failures. Additionally, it can create an environment where students feel that they need to be protected from criticism or failure, rather than being encouraged to take risks and learn from their experiences. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between protecting students and allowing them to develop resilience and self-reliance."
