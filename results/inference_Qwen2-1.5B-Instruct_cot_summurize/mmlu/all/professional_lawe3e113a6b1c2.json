As the defendant was about to open an umbrella that she was carrying, a stranger to the defendant came up to her, snatched the umbrella out of the defendant's hand, and said, \"You thief! That's my umbrella. \" Enraged by being accosted in such a manner, the defendant grabbed for the umbrella with one hand and pushed the stranger with the other. The stranger hung on to the umbrella but fell over backward onto the sidewalk, which was wet and slippery. When the defendant saw the stranger hit the ground, she calmed down, decided the umbrella was not worth all the commotion, and walked off. As it turned out, the umbrella did in fact belong to the stranger, and the defendant had picked it up by mistake when she was left a restaurant earlier that day. A few moments later, the stranger got up in a daze and stepped into the gutter, where he was struck by a car that was passing another car on the right, in violation of a state law. The stranger died in the hospital two hours later. Which of the following is the most serious crime for which the defendant could be found guilty?\n\nA. Battery.\nB. Larceny.\nC. Involuntary manslaughter.\nD. No crime.\n"

Larceny is the unlawful taking or delivery of property with intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. If the defendant took the umbrella without permission and intended to keep it, then she could be charged with larceny. However, since the defendant did not have intention to permanently deprive the owner of the umbrella, she may only be charged with battery (A) if she caused harm to the stranger by grabbing for the umbrella with one hand and pushing him with the other. It is also possible that the defendant may face charges for involuntary manslaughter (C), as she may have been distracted and acted recklessly during the incident."
