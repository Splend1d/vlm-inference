Nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in symbiosis with legume plants, allowing them to fix atmospheric nitrogen and use it as a nutrient source. This process is known as nitrogen fixation, which is essential for the growth and survival of many plant species, including legumes. Without this process, these plants would not be able to obtain enough nitrogen to support their growth and development."
