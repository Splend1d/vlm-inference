Ignorance or Mistake\n\nUnder the circumstances described, the man may be able to successfully argue that he did not intend to cause harm and therefore should not be charged with second-degree murder. This defense relies on the idea that the defendant did not have the intent to cause harm, but rather acted out of involuntary intoxication or ignorance.\n\nIt is important to note that this defense may not always be successful, as courts will consider various factors when determining whether a defendant can establish this defense. However, in cases where there is no evidence of premeditation or intent to cause harm, this defense may be more likely to succeed."
