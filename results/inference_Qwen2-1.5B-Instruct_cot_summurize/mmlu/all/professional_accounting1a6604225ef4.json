The accountant must obtain sufficient appropriate evidence by performing procedures to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion.\n\nAn accountant conducting a review of interim financial information is required to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence by performing procedures to provide a reasonable basis for their conclusion or opinion, rather than expressing an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. A review involves examining only certain selected transactions and accounts to determine whether there are any significant differences between the interim financial information presented in the interim financial statements and the historical financial information that was available at the balance sheet date. Therefore, it is important for the accountant to perform adequate procedures to ensure that they have obtained sufficient appropriate evidence to support their conclusions or opinions."
