Static figures and a sense of optical surface movement\n\nPointillism is an art movement that emerged in France during the late 19th century, characterized by the use of small dots or patches of color to create images. This technique was developed by French painter Paul C\u00e9zanne and later popularized by his student Georges Seurat. Seurat's pointillist works often feature static figures and a focus on creating a sense of optical surface movement through the arrangement of small dots of color. The result is a highly stylized and simplified approach to composition, where the primary elements (dots) dominate the visual field. While some pointillists may have used more expressive techniques than Seurat, it is generally accepted that his work represents the pinnacle of the pointillist style."
