Its component elements include availability, utilisation, and stability, as well as access.\n\nFood security refers to the ability of individuals and communities to obtain sufficient, safe, nutritious, and affordable food for an active life. This includes factors such as access to food, the quality and quantity of food available, and the nutritional content of that food. The concept encompasses both the availability and accessibility of food, as well as the utilization of that food by individuals and households. Access to food can be affected by various factors including poverty, lack of education, limited resources, and political instability. Ensuring food security requires not only addressing immediate needs but also working towards long-term solutions to address underlying causes of food insecurity."
