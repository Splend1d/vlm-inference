Putting a danger of infection sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice is optional.\n\nJaundice can indicate several conditions, but it does not necessarily mean that someone has an infection or that they should have a sticker placed on their blood sample. It could also indicate other medical conditions such as liver disease or certain types of anemia. Additionally, itching is a common symptom of jaundice caused by the buildup of bilirubin in the body."
