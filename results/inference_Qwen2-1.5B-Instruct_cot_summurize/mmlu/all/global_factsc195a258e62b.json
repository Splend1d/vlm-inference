This number includes both formal and informal work, such as child labor in agriculture, mining, and construction. It does not include children who work in hazardous or exploitative conditions, which can be much higher.\n\nIt's important to note that this figure represents the total number of children working globally, not just those aged 5-14. However, it provides an estimate of the number of children involved in global child labor at that time."
