However, Congress has given lower federal courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Supreme Court in all other cases. This includes disputes between states themselves, as well as disputes involving ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls. Therefore, if there is a dispute between two states, it would be heard by the Supreme Court rather than by the lower federal court with concurrent jurisdiction."
