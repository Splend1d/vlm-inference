Additionally, it's mentioned that the engine is powered by coal, which means that the maximum power the engine can generate will depend on the amount of coal available in the tender.\n\nGiven that the coal is transferred from the tender to the engine through a shovel, it seems likely that the engine has a limited capacity for generating power due to the complexity of the transfer process. However, without more information about the specific design and capabilities of the engine, it's difficult to determine the exact maximum power it can attain.\n\nAssuming that the engine has a relatively low capacity for generating power (i.e., it can only transfer a certain amount of coal per cycle), then the maximum power the engine could attain would be:\n\nP = Q * V\n\nwhere P is the maximum power, Q is the amount of coal transferred per cycle, and V is the velocity of the coal transfer mechanism (e.g., the speed at which the shovel moves back and forth).\n\nWithout knowing the specifics of the engine's design, we cannot determine the exact maximum power it can achieve. Therefore, none of the given options (A) 6*10^3 W, (B) 6*10^5 W, (C) 6*10^7 W, or (D) 6*10^11 W) is correct."
