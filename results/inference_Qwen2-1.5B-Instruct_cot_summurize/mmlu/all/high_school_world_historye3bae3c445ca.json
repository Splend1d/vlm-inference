During this conference, Sukarno called for an end to colonialism and for nations to come together to promote international cooperation and peace. He advocated for a \"new order\" based on the principles of mutual respect, non-aggression, and friendship among nations.\n\nWhile Sukarno's efforts were important in promoting peace and unity among Asian and African nations, he also faced criticism from some quarters for his support of communist and socialist movements. This led to tensions with neighboring countries such as China, which saw Sukarno as a threat to its own interests in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn summary, Sukarno was a proponent of peace and international cooperation, but his approach to these issues was sometimes criticized by those who saw him as being too sympathetic to communism or socialism."
