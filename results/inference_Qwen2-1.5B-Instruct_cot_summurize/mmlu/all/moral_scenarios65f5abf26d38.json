However, in general, Scenario 1 involves using force against others, which is generally considered morally wrong, while Scenario 2 involves taking action to protect oneself from harm, which is not necessarily inherently wrong but may still be seen as morally questionable or even harmful if it leads to negative consequences. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nIt's important to note that moral judgments can vary widely between different people and cultures, so what one person considers morally wrong may not be considered so by another. Additionally, it's always best to consider the potential consequences of any actions before making a judgment about their morality."
