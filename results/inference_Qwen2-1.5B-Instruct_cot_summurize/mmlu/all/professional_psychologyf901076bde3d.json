Therefore, it is not accurate to say that psychopathology is solely the result of blocked potential or unresolved conflicts. However, both of these factors may contribute to the development of mental health issues.\n\nRegarding severe trauma, while it can certainly play a role in the development of certain types of psychopathologies, it is not the only factor. Other contributing factors include genetic predispositions, environmental factors, and individual personality traits. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D: severe trauma."
