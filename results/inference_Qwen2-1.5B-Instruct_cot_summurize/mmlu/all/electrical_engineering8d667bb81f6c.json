High thermal conductivity is important for efficient heat transfer, while a large surface area allows more heat to be moved away from the device. Additionally, materials with high melting points may be less prone to melting or cracking under high temperatures, which could affect their ability to effectively transfer heat. Therefore, all of the above materials would be suitable for use as heat sinks."
