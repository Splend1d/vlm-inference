A subsistence strategy and settlement pattern based on seasonality and planned acquisition of resources is known as logistical collecting, which involves gathering resources at specific times of the year to meet the needs of a community. This approach allows individuals or groups to conserve their resources by acquiring them only when they are in high demand, rather than wasting time searching for scarce items throughout the year."
