Because any definition of punishment should be value-neutral.\n\nThe separation of the concept of punishment from its justification is crucial because any definition or understanding of punishment must be objective and devoid of subjective values or biases. A value-neutral approach allows for a more consistent and fair application of punishment across different cultures, individuals, and contexts. It also promotes fairness in legal proceedings by ensuring that punishments are based solely on their severity and not influenced by factors such as race, gender, or social status. Ultimately, a value-neutral perspective ensures that the justice system operates without prejudice, promoting equality and respect for all individuals involved in the process."
