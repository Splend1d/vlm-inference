Four: harm to participants; lack of informed consent; invasion of privacy; involvement of deception.\n\nDiener and Crandall's framework for evaluating the ethical principles of educational research involves four key areas:\n\n1. Harm to Participants: This refers to any negative impact that the research may have on the participants, such as emotional distress or physical harm.\n2. Lack of Informed Consent: This refers to the participant's lack of knowledge about what they are agreeing to in the study.\n3. Invasion of Privacy: This refers to any actions that may invade an individual's privacy, such as recording their conversations without their consent.\n4. Involvement of Deception: This refers to any use of deception in order to manipulate the results of the study.\n\nTherefore, there are four categories of ethical principles involved in this framework, which is option B."
