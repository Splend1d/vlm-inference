Violation of the statute is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not less than $500 or more than $5,000 The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. The defendant, a recovering alcoholic, worked as a cashier at a drug store. Late one night while the defendant was working alone, he got the urge to have a drink. He opened a bottle of rum that the store sold and soon began drinking. A short time later, the defendant became inebriated and passed out. Not long thereafter, a 15-year-old girl entered the store to purchase a package of cigarettes. She took a box off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for them. Seeing the defendant lying on the floor, unconscious, the girl left the exact price for the cigarettes on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, he should be found\n\nA. guilty, because the offense does not require any mental state.\nB. guilty, because the defendant's intoxication was voluntaiy.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant was unconscious.\nD. not guilty, because the defendant's employer is vicariously liable for the violation that occurred.\n"

In this case, the defendant was working as a cashier at a drug store and became inebriated and passed out while drinking a bottle of rum. This action was committed within the scope of his employment and with the intent to commit a criminal act, so the employer can be held vicariously liable for the violation.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the defendant cannot be found guilty based solely on the fact that he was intoxicated. The state statute prohibits the sale of cigarettes to anyone under the age of 17, regardless of whether they are sober or inebriated. Therefore, even if the defendant was unable to make rational decisions due to alcohol consumption, the violation of the statute would still occur. The key factor is whether the defendant had the ability and intent to violate the statute, which is determined by the law, not the defendant's state of intoxication."
