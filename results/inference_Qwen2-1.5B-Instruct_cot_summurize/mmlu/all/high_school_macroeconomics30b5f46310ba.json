This can stimulate economic activity and growth. On the other hand, if the government increases its spending on goods and services, it can also lead to an increase in aggregate demand, which can boost economic activity and growth. However, this increase may be offset by lower tax revenues for the government, which could lead to a decrease in real GDP over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. real GDP rises and the price level rises."
