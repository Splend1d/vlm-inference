Let's re-evaluate our approach:\n\nWe know that the energy required to change the momentum of an object is equal to its mass times the square of its velocity divided by two, i.e., \\(W = \\Delta p^2 / 2m\\). In the context of accelerating protons, since the only force acting on them is gravity, their initial kinetic energy is zero. The work done to accelerate them to \\(c\\) will then be proportional to their mass.\n\nThus, if they start at rest, the work done on them to achieve \\(c\\) would be proportional to their mass. Since \\(c\\) is roughly \\(3 \\times 10^8\\) meters per second, the work required would be:\n\\[W \\propto m \\cdot (3 \\times 10^8 \\, m/s)^2 = 0.67mc^2\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 0.67mc^2."
