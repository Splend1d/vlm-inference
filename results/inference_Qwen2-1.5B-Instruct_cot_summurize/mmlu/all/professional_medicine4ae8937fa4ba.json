She has a 2-year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with insulin. She had a normal Pap smear 3 months ago and saw her ophthalmologist 6 months ago. Her 67-year-old grandmother has breast cancer. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2 . Her hemoglobin A1c is 6.2%, and fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 118 mg/dL. Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate at this time?\n\nA. Dietary modification for weight loss\nB. Human papillomavirus testing\nC. Mammography\nD. Influenza virus vaccine\n"

Mammography\n\nBased on the information provided, the patient is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb), which puts her in the age range where breast cancer screening is recommended. Additionally, the patient's hemoglobin A1c is 6.2% and fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 118 mg/dL, indicating that she may be at risk for developing diabetes-related complications such as eye diseases or heart disease.\n\nMammography is indicated to screen for breast cancer, which can be detected early when it is still treatable. It is important to note that mammograms should not replace regular self-exams and professional breast exams by a healthcare provider, but rather provide an additional layer of screening to help detect potential abnormalities earlier than traditional self-exams alone.\n\nThe other options listed do not seem relevant to the patient's current situation based on the information provided: dietary modification for weight loss would depend on the patient's overall health status, human papillomavirus testing does not appear necessary given the patient's age, influenza virus vaccine is typically administered annually, and flu symptoms are not present in the patient's description."
