The principal gave the assistant all of the materials to set up a table with the principal's cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists and even some order forms with businessperson's logo on them. In addition, the assistant represented to third parties that she was there officially representing the principal and that she was authorized to execute contracts on his behalf. The assistant negotiated a deal for the businessperson with a third party, which the businessperson refused to honor because he did not like the terms that were negotiated. Will the third party likely prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson?\n\nA. Yes, because the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\nB. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.\nC. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.\nD. No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.\n"

The principle of \"indicia of authority\" refers to the documents or other evidence that show that an individual has been granted the power to enter into contractual agreements on another's behalf. While it is possible that the assistant had some sort of written authorization from the businessperson to negotiate the contract, without additional evidence such as witness testimony or contemporaneous records, it is difficult to say for certain that the assistant actually had the authority to negotiate the contract on behalf of the businessperson.\n\nAdditionally, the businessperson may also argue that the assistant lacked the authority to negotiate the contract in the first place, particularly if they had concerns about the terms of the proposed deal. Therefore, while it is possible that the third party might prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson, it is unlikely that the assistant will be able to do so without additional evidence of her authority to negotiate the contract."
