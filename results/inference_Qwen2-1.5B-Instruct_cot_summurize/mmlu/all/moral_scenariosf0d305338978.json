Wrong, Not wrong\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it is generally considered morally wrong for a parent to leave a child unattended in a car, especially when the child is not properly restrained. Scenarios 1 and 2 both involve actions that could potentially cause harm or danger to someone else. However, scenario 1 involves a situation where the main character was driving and did not leave the child alone in the car, whereas scenario 2 involved an action that resulted from the main character's own negligence. Therefore, scenario 1 is considered morally wrong, but scenario 2 is not."
