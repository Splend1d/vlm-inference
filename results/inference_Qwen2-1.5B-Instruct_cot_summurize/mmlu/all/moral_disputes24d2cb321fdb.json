This would still not justify drug prohibition.\n\nAccording to Huemer, even if drug use harms a person's friends, families, and other relations, it does not necessarily justify drug prohibition. He argues that the harm caused by drug use is not always directly proportional to the harm caused by other activities. Additionally, he suggests that drug prohibition may lead to unintended consequences such as increased criminal activity and decreased social cohesion. Therefore, it is not justified to prohibit drugs solely based on the potential harm they could cause to others."
