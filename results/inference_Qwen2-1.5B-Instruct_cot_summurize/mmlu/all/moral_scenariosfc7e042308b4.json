Therefore, Scenario 1 would be considered \"Wrong, Wrong\". \n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no indication that the main character did anything explicitly wrong in Scenario 1.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because it does not involve any explicit action or decision that could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because it states that the scenario is \"Not wrong, Wrong\", but this statement contradicts the previous statements about the morality of the situation.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because it states that both scenarios are \"Not wrong, Not wrong\", which implies that both situations are equally acceptable from an ethical standpoint, which is not true."
