One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nThe ideas expressed by Voltaire, above, best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals?\n\nA. Many were accomplished scientists, who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe.\nB. They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\nC. Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man.\nD. Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n"

Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nThe quote from Voltaire shows his belief in the power of reason and science to lead to a better world free from religious or political persecution. He argues that humans should be able to live together peacefully without fear of punishment or discrimination based on their beliefs or backgrounds. This is an example of Enlightenment thinkers advocating for a more rational and objective approach to society and culture, rather than relying on traditional authority figures to dictate morality and ethics."
