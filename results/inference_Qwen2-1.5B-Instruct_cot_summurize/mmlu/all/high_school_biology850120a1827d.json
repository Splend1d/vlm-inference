Therefore, none of the given options directly detract from this claim. However, option B suggests that the appendix may have been larger in fossil hominids, which could indicate that its size may have evolved over time rather than being entirely vestigial. Option C suggests that the appendix has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue, which could also indicate that its function has not completely disappeared. Option D suggests that individuals with a larger-than-average appendix leave fewer offspring than those with a below-average-sized appendix, but this does not necessarily imply that the appendix is vestigial. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"none of the above.\""
