This means that sellers will have less incentive to sell their product at a higher price than what they could charge under a free market. As a result, sellers may choose to reduce the quantity they produce or sell, which could lead to a shortage of coffee in the market.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price floor is set too low, there may be a surplus of coffee available, and consumers may be able to buy more coffee at a lower price. However, this situation is not likely with a price floor, as it aims to stabilize the price of coffee within a certain range rather than allowing it to fluctuate freely. \n\nIn summary, the installation of a price floor in the market for coffee is most likely to cause an increase in the demand for coffee, as it restricts the ability of sellers to charge higher prices."
