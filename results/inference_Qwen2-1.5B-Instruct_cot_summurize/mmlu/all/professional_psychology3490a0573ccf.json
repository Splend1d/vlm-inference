This means that when individuals receive rewards or positive feedback for certain behaviors, they may develop an expectation that these behaviors will continue to be rewarded in the future, which can lead to increased use of those behaviors as a coping mechanism, ultimately contributing to the development of depressive symptoms. Therefore, option B is correct."
