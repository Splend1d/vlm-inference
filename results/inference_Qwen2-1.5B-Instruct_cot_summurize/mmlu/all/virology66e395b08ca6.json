Interacting with a virus infected cell\n\nAntibody-producing cells, also known as B lymphocytes or plasma cells, are stimulated by the presence of an antigen on a virus-infected cell. The immune system recognizes this antigen and activates the B lymphocytes to produce antibodies that can bind to and neutralize the virus. This process is called humoral immunity and involves the activation and proliferation of B lymphocytes in response to antigenic stimulation."
