Although no teacher or school official either encouraged or discouraged the practice, all but two teachers, when present, joined in the invocation. A student and his parents protested to the school superintendent, but they refused to intervene on the grounds that the matter was entirely up to the students. Moreover, school board officials pointed out that the students who led the recital always sat at a table in the rear of the cafeteria and that no one was required to participate in the blessing. In an action by the student's parents to enjoin the daily luncheon invocation at the high school, the court will most likely\n\nA. grant relief, since the invocation violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment.\nB. grant relief, since the primary effect of the invocation is to advance religious beliefs.\nC. deny relief, since the lunch hour is not part of the educational process.\nD. deny relief, since the noncompulsory nature of the invocation would not be violative of the establishment clause.\n"

The court will most likely find that the daily luncheon invocation violates this provision because it promotes religious beliefs without any secular purpose or reason. The fact that the students and their parents protest against the practice does not change this conclusion."
