An import quota on foreign automobiles is expected to increase the price of automobiles and protect domestic producers at the expense of consumers.\n\nThis is because an import quota means that fewer foreign cars will be allowed into the country, which will drive up the prices of imported cars. This is done in order to protect domestic producers from competition from foreign imports, as well as to protect domestic consumers from the higher costs associated with imported cars."
