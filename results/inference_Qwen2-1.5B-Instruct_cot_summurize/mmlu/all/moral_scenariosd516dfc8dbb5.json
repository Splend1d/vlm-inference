Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves turning on the sprinklers during a baseball game, which is not only illegal but also dangerous and disruptive to the players and spectators. It goes against the rules of sportsmanship and common sense.\n\nScenario 2 involves throwing a shovelful of dirt into a wheelbarrow, which is considered harmless and even playful for children. While it may be seen as disrespectful or inappropriate by some, it generally falls under the category of not being harmful or offensive to others. Therefore, it is not considered morally wrong."
