The system of equations Mx = b has a unique solution for each real 5 x 1 column vector b.\n\nThis statement implies that the columns of M are linearly independent, which is not necessarily true if the system has no solutions or infinite solutions (which would violate condition A). Additionally, it does not guarantee that the matrix has non-zero determinants, as there may still be zero divisors in the matrix (condition D). However, the uniqueness of solutions guarantees that the rows of the matrix form a basis for the space of all 5-dimensional vectors, which is equivalent to the columns being linearly independent (condition B). Therefore, condition C is equivalent to none of the other four."
