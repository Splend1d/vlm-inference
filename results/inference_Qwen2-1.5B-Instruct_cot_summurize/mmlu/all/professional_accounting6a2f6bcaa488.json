Yes, No. A CPA who fraudulently issues an unqualified opinion on a materially misstated financial statement can be liable to corporate shareholders and corporate bondholders as well as other stakeholders in the company. This liability arises from the duty of care owed by the CPA to their clients, including the obligation to provide accurate and reliable financial information. If the CPA fails to do so, they may be held accountable for any resulting losses or damages suffered by the client or its stakeholders."
