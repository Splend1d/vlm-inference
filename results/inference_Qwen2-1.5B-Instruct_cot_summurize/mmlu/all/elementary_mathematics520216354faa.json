Point B is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- We know that point A is located at -20.\n- Point B is 5 less than point A, so we can subtract 5 from -20 to find the location of point B: -20 - 5 = -25.\n- Since point B is to the left of point A on the numberline, it means that its location is negative (-25)."
