Centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization\n\nThe literacy rate data provided shows significant improvements in educational attainment for the Russian-speaking population over time, from low levels during the late Imperial period to high rates by the mid-1950s under Soviet rule. This trend aligns closely with the context of centralizing education policies and implementing large-scale state-directed modernization efforts across various sectors, including education, during this period.\n\nWhile other options like educational reform (modern era), syndicalist forms of socio-economic organization, or second-stage industrialization may also be relevant, they do not directly capture the specific focus on education and modernization as seen through the lens of literacy rates. The data suggests a concerted effort towards education that was aimed at improving economic productivity and national identity, which would fit more naturally within the broader framework of state-directed modernization efforts."
