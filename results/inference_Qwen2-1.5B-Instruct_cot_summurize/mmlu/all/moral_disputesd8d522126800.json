When partners in a relationship mutually deny each other's humanity, it can lead to feelings of objectification and dehumanization, which are forms of sexual objectification. Sexual objectification refers to the act of viewing someone as merely an object for sexual pleasure or desire without any regard for their individuality or worth as a human being. This can include behaviors such as belittling, demeaning, or objectifying others based on their physical appearance or gender identity. Therefore, denying another person's humanity through actions such as name-calling, dismissing their opinions, or making them feel inferior can be considered sexual objectification."
