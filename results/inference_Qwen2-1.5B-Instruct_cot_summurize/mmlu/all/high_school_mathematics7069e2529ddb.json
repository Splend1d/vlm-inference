We know that:\n\n- There are 20 boxes in total.\n- 13 boxes contain pencils (and therefore no pens).\n- 9 boxes contain pens (but no pencils).\n- 3 boxes contain neither pens nor pencils.\n\nWe can use these facts to find the number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils (\\(B\\)).\n\nThe total number of boxes containing either pens or pencils is the sum of those with pencils plus those with pens minus those with both (since they're counted twice if we just add them together):\n\n\\[P + Q - B = 20 - 3 = 17.\\]\n\nGiven that 13 boxes contain pencils but none have both pens and pencils (because there are only 9 boxes with pens), we can substitute this information into our equation for the total number of boxes with either pens or pencils:\n\n\\[13 + Q - B = 17.\\]\n\nSince \\(Q\\) includes the 9 boxes with pens and some of these also have pencils, we can subtract the 9 from both sides to get:\n\n\\[Q - B = 8.\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\(B\\):\n\n\\[B = Q - 8.\\]\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the original equation gives us:\n\n\\[13 + Q - (Q - 8) = 17.\\]\n\\[13 + Q - Q + 8 = 17,\\]\n\\[21 + Q = 17,\\]\n\\[Q = 6.\\]\n\nSo, there are 6 boxes that contain pens. Now, using \\(Q\\) to find \\(B\\):\n\n\\[B = Q - 8 = 6 - 8 = -2.\\]\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a negative number of boxes, it seems there was an error in our calculation. Let's re-examine our steps:\n\n\\[B = Q - 8.\\]\n\\[B = 6 - 8 = -2.\\]\n\nThis result doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of boxes. The correct approach should be:\n\n\\[B = P + Q - 3.\\]\n\\[B = 13 + 6 - 3 = 16.\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 16 boxes that contain both pens and pencils, which corresponds to option C. \n\nThe correct answer is **C. 13**."
