                    "text": "To find the dimension of the vector spaces \\(V\\) and \\(W\\), we can use the fact that for any polynomial \\(p(x)\\) of degree at most 3, there exist unique constants \\(a_0,\\,a_1,\\,a_2,\\,a_3\\) such that \\[p(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0.\\] We know from this representation that:\n\n- For \\(p(0) = 0\\), we have \\(a_0 = 0\\).\n- For \\(p(1) = 0\\), we have \\(a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 0\\).\n- For \\(p(-1) = 0\\), we have \\(a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 = 0\\).\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously gives us \\(a_1 = -a_0\\) and \\(a_2 = a_0\\) because they must sum to zero when evaluated at different points. Thus, we have \\(a_3 = 0\\). This means that the only non-zero constant term in our polynomial is \\(a_0 = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\(p(x)\\) with \\(p(0) = 0\\) has exactly one non-zero coefficient, so its degree is exactly 3.\n\nNow let's calculate the dimensions of \\(V\\) and \\(W\\):\n\n- The dimension of \\(V\\) is the number of vectors in it, which is equal to the number of coefficients of \\(p(x)\\) that are not zero.\n- Since \\(p(x)\\) is a cubic polynomial, it has three non-zero coefficients. Therefore, the dimension of \\(V\\) is 3.\n\nFor \\(W\\), we need to count how many polynomials satisfy \\(p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0\\). There are two cases to consider:\n1. If \\(p(x)\\) has a root at \\(x=0\\), then \\(p(x)\\) cannot be divisible by \\(x-0\\), i.e., \\(p(x)\\) cannot have \\(x^2\\) or higher powers of x as a factor. In other words, \\(p(x)\\) must be linear: \\(p(x) = ax + b\\). Solving \\(p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0\\) gives \\(b = 0\\) and \\(a = -2\\) for \\(p(x) = -2x\\), giving one solution. Similarly, if \\(p(x)\\) has a root at \\(x=1\\), then \\(p(x)\\) cannot be divisible by \\(x-1\\), i.e., \\(p(x)\\) must be quadratic: \\(p(x) = bx^2 + c\\). Solving \\(p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0\\) gives \\(c = 0\\) and \\(b = -1/2\\) for \\(p(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2\\), giving another solution. However, since \\(p(x)\\) must also pass through \\(x=-1\\), we get \\(b = -1/2\\) and \\(c = 0\\), giving another solution for \\(p(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2\\).\n\nThus, \\(W\\) contains 3 distinct polynomials that satisfy the given conditions, making its dimension 3.\n\nFinally, the total dimension of both \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) is \\(3 + 3 = 6\\).\n\nThe correct answer is C. 6."
