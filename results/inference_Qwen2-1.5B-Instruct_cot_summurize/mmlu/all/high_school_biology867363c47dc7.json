It is a restriction enzyme extracted from E. coli.\n\nEcoR1 is a type of restriction enzyme that is commonly used in molecular biology to cut DNA at specific sites and expose single-stranded DNA fragments for further manipulation or cloning into other DNA molecules. This makes it useful for cutting DNA sequences to facilitate gene cloning and other genetic manipulations."
