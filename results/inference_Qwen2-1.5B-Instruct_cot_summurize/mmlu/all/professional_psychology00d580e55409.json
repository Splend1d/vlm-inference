Its span is limited by the number and form of the items presented.\n\nShort-term memory (STM) refers to the ability to store, encode, and retrieve small amounts of information for a brief period of time, typically less than 15 seconds. The span of STM is determined by the number and complexity of items stored in the memory. As more items are added or the order of the items changes, the amount of information that can be remembered decreases. Therefore, STM is affected by interference, which occurs when new information is presented while old information is still present in the mind. Interference can cause the recall of the old information to become distorted or even forgotten altogether."
