This allows for transparency and accountability in the audit process. It is important to note that an auditor may not have enough information to form an opinion about the fairness of the financial statements, so it would be inappropriate to state that they do not provide such an opinion. Additionally, an auditor may not have sufficient evidence to determine whether the internal controls over royalty payments are effective, so it would be inappropriate to state that they believe they are. Finally, while the sufficiency of the procedures is the responsibility of the auditor, it is also the responsibility of the client to ensure that the procedures are appropriate and effective."
