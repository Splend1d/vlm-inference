The goal of hypnosis is to facilitate relaxation and enhance suggestibility, allowing the therapist to guide the client into a trance-like state where they may be more susceptible to suggestions or ideas. However, the therapist must also be able to terminate the session at any time if the client desires or feels uncomfortable. \n\nIt is important to note that not all individuals respond well to hypnosis and some may experience negative effects such as confusion, anxiety, or even withdrawal symptoms when their exposure to hypnosis ends. Therefore, it is essential for therapists to have appropriate training and experience in order to safely and effectively use hypnosis as a therapeutic tool."
