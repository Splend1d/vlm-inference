Utilitarianism\n\nUtilitarianism argues that actions should be judged based on their outcomes, and that the greatest happiness for the greatest number is the best course of action. This could lead to a situation where certain human rights may not be considered important if they do not result in overall positive outcomes. Therefore, utilitarianism could argue against the idea that all humans have equal rights regardless of context or culture. \n\nCommunitarianism, cognitivism, and positivism do not necessarily relate directly to the argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. However, they can be seen as arguments for different perspectives on what constitutes an ethical framework or standard. For example, communitarianism might argue that cultural norms and values play a significant role in determining what is ethical, while cognitivism might argue that morality is entirely dependent on individual beliefs and opinions, which could make it difficult to establish universal standards of ethics. Positivism might argue that ethical principles are objective and independent of personal beliefs or cultural context, making it difficult to determine when a particular action violates those principles."
