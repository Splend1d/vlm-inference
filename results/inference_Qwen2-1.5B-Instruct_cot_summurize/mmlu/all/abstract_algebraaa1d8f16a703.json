An integral domain is a commutative ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Therefore, for any elements a, b in R[x], if a and b are not both zero, their product ab is also not zero, making R[x] an integral domain.\n\nThis statement is true because it directly follows from the definition of an integral domain.\n\nStatement 2: \"If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg (f(x)g(x)) = deg f(x) + deg g(x).\"\n\nThe degree of a polynomial is defined as the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial. The degree of a product of two polynomials is equal to the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\n\nTherefore, for any polynomials f(x) and g(x) in R[x],\ndeg(f(x)g(x)) = deg(f(x)) + deg(g(x)).\nThis statement is also true, given the properties of polynomial degrees.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is A. True, True."
