According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action would be considered cruel and unusual treatment of an animal, and could potentially lead to legal consequences for the person who performed the act.\nOn the other hand, the main character who used \"I\" in scenario 2 is not doing anything that is clearly morally wrong because giving a child a biscuit to chew on is generally considered safe and appropriate behavior. However, if the child has teething issues, it may be necessary to provide some type of relief, such as a cold compress or a soft object to chew on. In either case, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before providing any form of treatment to a child, regardless of whether it is related to teething or another issue."
