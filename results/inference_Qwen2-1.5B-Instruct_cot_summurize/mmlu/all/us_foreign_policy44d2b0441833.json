They believe that individual countries should be able to make their own decisions about how to promote their own interests, without being influenced by other nations.\n\nTherefore, they tend to object to the influence of exceptionalism on American foreign policy, which they view as promoting a single country's interests at the expense of others. This can lead to a diminished focus on collective security and a diminished focus on power and interest among the international community."
