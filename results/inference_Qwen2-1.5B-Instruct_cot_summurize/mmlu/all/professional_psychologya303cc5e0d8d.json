It tells us how much two variables change together (positive correlation) or whether they move independently from each other (negative correlation). In this case, if there is a positive correlation between two sets of test scores, it means that as one set increases, so does the other set, indicating a direct relationship between them.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct."
