The bank is considering two options: a single line where the customer at the front waits for the next available teller, or separate lines for each teller. The bank decides to use a computer simulation of these two options to determine the average wait time for customers. Which of the following is NOT true about the bank's plan?\n\nA. The bank can incorporate other factors, such as the number of tellers, in the simulation.\nB. The bank can use the simulation to investigate these two options without causing inconvenience for customers.\nC. The bank may consider new alternatives based on the simulation results.\nD.
