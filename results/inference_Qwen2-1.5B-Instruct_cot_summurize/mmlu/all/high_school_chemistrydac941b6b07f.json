Since the pH is the negative log of the concentration of the base at equilibrium, we have:\n\n\\[pH = -\\log \\left( \\frac{[\\text{undissolved acid}]}{\\text{total volume of solution}} \\right) = -\\log \\left( \\frac{0.25}{0.25} \\right) = -\\log 1 = 0\\]\n\nThis means that the total concentration of the acid in the solution is 0.25 M. We also know that the total volume of the solution is 0.25 L.\n\nNow, let's use the information about the pH to find the pKa:\n\n\\[pH = -\\log \\left( \\frac{[\\text{undissolved acid}]_0}{[H^+]_0} \\right)\\]\n\\[0 = -\\log \\left( \\frac{0.25}{[H^+]} \\right)\\]\n\\[1 = \\log \\left( \\frac{0.25}{[H^+]} \\right)\\]\n\\[-\\log \\left( \\frac{0.25}{[H^+]} \\right) = 1\\]\n\\[\\log \\left( \\frac{0.25}{[H^+]} \\right) = -1\\]\n\\[\\frac{0.25}{[H^+]} = 10^{-1}\\]\n\\[\\frac{0.25}{[H^+]} = 0.1\\]\n\\[[H^+] = \\frac{0.25}{0.1} = 2.5\\]\n\nTherefore, the hydrogen ion concentration ([H^+]) in the solution is 2.5 M. Now, we can calculate the pKa:\n\n\\[pK_a = -\\log \\frac{[\\text{acid}]}{[\\text{base}]}_{\\text{at equilibrium}}\\]\n\\[pK_a = -\\log \\frac{0.25}{2.5} = -\\log 0.1 = 1\\]\n\nSo, the pKa of the weak acid is 1. This corresponds to option D."
