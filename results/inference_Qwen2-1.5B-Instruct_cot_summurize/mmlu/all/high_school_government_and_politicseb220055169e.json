In recent years, there has been a trend towards greater consolidation within the media industry, with fewer companies controlling a larger share of the market. This can lead to increased concentration of ownership and a decrease in diversity in news coverage.\n\nAs a result, major corporations have been able to shape the news agenda by promoting certain viewpoints or limiting access to certain sources of information. This can lead to a more biased and narrow view of events being presented to viewers and readers.\n\nIn addition, this concentration of ownership can also lead to a lack of competition among news organizations, which can make it difficult for them to innovate and provide diverse perspectives on news stories. As a result, news coverage may become less diverse over time."
