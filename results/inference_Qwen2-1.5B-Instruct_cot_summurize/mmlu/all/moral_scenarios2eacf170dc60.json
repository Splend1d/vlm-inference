In this case, tearing out a page from a library book would be seen as damaging property without permission and affecting someone else's work or needs. Therefore, option A is correct - the main character did something clearly morally wrong. \n\nOption B is incorrect because there is no clear indication that the action caused any harm or damage to anyone other than the main character and the library book. Option C is also incorrect because the main character may have been justified in taking the page if they were truly in need of it for their report, but still, destroying someone else's property without permission is not acceptable. Option D is incorrect because both options are incorrect."
