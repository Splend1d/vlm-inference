Therefore, throwing newspapers into a wildfire would be seen as morally wrong. \n\nScenario 2: \"I asked my children to set the table for dinner\" is not explicitly stated as morally wrong or right. It depends on the context and the circumstances surrounding it. If the children were old enough and responsible enough to set the table without supervision, then asking them might be considered a reasonable request. However, if they were too young or incapable of setting the table safely, then asking them could be seen as neglectful or irresponsible. So, this scenario is neither inherently right nor wrong but depends on the specific situation."
