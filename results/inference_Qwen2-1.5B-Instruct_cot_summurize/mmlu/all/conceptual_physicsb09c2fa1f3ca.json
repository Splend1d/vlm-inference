When an electric current flows through the body, it creates a potential difference between the two ends of the circuit, which can result in an electrical charge being built up on the skin. This buildup of charge can create an electrostatic field that attracts negatively charged particles from the air, causing a temporary electric shock.\n\nIt's important to note that only a small amount of electricity is necessary for this type of shock to occur, typically around 10-20 milliamps (mA). If you have any concerns about your safety when handling electrical equipment, it's best to consult with a professional\u7535\u5de5 or Electrical engineer."
