The prosecutor stated that the visitor knew the child personally, which is why the child went with him, and that the perpetrator knew the child's parents had money. The prosecutor called a witness to testify that the perpetrator told the witness \"I am looking forward to visiting with the child and his parents. They have a wonderfully luxurious house that I will enjoy staying in.'' The defense objected to the proposed testimony. Will the court likely sustain the objection?\n\nA. No, the statement is admissible to impeach the accused and establish he is lying on cross, if he takes the stand.\nB. No, the statement can come in as impeachment if the accused takes the stand, and as a party admission to show the material facts of knowing the child and that the family had money.\nC. Yes, the prejudice of the statement will greatly outweigh its probative value.\nD. Yes, the statement is irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence.\n"
