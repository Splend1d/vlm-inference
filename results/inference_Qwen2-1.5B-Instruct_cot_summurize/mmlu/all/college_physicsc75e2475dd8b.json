According to the problem statement, it takes twice as much work to stretch the second spring by half the initial distance compared to the first spring. This means that:\n\n\\[ F_2 \\cdot \\frac{x}{2} = 2 \\cdot F_1 \\cdot x \\]\n\\[ \\frac{F_2}{F_1} = 2 \\]\n\nNow, let's denote the force constant of the first spring as \\(k\\), so \\(F_1 = kx\\). Then, using the equation above, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{kx}{k} = 2 \\cdot kx \\]\n\\[ 1 = 2 \\]\n\nThis is a contradiction because the left side of the equation equals 1, but the right side is not equal to 2. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in the interpretation or setup of the problem. In a real scenario, if you were asked to find the force constant of a second spring based on its ability to stretch another spring by half the original distance, the answer would simply be the same as the original spring, i.e., \\(k\\).\n\nHowever, without further clarification, we cannot definitively say what the correct answer should be based solely on the information provided. If the question intends for us to consider the force constants of the springs rather than their respective stretches, then the force constant of the second spring could indeed be \\(2k\\). But without additional context, the best approach is to assume the intended relationship between the forces and displacements applies."
