This increase in aggregate demand will push up prices, as there will be more buyers willing to pay higher prices for the limited supply of goods and services.\n\nAs a result, the price level (the average level of prices) will increase. The increase in prices will cause the nominal value of GDP to rise because it includes the nominal values of all goods and services sold, even if their actual prices have increased.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. GDP increases and the price level increases."
