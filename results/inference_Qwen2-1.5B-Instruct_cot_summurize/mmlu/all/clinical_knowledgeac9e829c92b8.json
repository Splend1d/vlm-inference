During this process, ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), which then reassembles into another molecule of ATP within the muscle cell. This rapid ATP production allows for sustained energy release during exercise, helping to maintain performance levels over longer periods of time compared to glycolysis or other anaerobic pathways. Glycolysis occurs at lower intensities and provides more ATP per glucose molecule, while aerobic metabolism (including the Krebs cycle) produces less ATP but can be sustained over longer periods without significant depletion of ATP."
