                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The blood lactate concentration in soccer and other sports can increase throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued. This is because lactate is produced by anaerobic metabolism, which occurs when oxygen is not available to cells for energy production. As the body becomes less able to produce enough ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through aerobic respiration, it turns to anaerobic pathways such as lactic acid fermentation, which produces lactate instead. Therefore, lactate levels will typically increase as fatigue sets in. However, the specific range and rate of increase may vary depending on factors such as fitness level, training intensity, and overall physical condition."
