A virtual team can be located anywhere in the world, as long as they have access to technology and communication tools that allow them to work together effectively. The other options do not necessarily apply to all types of virtual teams, as some may prefer to work in the same building or with people from the same industry. However, it's important to note that remote work can also bring its own challenges such as isolation and lack of physical interaction, which may require additional support and collaboration strategies."
