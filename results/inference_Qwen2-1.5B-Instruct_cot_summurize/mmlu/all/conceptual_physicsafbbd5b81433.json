The volume also doubles because the cube of the length is doubled.\n- If you triple the length of an object, the surface area triples because the square of the length is tripled. The volume also triples because the cube of the length is tripled.\n\nTherefore, when you scale up an object to three times its linear size, both the surface area and volume will increase by a factor of 9.\n\nSo the correct answer is C. 9 and the volume by 27."
