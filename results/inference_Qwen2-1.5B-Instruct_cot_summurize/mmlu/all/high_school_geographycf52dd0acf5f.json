They show roads, highways, streets, and other features of the landscape that can help them navigate through different areas of a city or country. While a mental map may be helpful for someone who is familiar with the area, it does not provide the same level of detail and information as a road map. Similarly, a world globe or Rand-McNally Road Atlas would also not be appropriate for navigation purposes."
