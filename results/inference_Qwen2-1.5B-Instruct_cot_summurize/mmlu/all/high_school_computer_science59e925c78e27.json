Customers will be unable to mistakenly select the incorrect department for their particular issue.\n\nWhile an upgraded system may improve customer service in many ways, it is unlikely that it would eliminate the need for human representatives altogether. In fact, while automated systems can certainly help streamline certain processes and reduce wait times, they still require human intervention to handle more complex issues or to resolve problems that cannot be handled automatically.\n\nAdditionally, even with an improved system, customers may still face challenges if they have trouble understanding the automated responses or if there are technical issues with the system itself. In these cases, human representatives could still be necessary to assist customers who are having difficulty navigating the system.\n\nTherefore, while an upgraded system may offer some benefits, it is unlikely to completely eliminate the need for human representatives to address customer inquiries."
