The fact that 82% of the responses came from those who agreed with the statement suggests that there may be some bias or selective sampling involved in the respondents' willingness to respond. Without further information about the characteristics of the audience and how they were selected, it is difficult to determine whether the results represent a true reflection of public opinion or simply reflect the opinions of those who participated. Therefore, it is important to consider other factors such as the wording of the question, the tone of the discussion, and the demographics of the audience when interpreting survey results."
