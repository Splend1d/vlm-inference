This matches our initial assumption that the population must have been slightly over 4,500,000 to round down to the nearest 10,000.\n\nOption C: 4,533,372 rounds up to 4,533,400, which is not exactly 10,000 more than 4,533,372, and therefore does not round down to the nearest 10,000.\n\nOption D: 4,535,343 rounds up to 4,535,350, which is exactly 10,000 more than 4,535,343, but rounding down to the nearest 10,000 would give us 4,535,343, which is already at or just under the threshold of rounding to the nearest 10,000.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the rounding rules, the only option that makes sense as being the actual population of Louisiana in 2010 is **Option B**."
