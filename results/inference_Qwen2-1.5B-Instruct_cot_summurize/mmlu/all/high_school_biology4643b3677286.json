This process involves the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which can be used for energy production or further catabolism in the body. Hydrolysis refers to the breaking down of substances through the action of enzymes that break chemical bonds between molecules, but it does not involve the conversion of one substance into another. The other options listed (conversion of fats to fatty acids and glycerol, conversion of proteins to amino acids, and conversion of starch to simple sugars) all involve the breakdown of molecules into smaller components through hydrolytic processes."
