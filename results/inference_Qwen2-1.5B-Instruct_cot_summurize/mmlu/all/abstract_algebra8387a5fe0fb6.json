This group is abelian and satisfies g = g^(-1) for all elements g in Z_6, but it also has an element that does not have an inverse, such as 3. In this case, g = 3 does not satisfy g = g^(-1). Therefore, A is not necessarily true.\n\nB. g = g^2 for every g in G\n\nIt is possible for a group to be abelian and satisfy g = g^2 for all g in G, but it is not necessary. For example, consider the Klein four-group V4. This group is abelian and satisfies g = g^2 for all elements g in V4, but it also has non-abelian subgroups. Therefore, B is not necessarily true.\n\nC. (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G\n\nIf G is abelian, then (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 holds for every g, h in G. This is because if two elements commute, their product commutes with itself, and the operation on the left and right sides of the equation are both associative. Therefore, C is true.\n\nD. G is of finite order\n\nIf G is abelian, then its order must be a power of 2 or 4. This is because if the order of G is n, then G can be generated by any element of order n, and since G is abelian, any two generators commute, so the order of the subgroup generated by them is at most half the order of G. However, if G is of infinite order, then it cannot be generated by any element, and thus cannot be abelian. Therefore, D is false.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is:\n\nC. (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G"
