For example, sound waves in air can be thought of as having both longitudinal (vibrating particles moving back and forth) and perpendicular (vibrations of the medium itself) components. Similarly, electromagnetic waves can also have both longitudinal and perpendicular components due to their interaction with the medium they travel through."
