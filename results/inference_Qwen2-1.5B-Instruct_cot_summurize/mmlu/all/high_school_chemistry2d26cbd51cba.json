                    "text": "To determine the H+ concentration in a solution of phenol, we need to calculate the pH of the solution and then use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nGiven:\nKa = 1 \u00d7 10^-10\n\nWe know that the pH of a buffer solution can be calculated using the formula:\npH = -log([H+])\n\nWhere [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions.\nFor phenol, the pKb is equal to the Ka value because it's a strong base, so:\npH = 2 * log(Ka)\npH = 2 * log(1 * 10^-10)\npH = 2 * (-10)\npH = -2\n\nSince the pKb is negative, the pOH is also negative. We know that the pH + pOH = 14 (the standard pH scale), so we can find the pOH:\npOH = 14 - pH\npOH = 14 - (-2)\npOH = 16\n\nNow, we have the pOH and the pKb, which allows us to find the [H+] using the Henderson-Hasselbach equation:\n[H+] = [OH-] / (1 - Kw/Kb)\n\nFirst, we need to find Kb, the constant for phenol. For this, we use the Ka value:\n[OH-] = Ka / (pKb + pH)\n[OH-] = 1 * 10^-10 / (1 * 10^-6 + -2)\n[OH-] = 1 * 10^-10 / -1.8\n[OH-] = 5.27 * 10^-11 M\n\nNext, we plug in the values into the equation:\n[H+] = [OH-] / (1 - Kb)\n[H+] = 5.27 * 10^-11 / (1 - 1 * 10^-6)\n[H+] = 5.27 * 10^-11 / 9.99999\n[H+] \u2248 0.527 * 10^-1 M\n\nSo, the H+ concentration in the solution is approximately 5.27 * 10^-1 M or 1 * 10^-5 M. The correct answer is D. 1 \u00d7 10^-5 M."
