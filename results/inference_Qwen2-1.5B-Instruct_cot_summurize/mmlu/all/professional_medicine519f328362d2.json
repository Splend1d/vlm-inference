All the toes on the right foot have turned black. He has become slightly febrile and progressively more confused during the past few days. Examination discloses cellulitis in the midfoot. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?\n\nA. Amputation\nB. Application of topical collagenase\nC. Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes\nD. Hyperbaric oxygen\n"

Amputation\n\nThis is because the patient's condition, which includes severe frostbite, cellulitis, and confusion, suggests that the toe infection may have spread beyond its original location. Amputation can prevent further complications such as gangrene or amputee infection.\n\nIt is not appropriate to use topical collagenase, apply debridement of necrotic skin, or administer hyperbaric oxygen without proper medical supervision, as these treatments might exacerbate the infection if used incorrectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Amputation."
