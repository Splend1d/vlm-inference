It does this by making provisions in UK law that mirror the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is an international treaty that sets out certain rights and freedoms for individuals around the world.\n\nThe Human Rights Act 1998 also provides for the possibility of challenging primary legislation that conflicts with human rights protections under domestic law. This means that courts can be used as a mechanism to challenge the constitutionality of laws that infringe upon individual rights.\n\nFinally, the Human Rights Act 1998 also allows anyone who has a \"reasonable case\" to bring a claim before a court, meaning that it provides a way for people to challenge actions or policies that they believe violate their human rights.\n\nTherefore, all of the statements provided are correct."
