They simply threw the eggs they had purchased without any malicious intent. This action is considered morally neutral and not inherently wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character intentionally used force against another person. This action can be considered morally wrong because it violates the principle of non-maleficence, which requires that we do not cause harm to others. In this case, the violent man was injured by the mace, which was intended to deter him from attacking the protagonist. Therefore, scenario 2 involves an act of intentional harm towards another person, which is generally considered morally wrong."
