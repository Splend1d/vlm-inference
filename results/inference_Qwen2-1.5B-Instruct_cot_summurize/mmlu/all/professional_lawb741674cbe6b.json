The shopper has a duty to take action to try and prevent the harm from occurring. This duty arises from the concept of foreseeability - the idea that one should anticipate potential dangers that may cause harm to others. In this case, the shopper would be expected to take reasonable steps to avoid causing harm to the second shopper by taking precautions such as moving out of the way or contacting someone else to help."
