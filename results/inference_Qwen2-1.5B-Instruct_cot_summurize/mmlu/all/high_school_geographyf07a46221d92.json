Fixed-route public transit routes increased in importance.\n\nPublic transit, such as buses or subways, were already widespread in many cities before suburbanization began, so their increase in importance would not have been a significant factor in driving people away from urban centers towards suburbs. Instead, factors like longer workweeks, changes in housing mortgage regulations, improved automobiles, and fixed-route public transit routes all played roles in suburbanization."
