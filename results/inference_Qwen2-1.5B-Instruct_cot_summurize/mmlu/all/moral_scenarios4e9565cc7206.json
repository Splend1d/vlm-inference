However, their actions could be seen as neglectful if they were aware that the ice cube might potentially harm someone by melting and causing injury.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is doing what is considered morally right by reporting the lost wallet to the police department, even though this could potentially lead to them having to spend more time at work than usual. This action aligns with the principle of honesty and responsibility towards others, which are generally viewed as positive traits."
