This means that all the matter and energy in the universe had a lower density and therefore a higher pressure. As a result, the expansion of the universe was faster at that time, causing the distance between galaxies to be closer together.\n\nToday, when the temperature of the universe is around 3K, the expansion of the universe has slowed down significantly, leading to larger distances between galaxies. Therefore, the answer is not A or C, which suggest that the distance between galaxies was smaller in the past due to the high temperature. \n\nOption D suggests that the distance between galaxies was twice as far as it is today, but this contradicts the fact that the expansion of the universe has slowed down over time. So option D is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: one-half as distant as they are today."
