In general, customary crimes refer to practices or behaviors that are widely accepted as part of a particular community's culture or customs. These can include acts such as theft, assault, or murder.\nIn some cases, customary crimes may be recognized by English law if they meet certain criteria. For example, a court may decide that a particular custom or practice constitutes a crime based on its prevalence and seriousness. However, it is important to note that the incorporation of customary crimes under English law is not automatic, and requires careful consideration and analysis by the judiciary.\nTherefore, the answer to your question is D: \"the situation is not clear-cut but an act of parliament would most probably be required.\""
