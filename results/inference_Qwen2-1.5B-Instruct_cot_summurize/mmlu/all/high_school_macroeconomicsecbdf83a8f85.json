The entire consumption function would shift upward.\n\nIf households are more optimistic about the future, they may have higher levels of income and spending, which could lead to an upward shift in the consumption function. This is because increased income typically leads to an increase in consumer spending, as people use their additional income to purchase goods and services that meet their needs and wants. As a result, the consumption function would shift upwards due to the positive effect of higher incomes on consumer spending."
