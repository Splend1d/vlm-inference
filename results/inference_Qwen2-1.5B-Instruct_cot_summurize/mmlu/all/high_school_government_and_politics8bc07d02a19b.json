Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.\n\nAppellate courts are responsible for reviewing and overturning decisions made by lower courts, including trial courts. They do not typically decide new facts or evidence, but rather examine whether the lower court's decision was proper based on established legal principles and precedents. While appellate judges may sometimes use their own judgment to make rulings, they must generally follow the law as it has been previously decided by other courts."
