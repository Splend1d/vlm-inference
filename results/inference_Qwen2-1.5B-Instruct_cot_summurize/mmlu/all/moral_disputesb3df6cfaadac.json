McGinnis, who coined the term \"expressive harm,\" sexual violence can occur without intention or with intent but without necessarily causing physical harm. The goal of such acts is often psychological or symbolic rather than physical. This concept challenges traditional views on rape as an act that must always result in physical injury for it to be considered harmful. \n\nSo, according to McGinnis, even if no physical harm occurs, there can still be a level of harm that meets his definition of expressive harm. However, this does not mean that the act itself is not harmful in some way. It just means that the impact of the act may not necessarily include physical injury or damage."
