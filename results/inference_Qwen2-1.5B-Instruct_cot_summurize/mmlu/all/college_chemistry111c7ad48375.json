Therefore, the boiling point of argon is higher than that of neon.\nOption A (melting point) and option B (boiling point) cannot be compared because they refer to different physical properties. Option C (polarizability) refers to the ability of an atom or molecule to interact with a magnetic field, which can change its polarization. Argon and neon do not have significant polarizabilities, so this property cannot be used to compare their melting points.\nOption D (first ionization energy) refers to the energy required to remove the first electron from an atom. The first ionization energy of argon is about 56 kJ/mol, while the first ionization energy of neon is about 80 kJ/mol. Therefore, the first ionization energy of argon is higher than that of neon.\nTherefore, the answer is A. Melting point."
