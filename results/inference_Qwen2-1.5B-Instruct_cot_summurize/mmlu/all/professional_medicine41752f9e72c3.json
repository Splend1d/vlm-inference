Ultrasonography can help distinguish between benign and malignant thyroid nodules by assessing their size, shape, and internal structures. It is also useful in evaluating the presence of other salivary glands in the area. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and nuclear thyroid scan may be needed if the ultrasound findings are ambiguous or suspicious. An iodine-131 scan is not typically used for thyroid lesions."
