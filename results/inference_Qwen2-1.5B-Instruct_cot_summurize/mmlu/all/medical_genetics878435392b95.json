This mutation leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin molecules called sickle-shaped hemoglobin (sHb), which can cause serious health problems such as pain and organ damage when they block blood vessels.\n\nThere is no direct evidence that a deletion or duplication occurs during the development of \u03b2-thalassaemia. However, it is possible that some mutations may lead to a change in the structure or function of the beta-globin genes, resulting in the production of sHb instead of normal hemoglobin. This could potentially result in the formation of sickle-shaped hemoglobin, leading to the symptoms associated with \u03b2-thalassaemia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. a point mutation."
