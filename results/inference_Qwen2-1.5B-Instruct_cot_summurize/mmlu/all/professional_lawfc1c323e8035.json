To do so, they must present evidence linking the defendant to the alleged victim and the circumstances surrounding their relationship. This includes showing that the defendant has a history of committing similar offenses, such as sexual abuse of another child.\n\nWhen presented with the possibility that the defendant may have committed similar crimes before, the defense can challenge the credibility of the prosecution's case. However, the prosecution has a duty to introduce relevant evidence to support its claim that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If the evidence relating to prior offenses is deemed prejudicial, the court will typically allow limiting instructions to the jury to instruct them on how to consider the probative value versus the prejudicial impact of the evidence.\n\nIn summary, while the introduction of evidence from past cases involving other children may be considered prejudicial, it can still be admitted if the prosecution establishes that the defendant is more likely than not to have committed the crime at issue."
