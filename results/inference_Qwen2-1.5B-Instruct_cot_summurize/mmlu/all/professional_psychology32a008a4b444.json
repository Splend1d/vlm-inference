A teacher telling a student, \"You can do that if you want to, but I would appreciate it if you would not.\" This type of message is known as a double-bind message because it creates a situation where the person receiving the message feels trapped or obligated to choose between two options that both have negative consequences for them. In this case, the teacher's statement has a positive connotation (it suggests that doing what the student wants will be appreciated) while also having a negative consequence (the teacher may feel frustrated or upset if the student chooses not to follow their wishes)."
