They were known for their advanced agricultural techniques, including the cultivation of maize (corn) and squash. The Hohokam developed sophisticated irrigation systems and terracing techniques to grow crops on steep hillsides. Their agricultural practices allowed them to sustain large populations while also supporting trade with neighboring tribes."
