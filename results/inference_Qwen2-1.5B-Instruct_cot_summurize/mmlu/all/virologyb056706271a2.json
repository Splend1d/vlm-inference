It can vary depending on the specific virus and the individual's immune response, but in general, it typically lasts between 1-24 days.\n\nDuring this period, the virus replicates inside the host cell and spreads throughout the body. This is when the virus becomes active and starts causing symptoms. However, not all individuals will experience symptoms immediately after exposure. Some may have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all before developing more severe ones later on. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be B - Virus replication happens at an intracellular level."
