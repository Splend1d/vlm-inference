Her coworkers became concerned when she did not arrive for work. On arrival, she is unable to provide a history. Her pulse is 96/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 124/58 mm Hg. Examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs. Her serum creatine kinase activity is 10,300 U/L. Urine toxicology screening is positive for opiates and cocaine. Urine dipstick is strongly positive for blood. Microscopic examination of the urine shows pigmented granular casts and rare erythrocytes. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions over the next 24 hours?\n\nA. Acute respiratory distress syndrome\nB. Acute tubular necrosis\nC. Cerebral edema\nD. Cerebral hemorrhage\n"

The presence of microcysts in the urine and strong positivity for blood suggest that there may be bleeding into the brain tissue. This is commonly seen in cases of acute tubular necrosis or cerebral edema. However, without further evaluation, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the cerebral edema."
