It is important to remember that what might be seen as \"wrong\" or \"morally wrong\" can vary widely depending on cultural context, personal beliefs, and individual values. In this case, the act of fixing a cat with garden shears is considered acceptable within many cultures and societies. \n\nScenario 2 is also not considered morally wrong. Checking your teenager's bedroom closet for him to clean may seem intrusive or even inappropriate, but it is still generally considered acceptable behavior. The act of helping someone who needs help is often considered a good deed and is not inherently wrong."
