If the trait reaps the best return for the cost relative to alternative forms of the trait, that trait will win out over the alternative forms.\n\nOptimal theory suggests that natural selection favors traits that provide the greatest benefit to an individual, but at the same time do not come with high costs. In other words, optimal theory assumes that natural selection acts on individuals based on their ability to survive and reproduce, rather than solely on their physical appearance or behavior. Therefore, if one trait provides more benefits than another, it is likely to become more common in the population over time. This is because individuals who possess this advantageous trait have a higher chance of survival and reproduction compared to individuals who lack it."
