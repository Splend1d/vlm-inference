As a result, buyers have many options to choose from, and they often negotiate prices and quantities with suppliers to get what they want at the best price.\n\nOn the other hand, in a monopolistic input market, there is only one supplier of the input good, and this supplier has complete control over its production process. The supplier sets the price and quantity of the input goods it offers, and buyers must buy from this single supplier or face higher costs or reduced availability.\n\nTherefore, in a monopolistic input market, the buyer (i.e., the company) pays less for the input goods than would be possible in a competitive market, and it hires more workers to produce the output goods."
