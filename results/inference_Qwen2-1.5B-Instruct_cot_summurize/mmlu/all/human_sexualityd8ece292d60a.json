All of the above.\n\nThe anatomical differences between males and females can be seen in several areas including:\n\n- Males typically have only one exit structure for urine and reproductive fluids (the urethra), while females have two: the urethra and the vagina.\n- Males often have an external sexual organ called the penis, which gets engorged with blood during sexual arousal. Females do not have any external sexual organs or structures related to reproduction.\n- The anatomy of the male genitalia also includes the testes, which produce sperm cells. In contrast, the female genitalia do not include testicles or other reproductive organs.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are incorrect."
