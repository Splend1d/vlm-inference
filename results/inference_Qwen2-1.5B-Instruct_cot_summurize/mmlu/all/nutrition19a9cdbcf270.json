When there is low levels of leptin, it can lead to increased energy intake as the body tries to compensate for the lack of regulation. This condition is known as leptin resistance or leptin deficiency. \n\nIn contrast, leptin resistance occurs when the body becomes resistant to the effects of leptin, even though the hormone is still present in the bloodstream. This can occur due to genetic factors, obesity, or other health conditions. Leptin resistance can lead to weight gain and metabolic syndrome."
