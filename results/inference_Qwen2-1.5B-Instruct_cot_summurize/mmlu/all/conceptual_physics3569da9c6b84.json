This means that the magnetic field strength also increases. Using a ferromagnetic material (like iron) as a core for the coil can also increase the magnetic field strength by allowing more magnetic flux to pass through the coil. The size of the coil does not directly affect the magnetic field strength, but rather the amount of magnetic flux passing through the coil. An air-core electromagnet uses a non-magnetic conductor (air) as its core instead of a ferromagnetic material, which reduces the magnetic field strength compared to a magnet with a ferromagnetic core. Increasing the diameter of the coil may also increase the magnetic field strength if the number of turns per unit length remains constant, but this is less common due to practical considerations such as coil design and manufacturing tolerances."
