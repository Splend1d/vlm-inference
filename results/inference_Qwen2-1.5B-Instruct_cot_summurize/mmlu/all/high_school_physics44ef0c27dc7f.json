Yes, and the work done will be positive.\n\nWhen an object (in this case, the man standing in the elevator) is subjected to a force (the normal force from the floor), there is a change in its position (it moves up). The amount of work done by the normal force is calculated using the formula:\n\nWork = Force \u00d7 Distance\n\nIn this scenario, the distance moved by the man is equal to his height above the ground when he reaches the top floor. So, the work done by the normal force will be positive because the man's height increases during his ascent. Therefore, option A is correct."
