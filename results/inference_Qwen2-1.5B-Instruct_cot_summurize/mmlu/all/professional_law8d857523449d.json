In accordance with the bylaws of the league's charter, the commissioner was required to obtain the approval of at least half the owners before raising his expense allocation. At trial, the commissioner seeks to testify that his predecessor told him that he had authority under the league's charter to raise his expense allocation. The commissioner's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent.\nB. admissible as evidence of the routine practice of an organization.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the league's charter is the best evidence.\n"

Testimony about a previous incident or statement cannot be used against the declarant in subsequent proceedings, unless the prior statement was made under oath and corroborated by other evidence. In this case, there is no corroboration for the commissioner's claim that his predecessor authorized his actions. Therefore, the commissioner's testimony is inadmissible."
