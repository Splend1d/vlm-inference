When excess reserves increase by $700, this means the total amount of excess reserves becomes:\n\n$1000 (original deposits) + $700 (increase in excess reserves) = $1700\n\nNow, let's find out what proportion of the total deposits ($1000) these excess reserves represent:\n\n$$\\frac{Total \\, Excess \\, Reserves}{Total \\, Deposits} = \\frac{$1700}{$1000} = 1.7$$\n\nThis means that $1.7 or 170% of the total deposits are now considered excess reserves. \n\nSo, the correct answer is A: 70%."
