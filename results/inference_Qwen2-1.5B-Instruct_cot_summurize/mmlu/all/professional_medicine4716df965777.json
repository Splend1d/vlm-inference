Additionally, it is important to consider other potential causes such as gastrointestinal bleeding or inflammation, which can be caused by stress or caffeine intake. A CBC may also help determine if there is an underlying cause of iron deficiency anemia or other nutritional deficiencies that could be contributing to the symptoms. It is not appropriate to order an abdominal flat plate radiography or a urine pregnancy test without further evaluation."
