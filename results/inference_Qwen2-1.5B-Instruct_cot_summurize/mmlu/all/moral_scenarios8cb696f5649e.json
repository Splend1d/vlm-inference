This action goes against the principles of empathy, respect for life, and self-control.\n\nScenario 2 involves running a comb through one's husband's hair, which is generally considered harmless and within the boundaries of normal household chores. However, if it causes emotional distress or discomfort to the husband, it could potentially be seen as disrespectful or inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, based on the context and the potential consequences of each scenario, both scenarios involve actions that can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The correct answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong."
