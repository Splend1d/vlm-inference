                    "text": "Let's analyze both statements one by one:\n\nStatement 1: \"If \\(G\\), \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) are groups of order 4, at least two of them are isomorphic.\"\n\nThis statement is true. In group theory, if the order (number of elements) of a group is a power of a prime number (in this case, 4 = 2^2), then every element in that group can be expressed as a product of powers of these prime numbers. This means that for any non-identity element \\(g\\) in \\(G\\), there exists an integer \\(k\\) such that \\(g^k = e_G\\). The same applies to \\(H\\) and \\(K\\). Thus, all three groups are isomorphic to each other, because they have the same structure.\n\nStatement 2: \"If \\(Z_r + Z_s\\) is isomorphic to a subgroup \\(Z_m + Z_n\\), then \\(r\\) divides \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) divides \\(n\\).\n\nThis statement is false. While it is true that \\(Z_r + Z_s\\) and \\(Z_m + Z_n\\) may share some properties or be isomorphic due to their common structure, we cannot directly conclude that \\(r\\) must divide \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) must divide \\(n\\) from this fact alone. The relationship between the orders of the subgroups involved depends on the specific subgroups considered within \\(Z_r + Z_s\\) and \\(Z_m + Z_n\\). For example, if \\(Z_r + Z_s\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(Z_m + Z_n\\), then \\(r\\) does indeed divide \\(m\\) and \\(s\\) do indeed divide \\(n\\). However, this is not always the case, as illustrated by the counterexample given below.\n\nCounterexample:\nLet \\(Z_3\\) denote the cyclic group of order 3 under addition modulo 3, which has no proper subgroups except itself and the trivial group \\(\\{0\\}\\). Let \\(Z_2\\) denote the cyclic group of order 2 under addition modulo 2, which also has no proper subgroups except itself and the trivial group \\(\\{0\\}\\). Then, \\(Z_3 + Z_2\\) is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which consists of the elements \\((a+b)\\mod 3\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) range over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\), which are equivalent classes modulo 3. Therefore, \\(Z_3 + Z_2\\) is a direct sum of two copies of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) but not isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4 + \\mathbb{Z}_2\\) since \\(\\mathbb{Z}_4 + \\mathbb{Z}_2\\) contains a copy of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_8\\) which is not contained in \\(Z_3 + Z_2\\).\n\nIn summary, while the first statement is true, the second statement is false without additional conditions or constraints. Therefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
