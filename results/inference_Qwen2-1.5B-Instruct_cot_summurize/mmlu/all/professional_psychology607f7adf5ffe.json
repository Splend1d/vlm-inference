Therefore, it is likely that minority group members will require longer-term counseling to address these issues effectively.\n\nAdditionally, many minority group members may have experienced discrimination or marginalization in their lives, which can make them feel uncomfortable or unsafe during therapy sessions. This can lead to resistance or avoidance from the client, which can also affect the duration of counseling.\n\nOverall, while it is not accurate to say that minority group members remain in counseling for an \"approximately the same length of time\" as non-minority dent, research suggests that they may require longer-term counseling to effectively address their unique needs and challenges."
