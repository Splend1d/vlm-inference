Losing 5-7% of body weight through a hypocaloric low fat diet and 30 minutes of daily activity.\n\nResearch has shown that losing weight through healthy lifestyle changes, such as reducing calorie intake and increasing physical activity, can help lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In addition, consuming a low-fat diet and engaging in regular exercise can also improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, which are important for preventing diabetes.\n\nOn the other hand, a very low carbohydrate diet may not be beneficial for people with diabetes or at risk of developing it, as it can lead to nutrient deficiencies and other health problems. Similarly, consuming a diet high in monounsaturated fats alone may not be sufficient for preventing diabetes, as it is not effective in lowering blood sugar levels or improving insulin resistance.\n\nInitiating metformin and practicing daily vigorous exercise may also be helpful for managing type 2 diabetes, but they are not specific to preventing diabetes."
