He contacted a government agency to state that the company for which he worked was submitting false safety reports on newly built aircraft. When the company learned that the engineer was leaking this information to the government agency, he was fired from his job. Afterward, the engineer sued the company for wrongful termination of employment. During the discovery stage of litigation, the engineer was deposed by the company's attorney. In his deposition, the engineer stated that the company submitted false safety reports to the government agency to cover up structural defects in its aircraft. A pilot was injured when one of the company'sairplanes he was piloting crashed. The pilot asserteda strict products liability tort against the company. At thal, the pilot seeks to introduce into evidence portions of the engineer's deposition from his wrongful termination lawsuit against the company. Assume that the engineer is unavailable to testify at trial. Upon objection by the company, the trial court judge should rule the engineer's deposition testimony\n\nA. admissible as former testimony.\nB. admissible as a vicarious admission.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered.\n"

However, since the engineer is unavailable to testify at trial, the company has the opportunity to object and the trial court judge can rule accordingly.\n\nOption A (admissible as former testimony) is incorrect because the engineer's deposition testimony was given before the incident that occurred during the pilot's flight, so it cannot be used to prove liability in the pilot's strict products liability claim.\n\nOption B (admissible as a vicarious admission) is also incorrect because the engineer's deposition testimony is not a statement made by the defendant admitting fault or liability in a civil case.\n\nOption D (inadmissible, because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered) is also incorrect because the engineer's deposition testimony would still be admissible if the company had the opportunity to cross-examine him on the liability issue."
