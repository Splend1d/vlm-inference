Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves calling the fire department for help when one's home is on fire, which is generally considered a necessary action to protect oneself and others from harm. However, it is important to note that if the situation is not life-threatening or urgent, it may be considered a legal obligation under certain circumstances (e.g., in cases where the person is unable to call for themselves due to age, disability, or other reasons). \n\nScenario 2 involves selling baked goods at a school event, which can be seen as a form of charitable giving and promoting community involvement. While there may be some concerns about profiting from a public event, such actions are generally viewed as acceptable and not inherently wrong."
