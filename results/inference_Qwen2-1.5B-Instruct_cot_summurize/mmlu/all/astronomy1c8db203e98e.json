However, when an asteroid passes near the Sun, it can become illuminated by the Sun's intense radiation and appear as a bright spot in the night sky. This effect is known as \"asteroid transits,\" and it occurs when the asteroid passes through the Earth's shadow or near the horizon at sunset or sunrise.\n\nThis brightness can be so bright that it can be seen from many parts of the world and even on ships at sea. It also creates a distinctive pattern in the night sky called the asterism of Orion, which consists of several bright stars in the constellation of Orion. The brightness of an asteroid can vary depending on its distance from the Sun and its inclination relative to the plane of the ecliptic (the path of the Sun across the sky)."
