These actions violated the kidnapping laws of both states, which are identical. A jury convicted the man in a State A court, but the trial judge gave what prosecutors in State B deemed an unduly lenient sentence. The state prosecutor in State B then commenced a kidnapping case against the man for violating State B's kidnapping statute. The man's lawyer has filed a motion in State B to dismiss the charge based on the double jeopardy protection against a second prosecution for the man's single act of kidnapping. Should the court grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. No, because the double jeopardy protection only prohibits a second prosecution following an acquittal for the same offense.\nB. No, because the man's conduct violated the laws of two different states, and each has the right to enforce its laws. right to enforce its laws.\nC. Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following a conviction for the same offense.\nD. Yes, because the government is collaterally estopped under the double jeopardy protection from prosecuting a defendant a second time for the same conduct that led to an earlier conviction.\n"

Yes, because the double jeopardy protection prohibits a second prosecution following a conviction for the same offense.\n\nThe double jeopardy clause in the United States Constitution states that \"No person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" This means that once someone has been acquitted or convicted of a crime, they cannot be tried again for the same offense unless there is new evidence that warrants a new trial.\n\nIn this scenario, the man was convicted in State A of kidnapping and sentenced in State A, but then the state prosecutor in State B brought charges of kidnapping against him based on his previous conviction in State A. The double jeopardy protection would prevent the state prosecutor in State B from bringing another charge of kidnapping against the man based on his prior conviction in State A.\n\nTherefore, the court should grant the motion to dismiss the charge against the man based on the double jeopardy protection against a second prosecution for the same offense."
