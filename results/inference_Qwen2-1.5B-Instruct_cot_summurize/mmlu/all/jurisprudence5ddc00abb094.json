Because it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck.\n\nDworkin's work on legal and political theory has been influential in the field, particularly in his concept of \"liberal egalitarianism.\" This view holds that individuals have a right to pursue their own interests within the bounds of law, and that this pursuit should not be obstructed by unequal treatment based on individual luck or disadvantage. In other words, according to Dworkin, the state should not intervene excessively to ensure equal outcomes for all individuals, as this can stifle individual freedom and creativity.\n\nWhile Dworkin also argues that the state has a role to play in promoting certain values (such as justice, fairness, and respect for human rights) and that these values may justify some forms of intervention, he believes that the primary concern should be protecting individual autonomy and allowing people to make choices that reflect their own goals and aspirations. This approach is often contrasted with theories of social engineering or top-down approaches to governance, which Dworkin sees as potentially stifling individual initiative and creativity."
