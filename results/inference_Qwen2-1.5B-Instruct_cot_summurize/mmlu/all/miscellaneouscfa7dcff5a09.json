This involves conducting research on the audience, analyzing their behavior and communication styles, and tailoring the message to meet their specific needs. Without an understanding of the audience, the message may not be effective or relevant, leading to poor engagement and low response rates. Therefore, knowledge and understanding of the audience are essential for creating successful graphic communications."
