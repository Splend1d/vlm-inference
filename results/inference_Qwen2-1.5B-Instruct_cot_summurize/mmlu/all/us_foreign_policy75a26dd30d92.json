Conservatives are skeptical of increases in defense spending; liberals advocate increases in defense spending.\n\nThis is because conservatives tend to prioritize smaller government and fiscal responsibility, which may lead them to be more cautious about increasing defense spending that could potentially lead to higher taxes or deficits. On the other hand, liberals tend to prioritize social programs and economic growth, which may motivate them to support increased defense spending as a way to protect national security and promote global stability."
