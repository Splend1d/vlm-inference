However, if we assume that \"moral wrongdoing\" is primarily based on actions that violate societal norms or laws, then scenario 1 would be considered morally wrong because jumping on a new table without permission can lead to property damage and potentially harm others. On the other hand, scenario 2 involves talking to someone who was not present during church services, which may not necessarily be considered morally wrong but may still be frowned upon by some individuals. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
