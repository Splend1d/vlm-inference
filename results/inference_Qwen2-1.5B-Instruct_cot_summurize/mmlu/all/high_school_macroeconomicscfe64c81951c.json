                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Money supply increases by $10 million, lowering the interest rate and increasing aggregate demand (AD).\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve purchases $1 million in Treasury securities from commercial banks, it reduces the amount of reserves held by banks. This reduction in reserves causes banks to have less money to lend out into the economy, leading to a decrease in money supply. However, since money demand is perfectly elastic, an increase in the money supply will lead to a proportional increase in the velocity of money (how often money is spent) without changing the total quantity of money.\n\nAs a result, when the money supply decreases, the interest rate rises because there are fewer dollars available for lending at lower interest rates. At the same time, the increase in money supply leads to a rise in aggregate demand, as businesses and consumers have more money to spend on goods and services. Therefore, both the interest rate and aggregate demand will increase. The net effect is that the money supply increases while the interest rate and aggregate demand both rise, resulting in a higher level of economic activity."
