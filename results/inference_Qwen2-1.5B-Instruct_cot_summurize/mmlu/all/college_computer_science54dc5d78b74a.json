This means that the number of bytes written to memory during the loop depends on the amount of data that needs to be written to the cache.\n\nIn this case, the loop writes the sum of two arrays into the cache. Since there are 256 elements in array A and 512 elements in array B, the total number of bytes written to the cache is:\n\n256 * 4 + 512 * 4 = 1024 + 2048 = 3072\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1024."
