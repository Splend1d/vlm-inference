PR involves the use of various channels such as media, social media, press releases, events, and influencer marketing to promote products or services to customers, potential customers, and other stakeholders. It allows for the establishment and maintenance of positive relationships between companies and their audiences. While direct marketing, advertising, sales promotion, and public relations can all be used in conjunction with each other, they each have different focuses and approaches. Direct marketing targets specific individuals or groups directly through email, phone calls, or physical mailings. Advertising aims to reach a wider audience through traditional media like TV, radio, print, and online ads. Sales promotion includes discounts, coupons, and other incentives to encourage purchases. Public relations focuses on building and maintaining relationships with the media and other influencers to increase brand visibility and credibility."
