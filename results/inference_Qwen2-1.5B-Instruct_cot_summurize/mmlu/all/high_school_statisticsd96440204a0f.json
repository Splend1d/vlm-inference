The value of R-sq does not provide enough information to make any conclusions about the nature of the relationship between the explanatory and response variables. It simply indicates the percentage of variance in the response variable that is accounted for by the regression model. To determine if there is a strong positive or negative relationship, or if most of the variation in the response variable is explained by the regression on the explanatory variable, additional data and analysis would be needed. Therefore, the correct answer is D: II and III only."
