In this case, we have a 13-week US Treasury bill that was purchased for $960. The bond has a face value of $1,000.\n\nTo find the BEY, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{BEY} = \\frac{\\text{Price}}{\\text{Maturity Value}} - 1 \\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{BEY} = \\frac{960}{1000} - 1 = 0.96 - 1 = -0.04 \\]\n\nHowever, since the BEY cannot be negative, it means that the bond is trading at a discount compared to its face value. To find the true yield, we need to convert the negative value into a positive one by taking the absolute value:\n\n\\[ \\text{BEY} = |-0.04| = 0.04 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\frac{0.04}{1} \\times 100\\% = 0.4\\% \\]\n\nSo, the yield on the 13-week US Treasury bill purchased for $960 would be approximately 0.4%, which rounds to 0.04 or 4%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided."
