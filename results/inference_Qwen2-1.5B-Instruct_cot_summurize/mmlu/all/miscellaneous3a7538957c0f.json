They are precise and accurate.\n\n- Precise means that all parts of a measurement are measured accurately to their respective dimensions.\n- Accurate means that the actual value being measured matches the result obtained from the measurement.\n\nIn this case:\n- The true length of the block of wood is 1.010 cm.\n- The three measurements provided (1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm) do not match this exact value, indicating they are not precise.\n\nTherefore, statement A is false.\n\nB. They are precise but not accurate.\n\n- Precise means that all parts of a measurement are measured accurately to their respective dimensions.\n- Not accurate means that the actual value being measured does not match the result obtained from the measurement.\n\nIn this case:\n- The true length of the block of wood is 1.010 cm.\n- The three measurements provided (1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm) match the actual value of 1.010 cm.\n\nTherefore, statement B is also false.\n\nC. They are accurate but not precise.\n\n- Accurate means that the actual value being measured matches the result obtained from the measurement.\n- Precise means that all parts of a measurement are measured accurately to their respective dimensions.\n\nIn this case:\n- The true length of the block of wood is 1.010 cm.\n- The three measurements provided (1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm) do not match this exact value, indicating they are not precise.\n\nTherefore, statement C is false.\n\nD. They are neither precise nor accurate.\n\nThis statement would be true if the three measurements did not match the true length of the block of wood. However, as we have established that the measurements match the true length, this statement is false.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only correct statement is:\n\n**D. They are neither precise nor accurate.**\n\nThis conclusion arises because the measurements do not precisely match the true length of the block of wood, even though they are accurate in that they yield results close to the truth."
