This could lead to an increase in U.S. net exports, as Japanese companies may be more willing to sell their products to American consumers due to the lower value of the yen.\nAs for the value of the dollar, it is possible that it may also increase slightly as a result of increased demand for U.S. goods and services from Japanese consumers during a recession. However, this would not necessarily be a direct effect of the recession itself.\nOverall, the changes in U.S. net exports and the values of the dollar and yen would depend on various factors such as global economic conditions, exchange rate policies, and other market forces."
