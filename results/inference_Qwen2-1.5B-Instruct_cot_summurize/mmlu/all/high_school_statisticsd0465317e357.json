We're interested in knowing how many employees would be expected at each end of the distribution.\n\n- Employees with income less than \\$13,000: \\(n_{\\text{low}} = Z_1 + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1\\)\n- Employees with income greater than \\$28,000: \\(n_{\\text{high}} = Z_2 + 1 = 6.67 + 1 = 7.67\\)\n\nSo, out of 400 employees, we can expect approximately 1 employee to have an income between \\$13,000 and \\$28,000 based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(B) 100**."
