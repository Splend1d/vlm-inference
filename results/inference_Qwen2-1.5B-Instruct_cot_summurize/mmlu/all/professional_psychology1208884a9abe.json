It assesses a range of skills such as attention, memory, problem-solving, and abstract reasoning. However, it does not specifically focus on intelligence or mental retardation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. adults who are mentally retarded. The LIPS can provide some insight into their cognitive abilities, but it is important to note that IQ tests like the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) or the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales (SBS) are more commonly used for this purpose."
