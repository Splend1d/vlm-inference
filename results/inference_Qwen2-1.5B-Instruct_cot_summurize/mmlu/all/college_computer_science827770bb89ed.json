II and III only\n\nHorizontal microarchitecture refers to microinstructions that perform one operation at a time, while vertical microarchitecture performs several operations in parallel. \n\nStatement I: The time required by programs running on horizontal microarchitectures can be higher due to the sequential execution of instructions compared to vertical microarchitectures. This is not necessarily true; it depends on the specific instruction set architecture (ISA) used. For example, an ISA designed for high performance might prioritize efficiency over speed and thus allow for faster execution times.\n\nStatement II: Horizontal microinstructions may or may not be unencoded. Some microprocessors use unencoded horizontal microinstructions where each instruction is encoded into a single instruction word. Others use encoded horizontal microinstructions where each instruction requires multiple words. Thus, statement II is partially true but incomplete.\n\nStatement III: Horizontal microinstructions typically consist of a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers. This is correct as it describes the structure of horizontal microinstructions. However, note that some modern processors support vertical microinstructions which also have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers, so this statement is not entirely accurate either. \n\nTherefore, the only statement that is true from among the given options is D. II and III only."
