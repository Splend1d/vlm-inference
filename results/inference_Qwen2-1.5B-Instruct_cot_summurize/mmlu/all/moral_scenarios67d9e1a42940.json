Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, the character did not explicitly harm anyone or take property without permission, but their actions could be seen as morally questionable due to the potential impact on others and the lack of consent. They may have been spreading germs unknowingly, and there was no intention to harm them specifically. However, it still falls under the category of \"wrong.\"\n\nIn scenario 2, the character did indeed break the law by reporting someone else's disappearance, even though they had no direct involvement with the case. This action goes against the laws of privacy and protection for children and families who might be affected. Therefore, it can be considered morally wrong."
