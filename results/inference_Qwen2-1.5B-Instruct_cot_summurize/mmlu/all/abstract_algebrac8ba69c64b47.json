A linear transformation \\(T: V \\to W\\) is injective if every non-zero vector in \\(W\\) has a unique preimage under \\(T\\). Since the dimension of \\(V\\) is less than the dimension of \\(W\\), there exists at least one element in \\(W\\) (since the dimension of \\(W\\) is greater than zero) which cannot be written as a linear combination of vectors from \\(V\\), meaning that \\(T\\) maps some elements of \\(V\\) to different elements of \\(W\\), making it injective.\n\nStatement 2:\nLet \\(\\dim(V) = n\\) and suppose that \\(T: V \\to V\\) is linear. If \\(T\\) is injective, then it is a bijection.\nThis statement is false. While an injective function \\(T: V \\to V\\) always preserves the dimension of its domain, this does not necessarily mean that \\(T\\) is a bijection. For example, consider the linear transformation \\(T: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) defined by \\(T(x,y) = (x+y,x-y)\\). This transformation is injective but not bijective because it fails to preserve the origin.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B**. False, False."
