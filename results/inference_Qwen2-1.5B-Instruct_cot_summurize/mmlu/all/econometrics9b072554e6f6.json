In your case, you're testing for two cointegrating vectors, so you should use the eigenvalues corresponding to those two eigenvectors.\n\nTherefore, option B (the largest 2) would be used in the test.\n\nNote: If there were more than two cointegrating vectors, then you would need to compute the eigenvalues for all of them and select the largest two. But since you're only testing for two cointegrating vectors, the answer remains as stated above."
