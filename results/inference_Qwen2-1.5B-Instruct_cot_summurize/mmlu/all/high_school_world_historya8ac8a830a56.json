The urban middle class. \n\nAs mentioned in the chart, literacy rates rose significantly during this time period, particularly for the Russian-speaking population. This suggests that there was an increase in access to education and learning opportunities, which could have been beneficial for individuals within the urban middle class who may have had more disposable income and resources to invest in their education.\n\nOption A, the rural peasantry, may have also benefitted from increased literacy rates due to improved agricultural practices and technologies, but it is not specified whether they had access to these educational opportunities or resources. Option B, members of the Russian Orthodox clergy, may have also benefitted from increased literacy rates as part of religious studies, but again, it is not specified whether they had access to these educational opportunities or resources. Option D, officers in the armed forces, may have also benefitted from increased literacy rates, but it is not specified whether they were able to access formal education or if their roles required them to be literate."
