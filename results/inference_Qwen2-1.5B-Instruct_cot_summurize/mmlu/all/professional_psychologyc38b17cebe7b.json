However, this theory also accounts for environmental influences on development, including genetic factors, early experiences, and social interactions. Additionally, SOC theory suggests that individuals may develop compensatory mechanisms to adapt to their environment and reduce the negative effects of stressors. Therefore, it can be said that all the options mentioned are true."
