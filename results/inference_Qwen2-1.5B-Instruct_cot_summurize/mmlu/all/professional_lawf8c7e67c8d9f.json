When he became chronically ill and could not care for himself, his unmarried daughter moved into his home to take care of him. As time went on, the widower became senile, lost touch with reality, and required continuous care. When that happened, the caretaking daughter made out a deed to herself as grantee and had him sign as grantor. He was not aware of what he was doing when he signed it. After the widower died, the two married children sued to have the deed set aside for mental incompetence. Assuming they can prove the foregoing allegations, will the court likely strike down the deed?\n\nA. No, because the caretaking daughter had a right to the property in return for all of the work that she performed.\nB. No, because every deed is strongly presumed to be valid when signed.\nC. Yes, because he did not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of his act or the meaning of the legal instrument he signed.a\nD. Yes, because it was obtained by mutual mistake.\n"

Yes, because he did not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of his act or the meaning of the legal instrument he signed.\n\nUnder English law, a person who signs a document without understanding its terms may void the document if it is found to be a \"mutual mistake\". In this case, the caretaker's daughter signed the deed intending to transfer her interest in the property to herself while the father intended to leave it to his family. This mistake occurred due to their different understanding of the circumstances at the time of signing, which constitutes a mutual mistake. Therefore, the deed may be struck down as voidable."
