Upon delivery, the buyer was surprised to find an assortment of pacific wild salmon, domestic salmon raised in captivity, and mixed east coast salmon. In prior discussions, the parties agreed on all pacific wild salmon for fulfillment of the order, and none of the other inferior types were discussed. Does the parol evidence rule apply to preclude the buyer's testimony regarding what kind of salmon the parties' intended by the term \"quality salmon\" in the written contract?\n\nA. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply to preclude testimony in cases such as this one where the testimony would explain what the parties meant by the terms they used.\nB. Yes, the parol evidence rule applies to preclude the testimony because the testimony would add to or contradict the final signed writing.\nC. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply because the contract was reduced to writing.\nD. Yes, the parol evidence rule applies to preclude the testimony because the terms of the contract were not recorded and preserved at the time of signing the contract.\n"

This rule is designed to prevent unintended changes to the written agreement and ensure that both parties have a clear understanding of their obligations under the contract.\n\nIn this case, the buyer and seller agreed on the type of salmon to be delivered, which was all pacific wild salmon. However, upon delivery, the buyer found an assortment of different types of salmon, including domestic salmon raised in captivity and mixed east coast salmon. The buyer's surprise about the variety of salmon is not relevant to the terms of the written contract, as it occurred after the contract was signed and cannot be relied upon to modify the contract.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. No, the parol evidence rule does not apply to preclude the buyer's testimony regarding the type of salmon the parties' intended by the term \"quality salmon\" in the written contract."
