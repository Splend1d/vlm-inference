This belief can arise from various factors, including an external locus of control, which suggests that one's success or failure is determined by external events rather than personal effort or ability.\n\nAn external locus of control means that an individual believes that they do not have any control over the outcomes of events, such as the outcome of a job interview or the result of a medical diagnosis. This can lead to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness when faced with challenges or setbacks. Therefore, learned helplessness is most closely associated with an external locus of control."
