For the ideal generated by this polynomial to generate a field, the ideal must have at least four elements (since the degree of the polynomial is 3). This means that if there exists a value of \\(c\\) that makes the ideal generated by \\(x^3 + cx^2 + 1\\) have less than four elements, then the quotient ring formed will not be a field.\n\nHowever, since the degree of the polynomial is 3, the ideal generated by \\(x^3 + cx^2 + 1\\) must have exactly three elements, or else it would not be able to form a field with respect to addition and multiplication defined on its set of elements.\n\nThus, we only need to find the values of \\(c\\) for which the ideal generated by \\(x^3 + cx^2 + 1\\) has exactly three elements. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. \\(c = 0\\): In this case, the ideal generated by \\(x^3 + 0x^2 + 1\\) consists of just one element (\\(1\\)), so the quotient ring does not form a field under these conditions.\n\nB. \\(c = 2\\): The ideal generated by \\(x^3 + 2x^2 + 1\\) consists of three elements: \\(1, -1, -1\\). Thus, the quotient ring formed is indeed a field.\n\nC. \\(c = 1\\): The ideal generated by \\(x^3 + x^2 + 1\\) consists of two elements: \\(1, -1\\). Thus, the quotient ring formed is also a field.\n\nD. \\(c = 3\\): The ideal generated by \\(x^3 + 3x^2 + 1\\) consists of one element: \\(1\\). Thus, the quotient ring formed is again a field.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 2** and **C. 1**, as they both satisfy the condition that the ideal generated by \\(x^3 + cx^2 + 1\\) has exactly three elements."
