In a monopsony, there is only one employer who can hire workers from a particular industry or sector, and they must pay a higher wage to attract and retain workers compared to a competitive labor market where multiple employers could offer similar wages. The wage paid by the monopsonist will be higher than that of a competitive labor market because it is necessary for the employer to compensate workers for the fact that they cannot freely choose between jobs."
