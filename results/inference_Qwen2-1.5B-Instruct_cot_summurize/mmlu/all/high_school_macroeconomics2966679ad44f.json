A bank cannot lend out all of its deposits.\n\nIn a fractional reserve banking system, banks hold some of their deposits in reserve money (savings accounts and demand deposits) while lending out the rest of their deposits. The amount of money held in reserve is typically around 20% of total deposits. This means that not all deposits can be lent out.\n\nFor example, if a bank has $1 million in deposits, it would keep about $200,000 in reserve money for each deposit, leaving $870,000 available to lend out. However, this does not mean that the bank can only lend out $870,000 worth of deposits - it could lend out more or less depending on market conditions and other factors."
