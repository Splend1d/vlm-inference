All four criticisms of standard (\"plain vanilla\") GARCH models can be overcome by EGARCH models, except for criticism (ii). \n\nEGARCH models include an additional term that allows for the possibility of leverage effects, which helps to overcome criticism (ii). Additionally, EGARCH models can accommodate asymmetric responses to positive and negative shocks through their specification of the variance-gamma distribution. Finally, EGARCH models can allow for feedback between the volatility and the returns, as they incorporate an autoregressive component that captures the relationship between past volatility levels and current volatility levels."
