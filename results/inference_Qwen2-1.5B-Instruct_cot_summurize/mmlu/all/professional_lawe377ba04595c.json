Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that \"in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. \" In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)\n\nA. equitable servitude.\nB. restrictive covenant.\nC. unenforceable restriction.\nD. easement for public use.\n"

In this case, the county school board has been granted permission to use the 10-acre tract for a new school building, which falls under the category of a public use. Therefore, the investor's proposed designation of the 10-acre tract for construction of a school building is best described as an easement for public use. \n\nOption A, equitable servitude, refers to a legal right given by law to prevent someone from doing something that would cause harm to another person or their property. It does not involve the use of a piece of land for a specific purpose.\n\nOption B, restrictive covenant, refers to a legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties that restricts certain activities or conditions that may affect the value or use of real estate. It also does not relate to the use of a piece of land for a specific purpose.\n\nOption C, unenforceable restriction, refers to a condition or limitation placed on real estate that cannot be enforced against subsequent owners or users. It does not apply in this scenario because the condition is being used to allow a specific use of the land for a public benefit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. easement for public use."
