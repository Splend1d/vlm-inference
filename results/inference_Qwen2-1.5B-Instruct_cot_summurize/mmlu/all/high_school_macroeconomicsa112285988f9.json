This can lead to reduced demand, which may result in lower sales and profits for businesses. As a result, they may reduce their production levels to compensate for the decreased demand, leading to a decrease in output. This is known as a \"demand shock.\" The other options do not necessarily follow from this situation. Prices tend to increase when there is a reduction in demand, so option A is incorrect. Saving tends to increase during economic downturns, so option C is also incorrect."
