The city of Cincinnati is undertaking a huge highway construction project that strands fans in pregame traffic jams for hours.\n\nAn increase in consumer surplus (the difference between what consumers are willing and able to pay and what they actually pay) can occur when the availability of goods or services changes, making them more desirable or less expensive. In this case, the construction project could make it harder for fans to get to the ballpark on time, which would lead to an increase in demand for Reds tickets. This could potentially drive up the price of tickets and result in an increase in consumer surplus for those who are able to attend the game. However, if the construction project does not significantly impact the availability of tickets, then it may have little effect on consumer surplus."
