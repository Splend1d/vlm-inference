                    "text": "To determine which statement is true about the function \\(f(x)\\), we need to analyze its behavior and properties.\n\nFirst, let's find the critical points of the function by setting its derivative equal to zero:\n\n\\[f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 9\\]\n\nSetting this equal to zero gives us:\n\n\\[3x^2 + 4x - 9 = 0\\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nIn this case, \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 4\\), and \\(c = -9\\). Plugging these values into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{(4)^2 - 4(3)(-9)}}{2(3)}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{164}}{6}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{-4 \\pm 8}{6}\\]\n\nThis gives us two possible values for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[x_1 = \\frac{-4 + 8}{6} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\\]\n\\[x_2 = \\frac{-4 - 8}{6} = \\frac{-12}{6} = -2\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the intervals determined by these critical points:\n\n1. For \\(x < x_1 = \\frac{2}{3}\\), \\(f'(x) > 0\\) because the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is positive.\n2. For \\(x_1 < x < x_2 = -2\\), \\(f'(x) < 0\\) due to the negative coefficient in front of the \\(x^2\\) term.\n3. For \\(x > x_2 = -2\\), \\(f'(x) > 0\\) again.\n\nFrom the analysis above, it's clear that the function \\(f(x)\\) changes from increasing to decreasing at \\(x = \\frac{2}{3}\\). This means there is exactly one point where \\(f(x) = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect; the function does not have exactly three real solutions but rather just one.\n\nNext, let's look at the inequality involving \\(f(x)\\):\n\n\\[f(x) \\geq -18\\]\n\nSince we've established that \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing around \\(x = \\frac{2}{3}\\), and it decreases as \\(x\\) approaches this value from both sides, the function will be less than or equal to \\(f(\\frac{2}{3})\\) on either side of \\(x = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nGiven that \\(f(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 + 2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 - 9\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) - 18\\),\n\\[f(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{8}{9} - 6 - 18\\]\n\\[f(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{8}{9} - 24\\]\n\\[f(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{54}{9}\\]\n\\[f(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{54}{9}\\]\n\\[f(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{8}{9} - \\frac{45}{9}\\] \n\\[f(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{8}{27} - \\frac{45}{9}\\]\n\\[f(\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{8}{27} - \\frac{150}{27}\\]\n\\[f(\\frac{2}{3}) = -\\frac{142}{27}\\]\n\nThus, the minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(-\\frac{142}{27}\\), so the inequality \\(f(x) \\geq -18\\) holds only when \\(x\\) is greater than \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), making option C correct.\n\nFinally, let's examine the statement D: \"The function \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing for \\(x \\leq -3\\)\".\n\nBased on our analysis of the function's behavior around \\(x = \\frac{2}{3}\\), we know that \\(f(x)\\) is decreasing for \\("
