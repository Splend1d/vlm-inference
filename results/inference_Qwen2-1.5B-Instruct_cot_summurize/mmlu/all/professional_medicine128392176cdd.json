Osteomalacia is a condition characterized by bone density loss and stiffness, which can lead to muscle weakness and joint pain. It is often associated with vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption of calcium and phosphate. In this case, the patient's low serum calcium concentration suggests a potential cause of osteomalacia, such as vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption of calcium and phosphate. Other causes of osteomalacia include renal disease, chronic alcohol abuse, and certain medications."
