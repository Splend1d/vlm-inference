A cytokine storm\n\nA cytokine storm is a type of immune response that occurs when the body's immune system becomes overwhelmed and starts producing excessive amounts of cytokines, which can lead to tissue damage and organ failure. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including viral infections such as COVID-19.\n\nAntibody-mediated reactions refer to the immune response triggered by antibodies produced in response to an infection or injury. Killer T cells (also known as CD-8) are part of the adaptive immune system and play a crucial role in recognizing and destroying infected cells, but they are not primarily responsible for causing immune pathology in viral infections.\n\nA decline in the function of the immune system is not necessarily a result of a viral infection itself; it could also be due to other factors such as age, underlying health conditions, or medications.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. A cytokine storm."
