The motel manager authorized the officers to enter the room and provided them with a passkey. Without obtaining a warrant, the officers knocked on the room's door, announced their presence, and told the occupants that they would like to speak with them. The officers then heard yelling and repeated flushing of the toilet. They then used the passkey and entered the room, where they saw the occupants dumping drugs into the toilet. The occupants of the room were charged with drug dealing and have moved to suppress the drugs. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?\n\nA. No, because exigent circumstances justified the officers' entry.\nB. No, because the motel manager consented to the officers' entry.\nC. Yes, because exigent circumstances cannot excuse the lack of a warrant.\nD. Yes, because the officers cannot benefit from exigent circumstances that they created.\n"

Yes, because the officers cannot benefit from exigent circumstances that they created.\n\nIn this case, the police officers had probable cause to believe that drug dealing was occurring in a specific room at a local motel. This gives them reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory search without a warrant. However, it does not automatically mean that they can enter the room without a warrant if exigent circumstances exist.\n\nExigent circumstances refer to situations where there is an immediate danger or threat to public safety, such as a fire or a natural disaster. In this scenario, the officers did not face any immediate danger or threat to public safety; instead, they encountered resistance from the occupants of the room, who were engaged in illegal activities.\n\nTherefore, the court should deny the motion to suppress the drugs, as the officers did not act within the parameters of the law by entering the room without a warrant due to exigent circumstances. The officers' actions created their own exigency, which prevented them from relying on exigent circumstances as a defense for their unlawful entry."
