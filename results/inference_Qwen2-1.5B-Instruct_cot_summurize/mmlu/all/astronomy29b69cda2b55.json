                    "text": "The correct answer is A: Their large systems of moons and rings gravitationally attract the mass around the equator more.\n\nJovian planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, have a strong magnetic field that interacts with their own atmosphere and other objects in orbit around them. This interaction can cause the planet's surface to be heated up and expand, creating a bulging appearance at the equator due to the increased density of the gas and dust there compared to the rest of the planet.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as a \"tether effect,\" where the magnetic field lines from the planet's core create a sort of \"tether\" that pulls material towards the poles and away from the equator. As the planet rotates, this causes the mass near the equator to be pulled inwards, while the mass further out is pushed outwards by the force of the magnetic field.\n\nSo, the reason why jovian planets bulge around the equator is because of the way their atmospheres interact with their magnetic fields."
