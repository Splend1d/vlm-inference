Dark-colored ones inhabit the lava formations, while light-colored mice inhabit the desert. Which of the following statements is correct about this scenario?\n\nA. The two varieties of mice descended from a recent common ancestor.\nB. The mouse population was originally one population that diverged into two species because of mutations.\nC. Selection favors some phenotypes over others.\nD. Originally the mice were all dark colored. As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.\n"

As the lava decomposed into sand, the color of some mice changed because that color was favored in that environment.\n\nThis scenario best describes how the pocket mice evolved and adapted to their environments through natural selection. The lava formed pockets where the sand eventually settled, which allowed darker-colored mice to survive better than lighter-colored ones due to their darker coats being more effective at absorbing heat and preventing water loss. Over time, this selective pressure caused the mice to evolve to be mostly dark-colored, with only a few exceptions for light-colored mice who found it advantageous to adapt."
