Du Bois, progress for African Americans in the aftermath of slavery was dependent on the small group of African Americans receiving the same thorough and extensive education as the most talented White Americans were able to access. Du Bois believed that education was key to breaking the cycle of poverty and inequality faced by African Americans at the time. He argued that if African American children received an education comparable to that of white children, they would have better opportunities to succeed and contribute to society."
