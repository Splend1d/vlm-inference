If the cross-price elasticity of demand between two goods is positive, it means that as the price of one good increases, the quantity demanded of the other good also increases. This suggests that these two goods are substitutes for each other and their demand is likely to be responsive to each other.\n\nIn contrast, if the cross-price elasticity of demand is negative, it means that when one good's price increases, the quantity demanded of the other good decreases. This suggests that these two goods are complements for each other and their demand is not expected to be responsive to each other.\n\nLuxuries and necessities do not have cross-price elasticities because they are not substitutes or complements of each other."
