His sister states that he recently saw a psychiatrist for the first time because of hearing voices; he was prescribed a medication, but she is not sure what it is. She says that he has a history of excessive drinking, and she thinks that he has also experimented with illicit drugs. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.3\u00b0F), pulse is 124/min, and blood pressure is 160/102 mm Hg. Examination shows profuse diaphoresis and muscle rigidity. His neck is supple. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Mental status examination shows psychomotor agitation alternating with lethargy. His leukocyte count is 15,600/mm3 , and serum creatine kinase activity is 943 U/L. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?\n\nA. Amphetamine intoxication\nB. Bacterial meningitis\nC. Delirium tremens\nD. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome\n"

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome\n\nNeurolitic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an acute psychiatric reaction caused by antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol or pimozide. It typically presents with fever, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status. In this case, the patient is showing all three of these symptoms, along with profuse diaphoresis and muscle rigidity. Additionally, his leukocyte count is elevated and his serum creatine kinase activity is high, which are both characteristic of NMS. \n\nAmphetamine intoxication would result in hyperactivity, restlessness, and hallucinations rather than the symptoms described here. Bacterial meningitis usually causes a low-grade fever and sensitivity to light, not a high fever like this patient exhibits. Delirium tremens occurs in alcoholics who have had a long period of abstinence from alcohol and then suddenly drink large amounts, causing delirium and tremors due to alcohol withdrawal.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is neuroleptic malignant syndrome."
