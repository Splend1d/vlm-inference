Therefore, the maximum possible order for an element in $Z_{8} \\times Z_{10} \\times Z_{24}$ is:\n$$\\text{Order} = \\text{Order of } Z_{8} \\times Z_{10} \\times Z_{24} = 8 \\times 10 \\times 24 = 1920.$$\nHowever, this result contradicts our understanding that the order must be less than or equal to the lcm of the orders of the groups. Let's reconsider our approach.\n\nThe direct product of two cyclic groups of order $n$ and $m$, respectively, is generated by the elements $\\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$ and $\\{0, 1, ..., m-1\\}$, respectively. In this case, we have three cyclic groups: $Z_{8}$, $Z_{10}$, and $Z_{24}$. Their orders are 8, 10, and 24, respectively.\n\nThe lcm of 8, 10, and 24 is not simply the product of these numbers, but rather the least common multiple (LCM) of all three numbers. To find the LCM of 8, 10, and 24, we can use the prime factorization method:\n\n- The prime factorization of 8 is $2^3$,\n- The prime factorization of 10 is $2 \\cdot 5$,\n- The prime factorization of 24 is $2^3 \\cdot 3$.\n\nTaking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of these factorizations gives us the LCM: $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 8 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 240$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible order for any element in $Z_{8} \\times Z_{10} \\times Z_{24}$ is 240. This matches option C."
