All of the above.\n\nThe Great Pyramids of Giza were built during the New Kingdom period (1550-1069 BC), which is considered to be the most productive era of pyramid building in Egypt. The pyramids were built by skilled workers, including both Egyptians and foreign laborers brought from abroad, such as Persians, Babylonians, and Libyans. The construction process was supervised by Pharaohs like Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, who personally participated in the project. Additionally, the construction work required significant resources, such as limestone quarries, and labor, which were obtained through forced labor or slave labor. Therefore, it can be concluded that all of the options listed are correct."
