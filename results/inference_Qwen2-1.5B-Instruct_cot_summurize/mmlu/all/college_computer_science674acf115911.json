This problem is known as \"integer factorization\" and has been studied by mathematicians for centuries.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to this belief. For example, it's possible to prove that factoring is computationally intractable only under certain conditions, such as when the input number is prime or very close to a power of a small prime. But even in these cases, factoring may still be computationally infeasible for practical purposes.\n\nIn summary, while integer factorization is believed to be computationally hard due to its connection with the factorization problem, it is not necessarily true that it is always computationally intractable. There are still open questions and research directions related to the computational complexity of integer factorization."
