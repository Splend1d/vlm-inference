Diplopia, also known as double vision, occurs when there is a misalignment of two images on the retina due to a problem with the nerves that transmit visual information from the eyes to the brain. In some cases, the outer image may be distorted or appear to be upside down relative to the inner image, which can cause the patient to perceive double vision. However, this does not necessarily mean that the outer image is always false; it could still be real but distorted. It's important to note that other factors such as eye movement disorders and ocular muscle problems can also contribute to diplopia."
