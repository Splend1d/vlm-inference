The remaining percentage of body weight is composed of extracellular fluid (EF). Therefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Fat = 20%, FFM = 17%, IF = 40%, EF = 23%\n\nNote: This answer assumes that the percentages given in the question are accurate for a healthy individual with a normal body weight. It's important to note that different studies may have slightly different results due to differences in sample size or other factors."
