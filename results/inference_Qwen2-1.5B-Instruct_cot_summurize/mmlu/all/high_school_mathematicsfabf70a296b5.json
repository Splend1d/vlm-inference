The number of ways to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52, with no restrictions on the suits or order, is given by:\n\n\\[ \\binom{52}{3} = \\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!} \\]\n\nHowever, since we want to ensure that all three cards have different suits, and we don't care about their order, we need to consider the number of ways to choose 3 suits out of 4 without regard for which suits they are chosen together.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 suits out of 4 is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[ \\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, there are 4 ways to choose 3 suits out of 4. For each choice of suits, we then need to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 cards from those 3 suits, which is simply the number of permutations of 3 cards taken from the 13 cards in each suit, multiplied by the 3 suits.\n\nFor each of these 4 choices of suits, we have:\n\n- Permutations of choosing 3 cards from 13 in one suit: \\( \\binom{13}{3} \\)\n- Permutations of choosing 3 cards from 13 in another suit: \\( \\binom{13}{3} \\)\n- Permutations of choosing 3 cards from 13 in yet another suit: \\( \\binom{13}{3} \\)\n\nAdding these up gives us the total number of ways to choose 3 cards of different suits:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times (\\binom{13}{3} + \\binom{13}{3} + \\binom{13}{3}) = 4 \\times 3010 = 12040 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(C) 2197**."
