If the hog producers have been feeding less efficient feed than they did in the previous year, then they would be producing fewer pounds of meat per unit of feed. This would result in a lower profit margin on every unit of feed consumed.\n\nLower feed efficiency could also explain why the returns were higher in the first year. This suggests that the producers may have been able to achieve better feed conversion ratios (the amount of feed converted into meat) with the more efficient feed used in 2020. As a result, even if the overall cost of production remained constant, the producer would still earn a higher profit per pound of feed used.\n\nTherefore, option A (lower feed efficiency) is the most likely explanation for the difference in returns."
