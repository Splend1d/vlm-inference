Instead, you can simply iterate over the list once and perform the calculations directly without storing intermediate values.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ncount = len(numbers)\nsum_of_elements = 0\n\nfor i in range(count):\n    sum_of_elements += numbers[i]\n\naverage = sum_of_elements / count\n```\n\nThis version of the code only iterates through the list once, eliminating the need for `count` and `sum`. It also performs the calculation directly instead of using two separate variables for `sum` and `count`."
