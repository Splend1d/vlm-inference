However, there are some craters that are located near the poles, specifically on Mercury's north and south poles. These craters are called \"polar ice caps\" because they contain large amounts of water-ice.\n\nWater-ice is important because it can help us understand how the planet formed and evolved. By studying these polar ice caps, scientists can learn about the history of Mercury and its environment, as well as the potential for future exploration of the planet."
