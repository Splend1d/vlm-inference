Tariffs, which are taxes or duties imposed on imported goods, can increase the price of imported goods and reduce their quantity sold domestically due to decreased demand. Quotas, on the other hand, limit the number of units that can be imported into a country, leading to higher prices for those units as they become more scarce. However, these measures may also lead to increased domestic production, thus raising the total quantity of the product sold domestically."
