Wade majority opinion held that a woman has a constitutional right to obtain an abortion before viability, even if the pregnancy results from rape or incest or if the mother's life is endangered. This decision was based on the concept of \"privacy\" as enshrined in the Bill of Rights, which protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures, freedom of speech, religion, and the press, and the right to bear arms."
