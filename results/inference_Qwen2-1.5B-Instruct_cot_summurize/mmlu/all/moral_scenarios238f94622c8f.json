Knocking over a wine glass may be seen as careless and potentially harmful, especially if it causes injury or loss of value for the owner. \n\nScenario 2 involves making an unfounded judgment about someone's mental state based on personal interaction, which can also be considered morally questionable. However, this scenario doesn't involve intentional wrongdoing like Scenario 1, so it is not necessarily wrong under all circumstances. The act itself isn't inherently wrong but could still be judged negatively depending on the context and intent behind the decision to visit the old guy in his house."
