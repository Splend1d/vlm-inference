Insulin, cortisol, and increased pH levels do not directly activate muscle glycogen breakdown. Muscle glycogen is broken down through a process called glycolysis, which involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate and ATP. This process is stimulated by the presence of oxygen and increases in pH levels, but it does not require any of these hormones to occur."
