In this case, the organism will express the dominant phenotype (the more common trait) even if it does not have the dominant allele.\nStabilizing selection occurs when there is no significant change in the frequency of any genetic variation over time, while directional selection occurs when there is a significant increase or decrease in the frequency of one genetic variant compared to another. Sexual selection is a type of directional selection that can occur in some species, but it is not directly related to the concept of heterozygote advantage.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. directional selection."
