The string tension can be greater or less than mg depending on the speed of the ball.\n\nWhen a ball is moving in a horizontal circle, the net force acting on it is not only due to gravity (mg) but also due to the centripetal force provided by the tension in the string. This means that the tension in the string must be greater than mg for the ball to maintain its circular motion. \n\nHowever, if the ball's speed becomes too high, the tension in the string will become insufficient to provide enough centripetal force, and the ball will start to slip off the circular path. In this case, the tension in the string would be less than mg. Therefore, the correct answer is D. It can be greater or less than mg depending on the speed of the ball."
