The passage mentions that pursuing pleasure and happiness may lead to temporary satisfaction but does not suggest that either pursuit will bring lasting happiness or fulfillment. It also suggests that forgetting about happiness may be counterproductive as it can prevent individuals from living their lives fully and experiencing genuine joy. Therefore, the best approach to pursuing happiness would be to find a balance between pursuing pleasure and happiness while also engaging in activities that bring meaning and purpose to one's life."
