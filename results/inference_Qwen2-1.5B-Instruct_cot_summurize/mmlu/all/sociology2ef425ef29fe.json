The Japanese model is applied, through lateral networks of flexible roles.\n\nIn this context, the term \"alternative form of network organization\" refers to a structure where businesses operate in a decentralized manner, with decision-making processes taking place at multiple levels within an organization rather than being centralized. This type of organizational structure allows for greater flexibility and responsiveness to changes in the market or customer needs.\nOne example of this type of organizational structure is the Japanese \"Lateral Network,\" which involves horizontal relationships between employees who share information and collaborate on projects. In this system, employees have more autonomy and decision-making power, allowing them to take ownership of their work and make decisions that impact the success of the company as a whole.\nAnother example is the use of lateral networks in supply chain management, where companies rely on suppliers and retailers to perform certain tasks, such as logistics or distribution, rather than having these functions performed by internal departments.\nOverall, the alternative form of network organization emphasizes collaboration and flexibility, and encourages the sharing of knowledge and resources among employees and stakeholders."
