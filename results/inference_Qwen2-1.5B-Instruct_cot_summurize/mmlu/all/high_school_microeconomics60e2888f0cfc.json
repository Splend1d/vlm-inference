The marginal (physical) product of labor and the output price.\n\nWhen a firm produces an additional unit of output, the marginal physical product represents the increase in output that can be achieved with one more unit of labor. If the marginal physical product is greater than the output price, then increasing the amount of labor would result in a positive profit. This means that the firm has an incentive to hire more workers to produce more output at a higher price.\n\nTherefore, the demand for labor is determined by the marginal (physical) product of labor and the output price."
