Adverse impact. \n\nAdverse impact occurs when an employment practice has the effect of disproportionately disfavoring one group over another, even if the practice itself is neutral. In this case, the fact that there is a higher rate of selection or promotion for one group compared to another could be seen as an indication of adverse impact. The EEOC guidelines state that employers must take steps to eliminate any practices that have a disparate impact on a protected class."
