Therefore, there won't be rain.\" is a logically valid conditional syllogism.\n\nA conditional syllogism is an argument that contains two premises and one conclusion. In this case, the first premise states that if the sky is blue, then it will not rain. The second premise states that the sky is blue today. The conclusion is that there will not be rain.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is valid or invalid, we need to check whether the argument follows from its premises. In other words, we need to ensure that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion is true because both the first and second premise are true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) A conditional syllogism."
