Voluntary intoxication does not negate the requirement of intent. In this case, the husband's son had loaded the gun before the incident occurred, indicating that the husband knew about the danger posed by the weapon and still chose to use it against his wife. Therefore, the husband cannot rely on voluntary intoxication as a defense to the charge of battery."
