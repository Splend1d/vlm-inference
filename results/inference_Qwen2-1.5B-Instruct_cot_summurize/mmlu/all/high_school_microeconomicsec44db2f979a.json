A negative cross-price elasticity\n\nComplements are two goods that when consumed together, they decrease the total utility or satisfaction received from consuming them. This is indicated by a negative cross-price elasticity, which measures the degree to which the quantity demanded of one good increases as the price of another good decreases.\n\nOn the other hand, substitutes are two goods that when consumed together, they increase the total utility or satisfaction received from consuming them. This is indicated by a positive cross-price elasticity, which measures the degree to which the quantity demanded of one good increases as the price of another good increases.\n\nOption B (a horizontal demand curve) and option D (a demand elasticity greater than one) do not necessarily indicate that two goods are complements. A horizontal demand curve suggests that there is no relationship between the price of one good and its demand, while a demand elasticity greater than one means that the quantity demanded of one good changes more rapidly in response to a change in the price of another good compared to the quantity demanded of that good alone. These factors can be indicative of either complements or substitutes. Option A (a positive income elasticity) does not directly indicate whether two goods are complements or substitutes."
