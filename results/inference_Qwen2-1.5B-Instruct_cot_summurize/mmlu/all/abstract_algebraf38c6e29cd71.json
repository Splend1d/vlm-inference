The condition you've stated, \\((ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}\\), implies associativity. However, it doesn't necessarily imply commutativity since there could still exist elements in the group which do not commute with each other.\n\n3. **Abelian Group**: An abelian group is one where the group operation is commutative. Given your condition, if \\((ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}\\), then \\(ab = ba\\), implying that the group operation is indeed commutative.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude whether \\(G\\) is a commutative group, an abelian group, or any other type of group without additional information about the properties of the group operation (\\(ab\\) vs \\(ba\\)).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **none of these** (Option D)."
