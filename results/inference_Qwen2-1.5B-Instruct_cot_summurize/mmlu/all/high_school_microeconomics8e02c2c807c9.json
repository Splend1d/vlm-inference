In contrast, a monopoly is characterized by the presence of only one firm in the market, which allows them to charge a higher price for their product without having to compete with other firms. This leads to a situation where the monopolist has an incentive to produce more output and sell it at a higher price, which results in lower average costs and higher profits. Therefore, a monopoly is generally considered to be less efficient than a perfect competitor."
