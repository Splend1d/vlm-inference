                    "text": "The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed in 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The pact was created as a way for the two countries to strengthen their relationship and avoid conflict. It was not created out of a desire to help the Germans seize land from Czechoslovakia, nor was it created as a result of a failure by the Soviets to form an alliance with Britain and France. Therefore, none of the options listed (Germany promising to help regain Soviet land lost in the First World War, the attempt by the Soviets to form an alliance with Britain and France had failed, they wanted to assist the Germans in seizing land from Czechoslovakia, or holding debt to Germany stemming from the First World War) are correct. \n\nThe pact was created as a way for the two countries to work together against their mutual enemies, which were the British Empire and the French Fifth Republic. The pact also included a clause that stated that neither country would support any third power that attacked the other. This clause was intended to prevent the two countries from getting involved in each other's internal affairs. Overall, the pact was a strategic move by both countries to strengthen their relationship and avoid conflict."
