(2) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the tract of land. (3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the woman delivered to her daughter, the woman promised to convey the tract of land to her daughter by quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. (4) In 2008, the woman delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage. If the woman thereafter defaulted on the mortgage debt, which of the following is probably correct?\n\nA. Only the daughter has a cause of action against the woman.\nB. Only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.\nC. Both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman.\nD. Neither the daughter nor the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.\n"

The mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the tract of land, which also gave them a priority right over any other claims or interests in the property.\n\nThe woman then promised to convey the tract of land to her daughter by quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. This means that the woman intended to transfer the property to her daughter without having to pay off the mortgage debt first. However, since she failed to do so, the mortgage company may still have a cause of action against her for breach of contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Neither the daughter nor the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman."
