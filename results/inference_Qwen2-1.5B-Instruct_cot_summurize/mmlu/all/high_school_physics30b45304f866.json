The linear momentum of the system remains constant before and after the collision because it is conserved in an isolated system (i.e., no external forces act on the system). Therefore, the linear momentum of the two carts combined is equal to their individual momenta before the collision. Since one cart has a mass of 1.5 kg and the other has a mass of 0.5 kg, their total mass is 2 kg, so their combined linear momentum is \\(2 \\times m = 2 \\times 2 = 4\\) kg\u22c5m/s. This means that the final velocity of the combined system is also 4 kg\u22c5m/s. \n\nThe correct answer is D. Linear momentum."
