A friend of the woman had known the woman for years and knew that she was an easily excitable person. The friend also hated the woman's husband. Knowing that the woman was present, the friend drew a pistol and threatened to kill the husband. The woman suffered severe emotional distress as a result of witnessing this incident and soon afterward had a miscarriage. In an action by the woman against the friend for mental anguish resulting in her miscarriage, the woman will\n\nA. lose, because the friend did not intend for the woman to suffer a miscarriage.\nB. lose, because the friend's actions were directed against the husband, not the woman.\nC. win, because it was highly probable that the friend's extreme and outrageous conduct would cause emotional distress to the woman.\nD. win, because she is the husband's wife.\n"

The friend drew a pistol and threatened to kill the husband, which could have caused serious harm or death to the husband. Additionally, the friend's behavior was extremely aggressive and threatening towards the husband, which could have caused the woman to experience significant fear and anxiety. These factors suggest that the friend's conduct was extreme and outrageous, and therefore may have caused emotional distress to the woman.\n\nTherefore, the woman may be able to recover damages from the friend for emotional distress resulting from witnessing the friend's threats and actions."
