Therefore, the brother did not pay valuable consideration for his deed. \n\n3) The recording statute provides that unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. This means that the brother would have been entitled to record his deed under the recording statute had he done so within four years after the conveyance. \n\n4) The brother's sons recorded the deed before their father's sons sought to oust them from the land. \n\nTherefore, based on these facts, the correct answer is B: the brother recorded his deed before the grantor's children sought to oust him from the land."
