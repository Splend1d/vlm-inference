The moral reflection of many generations.\n\nRoss argues that the existing body of moral convictions of the best people is the cumulative product of the moral reflection of many generations, rather than being the result of biases or self-confirmation among individuals. He suggests that over time, people's beliefs about what is right and wrong have evolved through a process of moral reflection and discussion within communities. This reflects a broader understanding of how human societies develop their values and norms."
