This means that the demand for the good will increase, which will result in higher profits for the firm. As a result, the firm may decide to hire more workers to meet the increased demand.\n\nHowever, even if the firm decides to hire more workers, it will still face competition from other firms in the market. Therefore, the firm may have to pay higher wages to attract and retain workers. This is because the firm cannot simply pass on the cost savings from the technology to its customers, since the customers also benefit from the lower prices.\n\nIn summary, while the technological innovation may initially reduce the firm's employment level, it can lead to higher wages if the firm chooses to hire more workers."
