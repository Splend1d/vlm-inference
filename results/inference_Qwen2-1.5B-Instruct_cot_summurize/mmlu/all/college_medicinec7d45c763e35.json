Therefore, when the sound exits the first medium and enters a denser medium, its velocity will increase.\n\nThe intensity of sound is not affected by the change in medium, so option B remains unchanged.\n\nFrequency and wavelength depend on the properties of the medium through which the sound is traveling. In general, when the speed of sound increases, both frequency and wavelength decrease. So, options C and D would also be affected by the change in medium.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D."
