There is a purchasemoney mortgage on the property for which the four signed a promissory note as security. The loan was not satisfied at the time of the conveyance. The conveyance is a deed in fee simple to the adult child. The adult child then takes over the mortgage payments. The adult child stops making the payments and conveys the property to a bona fide purchaser who does not do a title search. The purchaser sues his grantor to get an order compelling him to pay the mortgage and remove the lien from his property. Will the court more than likely grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants?\n\nA. Yes, that is the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing.\nB. Yes, because the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.\nC. No, the court will order the original four owners to come into court and defend on behalf of the adult child, who has no legal responsibility for the mortgage.\nD. No, the court will order the adult child to resume paying on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is D. No, the court will order the adult child to resume paying on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any undisclosed encumbrances is entitled to enforce the conveyance against the person who conveyed the property. However, the UCC also provides that if the purchaser does not discover the encumbrances before taking possession of the property, he may be precluded from enforcing the conveyance against the person who conveyed the property unless the person has fraudulently concealed the encumbrances or has failed to make a diligent investigation. In this case, the adult child did not discover the encumbrances before taking possession of the property, so the UCC does not apply and the adult child is not precluded from enforcing the conveyance against the original four owners.\n\nAdditionally, the UCC provides that the original four owners are liable to the adult child for the amount of the unpaid mortgage and any other amounts due under the promissory note, and must take steps to ensure that the mortgage is paid off. If the adult child sues the original four owners to collect on the mortgage, the court will likely grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants, as the adult child cannot be forced to pay the mortgage until the original four owners have taken action to pay it off. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect, as the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full. Option C is also incorrect, as the court will order the original four owners to come into court and defend on behalf of the adult child, who has no legal responsibility for the mortgage."
