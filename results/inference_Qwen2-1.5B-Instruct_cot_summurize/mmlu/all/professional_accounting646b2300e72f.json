The fair market value of the land was $30,000. Therefore, the basis of the land should be calculated as follows:\n   - The total cash distribution: $12,000\n   - The total basis for the land: $10,000 (cash) + $30,000 (fair market value)\n   - This gives us a total basis of $40,000\n\n3. **Adjusted Basis**: After receiving the distribution, the partnership's basis in the land is reduced to its adjusted basis ($40,000 - $12,000 = $28,000).\n\n4. **Final Basis**: To find the final basis for Gulde, we add back the cash distribution ($12,000) from which the adjusted basis has been subtracted:\n   - Final basis for Gulde = Adjusted basis for partnership - Cash distribution\n   - Final basis for Gulde = $28,000 - $12,000 = $16,000\n\n5. **Answer**: Since the question asks for the basis in the land after the distribution, the answer is $30,000, option D."
