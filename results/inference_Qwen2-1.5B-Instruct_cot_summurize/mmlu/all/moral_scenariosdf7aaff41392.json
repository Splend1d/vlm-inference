It involves breaking the rules and potentially putting other people's safety at risk by not respecting the closure sign.\n\nOn the other hand, choosing not to vaccinate children against diseases such as measles or polio due to forgetfulness is generally seen as a personal choice that should be respected unless it causes harm to others or violates laws and regulations regarding vaccination requirements. Therefore, scenario 2 is not explicitly morally wrong, but it could be considered \"not wrong\" if it aligns with the individual's values and circumstances."
