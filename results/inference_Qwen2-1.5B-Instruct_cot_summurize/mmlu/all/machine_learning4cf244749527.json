Some rectangles might intersect with each other or overlap, making them unable to shatter the given set of points.\n\nStatement 2: The statement is true. The VC-dimension of a k-Nearest Neighbour classifier when k = 1 is infinite because for any set of points, there will always be at least one point that is closer than any other point to every point in the set. Therefore, no matter how many points you have, there will always be at least one point that is \"closer\" to every point in the set, which means that the classifier will always fit into the VC-dimension of infinity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
