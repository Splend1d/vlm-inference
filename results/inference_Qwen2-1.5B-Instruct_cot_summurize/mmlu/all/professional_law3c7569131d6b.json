The parties entered into a valid, written construction contract that contained a provision that called for an architect's certificate of completion. After completion of the cottage, the owner hired an architect to inspect the contractor's work and issue the certificate. The architect refused in bad faith to execute the certificate. The contractor then sued the owner for the entire contract amount. The owner argued that the lack of issuance of the certificate excused her from further performance under the contract. Upon hearing this argument, most courts will\n\nA. order the architect to execute the certificate.\nB. require the contractor to proceed in equity for reformation to eliminate the clause.\nC. award the contractor damages against the architect.\nD. excuse the condition and require the owner to pay damages to the contractor.\n"

Excuse the condition and require the owner to pay damages to the contractor.\n\nIn most cases, if the architect refuses to issue a certificate of completion, the contract may be considered breached by the contractor. However, the court may consider whether there is a \"condition precedent\" or a \"waiver\" that would excuse the breach. In this case, it seems that the architect's refusal was due to bad faith, which could be considered a \"condition precedent\" that excuses the breach. Therefore, the court may hold the owner liable for the entire contract amount, as long as the contract contains such a provision. If the contract does not contain such a provision, the court may allow the contractor to proceed in equity for reformation to eliminate the clause."
