We have $a=7$ and $b=13$, so $ab = 7 \\cdot 13 = 91$.\n\nNext, we want to find the number of even positive integers less than $91$. An even number is any integer that can be divided by 2 with no remainder. So, we need to count how many numbers from 1 to 91 (inclusive) are divisible by 2 without remainder.\n\nThe largest even number less than 91 is 90, which is also the largest multiple of 2 less than or equal to 91. So, there are $\\frac{90}{2} = 45$ even numbers less than 91.\n\nTherefore, the number of even positive integers less than $ab$ is 45.\nThe answer is: $45$"
