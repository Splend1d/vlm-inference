They can be found in both aqueous and non-aqueous environments, including blood plasma and cell membranes. However, this does not necessarily mean that phospholipids are water-soluble. In fact, some phospholipids are amphipathic, meaning they have only one type of hydrophobic end and one type of hydrophilic end, but they do not dissolve completely in water. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Steroids are lipids that consist of glycerol and fatty acids."
