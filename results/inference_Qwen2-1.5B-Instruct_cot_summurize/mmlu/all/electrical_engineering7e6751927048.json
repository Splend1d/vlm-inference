Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\nf = 2 * sqrt( (5^2 + 2^2) / 1^2 ) = 2 * sqrt( 29 / 1 ) = 2 * sqrt( 29 )\nf \u2248 2 * 5.3851 = 10.7702 Hz\n\nThis result doesn't match any of the options given in your question. It seems that there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the problem statement. If the frequency of the vertical wave is indeed supposed to be 100 Hz as stated, then the correct answer would be B. 250 Hz. \n\nHowever, if the frequency of the vertical wave should be calculated using the formula provided above with a = 5, b = 2, and c = 1, it would give a different value than the one listed in the options. Please double-check the problem statement or provide more context so I can assist you better."
