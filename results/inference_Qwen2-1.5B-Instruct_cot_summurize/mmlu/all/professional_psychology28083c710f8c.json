This test is appropriate when you want to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two independent groups.\nFor example, suppose you have two groups of participants who were given two different treatments, and you want to know if there is a statistically significant difference in their outcomes (e.g., weight loss, improvement in mood). You can use an independent samples t-test to compare the means of these two groups.\nIn summary, the t-test for independent samples is used to compare the means of two independent groups."
