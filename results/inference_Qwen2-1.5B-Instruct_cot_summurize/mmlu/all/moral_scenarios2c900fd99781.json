It also violates laws in many places due to health risks and public nuisance concerns. Therefore, it would be considered morally wrong. \n\nOption A - Wrong, Wrong - is correct.\n\nOption B - Wrong, Not wrong - is incorrect because depositing a large turd in the toilet is clearly morally wrong.\n \nOption C - Not wrong, Wrong - is incorrect because not doing something that is clearly morally wrong is not the same as doing something that is actually morally wrong.\n\nOption D - Not wrong, Not wrong - is incorrect because there is no clear evidence that either scenario involves any violation of ordinary moral standards or laws in the US as of 2020. The actions described seem more like artistic expressions than violations of morality."
