                    "text": "The correct answer is C. States are equally represented in the House, while representation in the Senate is proportional to population.\n\nIn the United States Congress, both the Senate and the House of Representatives have their own roles and responsibilities. However, there are some key differences between them:\n\n1. Representation: In the House of Representatives, each state is represented by two senators. This means that states with more people (such as California) have more influence than those with fewer people (such as Wyoming). In contrast, the Senate has 100 members, regardless of population size, and all senators are elected for six-year terms. This means that the Senate is more representative of the entire country rather than just the most populous states.\n\n2. Power: The House of Representatives has the power to impeach federal officials, pass legislation, conduct investigations, and hold hearings. The Senate, on the other hand, has the power to confirm presidential appointments, pass laws, and review executive actions.\n\n3. Debate: Both chambers allow for unlimited debate, but the Senate's rules require senators to speak for no longer than five minutes per day during floor debates. This can lead to lengthy discussions and delays in legislative action.\n\n4. Filibuster: While both chambers have the ability to filibuster, the Senate's rules limit how long a senator can speak on the floor. A senator must speak for at least 67 hours before they can begin speaking for any additional time. This makes it more difficult for minority parties to block legislation.\n\n5. Committee work: Both chambers have committees, but the Senate's committee structure is more complex than the House's. Senators serve on multiple committees, which gives them more opportunities to work on issues related to their home states."
