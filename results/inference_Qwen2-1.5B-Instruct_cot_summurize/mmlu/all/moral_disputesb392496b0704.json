Therefore, it is not possible to determine which option is correct based on the given information. However, we can infer that eugenics and genetic enhancement may have negative consequences for individuals and society if they are pursued without regard for ethical considerations or if they lead to unintended consequences. These actions could potentially harm vulnerable populations or undermine social cohesion, which are values associated with a secular perspective. Therefore, while it is difficult to definitively answer which option is correct without additional context, it seems likely that eugenics and genetic enhancement may be viewed negatively from a secular perspective due to their potential for negative consequences."
