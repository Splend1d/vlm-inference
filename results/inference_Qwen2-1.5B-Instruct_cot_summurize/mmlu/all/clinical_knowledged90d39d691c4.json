Transfuse it as soon as possible and annotate the patient's notes with the time of administration.\n\nIf a blood unit has been out of refrigeration for longer than the accepted time limit, it is important to transfer it to a cooler environment (such as a refrigerator) and not just discard or dispose of it. Administering the blood unit as soon as possible after transfer can help ensure that the blood remains viable and safe for use. Additionally, annotating the patient's notes with the time of administration can provide documentation of when the blood was administered, which may be useful for future reference."
