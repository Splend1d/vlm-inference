For a falling object, this occurs when the net force acting on it is zero. Therefore, the force of air resistance (which is proportional to the square of the speed) must be equal to the weight of the object. At terminal velocity, the object's speed is approximately 9.8 m/s, and so the force of air resistance is approximately 0.8 N.\nHowever, the magnitude of the air resistance depends on the shape and size of the object, as well as the density and viscosity of the air. Therefore, the exact value of the air resistance force will vary depending on these factors."
