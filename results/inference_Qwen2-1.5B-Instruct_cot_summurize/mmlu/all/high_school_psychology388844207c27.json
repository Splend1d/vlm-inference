Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is most likely related to the amount of light to which a susceptible person is exposed, as it can be triggered by changes in daylight levels during the winter months. Clasophobia, or fear of enclosed spaces, and catatonic schizophrenia are not directly related to exposure to light. Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior."
