                    "text": "The correct statements are:\n\nA. If \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=c\\), then \\(f'(c)\\) exists.\n\nThis is because continuity implies that the function approaches a certain value as it approaches a certain point, and this can be expressed in terms of derivatives. The derivative \\(f'(x)\\) measures how much \\(f(x)\\) changes as \\(x\\) changes, so if \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=c\\), then \\(f'(c)\\) must exist to ensure that the change in \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x=c\\) is well-defined.\n\nB. If \\(f'(c)=0\\), then \\(f\\) may have a local maximum or minimum at \\((c,f(c))\\).\n\nHowever, this statement does not necessarily imply that there is an inflection point at \\((c,f(c))\\). An inflection point occurs when the second derivative of \\(f(x)\\) changes sign, but only under certain conditions on the first derivative (\\(f'(x)\\)). Therefore, while having \\(f'(c)=0\\) suggests that \\(f''(c)\\) could equal zero (indicating a possible inflection point), we cannot definitively conclude that there will be one at \\((c,f(c))\\) without further information about the behavior of \\(f''(x)\\) near \\(x=c\\).\n\nC. If \\(f''(c)=0\\), then the graph of \\(f\\) has an inflection point at \\((c,f(c))\\).\n\nAgain, this statement is incorrect. While having \\(f''(c)=0\\) indicates that the second derivative of \\(f(x)\\) equals zero, it does not guarantee that there is an inflection point at \\((c,f(c))\\). Inflection points occur where the concavity of \\(f(x)\\) changes from convex to concave or vice versa, which requires a more nuanced analysis involving both the first derivative and the second derivative of \\(f(x)\\).\n\nD. If \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(x=c\\), then \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(x=c\\).\n\nThis statement is true. Differentiability implies that the function is \"smooth\" and approaches a specific value as \\(x\\) gets close to \\(c\\), which ensures that the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\) exists and is equal to \\(f(c)\\). Continuity at \\(x=c\\) means that \\(f(x)\\) approaches a particular value as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\), just like differentiability guarantees for a smooth curve approaching a single point. So, by definition, if \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(x=c\\), it is also continuous at \\(x=c\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are:\n\nA. True\nB. False\nC. False\nD. True"
