This phenomenon is known as reciprocity, which means that people tend to behave reciprocally towards others who have shared similar information about themselves. Therefore, it is likely that if one partner in a relationship shares more about themselves, the other may also feel compelled to share more about themselves as well. However, it's important to note that this does not necessarily mean that the relationship will be happy or successful, as other factors such as communication, trust, and compatibility can also play a role."
