Near the edge of the field, a woman was sitting in a beach chair and reading a book. The girl threw the ball too far, and it went over her friends' heads and flew toward the woman. Although the woman did not see the ball coming, it hit the straw hat that the woman was wearing, knocking it from her head. Although the woman was not touched by the ball, she was startled by the ball hitting her hat, and she fell from her chair and broke her arm. If the woman initiates a suit against the girl to recover damages for her broken arm, the woman will\n\nA. recover for assault only.\nB. recover for battery only.\nC. recover for assault and battery.\nD. not recover.\n"

Therefore, there has been no direct physical contact between the woman and the girl's friend or the ball itself, which would allow the woman to sue for assault or battery. However, the woman may still be able to sue for negligence if the girl or her friends failed to ensure that the ball was not thrown into a dangerous area where people like her might be present, such as near a busy street or playground."
