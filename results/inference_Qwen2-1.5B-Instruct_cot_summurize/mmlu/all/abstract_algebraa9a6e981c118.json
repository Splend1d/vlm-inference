This is because if \\(x = a\\) is a zero of \\(f(x)\\), then \\(a^3 + 2a + 2 = 0\\), and by Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of \\(g(x)\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) divided by the leading coefficient (which is 1 for both polynomials).\n\nSince \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\) has only seven elements (\\(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\)), which satisfy \\(a^3 - 2a - 2 = 0\\), we know that the only possible values for \\(a\\) are those that make the above equation true.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\n- Option A: \\(1\\) doesn't work since \\(1^3 - 2*1 - 2 \\neq 0\\).\n- Option B: \\(2\\) works since \\(2^3 - 2*2 - 2 = 8 - 4 - 2 = 2\\).\n- Option C: \\(2,3\\) don't work since \\(2^3 - 2*2 - 2 = 8 - 4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(3^3 - 2*3 - 2 = 27 - 6 - 2 = 19\\) does not equal 0.\n- Option D: \\(6\\) doesn't work since \\(6^3 - 2*6 - 2 = 216 - 12 - 2 = 202 - 14 = 188\\) does not equal 0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 2**."
