Hepatojugular reflux occurs when blood from the liver flows back into the jugular vein, which can cause pressure on the carotid artery and result in a pulsatile sensation in the neck. This is different from other options where no variation with posture or pressure in the root of the neck reducing the impulse could indicate a venous source for the pulsation."
