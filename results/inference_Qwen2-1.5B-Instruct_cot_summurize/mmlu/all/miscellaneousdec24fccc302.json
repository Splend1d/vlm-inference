Buying Treasury bonds in the open market\n\nExpansionary monetary policy involves expanding the money supply and lowering interest rates, which can stimulate economic growth. The Federal Reserve typically buys Treasury bonds to increase the money supply and lower interest rates, which encourages borrowing and spending. This is known as quantitative easing (QE). By buying more government debt, the Fed can inject liquidity into the economy and encourage banks to lend more freely, leading to higher levels of investment and consumer spending."
