However, this does not necessarily mean that the main effects of each individual variable are statistically significant. It could be that the main effects are insignificant or even negative, but the interaction effect suggests that these main effects are significant together. Therefore, option A and B are incorrect. Option D is also incorrect because the interaction effect can occur without any of the variables being significantly different from zero."
