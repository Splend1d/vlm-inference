The CEO of the new business told the widget maker's manager that a substantial profit hinged on receiving the widgets. The manufacturer discovered it could not produce the widgets due to equipment failures. The business sued the manufacturer for breach of contract, claiming lost profits of $10 million. The CEO testified to the company's projected sales in detail. A qualified expert supported his lost profit projections; there was no expert testimony by the manufacturer. Will the court allow the company to collect its claimed lost profit damages?\n\nA. No, despite the expert testimony, anticipated profits for a new company are too speculative and are not awarded.\nB. No, because the equipment failures were an excusable occurrence that the manufacturer could not foresee.\nC. Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony.\nD. Yes, a new company can usually collect its lost profits because it is easier to prove than if the company had many accounts to complicate its projections.\n"

Yes, the lost profits damages were sufficiently proven by the evidence, including expert testimony.\n\nIt is generally true that lost profits damages are difficult to prove accurately, as they depend on factors such as market conditions, competition, and unforeseen events. However, when expert testimony is provided, courts will consider this evidence in determining whether the damages are reasonable and proportional to the losses suffered by the plaintiff.\n\nIn this case, the CEO presented detailed evidence of the company's projected sales and the expected lost profits based on those sales. This included expert testimony from a qualified expert who reviewed the company's sales data and made predictions about future sales. The court may have found that the expert testimony was sufficient to support the claim for lost profits damages, even though proving the actual losses would have been more challenging. Therefore, the court is likely to allow the company to collect its claimed lost profit damages under option C."
