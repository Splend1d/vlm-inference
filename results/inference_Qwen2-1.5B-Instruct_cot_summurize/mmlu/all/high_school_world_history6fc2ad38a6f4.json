A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H. Moreland, India at the Death of Akbar, 1920\nZamindars had an ability \"to establish a claim to sovereignty\" largely due to the Mughal Empire's policy of\n\nA. religious toleration\nB. universal taxation\nC. martial law\nD. suffrage\n"

The passage suggests that Zamindars could avoid paying taxes by refusing or ignoring them, but this could be seen as a form of rebellion against the Mughal Empire. By doing so, Zamindars could gain practical independence and enjoy certain levels of autonomy. Therefore, option C, martial law, is the most likely answer based on the context provided."
