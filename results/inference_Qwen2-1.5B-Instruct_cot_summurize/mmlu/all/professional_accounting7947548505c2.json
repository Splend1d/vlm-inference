It also ensures that all relevant data will be stored securely and accessible to authorized personnel. The development of a new system would provide a comprehensive approach to managing the fixed assets, including the ability to track changes, update depreciation rates, and generate reports easily. This would ensure that the company's financial records remain accurate and up-to-date, which is essential for effective decision-making and compliance with regulatory requirements."
