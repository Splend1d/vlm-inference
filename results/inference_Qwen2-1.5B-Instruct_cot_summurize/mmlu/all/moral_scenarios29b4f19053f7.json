In scenario 1, the character made a decision based on their own personal judgment and feelings, which may not align with societal norms or expectations. In scenario 2, the character took an action that could be seen as disrespectful or harmful if done inappropriately, but there is no clear evidence that this action went against any established moral principles. Therefore, neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong."
