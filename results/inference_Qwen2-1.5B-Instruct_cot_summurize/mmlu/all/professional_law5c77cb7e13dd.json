After a hearing, the state court ordered possession of the land surrendered to the corporation, upon deposit in court of a sum deemed adequate to cover damages that might be awarded. The timber company immediately commenced an action to enjoin the court-ordered sale of their property. Which of the following would be the best ground for upholding the state court's order?\n\nA. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public related use or activity.\nB. The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.\nC. The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury to use as amounts to a \"taking. \"\nD. The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.\n"

The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.\n\nThis is because the power of eminent domain is a constitutional right granted to the state by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and cannot be delegated to a private entity without express statutory authorization. Additionally, the power of eminent domain can only be exercised for a public purpose or activity, such as providing infrastructure or promoting economic development. In this case, the corporation was seeking to condemn the land for a public recreation area, which falls within these parameters. Therefore, the court had the authority to order possession of the land and require the timber company to pay damages before any sale could take place."
