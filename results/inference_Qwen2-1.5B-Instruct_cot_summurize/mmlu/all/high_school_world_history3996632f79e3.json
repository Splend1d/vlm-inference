But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nStalin's efforts to advance Russia as justified by his mention of the \"continual beatings\" were vindicated by which of the following historical events?\n\nA. The Space Race with the United States\nB. The Polish-Soviet War in the early 1920s\nC. The Western intervention in the Russian Civil War\nD. The German invasion of Russia in 1941\n"

The German invasion of Russia in 1941\n\nThe text mentions that Stalin referred to the \"continual beatings\" of Russia due to its backwardness, military, cultural, political, industrial, and agricultural deficiencies, which led to being repeatedly beaten by various European powers such as the Mongols, Turks, Swedes, Poles/Lithuanians, British/French capitalists, and Japanese barons. This alludes to the historical context where Russia had been subject to numerous defeats and invasions by foreign powers for centuries, which was seen as evidence of Russia's inferiority and vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, Stalin's efforts to claim Russia's superiority and justify his policies on economic and social development were validated by the German invasion of Russia in 1941, which was a direct challenge to Soviet power and resulted in significant territorial losses for the USSR. This event directly contradicted the earlier claims about Russia's backwardness and proved that the Soviet Union had overcome its historical disadvantages."
