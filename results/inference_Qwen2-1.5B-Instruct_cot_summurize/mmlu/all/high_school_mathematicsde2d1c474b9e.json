Among the numbers from \\(1\\) to \\(100\\), there are \\(50\\) even digits (0 through 9) and \\(50\\) odd digits (1 through 9) because every second number starting from \\(0\\) is even and every other number is odd. Thus, \\(50 + 50 = 100\\) numbers end with an even digit.\n\nNext, let's consider divisibility by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. From \\(1\\) to \\(100\\), there are \\(33\\) multiples of 3: \\(3, 6, 9, ..., 99\\). This means \\(33\\) numbers will be divisible by 3 among our \\(100\\) possibilities.\n\nWe want to calculate the number of integers that meet both conditions: being divisible by 2 AND not divisible by 3. Since \\(50\\) numbers end with an even digit, and \\(33\\) numbers are divisible by 3, the total count of numbers meeting these criteria would be:\n\n\\[50 - 33 = 17\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is:\n\n\\[\\frac{17}{100}\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\\frac{17}{66}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. \\(\\frac{17}{66}\\)."
