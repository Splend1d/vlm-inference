And this power has its original only from compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community. \u2026\nWhensoever, therefore, the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends.\nJohn Locke, Second Treatise of Government, 1690\nBased on the passage, one could argue that Locke was an advocate of\n\nA. divine right monarchy\nB. absolutism\nC. constitutionalism\nD. socialism\n"

However, based on the context provided, it seems that Locke would support the idea of a limited government with checks and balances to protect individual rights. This aligns more closely with constitutionalism than with divine right monarchy, absolutism, or socialism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Constitutionalism."
