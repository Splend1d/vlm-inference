This is because capitalism creates a system where individuals compete with each other for resources, leading to feelings of guilt and fear of failure, which can motivate people to seek spiritual comfort through religious practices. However, if a socialist revolution eliminates this competitive system, it could lead to a decline in religious beliefs."
