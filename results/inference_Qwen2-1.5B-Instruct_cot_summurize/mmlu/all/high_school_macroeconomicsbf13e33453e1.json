This can happen if the economy has already experienced stagflation before, or if there is a new shock that exacerbates existing problems.\n\nIf the economy has already experienced stagflation, then the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves may have shifted to the left due to falling prices and lower productivity. This can lead to higher unemployment and stagnant wages, as well as lower economic growth.\n\nHowever, if there is a new shock that exacerbates existing problems, such as a recession or war, then the economy may experience a double dip recession, where there is a second round of stagflation. In this case, the two curves would shift further to the left, leading to even higher levels of unemployment and stagnant wages.\n\nSo in summary, stagflation can be caused by a combination of factors including high unemployment, stagnant wages, and low economic growth, but it is most commonly associated with a leftward shift in both the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves."
