Sometimes an action can be permissible even if it is motivated by a bad desire.\n\nThis is because Sandel's argument about the desirability of the good over the bad in our motivations does not apply to this particular situation. The scientist is motivated by a desire for mastery, which is generally considered to be a good motivation. It may not be the most noble or virtuous motivation, but it is still a good one compared to other options like self-interest or harmlessness. Therefore, the action taken by the scientist is still permissible, even though it is motivated by a bad desire.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it implies that all actions motivated by bad desires are impermissible, which is not necessarily true. There may be cases where an action is morally acceptable despite being motivated by a bad desire, especially when the bad desire leads to a greater overall good.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because Sandel argues that the desirability of the good over the bad in our motivations is important, but he does not say anything about whether the desire for mastery is a bad desire itself. He is discussing the desirability of the good over the bad, not the desirability of the bad over the good.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because there may be cases where an action is morally acceptable despite being motivated by a bad desire, even if it is necessary to find a cure for congenital blindness. For example, some people might believe that sacrificing their own health for the sake of others is a good thing, even though it goes against their own interests."
