Pia mater and brain surface.\n\nThe cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates around the brain and spinal cord through an intricate network of spaces called ventricles. The CSF fills these ventricles, which are lined with a layer of tissue called the pia mater. The pia mater connects to the brain surface, allowing for easy flow of CSF out of the ventricles and into the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain.\n\nTherefore, the CSF flows around the brain and spinal cord from the dura mater to the pia mater, then out of the ventricles and into the subarachnoid space."
