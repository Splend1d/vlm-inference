In the overall reaction, all the reactants are converted into products. Therefore, a substance that is produced in one elementary reaction and consumed in another is a reactant.\n\nA catalyst can be either a reactant or a product depending on its role in the reaction. A complex is a molecule or compound that contains more than one atom, and it may or may not be involved in the reaction."
