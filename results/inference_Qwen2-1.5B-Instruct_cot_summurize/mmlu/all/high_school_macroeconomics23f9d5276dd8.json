One example of such a policy is the Federal Reserve lowering the reserve ratio, which would increase the amount of money available for lending and investment.\n\nTherefore, option A (the Fed lowering the reserve ratio) is an example of a contractionary monetary policy. Options B (the Fed lowering the discount rate), C (the Fed increasing taxes), and D (the Fed selling Treasury securities to commercial banks) do not involve reducing the money supply or slowing down economic activity, so they do not represent contractionary monetary policies."
