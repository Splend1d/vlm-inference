Therefore, if the pH is equal to this value, the concentration of H2PO4^ will also be equal to its equilibrium concentration.\nThe equilibrium concentration of H2PO4^ is given by:\n\\[ [H_2PO_4^-]_{eq} = \\frac{K_a}{[H_3O^+]} \\]\nwhere \\(K_a\\) is the dissociation constant for H2PO4^. The only way for the concentration of H2PO4^ to be equal to its equilibrium concentration at pH = pKa = 2.17 is if the pH is 2.17.\nTo find the chemical shift of H2PO4^ at pH = 2.17, we can use the formula:\n\\[ \\Delta \\nu = -\\frac{\\Delta E}{R} \\log_{10} K_c \\]\nwhere \u0394\u03bd is the chemical shift (in parts per million), \u0394E is the energy difference between the excited state and ground state of H2PO4^(\u2212), R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol*K), and Kc is the equilibrium constant for the reaction.\nSince the \u0394\u03bd is negative, it represents an electron-withdrawing effect on H2PO4^(\u2212). The \u0394\u03bd for H2PO4^(\u2212) at pH = 2.17 is approximately 0.000002 ppm, which corresponds to a shift of about 3.41 ppm from the standard reference point.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 3.41 ppm."
