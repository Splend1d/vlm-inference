Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is often used by individuals with terminal illnesses or chronic pain who have expressed a desire to end their lives due to unbearable suffering. It involves the use of medical assistance to commit suicide, typically through the administration of lethal doses of medication. While PAS can be used for many different reasons, it is most commonly associated with individuals who are terminally ill and have no other options for relief from their symptoms.\n\nIn terms of demographics, studies have shown that PAS is more commonly used by individuals who are elderly, have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and have experienced significant suffering from their condition. Additionally, those who have no family support may also be more likely to seek out PAS as an option.\n\nIt's important to note that PAS is not without controversy and has been subject to legal and ethical debates in many countries around the world. However, it remains a topic of ongoing discussion and debate within the medical community."
