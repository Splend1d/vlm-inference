The argument makes several claims about the use of variables and predicates in logical expressions:\n\n1. There are those who use predicate variables.\n2. The values of these variables are attributes.\n3. Predicates are wanted in all sentences regardless of whether there are attributes to refer to.\n4. The dummy predicate 'F' is wanted generally for expository purposes.\n5. If we are going to quantify over attributes and refer to them, then clarity is served by using recognizable variables and distinctive names for the purposes, and not mixing these up with the predicates.\n\nFrom these premises, the conclusion that \"if we are going to quantify over attributes and refer to them, then clarity is served by using recognizable variables and distinctive names for the purposes, and not mixing these up with the predicates\" can be inferred. This conclusion ties together the other premises and provides a coherent justification for using recognized variables and distinct names when quantifying over attributes."
