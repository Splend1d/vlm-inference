The TFR is a measure of the average number of children born per woman during her reproductive years, and it is used to estimate the total number of children expected to be born in a given year if all women had one child each. It takes into account both the number of live births and the number of stillbirths, miscarriages, and abortions. The TFR can help researchers understand the demographic trends of a population over time and compare different countries or regions."
