The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime. The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\nA. Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\nB. Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\nC. No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\nD. No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.\n"

However, this remedy is limited to the extent that the wrongdoer can be held liable for damages resulting from the deprivation of the property. In this case, the man was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, which means he lost ownership of the property through judicial proceedings. Therefore, the man does not have any legal rights in the property.\n\nIt is important to note that this answer is based on the common law principles of equity, which are not always followed in criminal cases. Additionally, some jurisdictions have different rules regarding the remedies available after conviction in criminal cases."
