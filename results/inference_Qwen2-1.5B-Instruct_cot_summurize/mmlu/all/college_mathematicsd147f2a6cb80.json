An injection means that every element in the domain has at most one corresponding element in the codomain. A surjection means that every element in the codomain has an element in the domain that maps to it. For $f$ to be both one-to-one and onto, we need to ensure that for every element in the codomain there exists exactly one element in the domain that maps to it.\n\nFor function $f$ to be compact, it needs to satisfy the property that every open cover of its range (i.e., its image) contains a finite subcover. This means that every set of points in the range can be covered by finitely many intervals with their ends on the range. However, this condition does not guarantee continuity or one-to-oneness of $f$. \n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect because it includes both properties needed for continuity and one-to-one-ness.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because while the image of $f$ being compact implies that $f$ is continuous, this alone is not sufficient to imply that $f$ is one-to-one. One-to-one functions have more stringent conditions than mere continuity.\n\nOption A is also incorrect because although $f$ being one-to-one and onto implies that $f$ is continuous, this alone is not enough to conclude that $f$ is compact. Compactness requires more specific conditions related to the range of $f$, such as being closed and bounded.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D. I and III only."
