We know that $x$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by both 4 and 3.\nThis means that $x = 4a + 1$ for some integer $a$, and $x = 3b + 1$ for some integer $b$.\nWe also know that $x$ leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.\nThis means that $x = 5c + 2$ for some integer $c$.\n\nNow we can set up the following system of equations:\n\\[4a + 1 = 5c + 2 \\quad \\text{(equation 1)}\\]\n\\[3b + 1 = 5c + 2 \\quad \\text{(equation 2)}\\]\n\nFrom equation 1, we can subtract equation 2 from it to get:\n\\[4a - 3b = 1 \\implies a - \\frac{3}{4}b = \\frac{1}{4}\\]\nSo $a = \\frac{3}{4}b + \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nSubstituting this into equation 2 gives us:\n\\[3(\\frac{3}{4}b + \\frac{1}{4}) + 1 = 5c + 2 \\implies \\frac{9}{4}b + \\frac{3}{4} + 1 = 5c + 2 \\implies \\frac{9}{4}b + \\frac{7}{4} = 5c + 1.\\]\n\nMultiplying through by 4 gives us:\n\\[9b + 7 = 20c + 4.\\]\n\nRearranging terms gives us:\n\\[9b - 20c = -3.\\]\n\nSince $b$ and $c$ are integers, $9b - 20c$ must be an integer as well.\nThe only way for this to happen is if $9b - 20c = -3$ is true for all possible values of $b$ and $c$.\nThe only integer solution to this equation is $b = c = 1$.\nSo $x = 5(1) + 2 = 7$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{7}$. The answer is: $7$"
