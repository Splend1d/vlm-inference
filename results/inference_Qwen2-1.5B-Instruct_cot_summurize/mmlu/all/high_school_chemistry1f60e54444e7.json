The 2s peak has the lowest energy.\n\nThe photoelectron spectrum of an atom consists of peaks that correspond to the energies of electron transitions between different atomic orbitals. In the case of carbon, there are four main atomic orbitals: s, p, d, and f. The energy levels of these orbitals are given by the following formulas:\n\n- s orbital: \\( E_{\\text{s}} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times Z^2 \\)\n- p orbital (first excited state): \\( E_{\\text{p}} = \\frac{7}{5} \\times Z^2 \\) where \\( Z \\) is the atomic number of the element.\n- d orbital (second excited state): \\( E_{\\text{d}} = \\frac{111}{4} \\times Z^2 \\)\n- f orbital (third excited state): \\( E_{\\text{f}} = \\frac{9}{4} \\times Z^2 \\)\n\nwhere \\( Z \\) is the atomic number of the element.\n\nFrom this, we can see that the second excited state (2p) is lower in energy than the first excited state (1p). Therefore, the 2p peak would have the lowest energy compared to the other peaks. \n\nSo the correct answer is B. The 2s peak has the lowest energy."
