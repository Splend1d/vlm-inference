The number of vertices minus the number of edges (V-E) must be even.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. A complete graph with 12 vertices. This means that every vertex has an edge connecting it to all other vertices. Since there are 12 vertices, this graph would be connected since we can connect any two vertices without forming a cycle. However, for an Eulerian circuit, the condition V-E=2 should hold true, but here V-E=12-12=0, which doesn't satisfy the condition. So, this graph does not necessarily have an Eulerian circuit.\n\nII. A complete graph with 13 vertices. In this case, the graph would also be connected because every pair of vertices will form an edge. For an Eulerian circuit, the condition V-E=2 should hold true. Here, V-E=13-13=0, which again doesn't satisfy the condition. Therefore, this graph also does not necessarily have an Eulerian circuit.\n\nIII. A tree with 13 vertices. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. Every vertex in a tree has at most one neighbor. Therefore, if a tree has 13 vertices, then the total number of edges E = n(n-1)/2 = 13(12/2) = 78, which is greater than 69 (the minimum possible number of edges for a tree). However, the question asks for a tree with 13 vertices, so there might be some misunderstanding here. Let's consider the correct interpretation:\n\nIf we interpret \"tree\" as a connected graph where every vertex has at most one neighbor, then a tree with 13 vertices does indeed exist. In this case, the graph would be connected and each vertex has at most one neighbor, ensuring that the condition V-E=2 holds true. Thus, this graph must have an Eulerian circuit.\n\nSo, the answer is C. III only."
