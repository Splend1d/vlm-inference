According to the problem:\n\n1) The sum of the two numbers is 19:\n\\[ x + y = 19 \\]\n\n2) Their product is 70:\n\\[ xy = 70 \\]\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously. Multiplying both sides of the first equation by \\(y\\) gives us:\n\\[ xy + y^2 = 19y \\]\nSubstituting the second equation into this gives:\n\\[ 70 + y^2 = 19y \\]\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[ y^2 - 19y + 70 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form \\(ay^2 + by + c = 0\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -19\\), and \\(c = 70\\).\n\nTo solve for \\(y\\), we can use the quadratic formula \\(y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\):\n\\[ y = \\frac{19 \\pm \\sqrt{(19)^2 - 4(1)(70)}}{2(1)} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{19 \\pm \\sqrt{81 - 280}}{2} \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{19 \\pm \\sqrt{-199}}{2} \\] (since the discriminant is negative)\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for \\(y\\). This means our original approach was incorrect; let's correct it.\n\nInstead, we should recognize that if there were no solution, the quadratic would not have any real roots at all, which contradicts our initial assumption that the product of the two numbers is positive (as given by the second equation).\n\nTherefore, the correct way to proceed is to factorize the quadratic equation:\n\\[ y^2 - 19y + 70 = 0 \\]\n\nFactoring the left side gives us:\n\\[ (y-10)(y-7) = 0 \\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:\n\\[ y-10=0 \\Rightarrow y=10 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y-7=0 \\Rightarrow y=7 \\]\n\nThus, the two numbers could be either 10 or 7, but since they need to satisfy the conditions of being integers and their product being 70, the correct answer is **B. 7, 10**."
