Worker empowerment\n\nWorker autonomy in decision-making can be an example of worker empowerment, which refers to the ability of workers to make decisions that affect their work and workplace conditions without having to seek permission or approval from higher-ups. This can include things like choosing how to organize tasks, setting priorities for projects, or negotiating with management about compensation and benefits.\n\nWorker autonomy can also lead to increased worker power, as it gives workers more control over their work and their lives. It can help to build trust between workers and management, as well as promote a sense of ownership and pride in one's job. However, it requires careful consideration and implementation to ensure that it does not lead to negative consequences such as increased conflict or decreased productivity."
