The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.\n\nWhen the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution also increases. This means that even if the population proportion is close to the true value (like in this case), the standard deviation of the sampling distribution will be larger, which makes it harder for the sample proportions to get closer to the true population proportion.\n\nHowever, as the sample size increases, the sample proportions will become more consistent with each other and more likely to converge towards the true population proportion. So while the spread of the distribution of the sample proportion may decrease, the overall pattern of the distribution will still be similar to the binomial distribution."
