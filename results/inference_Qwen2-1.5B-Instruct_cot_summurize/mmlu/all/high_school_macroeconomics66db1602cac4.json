Investment in capital, such as machinery and equipment, can lead to increased production capacity and output, which can shift the aggregate supply curve to the right. This is because increased production capacity leads to higher output levels that can be sold at market prices. \n\nDecreases in labor supply or increases in corporate taxes or decreases in the availability of education and training would not shift the aggregate supply curve to the right. Decreases in labor supply could lead to lower productivity and output levels, while increases in corporate taxes could reduce incentives for businesses to invest and hire more workers, leading to lower output levels. Similarly, decreases in the availability of education and training could limit the skills and knowledge available to workers, making it harder for them to take advantage of job opportunities and contributing to lower output levels."
