An increase in non-traditional security threats.\n\nEfficient and effective balance of power is crucial for maintaining stability and preventing conflicts between nations. When states engage in inefficient balancing, they may be unable to effectively prevent conflicts from escalating into larger-scale disputes. This can lead to an increased risk of non-traditional security threats such as terrorism, cyberattacks, and economic instability, which can have far-reaching consequences on global security and stability. Additionally, it can also contribute to the emergence of non-state actors that can challenge traditional state-centric security systems. Therefore, efficient balancing is essential for ensuring peace and security across borders."
