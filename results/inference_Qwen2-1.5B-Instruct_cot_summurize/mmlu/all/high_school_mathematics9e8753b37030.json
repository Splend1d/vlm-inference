                    "text": " Let's consider the first term of an arithmetic sequence, which we'll call $a$. Since all terms in this sequence are consecutive odd integers, the common difference between each term is also odd. So if there are $n$ terms in the sequence, then the last term will be $a + (n-1)d$, where $d$ is the common difference and $n$ is the number of terms.\n\nSince all terms are odd, their sum must be even. Therefore, the sum of an arithmetic sequence with $n$ terms can be expressed as $(n/2)(2a + (n-1)d)$, because the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. In our case, since the sum is 240, we have:\n\n\\[(n/2)(2a + (n-1)d) = 240.\\]\n\nWe want to find the number of solutions for this equation, so let's start by simplifying it. First, divide both sides by 2 to get:\n\n\\[n(2a + (n-1)d)/2 = 120.\\]\n\nThen multiply both sides by 2 again to get rid of the fraction:\n\n\\[n(2a + (n-1)d) = 240.\\]\n\nNow, we know that $n$ is an integer, and $2a + (n-1)d$ is also an integer. The only way this can happen is if $n=5$ and $d=36$. Then we have:\n\n\\[2a + 4d = 120,\\]\n\\[2a + 4*36 = 120,\\]\n\\[2a + 144 = 120,\\]\n\\[2a = -24,\\]\n\\[a = -12.\\]\n\nBut this doesn't make sense, because we assumed that all terms were positive. Let's go back and check our work. We made a mistake when we simplified the original equation. The correct approach should be:\n\n\\[n(2a + (n-1)d) = 240.\\]\n\nSince $n$ is an integer, we can try different values of $n$ to see if any of them satisfy this equation. If $n=5$, then we have:\n\n\\[5(2a + 4d) = 240,\\]\n\\[10a + 20d = 240.\\]\n\nSubtracting 20 from both sides gives us:\n\n\\[10a = 220,\\]\n\\[a = 22.\\]\n\nNow we can substitute $a = 22$ into the equation $2a + (n-1)d = 120$ to solve for $d$. We get:\n\n\\[2*22 + (n-1)*36 = 120,\\]\n\\[44 + 36(n-1) = 120,\\]\n\\[36(n-1) = 76,\\]\n\\[n-1 = 2,\\]\n\\[n = 3.\\]\n\nSo the only solution to the equation is $n=5$ and $d=36$. This means that there is exactly one arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers whose sum is 240, which corresponds to option B. The answer is: $\\boxed{B}$"
