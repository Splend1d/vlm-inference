A ten-year loan with an annual interest rate of $10\\%$ compounded quarterly, with the condition that at the end of 5 years, Alex must make a payment equal to half of what he owes. The other half continues to accrue interest, and at the end of the ten years, Alex will pay off the remaining balance. 2. A ten-year loan with a simple annual interest rate of $12\\%$, with just one lump-sum payment at the end of the ten years. Find the positive difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes. Round your answer to the nearest dollar.\n\nA. 16401\nB. 16400\nC. 382\nD. 383\n"

Plugging these values into the formula gives us:\n\\[A_1 = 10000 \\left(1 + \\frac{0.10}{4}\\right)^{4 \\cdot 5} = 10000 \\left(1 + 0.025\\right)^{20} = 10000 \\left(1.025\\right)^{20} \\approx 16401.6.\\]\nAt the end of 5 years, Alex makes a payment of half of what he owes, so he pays $16401.6 / 2 = \\$8200.8$.\nThe remaining balance is $16401.6 - 8200.8 = \\$8200.8$.\nFor option 2, we simply use the formula for simple interest: $A = P(1 + rt)$, where $A$ is the final amount, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the annual interest rate, and $t$ is the time the money is invested for in years.\nFor option 2, we have $P = \\$10,\\!000$, $r = 0.12$, and $t = 10$. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:\n\\[A_2 = 10000 \\left(1 + 0.12 \\cdot 10\\right) = 10000 \\left(1 + 1.2\\right) = 10000 \\cdot 2.2 = \\$22000.\\]\nThe positive difference between the total amounts Alex has to pay back under the two schemes is $22000 - 16401.6 = \\$5598.4$, which rounds to $\\boxed{\\$5598}$.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 383."
