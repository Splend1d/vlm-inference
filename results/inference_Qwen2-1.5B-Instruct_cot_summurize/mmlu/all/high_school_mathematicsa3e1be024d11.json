                    "text": " Let's call the six numbers on the faces of the cube $a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f$. The product of the numbers on each face is $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d) \\cdot (e \\cdot f)$.\nThe sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to $1001 = 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9$.\nEach vertex is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to that vertex. So we have:\n- The vertex opposite $a$ has the product $(b \\cdot c) \\cdot (d \\cdot e) \\cdot (f)$.\n- The vertex opposite $b$ has the product $(a \\cdot c) \\cdot (d \\cdot e) \\cdot (f)$.\n- The vertex opposite $c$ has the product $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot (d \\cdot e) \\cdot (f)$.\n- The vertex opposite $d$ has the product $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot e) \\cdot (f)$.\n- The vertex opposite $e$ has the product $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d) \\cdot (f)$.\n- The vertex opposite $f$ has the product $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d) \\cdot (e)$.\n\nWe know that the sum of the products at each vertex is $11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 = 990$.\nSo we can write the equation:\n\\[11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 + 990 = 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 + (a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d) \\cdot (e \\cdot f).\\]\nSimplifying the left side gives $990 + 990 = 1980$.\nSubstituting this into the equation gives $1980 = 1980 + (a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d) \\cdot (e \\cdot f)$.\nSince $1980 = 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 = (a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d) \\cdot (e \\cdot f)$.\nThis implies that $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d) \\cdot (e \\cdot f) = 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 = 990$.\nBut we know that the sum of the numbers on the faces is $a+b+c+d+e+f=6$.\nSo the sum of the numbers on the faces is $\\frac{990}{6} = 160$.\nHowever, this doesn't match any of the given options.\nLet's re-examine our work. We made an error in the last step. The correct equation should be:\n\\[(a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d) \\cdot (e \\cdot f) = 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9.\\]\nAnd we know that the sum of the numbers on the faces is $a+b+c+d+e+f=6$.\nSo the correct sum of the numbers on the faces is $\\frac{11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9}{6} = 160/6 = 26.66...\\neq 1001/6$.\nWe must have made another mistake in our reasoning. Let's go back and check our work again carefully.\n\nAfter re-examining our work, we realize that we made a mistake in our calculation of the sum of the numbers on the faces.\nThe sum of the numbers on the faces is actually $a+b+c+d+e+f$,\nnot $\\frac{a+b+c+d+e+f}{6}$.\nSo let's correct our calculation of the sum of the numbers on the faces.\nThe sum of the numbers on the faces is $a+b+c+d+e+f=6$.\nAnd since the sum of the numbers on the vertices is $11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 = 990$,\nwe can write the equation:\n\\[990 = (a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d) \\cdot (e \\cdot f).\\]\nMultiplying both sides by 6 gives:\n\\[5940 = (a \\cdot b) \\cdot (c \\cdot d) \\cdot (e \\cdot f).\\]\nNow we can equate the two expressions for the sum of the numbers on the faces:\n\\[a+b+c+d+e+f = 6.\\]\nAnd from the equation above"
