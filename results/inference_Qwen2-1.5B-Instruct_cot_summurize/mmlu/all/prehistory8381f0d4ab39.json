The structure of the innominate (pelvis) - This includes the ilium and ischium bones.\n2. The position of the foramen magnum - The foramen magnum is a hole in the skull that allows the brain to be positioned at the center of the head.\n3. The presence or absence of a divergent big toe - In bipedal animals like humans, the big toe is usually straight, while in quadrupedal animals like horses, it is bent upward.\n\nAll these features can help paleoanthropologists determine whether an animal was bipedal or not."
