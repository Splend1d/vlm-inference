While the woman was away on a vacation, there was a burglary at her home, and her favorite painting was stolen. Although the painting was insured for $1,000,000 by an insurance company, it had a market value of over $1,500,000. When the woman returned from vacation, she met with a detective employed by the insurance company to investigate the theft. During their meeting, the woman told the detective that she would pay him an extra $50,000 if he recovered the paihting. For the next three weeks, the detective investigated the theft as part of his job responsibilities with the insurance company. Within the course of this investigation, the detective learned who was responsible for the burglary. As a consequence, the culprit was apprehended, and the painting was recovered and returned to the woman. The detective then requested the $50,000 that the woman had promised to pay him. After the woman refused to make the payment, the detective sued the woman for breach of contract. Who is most likely to prevail?\n\nA. The woman, because her promise was gratuitous.\nB. The woman, because the insurance company owed her a pre-existing duty to find the painting.\nC. The detective, because he did the act necessary to constitute an acceptance of the woman's offer.\nD. The detective, because the market value of the painting exceeded its insured value, so there was sufficient consideration to support the woman's promise.\n"

A gratuitous promise is one where there is no consideration (money or anything else) exchanged between the parties. Therefore, the detective cannot enforce the promise against the woman, and she is not liable for the debt.\n\nOn the other hand, the insurance company owed the woman a pre-existing duty to find the painting. This means that the woman could have expected the insurance company to take action to recover the painting even if she had not made a promise to pay them anything. However, the detective accepted the woman's promise, which constituted an acceptance of the offer. Therefore, the detective has a legal claim against the woman based on the promise they made to each other.\n\nIn conclusion, the woman is more likely to prevail because her promise was gratuitous and the detective accepted it, while the insurance company did not owe her any duty to find the painting."
