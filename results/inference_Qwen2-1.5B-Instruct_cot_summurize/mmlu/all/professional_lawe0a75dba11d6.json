This is because the rancher had a duty to act reasonably under the circumstances, and the fact that he made an emergency landing in the middle of an orange grove suggests that he believed that there was no other way to safely land his plane without causing harm to the grove. Additionally, the fact that he managed to land his plane between the trees in the grove suggests that he acted with caution and consideration for the safety of others."
