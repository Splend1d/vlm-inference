Therefore, option A is correct. \n\nRegarding B, it does not necessarily succeed in formulating the interest theory without the correlativity of rights and duties. The acceptance that conferring a right means recognizing the interest represented by that right could also involve correlativity.\n\nRegarding C, it seems to suggest treating an interest as the exercise of choice, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether or not it successfully avoids correlativity between rights and duties.\n\nRegarding D, it asserts that X has a right only when the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties, which again involves correlativity between rights and duties.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Regarding X's interest as directly related to Y's duty."
