This matches with option D. 100. \n\nHowever, it seems there might be some confusion in the question or interpretation as it asks \"how many units\", but the answer provided is \"how many units must Spark sell\". The correct calculation should not involve dividing by 1 since the number of units must be an integer. The correct interpretation would be \"what minimum number of units Spark must sell to achieve a desired profit of 10%?\" In this case, the correct answer is D. 100, assuming the intention was to calculate the number of units based on the profit goal rather than the sales goal."
