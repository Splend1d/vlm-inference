One effective way to do this is to help them change their self-statements, which are the beliefs they have about themselves and their abilities. By changing these statements, children can learn to think more positively about themselves and develop a more task-oriented mindset.\n\nFor example, instead of saying \"I am not good at this,\" a child might say \"I am capable of learning this skill with practice.\" This shift in perspective can help the child feel more confident and motivated to take action towards their goals.\n\nIt's important to note that self-instructional training should be tailored to each individual child's needs and strengths. Some children may benefit more from programming instructions or structured activities, while others may need more time to work through difficult emotions or habits. It's also crucial to provide positive reinforcement and support throughout the process to ensure that the changes are sustainable and lead to lasting improvements in behavior."
