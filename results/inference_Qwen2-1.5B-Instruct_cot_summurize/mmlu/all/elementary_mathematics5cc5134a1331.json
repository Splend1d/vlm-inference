All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 10.\n\nThis statement is false because if we divide any of these numbers (28, 42, 56, ...) by 10, it won't result in an integer value (i.e., will have a remainder). For example, dividing 28 by 10 gives us a decimal fraction of 2.8.\n\nB. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 4.\n\nThis statement is also false because all numbers in this pattern are odd and cannot be evenly divisible by 4 without leaving a remainder.\n\nC. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 8.\n\nThis statement is false because some of them (like 32) are not even, so they cannot be divided equally by 8.\n\nD. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 7.\n\nThis statement is true because adding 14 repeatedly to 28 gives you sequences that alternate between multiples of 7 and multiples of 14. When you add 14 again, the sequence alternates back to being multiples of 7. Thus, every 7th term of this pattern is equal to 28, which means all terms can be divided equally by 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 7."
