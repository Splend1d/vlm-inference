Drive-reduction theories suggest that an individual's behavior is influenced by internal drives or needs, such as hunger, thirst, or desire for food and drink. However, these theories do not explain why someone might eat when they are already full, or make decisions based on their current state of satiety rather than their internal drives. Therefore, none of the options provided by you can be explained using drive-reduction theories."
