Saving is equal to zero when consumption equals disposable income.\n\nThis statement is true because when consumption equals disposable income, it means that households have enough money to spend on their desired goods and services without having to save any money. In other words, households have enough money to satisfy their wants and needs, and they do not need to save any additional money for future use. Therefore, saving would be equal to zero in this case."
