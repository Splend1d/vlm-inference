The Commerce Power is a constitutional power granted to Congress by Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution that gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce. It is one of the three enumerated powers of Congress, along with the taxing and borrowing powers and the power to regulate foreign and interstate trade. The other two powers, the taxing and spending powers, can be used in conjunction with the Commerce Power to support federal law."
