The goods on the axes are perfect substitutes in consumption.\n\nWhen two goods are perfect substitutes, an increase in one good does not affect the demand for the other good and vice versa. This means that if we have enough of one good to satisfy our needs, there is no need to trade it for another good to get more of it. In this case, the production possibilities frontier (PPF) would be a straight line because any point on the PPF represents an opportunity cost where the maximum amount of one good can be produced at the current level of resources. If the goods are not perfect substitutes, the PPF would be curved."
