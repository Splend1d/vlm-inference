This means that corporations have little or no boundaries when it comes to how they handle personal data, which can lead to issues with privacy control. Additionally, since there are many individuals involved in corporate activities, it can be difficult to maintain individual privacy. Finally, much corporate activity takes place in private spaces, such as offices and conference rooms, which can also pose challenges for maintaining privacy."
