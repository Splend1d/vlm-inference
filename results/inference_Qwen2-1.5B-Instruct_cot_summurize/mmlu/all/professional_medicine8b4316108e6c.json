The patient initially noticed the weakness only while she was getting in and out of her car, but during the past 2 weeks, the weakness has progressed, so that she now has difficulty combing her hair. Since the symptoms began, she also has had aching of the joints in her hands that has responded partially to ibuprofen. She was adopted and family history is unknown. She has two teenaged children who are well. She appears uncomfortable. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 68 kg(150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is alert and fully oriented. Physical examination discloses cracking of the skin of both hands that involves the tips and lateral sides of several fingers. The muscles of the upper arms and legs are somewhat tender to pressure. Results of serum laboratory studies show a creatine kinase concentration of 600 U/L and a lactate dehydrogenase concentration of 800 U/L. Results of complete blood count are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Fibromyalgia\nB. Myasthenia gravis\nC. Polymyositis\nD. Scleroderma\n"

                    "text": "The most likely diagnosis for this patient based on the symptoms described is:\n\nC. Polymyositis\n\nPolymyositis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle inflammation and pain, which can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue. It affects multiple muscle groups and typically presents with a combination of joint pain and muscle stiffness. The patient's description of generalized aching and weakness of the proximal muscles of all four extremities and difficulty combing hair fits this pattern. Additionally, the patient's age and gender, as well as the fact that the symptoms have been present for over 2 months, support the diagnosis of polymyositis.\n\nIt's important to note that other conditions such as myasthenia gravis or scleroderma may also cause similar symptoms, but they are less common in women than polymyositis. A correct diagnosis is crucial for appropriate management and treatment options."
