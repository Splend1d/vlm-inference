The Senate as a whole has confirmation powers that the House does not have.\nC. Members are appointed to the committee in the House but are elected to committees in the Senate.\nD.

This means that the workload on the floor in the Senate is significantly higher than it is in the House. As a result, members who serve on committees in the House are often able to influence policy decisions at a much faster pace than those who serve on committees in the Senate.\n\nAdditionally, members of the House of Representatives are generally more accessible to their constituents, which allows them to gather feedback from the public and make changes based on that input.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer."
