He is considering the purchase of a different type of hen, so he took a random sample of 18 eggs laid by this type of hen. The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973. If he uses a 5% significance level, which is the correct conclusion and reason?\n\nA. Because tis more extreme than \u00b11.96, he should reject the null hypothesis.

Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\nC. Because tis less extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis.

He has convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n\nIn order to determine whether there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56g, we need to conduct a t-test. The t-statistic is calculated as:\n\nt = (mean of the sample group) - (mean of the population) / (standard error of the difference between means)\n\nwhere the standard error of the difference between means is given by:\n\nSE = sqrt[(s2sample/population)/(n-1)]\n\nwhere s2sample is the variance of the sample group, n is the number of observations in the sample, and population is the population mean.\n\nFor the first scenario, where the mean of the sample group is 54.1 grams and the mean of the population is 56 grams, the standard error of the difference between means would be:\n\nSE = sqrt[(s2sample/population)/(n-1)] = sqrt[(0.01/18)^2] \u2248 0.004\n\nSince the t-statistic is -1.973, and since the degrees of freedom are 17 (since we are testing a difference between two groups), the critical value for a one-tailed test at the 5% significance level is approximately +1.96.\n\nTherefore, because the t-statistic is more extreme than the critical value of t for 18 degrees of freedom, we can conclude that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is significantly different from 56 grams at the 5% significance level. This leads us to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis that there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 grams."
