The man asks the woman to agree that all of his property that he now owns will remain in his name if they ever get divorced. She agrees to that but demands a written document. However, they got married without having signed anything. Three months later, the husband leaves the wife for another woman. He sends her notice to vacate the home due to their prenuptial agreement. When she doesn't move, husband sues, asking for enforcement of the oral prenuptial contract. Will the court likely enforce the husband's claim?\n\nA. Yes, because the consideration for the contract was the marriage and the consummation of the marriage made the contract complete and enforceable.\nB. Yes, because prenuptial agreements are given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to enforcement decisions.\nC. No, because a contract in consideration of marriage must be in writing and the prenuptial was therefore not legal as long as it remained oral.\nD. No, because husband did not live up to his promise to put the agreement in writing and therefore he was guilty of fraud.\n"

Yes, because the consideration for the contract was the marriage and the consummation of the marriage made the contract complete and enforceable.\n\nIn this scenario, the husband agreed to give his property to his wife if they were to divorce, which is considered an enforceable contract under most jurisdictions. The fact that the agreement was verbal does not necessarily invalidate it, especially if there is evidence of mutual understanding and agreement between the parties involved. Additionally, the fact that the couple lived together before getting married suggests that they had a close relationship that could support the enforceability of the contract. Therefore, the court would likely uphold the husband's claim that the prenuptial agreement is valid and should be enforced."
