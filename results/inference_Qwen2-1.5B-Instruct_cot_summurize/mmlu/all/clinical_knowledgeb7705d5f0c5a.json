IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect.\n\nIV (intravenous) administration can allow for the titration of drugs, which means that the dosage of a medication can be adjusted based on the patient's response or needs. This can help achieve the desired effect more effectively and safely. \n\nThe other options are not necessarily false, but they do not apply as well to all situations or patients. For example, IV administration does carry some risks such as infection from bacteria in the catheter, so it is important to use sterile techniques and monitor the patient closely. However, these risks are generally lower than those associated with other types of injections like intramuscular or subcutaneous injections. Additionally, an intravenous cannula may be used for both drug and fluid administration depending on the type of treatment being administered and the specific needs of the patient."
