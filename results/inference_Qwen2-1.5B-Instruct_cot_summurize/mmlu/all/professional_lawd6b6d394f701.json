In this scenario, the young man and his friend agreed to break into the neighbor's house and steal the TV. This constitutes conspiracy.\n\nLarceny is the unlawful taking of someone else's property without their consent. In this case, the young man broke into the neighbor's house and took the TV, which is considered larceny.\n\nTherefore, the friend's actions can be classified as both conspiracy and larceny."
