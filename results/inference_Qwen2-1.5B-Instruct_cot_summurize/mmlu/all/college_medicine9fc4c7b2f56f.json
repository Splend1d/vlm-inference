The enzyme(s) responsible for this process include pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of substrates such as glucose, fructose, and other sugars into pyruvate, which can then be further metabolized to produce ATP."
