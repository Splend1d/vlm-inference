These adaptations include physical ones such as having larger brains or stronger limbs, but also cognitive abilities like language and culture that allow us to survive and thrive in diverse habitats.\n\nWhile biological adaptations can certainly play a role in allowing humans to live in different environments, it's important to recognize that human intelligence and cultural adaptations have played a significant role as well. For example, our ability to develop agriculture and build shelters has allowed us to settle in more permanent locations and establish complex societies that enable us to thrive across vast distances. Additionally, our cultural practices, such as hunting techniques, medicine, and religious beliefs, have helped us navigate and understand the natural world around us."
