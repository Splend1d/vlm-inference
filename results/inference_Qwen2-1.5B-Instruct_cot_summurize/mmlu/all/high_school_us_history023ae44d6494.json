We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\nOf the following policies, which was NOT a main objective of American Progressives?\n\nA. Passage of the Pure Food and Water Act\nB. Creation of national forests and protected wildlife reserves\nC. Initiation of antitrust lawsuits against various corporate monopolies\nD.

Intervention in the affairs of Central American governments\n\nThe Progressive Party platform did not advocate for intervention in the affairs of Central American governments. Instead, it emphasized the importance of maintaining the government of the people, by the people, for the people through the establishment and maintenance of equal opportunity and industrial justice, as well as securing the rights of the people to use their sovereign powers to utilize, maintain, or alter the country's resources, businesses, institutions, and laws in ways that promote the general interest. The passage of the Pure Food and Water Act, creation of national forests and protected wildlife reserves, and initiation of antitrust lawsuits against corporate monopolies were all part of the Progressive Party's goals."
