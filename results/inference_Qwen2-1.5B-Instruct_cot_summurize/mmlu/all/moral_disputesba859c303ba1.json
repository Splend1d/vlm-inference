If a being lacks the ability to reason at all, let alone to understand and follow moral principles, then it cannot be considered a moral agent. The other options (a moral patient, an object of moral sympathy, and a being of value) may still apply in certain cases where the being has some form of consciousness or agency, but they do not necessarily require moral reasoning as a prerequisite for being considered a moral agent."
