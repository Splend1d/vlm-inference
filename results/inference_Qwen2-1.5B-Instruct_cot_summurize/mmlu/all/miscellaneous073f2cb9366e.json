Eisenhower, is known for several key initiatives that had a lasting impact on American transportation policy and infrastructure. One of these was the construction of the Interstate Highway System, which aimed to improve mobility, reduce congestion, and enhance economic development across the country.\n\nThe construction of the interstate highways began in the early 1950s, with the first segments being completed in the late 1950s. The project involved the building of over 600 miles of new roads and highways, as well as the widening and reconstruction of existing routes. This massive undertaking not only improved connectivity between different parts of the country but also helped to spur economic growth and development through increased access to markets and resources.\n\nTherefore, option C (funding the construction of the interstate highway system) is the correct answer based on the information provided about President Eisenhower's administration."
