These limitations can include factors such as materiality, inherent limitations in the procedures, and other factors that could affect the accuracy of the results.\n\nTherefore, when reporting on the application of agreed-upon procedures, it is important to include a statement of scope limitation that clearly identifies any limitations that may affect the practitioner's opinion. This information is crucial for clients to understand and make informed decisions about the use of the procedures."
