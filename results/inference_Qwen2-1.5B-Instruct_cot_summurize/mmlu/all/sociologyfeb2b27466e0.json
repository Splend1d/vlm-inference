Terrorism, on the other hand, is considered a separate type of criminal activity that is motivated by political ideology or religious beliefs.\nWhile all of the above points could be true for terrorism, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nD. All of the above\n\nTerrorism is indeed committed on a larger, often global, scale, and is well-organized. It is also associated with political conflict between states and their citizens and can have far-reaching effects upon international relations. Additionally, terrorism can be seen as a form of political expression or rebellion against oppressive regimes or governments. Therefore, all of these factors make terrorism distinct from the types of crime described by the Chicago School."
