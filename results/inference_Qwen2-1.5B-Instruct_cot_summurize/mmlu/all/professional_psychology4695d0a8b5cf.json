In classical conditioning, if the conditioned stimulus (CS) is repeatedly not followed by the unconditioned stimulus (US), it can lead to extinction of the conditioned response (CR). This is because the CS becomes less effective in eliciting the CR as the US is no longer present. The other options are incorrect because they either involve the unconditioned stimulus or conditioned response, rather than the conditioned stimulus and its unconditioned stimulus."
