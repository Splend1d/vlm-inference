In this case, we have a test statistic of 1.53.\n\nGiven the range of values for the Durbin-Watson statistic (0-4), it is clear that our test statistic falls within the \"negative autocorrelation\" range. Therefore, the appropriate conclusion based on the given information is:\n\nB. Residuals appear to be negatively autocorrelated\n\nThis means that the Durbin-Watson test indicates that there may be some positive autocorrelation in the residuals of the regression model, but it does not provide conclusive evidence either way."
