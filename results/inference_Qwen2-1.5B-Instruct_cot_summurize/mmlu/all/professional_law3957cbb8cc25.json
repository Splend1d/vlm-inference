However, the state in which they were married prohibits a couple from obtaining a divorce until they have resided in the state for at least 12 months. In an action by the couple challenging the constitutionality of the residency requirement of the state divorce law, the court will most likely declare the provision\n\nA. constitutional, because the requirement promotes a compelling state interest.\nB. constitutional, because it is within the area of state action.\nC. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause.\nD. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\n"

Unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that \"No State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" This clause applies not only to federal actions but also to state actions that affect individuals who are subject to those state actions. \n\nIn this case, the state's residency requirement for divorce proceedings violates the Equal Protection Clause because it discriminates against couples who choose to live together instead of getting married. Couples who choose to remain unmarried may be denied the right to divorce if they do not meet the state's residency requirements. \n\nTherefore, the court would most likely find the state's residency requirement unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause."
