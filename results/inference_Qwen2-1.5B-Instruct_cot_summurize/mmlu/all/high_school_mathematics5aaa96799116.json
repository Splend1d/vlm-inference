The product of Ramanujan's number and Hardy's number is given by $(a + bi)(5 + 3i) = (a + bi)(5) + (a + bi)(3)$.\nExpanding, we get $5a - 3b + 5bi + 3ai$.\nWe know that this product equals $32 - 8i$, so we have two equations:\n\\[5a - 3b = 32 \\quad \\text{(1)}\\]\n\\[5b + 3a = -8 \\quad \\text{(2)}\\]\n\nNow let's solve these equations.\n\nFirst, multiply equation (1) by 3 to eliminate $b$: $15a - 9b = 96$.\n\nThen subtract equation (2) from this new equation: $15a - 9b - (5b + 3a) = 96 - (-8)$, which simplifies to $10a - 14b = 104$.\n\nDivide this equation by 2 to simplify it further: $5a - 7b = 52$.\n\nNow let's solve this new equation for $a$ in terms of $b$:\n\nMultiply equation (1) by 7 to eliminate $b$: $35a - 21b = 224$.\n\nAdd this equation to $5a - 7b = 52$: $40a - 14b = 276$.\n\nSubtracting this equation from $5a - 7b = 52$ gives us $35a = 224$, or $a = 6.4$.\n\nBut this doesn't make sense because the magnitude of a complex number is always non-negative. We must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet's go back and check our work.\n\nAfter multiplying equation (1) by 3, we should have gotten $15a - 9b = 96$, not $10a - 14b = 52$.\n\nSo let's correct this and try again:\n\nMultiply equation (1) by 3 to eliminate $b$: $45a - 27b = 288$.\n\nThen add this equation to $5a - 7b = 52$: $50a - 34b = 340$.\n\nSubtracting this equation from $45a - 27b = 288$ gives us $5a = 52$, or $a = 10.4$.\n\nThis still doesn't make sense because the magnitude of a complex number is always non-negative. \n\nLet's retrace our steps and look at the problem more carefully.\n\nThe product of Ramanujan's number and Hardy's number is given by $(a + bi)(5 + 3i) = (a + bi)(5) + (a + bi)(3)$.\n\nExpanding this expression gives $5a - 3b + 5bi + 3ai$.\n\nWe know that this product equals $32 - 8i$, so we have two equations:\n\n\\[5a - 3b = 32 \\quad \\text{(1)}\\]\n\\[5b + 3a = -8 \\quad \\text{(2)}\\]\n\nMultiplying equation (1) by 5 to eliminate $b$: $25a - 15b = 160$.\n\nAdding this equation to equation (2): $5a - 3b + 5b + 3a = 160 - 8$, which simplifies to $10a = 152$, or $a = 15.2$.\n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense because the magnitude of a complex number is always non-negative.\n\nIt seems that there was a misunderstanding in our previous attempts to solve this problem.\n\nUpon revisiting the problem, we realize that we were trying to find the value of $a + bi$, but the question asks for the specific number that Ramanujan picked, which is $a$ alone.\n\nTo find the value of $a$, we can divide equation (1) by 5:\n\n\\[5a - 3b = 32 \\quad \\text{(1')} \\Rightarrow 1a - \\frac{3}{5}b = \\frac{32}{5}\\]"
