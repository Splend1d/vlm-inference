Under the relevant state statute, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum of one year in jail and/or a fine of $500. At trial, the defendant pleaded not guilty and requested that an attorney be appointed to represent him. The trial judge refused to honor the defendant's request for an attorney. If the defendant is subsequently found guilty, which of the following is the most severe sentence that can constitutionally be imposed?\n\nA. A $500 fine.\nB. Six months in jail.\nC. One year in jail.\nD. No sentence, because the defendant was denied the right to counsel.\n"

In this case, the defendant did not have access to an attorney due to his indigency. Therefore, if he is later found guilty, the court must impose a sentence within the bounds of the applicable statute (one year in jail), but it cannot impose a sentence that would violate the defendant's constitutional rights. The most severe sentence under such circumstances is six months in jail."
