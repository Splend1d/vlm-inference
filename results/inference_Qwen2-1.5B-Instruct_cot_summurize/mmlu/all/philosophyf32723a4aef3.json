All might be successful, but at a price.\n\nHare argues that there are several ways to escape moral arguments, and while some methods may seem more effective than others, they come with their own set of challenges and limitations. For example, relying solely on emotional appeals can be misleading and ineffective in addressing complex ethical issues. On the other hand, using logical reasoning alone without considering emotional or cultural factors can also lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. Therefore, it is possible for different approaches to be successful depending on the context and audience involved. However, at the same time, each approach comes with its own costs and risks, such as undermining credibility and trustworthiness."
