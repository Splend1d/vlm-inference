However, for Cr, it typically has 15 electrons, which means that there would be 9 protons and 6 neutrons in the nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 24 electrons, 24 protons, 24 neutrons\n\nNote: It's important to note that the exact number of protons and neutrons may vary slightly due to the presence of other subatomic particles such as electrons and isotopes."
