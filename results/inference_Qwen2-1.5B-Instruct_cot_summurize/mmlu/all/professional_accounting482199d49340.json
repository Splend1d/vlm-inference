Notes to the financial statements.\n\nOn the income tax basis, an entity records its income and expenses differently than under GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). This means that certain items may not appear on the balance sheet or income statement as they would under GAAP. For example, deferred taxes are recognized on the income tax basis but not on the GAAP basis.\n\nTherefore, it is important for an entity preparing its financial statements on the income tax basis to include a note explaining how this difference affects their financial statements. This information is typically found in the notes to the financial statements."
