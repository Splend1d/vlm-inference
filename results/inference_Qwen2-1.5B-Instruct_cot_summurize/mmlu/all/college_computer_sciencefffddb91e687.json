For expression I: \\(f(w, w)\\), it cannot be unifiable with any other expression because the variable \\(w\\) appears in both the argument and the function name, making it impossible to find a substitution that makes the expressions lexically identical.\n\n2. For expression II: \\(f(x, 1)\\), this can be rewritten as \\(f(1, x)\\). If we substitute \\(x = 1\\), we get \\(f(1, 1)\\), which is equal to \\(f(w, w)\\), showing that they are unifiable since they have the same value under the given substitution.\n\n3. For expression III: \\(f(y, g(z))\\), it can be rewritten as \\(f(g(z), y)\\). If we substitute \\(z = g(z)\\), we get \\(f(g(g(z)), y)\\). Since \\(g(z)\\) is an arbitrary value, substituting it into \\(y\\) doesn't affect its value or the order of operations, so we end up with \\(f(g(g(z)), g(z))\\), which simplifies to \\(f(w, w)\\).\n\nTherefore, the pairs of expressions that are unifiable are:\n\n- (I, II)\n\nSo the answer is **A**. (I, II) only."
