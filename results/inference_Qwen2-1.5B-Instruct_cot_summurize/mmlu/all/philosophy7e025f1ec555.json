Based on images of the good, beauty, and truth obtained from particular objects and on which the concepts and Forms depend. \n\nIn Plato's philosophy, knowledge is distinguished from mere belief or opinion by the requirement that it be grounded in an understanding of the Forms, which are eternal, perfect, and unchanging entities that exist beyond the realm of the senses. These Forms are represented by the beautiful, good, and true things that we perceive through our senses.\n\nPlato believed that these Forms were the ultimate source of all knowledge, and that they could be apprehended through rational thought and reason. He argued that the human mind has inherent capabilities to understand and recognize these Forms, even though we do not perceive them directly with our senses.\n\nTherefore, knowledge in Plato's view is not just any sort of belief or opinion, but rather a true belief that can be justified or explained through logical reasoning and understanding of the Forms. This form of knowledge is distinct from mere sensory experience or beliefs formed through personal preference or upbringing."
