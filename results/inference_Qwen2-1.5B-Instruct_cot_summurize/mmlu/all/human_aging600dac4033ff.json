Cohorts refer to groups of people who share common characteristics at a specific point in time, such as birth year or graduation from high school. Age differences are more commonly associated with changes in physical appearance or life events, rather than psychological states. For example, older adults may experience more frequent sleep disturbances or memory problems, which could affect their ability to recall sexual experiences from their youth. However, it's important to note that these differences can also be influenced by individual differences, such as lifestyle choices or medical conditions."
