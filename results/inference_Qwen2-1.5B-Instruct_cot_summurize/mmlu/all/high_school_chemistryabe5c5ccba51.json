Add 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid to the flask, and then dilute it with 66.7 mL of water.\n\nThis is because you want to start with a known concentration of sulfuric acid in your solution. The 33.3 mL of 12.0 M acid will be added to the flask first, which will give you a total volume of 33.3 mL + 66.7 mL = 100.0 mL. Then, you dilute this solution with 66.7 mL of water to get a final volume of 100.0 mL + 66.7 mL = 166.7 mL.\n\nTherefore, option B is the best choice for making up 100. mL of 4.0 M sulfuric acid using the stock solution and water."
