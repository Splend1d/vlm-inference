This is because the increase in entropy favors disorder and randomness, which are generally associated with spontaneous processes.\n\nOn the other hand, spontaneous reactions also have the following properties:\n- The rate of the reaction increases as the temperature increases.\n- The concentration of reactants decreases over time as they are consumed by the reaction.\n- The Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G) is negative for spontaneous reactions.\n\nHowever, these properties do not necessarily indicate spontaneity on their own. For example, a reaction may be spontaneous but still have a negative \u0394G if it has a positive \u0394H and a positive \u0394S. Similarly, a reaction may have a positive \u0394G but still be non-spontaneous due to factors such as high activation energy or lack of sufficient catalysts. Therefore, the only property that directly indicates spontaneity is the value of \u0394S."
