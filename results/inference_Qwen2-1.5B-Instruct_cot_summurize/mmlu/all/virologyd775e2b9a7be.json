In this study design, individuals are exposed to an environmental toxin and their health status is monitored over time using standardized measures. The focus is on observing how the individual's health changes in response to the exposure, rather than testing for specific treatments or interventions. This type of study design is often used to assess the long-term effects of toxic substances on human health."
