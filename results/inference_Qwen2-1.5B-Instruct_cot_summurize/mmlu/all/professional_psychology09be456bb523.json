Descriptive labels can help convey specific meanings to some people, but they may be less effective for others. It is important to consider the potential effects of situational and demographic variables when interpreting test results. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. use descriptive labels, because such labels readily communicate specific meanings to most people."
