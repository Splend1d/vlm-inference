Human security is often seen as promoting a neo-colonial approach, where developed countries or organizations assume responsibility for the security of developing nations.\n\nB. The focus on economic development as a means to promote security can be seen as promoting global capitalism, which some argue undermines the sovereignty of smaller states and promotes inequality.\n\nC. The broadness of human security can make it difficult to define clear responsibilities and roles between different actors, such as governments, international organizations, and civil society groups.\n\nTherefore, all of the given options are relevant criticisms of the human security concept."
