During the course of their marriage, the beatings became more violent and more frequent. Unable to endure the physical abuse any longer, the wife hired a hit man to kill her husband. One night while the husband was asleep, the hit man entered the home with a key given to him by the wife and shot the husband to death. Afterward, the wife was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. At trial, the prosecution presented the facts outlined above. Thereafter, the defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the wife acted in self- defense under the battered women's syndrome. Based on the given facts, should the judge give such an instruction to the jury?\n\nA. No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.\nB. No, because even though the wife was the victim of spousal abuse, she could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.\nC. Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self- defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.\nD. Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury.\n"

Yes, because a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self-defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.\n\nThe fact that the wife had previously been beaten by her husband, and that the beatings became more violent and frequent over time, suggests that she may have believed that she needed to use lethal force in order to protect herself. Additionally, the fact that the wife hired a hitman to kill her husband shows that she was willing to take extreme measures to prevent further abuse.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this decision is based solely on the facts provided and does not necessarily apply to all cases where a spouse commits violence against another spouse. In some cases, the legal system may consider other factors such as whether the wife had the opportunity to escape or whether the husband posed an immediate threat to the life of the wife or others. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific circumstances of each case."
