Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in young children is defined as having three of the following four criteria: height-for-age Z score <-3, weight-for-age Z score <-3, oedema, and malnutrition.\n\nWeight-for-age Z score <-3 means that a child's weight is below the expected for their age and height, while height-for-age Z score <-3 indicates that a child's height is below the expected for their age and body mass index. Oedema refers to fluid buildup in the body, which can be caused by malnutrition. Malnutrition itself is characterized by low levels of protein, vitamins, and minerals in the diet.\n\nTherefore, all three conditions must be present for a child to have severe acute malnutrition."
