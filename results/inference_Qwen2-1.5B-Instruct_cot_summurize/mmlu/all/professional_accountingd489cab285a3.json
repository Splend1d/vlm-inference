Granting stock options to key executives at favorable prices.\n\nStock options granted to key executives by an unrelated third party (such as a bank or investment firm) may be used as a means of influencing their actions, such as buying or selling company securities, without direct ownership of the company itself. This practice could potentially lead to conflicts of interest if the executive benefits from the favorable pricing while still being able to influence the decision-making process regarding the purchase or sale of the company's securities. Therefore, it is more likely to involve related parties than other options listed."
