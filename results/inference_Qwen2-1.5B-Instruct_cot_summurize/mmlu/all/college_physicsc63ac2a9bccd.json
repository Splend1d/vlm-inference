In this case, we have:\n\n- \\(n = 2\\) (since it's a single-electron atom)\n- \\(l = 2\\)\n\nFor each value of \\(l\\), there are two possible values of \\(m_l\\) (from -l to +l). Therefore, for \\(l = 2\\), there are 3 possible values of \\(m_l\\):\n\n- For \\(m_l = -2\\): This corresponds to \\(-2s + 0p\\)\n- For \\(m_l = -1\\): This corresponds to \\(-1s + 0p\\)\n- For \\(m_l = 0\\): This corresponds to \\(0s\\)\n- For \\(m_l = 1\\): This corresponds to \\(1s\\)\n- For \\(m_l = 2\\): This corresponds to \\(2s\\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 3."
