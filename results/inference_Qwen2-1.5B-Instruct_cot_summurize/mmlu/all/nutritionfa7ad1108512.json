It helps to keep the digestive system healthy, preventing constipation and promoting regular bowel movements. Additionally, it can help to prevent the absorption of carcinogens in the gut, which may reduce the risk of developing certain types of cancer.\n\nVitamin C is also important for overall health, but it does not specifically reduce the risk for cancer of the colon or rectum. Similarly, alcohol consumption has been linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including esophageal and stomach cancers. \n\nOestrogen is a hormone that plays a role in the female reproductive system, but it does not have a direct effect on the risk of cancer of the colon or rectum."
