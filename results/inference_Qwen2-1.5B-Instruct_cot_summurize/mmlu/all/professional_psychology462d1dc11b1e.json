During this state, individuals may experience changes in their perception of time, reality, and memory. These effects can be manipulated through the use of hypnotherapeutic techniques, which involve guiding someone into a trance-like state where they appear to be more responsive to suggestions or stimuli. Hypnosis is not typically associated with measures like heart rate variability, blood pressure, or brain activity, nor does it lead to \"artificial sleep.\" Rather, it involves altering mental states that are perceived to be more accessible for learning or persuasion."
