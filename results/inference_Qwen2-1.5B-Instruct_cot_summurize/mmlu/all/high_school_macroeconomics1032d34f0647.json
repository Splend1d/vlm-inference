As a result, the economy experiences a temporary increase in output (Y) and inflation (inflation), which can lead to a rise in the short-run unemployment rate (U) and fall in the long-run unemployment rate (LUR).\n\nThis shift in the short-run Phillips curve from a downward slope to an upward slope means that as inflation increases, the short-run unemployment rate will also increase. The long-run unemployment rate will remain relatively constant because it reflects the underlying trend in the economy's productivity and technological progress.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Shifts up, falls, rises."
