However, this does not necessarily mean that the state has no obligation to consider these interests and values when making decisions about whether to allow someone to enter its territory.\n\nEgalitarians may disagree with Wellman's argument and believe that there should be no exceptions to the principle of equal treatment under the law. In this case, Wellman's response would be insufficient as it does not address the potential harm that could result from excluding certain groups or individuals from a state's territory.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most appropriate answer."
