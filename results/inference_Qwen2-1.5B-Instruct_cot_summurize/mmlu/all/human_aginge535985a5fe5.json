Education about older adults\n\nEducation about older adults can improve attitudes towards aging and older adults by providing information about their experiences, challenges, and contributions to society. This can help reduce stereotypes and biases and promote a more positive view of older people. Other options may also contribute positively to attitudes towards aging and older adults, but education is likely to have the most significant impact."
