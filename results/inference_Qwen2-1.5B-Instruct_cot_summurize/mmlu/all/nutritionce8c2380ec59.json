Result in bone mineral loss from the skeleton\n\nDuring pregnancy, there is an increase in bone turnover, which means that the body breaks down old bones more quickly than it builds new ones. This can lead to increased bone loss, particularly in areas such as the hips and spine.\n\nLactation, or breast feeding, also has an impact on bone health. Breast milk contains high levels of calcium, but it is not always easily available for the mother's bones to absorb. The baby may be taking calcium from the mother's bones instead of getting it directly through the milk. Additionally, breastfeeding itself can cause bone loss due to the stress placed on the bones during feeding episodes.\n\nBoth pregnancy and lactation can affect bone mineral content later in life, although this is less well understood at present. It is thought that factors such as weight gain, hormonal changes, and other lifestyle factors may contribute to bone loss after pregnancy and lactation."
