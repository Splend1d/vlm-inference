Jerry Lee Lewis was the son of a Pentecostal preacher named James \"Pete\" Lewis, and Jimmy Swaggart is also a Pentecostal preacher who was raised in a family of preachers. Therefore, Jimmy Swaggart is related to Jerry Lee Lewis through their shared religious background. \n\nBilly Graham and Oral Roberts were both born into wealthy families, while Jerry Falwell was raised by his mother's family after her father died when he was young."
