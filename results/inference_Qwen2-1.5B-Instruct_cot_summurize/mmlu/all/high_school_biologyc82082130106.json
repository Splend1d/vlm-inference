These bases pair with each other in a complementary manner: A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. Therefore, in any given sequence of DNA, the ratio of adenine to thymine (A:T) or guanine to cytosine (G:C) will always be equal. This is known as the genetic code or the codon table, which is used by cells to translate genetic information into proteins."
