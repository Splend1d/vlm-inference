Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nScenario 1 involves waiting outside for someone who has just taken a shower, which may be considered impolite or annoying by some people. However, it is not necessarily morally wrong. It depends on the context and how the person feels about being interrupted during their personal time.\n\nScenario 2 involves breaking someone's heart by dumping them, which can be seen as hurtful and selfish behavior. This scenario would likely be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
