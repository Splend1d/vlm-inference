The host supplied the bats, balls and gloves. An argument arose at home plate after a controversial call by the umpire, who was inebriated like all of the other participants. The host of the party became enraged at the umpire's decision and hit him in the face, breaking his nose. The umpire pressed charges when he became sober, and the authorities charged the host with criminal battery. At trial, the defense raised the defense of voluntary intoxication, arguing that the host lacked the mentality to form an intent to commit a criminal battery. Will the defense of voluntary intoxication be successful under these facts?\n\nA. Yes, criminal battery is a specific intent crime to which voluntary intoxication may be asserted as a defense.\nB. Yes, voluntary intoxication is always at least a partial defense to any crime that requires mens rea.\nC. No, the host was grossly negligent in allowing a group of drunk men to play a dangerous game of hardball, which precluded him from the benefit of the defense.\nD. No, criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available.\n"

No, criminal battery in this case is a general intent crime and the defense of voluntary intoxication is not available.\n\nVoluntary intoxication can be a valid defense for certain crimes, such as assault or battery if it can be proven that the defendant did not have the mental capacity to understand the nature of their actions or to control their behavior due to the influence of drugs or alcohol. However, in cases involving intentional acts, such as battery, the defendant must have intended to cause harm or injury, and voluntary intoxication cannot serve as a defense in those situations. In this case, the host had the intention to injure the umpire through his actions, so voluntary intoxication would not be applicable. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
