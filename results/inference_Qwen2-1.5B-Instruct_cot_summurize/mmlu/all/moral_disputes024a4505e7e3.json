In other words, they serve as tools or aids for achieving our desired ends. For example, we may use money as a means to purchase goods and services that enable us to live a better life. Similarly, education is considered a means to attain knowledge and skills necessary for success in various fields. \n\nOption A (desirable as a rule) suggests that desirable things should always be pursued, which is not necessarily true. Some things may not be desirable as a rule due to their negative consequences or lack of practical utility.\n\nOption B (desirable in theory) implies that desirable things can only be achieved through abstract reasoning rather than by action. This is also incorrect because some desirable things require physical effort or resources to acquire.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most appropriate answer based on the given options."
