                    "text": "The correct answer is D: Lower the discount rate risking inflation.\n\nWhen Congress embarks on an expansionary fiscal policy, it typically increases government spending and/or reduces taxes, which can lead to higher levels of aggregate demand in the economy. This can stimulate economic growth and create jobs, but it can also cause prices to rise due to increased demand for goods and services.\n\nTo mitigate the \"crowding-out\" effect, which occurs when expansionary fiscal policy leads to reduced private sector investment and consumption, policymakers may need to adjust monetary policy by lowering interest rates. By doing so, they can encourage more borrowing and lending, which can help to sustain economic growth while avoiding price inflation.\n\nHowever, if the discount rate is lowered too quickly or too aggressively, it could exacerbate the \"recessionary gap,\" which is the difference between the natural level of output that would occur with a given level of productivity and actual output. In this case, the economy would enter into a period of high unemployment and slow economic growth, known as a recessionary gap. To avoid this, policymakers must carefully monitor the economy and ensure that any reduction in the discount rate does not lead to excessive risk-taking or inflation."
