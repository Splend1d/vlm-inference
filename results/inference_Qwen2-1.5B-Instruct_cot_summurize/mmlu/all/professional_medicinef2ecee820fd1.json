Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\nA. collateral estoppel\nB. proximate cause\nC. res ipsa loquitur\nD. respondeat superior\n"

Res ipsa loquitur means \"the thing speaks for itself\" and refers to a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to recover damages even if it cannot be proven that the defendant caused the harm, as long as the injury occurred under circumstances where one would expect the defendant's conduct to cause the same type of harm. In this case, the patient established that the surgical sponge could not have been left without negligence, which satisfies the element of causation required by the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur."
