The line on which the call was made was a line owned by a woman. Immediately after receiving the call, the telephone operator reported the threatening conversation to the police. About half an hour later, during which time she had handled a number of other calls, the telephone operator received a call from a police officer who was at the woman's home. He asked her to listen to a voice. After she did, the officer asked the telephone operator if she could identify it. The telephone operator responded that she was positive that it was the voice of the person who had made the threat. As a result of the telephone operator's identification, the woman's boyfriend was arrested and charged with the crime of terrorist threatening. As a consequence of the arrest, the boyfriend lost his job and suffered embarrassment and ridicule in the community. At trial, however, the telephone operator's identification proved to be erroneous, and the boyfriend was exonerated. In a defamation action for slander by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company, he will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification constituted slander per Se.\nB. succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in the loss of his good reputation in the community.\nC. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.\nD. not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.\n"

Not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was made without actual malice.\n\nWhen making a statement about someone's character or conduct, it must be done with actual malice - that is, with knowledge that it is false or with reckless disregard for whether it is true. If the statement is made without actual malice, it cannot be considered slander per se (unlawful libel). \n\nIn this case, the telephone operator's identification of the voice as that of the threatening caller was based solely on her hearing the voice over the phone. She did not have any reason to believe that the voice belonged to the person who made the threat, nor did she make any effort to verify the accuracy of her identification. Therefore, the telephone operator's identification was not made with actual malice, and the boyfriend cannot succeed in a defamation action for slander."
