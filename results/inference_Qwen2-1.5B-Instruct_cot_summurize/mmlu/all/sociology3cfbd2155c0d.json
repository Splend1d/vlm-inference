Isolated people and put them under surveillance\n\nFoucault's theory suggests that prisons and other forms of carceral organization create environments where individuals are separated from society and placed under constant surveillance in order to control and discipline them. This can lead to a sense of isolation and alienation for those within these institutions. Additionally, the use of harsh disciplinary measures such as solitary confinement and other forms of repressive practices can strip inmates of their previous identities and limit their ability to form relationships with others outside of the institution."
