The key idea behind these oscillators is that they can be tuned or adjusted by varying an external signal (often referred to as a \"control voltage\") applied across their feedback path.\n\nWhen this control voltage is set at a particular level, it will cause the output waveform of the oscillator to have a specific frequency and amplitude, which corresponds to the desired shape of the sinusoid being generated. The control voltage can then be varied further to adjust the frequency or amplitude of the resulting waveform, allowing for a wide range of different shapes to be achieved depending on the specific application requirements. \n\nSo, while both sine waves and sawtooth waves could theoretically be produced using a relaxation voltage-controlled oscillator, the question specifically asks about generating one of two options: either a sine wave or a sawtooth wave. Therefore, option D is correct - both sine waves and sawtooth waves can indeed be generated using a relaxation voltage-controlled oscillator, but the question specifies only one option."
