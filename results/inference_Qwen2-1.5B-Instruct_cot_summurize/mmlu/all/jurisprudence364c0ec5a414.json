A person with a mental disability must act as would a person with the same mental disability.\n\nUnder the \"reasonable person\" standard, courts consider what a hypothetical reasonably prudent person would do under similar circumstances. This standard does not take into account an individual's mental or physical condition. Therefore, a person with a mental disability may be held responsible for actions that a mentally healthy person might have taken differently. It is important to note that this standard applies only to situations where there is no evidence of any mental incapacity. If there is evidence of a mental disability, the court will consider whether the disability has impaired a person's ability to understand and appreciate the risks involved in certain activities."
