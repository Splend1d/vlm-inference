Extortion and robbery.\n\nExtortion involves the use of threats or intimidation to obtain something from someone else, while robbery involves taking property from someone else forcefully. In this case, the defendant used threats to demand money from the man, which would meet the criteria for extortion. Additionally, the defendant physically assaulted the man, which would meet the criteria for robbery. Therefore, the defendant committed both extortion and robbery."
