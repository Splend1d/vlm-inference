As people get older, their ability to remember personal experiences and events decreases, leading to a decline in episodic memory. This is because as we age, our brains may become less efficient at forming new memories and retrieving existing ones. Other types of memory, such as sensory memory, semantic memory, and procedural memory, tend to remain relatively stable or improve with age."
