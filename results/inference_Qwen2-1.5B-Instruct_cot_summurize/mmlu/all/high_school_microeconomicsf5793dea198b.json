The number of units of labor hired would depend on the total cost or revenue generated from hiring those units and whether there's a surplus or deficit in terms of profit or loss.\n\nTherefore, without additional information about the total cost or revenue generated by hiring the units of labor, it is impossible to determine the exact number of units of labor that were hired based solely on the wage rate of $4.50. \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3"
