Stevenson's theory suggests that the meaning of a term can be understood by considering its psychological associations, such as the emotional or cognitive reactions people have when they hear or use the term. This approach emphasizes the importance of context in understanding language, rather than simply looking for empirical evidence or analyzing the linguistic structure of the term itself."
