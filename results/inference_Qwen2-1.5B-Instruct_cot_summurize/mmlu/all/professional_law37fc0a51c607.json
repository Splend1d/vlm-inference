An artist who specialized in making delicate glass sculptures had a studio two blocks away from the laboratory's plant. Late one evening, there was an explosion at the laboratory's plant. The force of the explosion caused the artist's studio to be shaken, which resulted in the destruction of valuable artwork in the studio. The artist now asserts a tort action against the laboratory to recover damages. Which of the following, if established, would furnish the laboratory with its best possible defense?\n\nA. The laboratory used extraordinary care in the manufacture and storage of nitroglycerin and was not guilty of any negligence that was causally connected with the explosion.\nB. The laboratory has a contract with the federal government whereby all the nitroglycerin manufactured at its plant is used in U. S. military weapons systems.\nC. The explosion was caused when lightning (an act of God) struck the plant during an electrical storm.\nD. The harm that the artist suffered would not have resulted but for the abnormal fragility of the artist's work.\n"

This defense argues that the laboratory is not responsible for the explosion because it is being used by the government for military purposes, which is considered an \"act of God\" under the doctrine of superseding cause. However, this defense does not address the issue of negligence or causation, so it may not be sufficient on its own. Other defenses that could be used include the possibility of intervening cause, which suggests that the laboratory took reasonable steps to prevent the accident and that the intervening cause (such as the lightning strike) was sufficiently distinct from the original cause (the manufacturing process). Additionally, the laboratory could argue that the explosion was caused by natural forces beyond their control, such as weather conditions or geological factors."
