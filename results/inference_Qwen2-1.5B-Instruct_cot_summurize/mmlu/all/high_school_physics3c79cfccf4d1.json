This means:\n\n\\[mv^2/R = mg\\]\n\\[v^2 = gR/m\\]\n\nWe want to maximize the mass such that the person doesn't fall off the ride. This happens when the centripetal force equals the maximum static frictional force (\\(\\mu N\\)), where \\(N\\) is the normal force exerted by the wall on the person's clothing. The maximum static friction \\(\\mu F_N\\) occurs when the person has the maximum possible static friction with the wall. Since there is no slipping, the normal force \\(N\\) is equal to the weight of the person (\\(m \\cdot g\\)).\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[v^2 = gR/m = m(gR)/m = gR\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt{gR}\\]\n\nSubstituting back into our previous equation for \\(v^2\\):\n\n\\[v^2 = gR\\]\n\nAnd substituting back into the formula for the maximum safe mass (\\(m\\)):\n\n\\[v^2 = gR/m\\]\n\nSo, the maximum safe mass is:\n\n\\[m = R/g\\]\n\nThis matches option D: \"None of the above.\""
