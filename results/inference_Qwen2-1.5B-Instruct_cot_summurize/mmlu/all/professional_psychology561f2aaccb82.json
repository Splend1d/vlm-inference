This can occur when an organization conducts research on its employees and the results are presented publicly without the employees' knowledge.\n\nIn this context, a \"cover story\" that makes the researchers believe that the purpose of the study is something different from what it actually is could help control the Hawthorne effect by ensuring that the employees do not perceive the research as being conducted solely for their benefit but rather for the broader purposes of the organization.\n\nTherefore, option A (Hawthorne effect) would be most helpful for controlling such a situation."
