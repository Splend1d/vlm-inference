Evangelical Christianity.\n\nThe passage describes Dorothea Dix's plea for a state hospital to care for the mentally ill, which was submitted to the General Assembly of North Carolina in 1848. This demonstrates that the reform movement of the late 1800s was influenced by religious beliefs, particularly evangelical Christianity, which often supported reforms aimed at improving social welfare. The passage suggests that this was one of the key motivations for reformers of the time, although it is important to note that there were also other factors such as distrust of big government and the desire for personal benefits that may have also played a role."
