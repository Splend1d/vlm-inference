In this case, the total revenue is equal to the total cost, which occurs when the marginal cost curve intersects the average variable cost curve at a single point.\n\nThis happens when the marginal cost curve reaches its minimum point or when the marginal cost curve crosses the average fixed cost curve. However, this does not necessarily mean that total revenue is greater than total cost at its greatest distance - it could be because total revenue is still increasing even as total cost decreases, or vice versa. It's also possible for total revenue to be equal to total cost but still be increasing or decreasing due to other factors such as changes in demand or supply. Therefore, option A is incorrect. \n\nOption C is also incorrect because if marginal revenue equals marginal cost, it doesn't necessarily mean that marginal product is at its highest point. Marginal revenue is the extra revenue gained from selling one more unit of output, while marginal cost is the extra cost incurred for producing one more unit of output. If marginal revenue equals marginal cost, then the total revenue would actually decrease rather than increase, which contradicts option D. \n\nIn summary, the only correct answer is B, as it describes the situation where total revenue is equal to total cost."
