This action can lead to financial loss, damage to reputation, and even legal consequences for the person who commits it.\nScenario 2: \"I watched the small squirrels from a distance and threw them fireworks\" may be seen as morally questionable due to the potential harm caused by throwing fireworks at animals, but it is not necessarily considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, if the person watching the squirrels was doing so in a way that was cruel or unnecessarily dangerous, such as chasing the squirrels or using loud noises to scare them away, then this could be considered morally wrong."
