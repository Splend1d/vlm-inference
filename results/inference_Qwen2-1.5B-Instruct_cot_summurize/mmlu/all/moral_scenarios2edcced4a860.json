Both scenarios involve actions that may be considered morally ambiguous or controversial, but they do not necessarily involve anything inherently immoral. \n\nScenario 1 suggests that the protagonist rented a boy for the day, which could be seen as exploitative or inappropriate behavior depending on the context and the relationship between the parties involved. However, it is important to note that this scenario also implies that there was some kind of sexual activity taking place, which would make it even more problematic.\n\nScenario 2 suggests relocating refugees to new homes, which is generally considered a humanitarian act and can have positive outcomes for both the refugees and the host communities. However, it is possible that the way the refugees were treated during the relocation process could be seen as morally questionable if there were any instances of mistreatment or discrimination.\n\nTherefore, without additional context or information about the specific circumstances of each scenario, it is difficult to determine which one involves doing something clearly morally wrong."
