In an isochoric process, the volume remains constant during the process, so the volume cannot increase. Therefore, option D is incorrect. \n\nOption A is correct because the average speed of the molecules increases as the temperature increases, which results in more frequent collisions with the walls of the container.\n\nOption B is also correct because if the volume remained constant, the pressure would also remain constant, regardless of how much the temperature increases.\n\nOption C is correct because the kinetic energy of the system (which includes both the thermal kinetic energy of the gas molecules and any internal kinetic energy of the container itself) increases as the temperature increases. This is due to the first law of thermodynamics, which states that heat transfer into a system adds to its internal energy and thus increases its kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, the only incorrect statement is D."
