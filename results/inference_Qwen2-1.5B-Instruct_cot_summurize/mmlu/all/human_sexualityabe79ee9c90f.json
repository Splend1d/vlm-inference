The fact that Bruce is a homosexual man and Chuck is a heterosexual man does not provide any clues about whether or how they played during childhood. Additionally, the question itself suggests that we should consider the typical behavior of boys and girls when comparing their play preferences, but this is not necessarily true for all individuals. Therefore, without further information, none of the given options can be considered accurate."
