A tax cut is likely to increase aggregate supply by providing greater rewards for risk-taking.\n\nSupply-side economics emphasizes the role of government policies, such as tax cuts, in stimulating economic growth and job creation. It argues that increasing disposable income through tax cuts can lead to increased spending and investment, which in turn can boost aggregate demand and stimulate economic activity. However, it does not necessarily imply an increase in aggregate supply due to a reduction in taxes or incentives for risk-taking. The impact on aggregate supply depends more on factors like productivity, technology, and other macroeconomic variables. Therefore, option D contradicts the traditional supply-side perspective."
