This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid. And all lands, both islands and mainlands, found and discovered already, or to be found and discovered hereafter, by the said King of Portugal and by his vessels on this side of the said line and bound determined as above, toward the east, in either north or south latitude, on the eastern side of the said bound provided the said bound is not crossed, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King of Portugal and his successors. And all other lands, both islands and mainlands, found or to be found hereafter, discovered or to be discovered hereafter, which have been discovered or shall be discovered by the said King and Queen of Castile, Aragon, etc., and by their vessels, on the western side of the said bound, determined as above, after having passed the said bound toward the west, in either its north or south latitude, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King and Queen of Castile, Leon, etc., and to their successors.\"\nTreaty of Tordesillas, 1494\nWhich of the following inferences best explains the reason the King of Portugal insisted on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line?\n\nA.

                    "text": "The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, divided newly discovered land in the Western Hemisphere between Spain and Portugal. The Spanish received half of the land to the west of the line dividing them, while Portugal received half of the land to the east. \n\nOption A suggests that Portuguese explorers believed the route to the New World was easier to travel by going east, but there is no evidence to support this claim.\n\nOption B suggests that Portugal wanted to continue the crusades against the Mamelukes who controlled the Holy Land. However, this option does not explain why Portugal would insist on Portuguese control over territory east of the demarcation line.\n\nOption C suggests that Portugal wanted control of the wealthy lands of Mexico. While Portugal did gain control of some Mexican territories, including the city of Veracruz, this option does not fully explain the reasons behind the treaty's provisions.\n\nOption D suggests that Portugal knew of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa. While this knowledge might have influenced Portugal's decision to seek territorial control, it does not fully explain the reasons behind the treaty's provisions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for the King of Portugal insisting on Portuguese control over territory east of the demarcation line is option B: the Portuguese desired to continue the crusades against the Mamelukes who controlled the Holy Land."
