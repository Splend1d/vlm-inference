Once he sought help, he worked to overcome this fear first by witnessing his counselor playing with a dog and then, after a while, by actually touching and petting a dog himself.

Systematic desensitization is a form of exposure therapy that helps individuals confront their fears gradually and in a safe environment. It involves gradually exposing the individual to the feared object or situation until they become less afraid of it. In Calvin's case, he started by observing someone else interacting with a dog and then progressed to actually touching and petting the dog himself. This gradual approach helped him overcome his fear of dogs."
