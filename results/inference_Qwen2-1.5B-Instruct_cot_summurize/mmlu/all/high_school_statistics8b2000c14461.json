This type of study allows researchers to manipulate variables such as diet by assigning participants to different groups based on their consumption of meat or not.\n\nThe second study is also a controlled experiment, but this time it is observing the effects of meat consumption over time. By serving one group (those who consume meat) a specific amount of meat per day for six months, and another group (those who consume only vegetables) for the same period, researchers can compare the changes in weight between these two groups. \n\nTherefore, both studies are controlled experiments. Option A is correct."
