The task is to learn whether there might be different clusters of such patients based on their characteristics or conditions. This can be done using unsupervised learning techniques.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Unsupervised learning\n\nThis type of learning problem involves identifying patterns in the data that cannot be directly observed but can be inferred by analyzing the relationships between features. In this case, the goal is to find groups of patients with similar characteristics or conditions within the larger population."
