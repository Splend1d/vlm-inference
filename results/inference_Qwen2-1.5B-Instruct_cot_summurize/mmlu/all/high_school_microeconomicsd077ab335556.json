Demand for white Ford minivans\n\nIn general, the elasticity of demand refers to how much the quantity demanded responds to changes in price or other factors such as income and availability. Elasticity measures the responsiveness of demand to changes in price.\n\nElasticity can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Elasticity} = \\frac{\\%\\Delta Q}{\\%\\Delta P} \\]\n\nwhere \u0394Q is the change in quantity demanded, \u0394P is the change in price, and %\u0394Q and %\u0394P are percentages that represent the percentage change from their respective baseline values (e.g., the baseline value for price could be $10, so if the price increases by 25%, it would be $12.50).\n\nFor example, let's say the original price of a product was $10 and the quantity demanded was 10 units. If the price increased by 25% to $12.50, the new quantity demanded would be 8 units. The elasticity of demand for this product would be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Elasticity} = \\frac{(8 - 10) / (10 - 8)}{(12.50 - 10) / (12.50 - 10)} = \\frac{-2 / 2}{4 / 2} = -1/2 = -0.5 \\]\n\nThis means that the elasticity of demand for this product is -0.5, which indicates that the demand is relatively inelastic. In contrast, if we were looking at the demand for cars in general, the demand would typically be more elastic because people may be willing to pay more for certain types of cars (e.g., luxury cars) compared to others (e.g., economy cars). Therefore, the demand for white Ford minivans would have an even higher elasticity than the demand for all automobiles combined. \n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Demand for white Ford minivans."
