After applying batch normalization, the layer's activations will follow a standard Gaussian distribution.\n\nBatch normalization is a technique used in deep learning to normalize the inputs to each layer of a neural network by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the input data. This helps to speed up training and improve the stability of the model. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the bias parameter of an affine layer remains necessary even after batch normalization. The bias term allows the weights to adjust more accurately to the scale of the data.\n\nOption C is incorrect because standard weight initialization is not affected by batch normalization. However, it is important to note that the choice of initial values for weights and biases can affect the convergence of the optimization algorithm.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because batch normalization is not equivalent to layer normalization for convolutional neural networks. Layer normalization is a different technique that normalizes the output of each layer separately, while batch normalization is designed to normalize the entire input at once."
