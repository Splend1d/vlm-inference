However, if the declarant is not questioned about the statement before it is offered into evidence, the court will typically exclude the statement under the hearsay rule.\n\nIn this case, the prosecution has presented the victim's statement that she screamed after the beating stopped, but they have not asked the victim questions about the statement before she was excused from testifying. Therefore, the statement cannot be admitted as an excited utterance, and it would be inadmissible under the hearsay rule."
