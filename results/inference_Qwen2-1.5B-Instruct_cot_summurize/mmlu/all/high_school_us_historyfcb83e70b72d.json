It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nThe excerpt from Frederick Douglass is most clearly an example of which of the following developments in the mid-nineteenth century?\n\nA. The gradual replacement of indentured servants with African slaves\nB. The preservation of African culture through cultural adaptation\nC. Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery\nD. The success of abolitionists to sway majority public opinion\n"

Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery\n\nThe excerpt from Frederick Douglass's speech in 1857 describes how the slaveholding South had a significant advantage due to their organized systems, including state governments that were \"complete slavery organizations.\" This was contrasted with the North, where the institutions supporting slavery were largely intact but lacked the same level of organization and support.\n\nTherefore, the passage best exemplifies the development of Southern influence on the federal government to preserve the institution of slavery, as it shows the South's ability to effectively utilize existing structures to maintain its dominance over the country's political landscape."
