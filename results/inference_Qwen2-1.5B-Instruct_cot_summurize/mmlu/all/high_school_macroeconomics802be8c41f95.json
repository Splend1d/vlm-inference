This increases the total amount of money available for consumption and investment, which can lead to an increased level of economic activity.\n\nOn the other hand, an increase in the velocity of money (V), which refers to how often money changes hands in a given period, decreases the spending multiplier because it means that fewer dollars are circulating in the economy at any given time. This reduces the overall level of money supply and can slow down economic growth.\n\nAn increase in the real interest rate also tends to decrease the spending multiplier because it makes borrowing more expensive and therefore reduces the incentive to spend more money. This can reduce overall economic activity and spending.\n\nFinally, an increase in the marginal propensity to save (MPS) will tend to decrease the spending multiplier because it means that for every additional dollar saved, there is less than one dollar left over to be spent or invested. This reduces the total amount of money available for consumption and investment, which can lead to a lower level of economic activity."
