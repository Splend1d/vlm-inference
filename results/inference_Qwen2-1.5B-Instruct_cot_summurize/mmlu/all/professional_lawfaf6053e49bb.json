One afternoon, the lift suddenly broke down because of a power failure in the area. A customer was suspended in his lift chair, one-third of the way up the hill and 50 feet above the ground. The customer remained on the lift for five hours until power was restored. He was then returned uninjured to the bottom of the hill. In a suit against the ski resort, the customer is likely to have action for\n\nA. false imprisonment.\nB. negligence.\nC. assault.\nD. no cause of action.\n"

This situation would fall under the category of negligence, as the ski resort is responsible for ensuring the safety of its customers by maintaining proper equipment and operating it efficiently. Negligence can be established based on the foreseeability of harm and the ski resort's failure to mitigate the risk."
