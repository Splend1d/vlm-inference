This is because the patient is concerned about becoming addicted to opioids, which is a common concern among patients who have been exposed to them. Naloxone is a medication that can reverse the effects of opioids in the body, making it an effective treatment for opioid addiction. It is important to note that the patient's history of alcohol consumption may increase her risk of developing an addiction to opioids, so it is important to monitor her closely for any signs of addiction or dependence."
