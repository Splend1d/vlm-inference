This action could be considered morally wrong for those who value vegetarianism or veganism.\n\nScenario 2 involves observing someone else's personal space without their consent, which is generally considered disrespectful and may also be seen as invasive or uncomfortable by some people. While it's not explicitly stated whether the wife's actions were inappropriate, this scenario can still be viewed as potentially morally wrong if it violates boundaries or causes discomfort to others. \n\nHowever, both actions themselves are not inherently wrong; they are simply not aligned with widely accepted moral norms. In terms of the given options, Scenario 1 is the only one that would be considered \"wrong\" based on ordinary moral standards at the time of writing (as of 2020)."
