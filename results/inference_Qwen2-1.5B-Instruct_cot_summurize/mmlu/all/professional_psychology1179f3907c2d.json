Developmental contextualism\n\nDevelopmental contextualism refers to the idea that children's behavior, including their temperament, is shaped by both internal (biological factors) and external (environmental factors) influences. The match between a child's temperament and the demands and responses of the environment in which she develops is considered one of these external influences. This concept is also known as bidirectionality. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Developmental contextualism."
