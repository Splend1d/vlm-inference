Further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation.\n\nWhen the economy is operating beyond full employment, it means that there is more demand for goods and services than there are workers available to produce them. This leads to higher prices and wages, which can cause inflation.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the unemployment rate will decrease. In fact, if the economy is producing more goods and services than people are willing to buy, then there may be a shortage of jobs, leading to higher unemployment rates.\n\nIn addition, even with higher prices and wages, it may still be difficult for employers to find enough workers to fill open positions. This is because some workers may have low incomes or other barriers to entry, such as lack of education or experience.\n\nTherefore, while higher prices and wages can lead to inflation, they do not automatically reduce unemployment or make it easier for employers to hire workers. Instead, they can contribute to economic growth and increase overall prosperity."
