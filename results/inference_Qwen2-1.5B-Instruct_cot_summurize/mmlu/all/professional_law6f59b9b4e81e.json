The federal government at the time was implementing a thaw in relations with the Cuban government. The U.S. Congress passed a statute regarding various policies and dealings toward Cuba. A National Trade Council sued the state in federal court seeking an injunction and declaratory judgment that the state law toward Cuba was unconstitutional. 30 of the business entities that were discriminated against by the state were members of the council. Is the federal court likely to grant the declaratory judgment and declare the state law unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, the state law was consistent with the federal law and with federal policy on Cuba.\nB. No, a state has the sovereign right to pass its own laws concerning its policies toward foreign countries.\nC. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it denies equal protection to citizens of other states.\nD. Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interfered with the foreign affairs power of the federal government.\n"

Yes, the state law is unconstitutional because it illegally interferes with the foreign affairs power of the federal government.\n\nThe National Trade Council is a private entity that seeks relief through federal court. They cannot sue the state directly for violation of the Constitution. Rather, they must sue the state's agency or official who enforced the unconstitutional law.\n\nThe state's action violates the Commerce Clause of the Constitution which prohibits states from passing legislation that unreasonably restricts interstate commerce. The Supreme Court has held that such laws violate the Constitution's requirement that Congress alone have the authority to regulate commerce among the states. \n\nIn this case, the state's prohibition on buying from or doing business with Cuba is an illegal interference with the federal government's ability to regulate international trade and commerce. Therefore, the federal court would likely find the state law unconstitutional and issue a declaratory judgment declaring it so."
