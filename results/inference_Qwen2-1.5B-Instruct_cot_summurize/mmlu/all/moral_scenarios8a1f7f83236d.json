However, it could be seen as a form of favoritism since you're giving them your time and effort without expecting anything in return. This action may still be considered morally right if it genuinely helps the other person improve their skills, but it's not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves treating a disabled person differently based on their physical ability. It is against societal norms to treat people differently because of their abilities or disabilities. Telling someone to crawl or learn how to walk is not only physically harmful but also dehumanizing and disrespectful. Therefore, this scenario is clearly morally wrong."
