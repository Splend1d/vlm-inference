The speed of light in vacuum, c, is given by:\n\nc = \u221a(\u03b50 * \u03bc0)\n\nwhere \u03b50 is the electric constant (also known as the vacuum permittivity) which for air is approximately 8.85 x 10^-12 F/m.\n\nFor a nonmagnetic dielectric material, \u03b5r = 4.0, so we can rearrange the formula to solve for \u03bc0:\n\n\u03bc0 = c\u00b2 / (\u03b50)\n\nPlugging in the values gives:\n\n\u03bc0 = (\u221a(4.0))\u00b2 / (8.85 x 10^-12)\n\u03bc0 = 20 / 8.85 x 10^-12\n\u03bc0 \u2248 2.26 x 10^\u22127 T/m\n\nNow that we have \u03bc0, we can find the speed of light in the material using the formula:\n\nc = \u221a(\u03b50 * \u03bc0)\n\nPlugging in the values gives:\n\nc = \u221a(8.85 x 10^-12 * 2.26 x 10^-7)\nc \u2248 1.0 x 10^8 m/s\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 1.0 x 10^8 m/s."
