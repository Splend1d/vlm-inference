I and II only.\n\nAbdul's ability to judge the distance of vehicles when he is driving depends on two cues: the sound of the engine and the reflection of headlights. The sound of the engine can give him an idea of the speed of the vehicle, while the reflection of headlights can help him estimate its distance from him. Neither of these cues would be affected by the loss of vision in his right eye. Therefore, he can still use these cues effectively. \n\nOption A (I only) suggests that only the sound of the engine could be used, which is not true as it also relies on the reflection of headlights. Option B (II only) suggests that only the reflection of headlights could be used, but this is incorrect as it relies solely on the sound of the engine. Option C (III only) suggests that only the visual cue of the reflection of headlights could be used, which is also incorrect as it relies on both auditory and visual cues."
