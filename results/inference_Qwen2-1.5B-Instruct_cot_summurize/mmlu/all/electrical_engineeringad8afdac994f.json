The voltage induced in an inductor is given by the equation:\n\nV = L * di/dt\n\nwhere V is the voltage, L is the inductance, i is the current, and d represents differentiation with respect to time.\n\nThis means that the voltage induced in anductor is proportional to both the inductance and the rate of change of current through it. Therefore, option D is the correct choice."
