In this case, Tina's initial exposure to pictures of the space shuttle was likely so frequent that it became routine for her, leading to a decrease in sensitivity or \"dishabituation\" to seeing the object again when presented with it later. This is different from other concepts like autokinetic effect, which involves objects moving on their own without external forces, and shape constancy, which refers to an object's ability to maintain its shape even if it is rotated or tilted. Summation is also not relevant to the situation described, as it pertains to how we perceive multiple stimuli at once rather than experiencing difficulty recognizing something previously encountered."
