In this case, since the distribution is normal, the 25th percentile corresponds to the z-score of -0.5 (because the cumulative probability is 0.25).\n\nThe formula for calculating the z-score is:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nWhere \\(x\\) is the value you want to know the percentile for, \\(\\mu\\) is the mean (\\(45\\)), and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation (\\(4\\)).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[z = \\frac{42.5 - 45}{4} = \\frac{-2.5}{4} = -0.625\\]\n\nNow we convert the z-score back into a raw score by multiplying by the standard deviation and adding the mean:\n\n\\[42.5 + (-0.625)(4) = 42.5 - 2.5 = 40\\]\n\nTherefore, the mass of egg that would be the 25th percentile of the masses of all the eggs is 40 g, which corresponds to option D."
