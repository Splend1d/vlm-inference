Technological developments do not affect the majority of the world's population and so the advancement of telecommunications and digital media are not of concern to peace studies.\nB. Digital information, media, and communications technology is likely to inspire greater harmony in the international system as the global population learns more about the world in which they live, and the lives of others around them.\nC. With access to digital information, such as media and the internet, disempowered populations will become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could lead to widespread frustration and revolution.\nD. Technological change and development is likely to strengthen the power of already dominant international players, and to reinforce the status quo of international relations.\n"

While some argue that technological advancements may inspire greater harmony in the international system, others suggest that they have the potential to exacerbate existing power imbalances and deepen social divides.\n\nOption A suggests that technological developments do not affect the majority of the world's population and therefore do not pose a significant threat to peace. However, this argument overlooks the ways in which technology can be used for both positive and negative purposes, including spreading misinformation, amplifying political polarization, and enabling surveillance and control.\n\nOption B argues that digital information, media, and communications technology can inspire greater harmony in the international system by promoting understanding and empathy across cultures and nations. This perspective highlights the potential benefits of technology in fostering global cooperation and reducing conflict.\n\nOption C suggests that with access to digital information, disempowered populations may become aware of their own exclusion and the inequalities of the global system. This could potentially lead to widespread frustration and revolution, which could challenge established power structures and promote greater peace and stability.\n\nOption D argues that technological change and development is likely to strengthen the power of already dominant international players and reinforce the status quo of international relations. This perspective highlights the potential risks of technological dominance and the need for democratic governance and accountability in the face of increasing technological influence. \n\nIn summary, while there may be some positive aspects of technological change and development, it is important to consider its potential impact on global peace and stability. Peace studies should continue to explore these issues and advocate for policies that support equitable and sustainable technological development that promotes human rights and social justice."
