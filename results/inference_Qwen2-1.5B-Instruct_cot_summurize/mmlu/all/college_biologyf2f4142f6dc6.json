                    "text": "The correct answer is C: an increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide and an increase in concentration of hydrogen ions.\n\nHyperventilation, also known as rapid breathing or shallow breathing, occurs when a person breathes rapidly and shallowly, which can lead to an increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and a decrease in concentration of hydrogen ions (pH). This is because the body compensates for the increased CO2 production by exhaling more CO2, which causes the pH to drop. The decrease in pH is what we feel as shortness of breath or \"the gasping attack\" during hyperventilation.\n\nSo, if someone starts to breathe too fast while resting, their blood will have an increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide due to the respiratory compensation mechanism, and they will experience an increase in hydrogen ion concentration."
