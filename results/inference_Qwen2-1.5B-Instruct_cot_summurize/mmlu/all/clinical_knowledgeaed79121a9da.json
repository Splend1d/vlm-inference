Hypernatraemia (or hypernatremia) occurs when there is an excessive intake of sodium, leading to an increase in the osmolarity of the body's fluids and resulting in hyponatremia (low sodium). This can occur from overhydration through excessive water consumption or excessive fluid replacement after surgery, for example."
