On the other hand, increases in capital and expenditures on research and development are more likely to stimulate growth by increasing productivity and innovation. Spending on education and training may also contribute to economic growth by improving skills and knowledge among workers, but it is less likely to directly stimulate economic activity as much as increased capital or R&D investments."
