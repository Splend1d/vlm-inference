The prosecution offered into evidence the bank's daily deposit and tally records for a six month period, to show that total deposits did not reconcile with the total funds received and recorded. The prosecution tried to enter the records as exhibits without certification or the testimony of an official bank custodian of records. Defense counsel objected on the basis of hearsay. Is the court likely to order the evidence inadmissible without further proof of authenticity?\n\nA. No, because the trial court has wide discretion in allowing documentary evidence that is regularly kept by a business.\nB. Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.\nC. No, because business records kept on a regular basis are allowed as an exception to the hearsay rule and no further qualification is required.\nD. Yes, because bank records are not included in the hearsay exception for business records.\n"

Yes, because a qualified bank employee must first authenticate them in person or provide a certification in compliance with the rules.\n\nThe hearsay rule states that statements made out of court cannot be used as evidence unless they can be authenticated. In this case, the bank's deposit and tally records are considered business records, which are generally admissible under certain exceptions to the hearsay rule. However, these records need to be authenticated before they can be used as evidence.\n\nUnder the hearsay rule, a witness may testify about what he or she heard someone else say, but only if the statement is \"a matter within the personal knowledge of the declarant.\" This means that the witness must have firsthand knowledge of the statement. If the record is the product of someone else's work (such as the bank's daily deposit and tally records), it would not meet the requirement of being a matter within the personal knowledge of the declarant.\n\nTherefore, the bank teller would need to produce the records either through testimony from a bank custodian of records who has personally examined and authenticated the records, or through a certified copy of the records produced by the bank itself. Without such authentication, the records would not be admissible as evidence under the hearsay rule."
