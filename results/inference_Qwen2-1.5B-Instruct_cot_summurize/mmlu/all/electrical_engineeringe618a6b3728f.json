                    "text": "The superposition theorem states that the output of an electrical circuit is the sum of the outputs produced by each input voltage or current source separately. This means that if you have multiple sources (voltage or current) and they are all connected to the same point in the circuit, the total output will be equal to the sum of their individual outputs.\n\nIn a linear system, if you apply different inputs with different magnitudes and phases, the output will also vary according to these inputs. This means that the output of a linear system can be represented as a vector addition of the outputs from each input. Therefore, the superposition theorem holds for linear systems.\n\nSo, the answer is D. An impulse. An impulse represents a sudden change in the input voltage or current, which is a common example of a non-linear input signal. In a linear system, the output should not depend on the instantaneous value of the input, but rather on the magnitude and phase of the input."
