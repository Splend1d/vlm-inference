The smallest entity that can evolve is an individual organism.\n\nDarwin proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection, which states that small changes over time can lead to significant evolutionary development. He believed that individuals could accumulate advantageous traits through their interactions with the environment and other organisms. Therefore, he would not reject this concept. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that Darwin did not specify any specific size limit for entities that could evolve. It's possible that some forms of life may be too small to be considered in his work, but this does not necessarily mean they cannot evolve."
