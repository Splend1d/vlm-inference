The woman discovered that the service was selling her personal profile information, and the information pertaining to thousands of other members, to third party purchasers for tracking of their Internet activities and buying habits. In her class action breach of contract action against the service, she alleged two theories of damages. First, she contended that she and the class members suffered \"embarrassment and humiliation\" from the disclosure, and second, that she and the others must be compensated for the market value of the information seized. Will the court likely recognize these allegations as sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract?\n\nA. Yes, because the service breached the duty of good faith inherent in every contract.\nB. Yes, because these are common types of damages that are authorized in breach of contract cases.\nC. No, because Internet laws protect absolutely all communications and downloads of this nature as part of the service's guaranteed scope of free speech rights.\nD. No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.\n"

No, because humiliation is not an item of damages in a breach of contract case, and the unauthorized collection of personal data does not establish an economic loss.\n\nWhile the court may consider whether the service breached its contractual duties of good faith, it is unlikely to find that the disclosure of personal profiles and information has caused embarrassment or humiliation. Additionally, while there may be some common law principles that authorize certain types of damages in breach of contract cases, the specific circumstances of this situation would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the court. Without more information about the facts of the case, it is difficult to determine whether the plaintiff's claims have merit."
