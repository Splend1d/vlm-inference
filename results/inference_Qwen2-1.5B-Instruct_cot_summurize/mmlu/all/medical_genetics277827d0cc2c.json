Twin studies are particularly useful for studying how genetics and environment interact with one another to influence human traits, such as intelligence or personality. By comparing the traits of identical (or monozygotic) twins who share 100% of their genes, researchers can estimate the effects of genetic factors on these traits. This information can then help scientists understand the role that genetics plays in shaping human behavior and characteristics."
