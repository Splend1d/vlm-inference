According to the problem, he scored 4 points fewer in his first game than in his second game. We can write this relationship mathematically as:\n\n\\[ \\text{First Game Points} - \\text{Second Game Points} = 4 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 18 - p = 4 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(p\\), we add \\(p\\) to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 18 = 4 + p \\]\n\nThen, subtract 4 from both sides to isolate \\(p\\):\n\n\\[ 14 = p \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 18 \u2212 4 = p; 14."
