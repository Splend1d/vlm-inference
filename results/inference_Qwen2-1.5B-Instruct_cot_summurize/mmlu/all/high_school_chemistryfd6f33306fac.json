                    "text": "Heat of fusion is not a good measure of relative intermolecular attractive forces because it measures the amount of heat required to convert a substance from its solid state to its liquid state, which does not directly relate to the strength or type of intermolecular forces between molecules.\n\nBoiling points and vapor pressures are both related to intermolecular forces but boil in different ways. Boiling points depend on the strength of the hydrogen bonds between molecules, while vapor pressures depend on the strength of the van der Waals forces between molecules (which can be influenced by intermolecular forces). Therefore, boiling points and vapor pressures can be used as indicators of the strength of intermolecular forces, although they may not fully capture all aspects of the force interactions.\n\nHeat of vaporization, also known as the latent heat of vaporization, is a measure of the energy released during the phase change from liquid to gas. It is closely related to intermolecular forces, specifically the van der Waals forces, since these forces play a role in the ability of liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Therefore, heat of vaporization can be considered a good measure of the strength of intermolecular forces. However, it's important to note that this measure alone cannot completely capture the full range of intermolecular forces present in a given system."
