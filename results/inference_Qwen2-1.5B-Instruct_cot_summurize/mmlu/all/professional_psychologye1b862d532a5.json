It helps alleviate leniency and other biases.\n\nUsing a forced-choice method as an employee performance appraisal technique allows managers and supervisors to provide clear, objective feedback on an employee's performance without the influence of personal bias or leniency. This can help to ensure that evaluations are fair and accurate, which in turn can improve overall morale and productivity within the workplace. Additionally, forcing employees to choose between two options (e.g., \"strongly agree\" or \"neutral\" versus \"strongly disagree\") can also make the process more efficient and less time-consuming than relying solely on subjective ratings."
