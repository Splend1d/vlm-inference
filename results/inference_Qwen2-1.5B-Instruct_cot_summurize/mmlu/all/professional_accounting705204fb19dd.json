No, No.\n\nFunctional expenses refer to expenses that relate to the specific activities or services provided by the organization. Natural expenses refer to expenses that do not have a direct relationship with the organization's operations but may still be incurred. For example, an organization may incur natural expenses such as rent for office space or utilities, which do not directly contribute to its operations but are necessary for the organization to function.\n\nTherefore, a voluntary health and welfare non-governmental not-for-profit organization would typically report functional expenses on their financial statements, while natural expenses would not be reported separately."
