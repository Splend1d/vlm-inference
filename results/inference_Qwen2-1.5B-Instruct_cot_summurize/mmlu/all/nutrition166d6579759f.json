Processed meat. \n\nProcessed meats, such as sausages, bacon, and ham, contain high levels of nitrates and nitrites which can cause cancer when they are heated to high temperatures during cooking or when they come into contact with other chemicals in the body. These chemicals can react with other compounds in the body, leading to the formation of potentially carcinogenic compounds. Additionally, processed meats often contain high levels of sodium, which is linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including esophageal cancer."
