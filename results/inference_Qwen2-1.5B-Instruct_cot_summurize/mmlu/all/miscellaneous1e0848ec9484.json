                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Ocean floor topography and the shape of the coastline serve to amplify tidal flow at specific localities.\n\nTidal range can vary significantly depending on the location, with some areas experiencing up to 60 feet of tidal fluctuation and other areas having only one-to-two-foot tidal fluctuations. This variability is primarily due to differences in ocean bottom topography and the shape of the coastline.\n\nAs oceans move along their curved paths around continents, they create pressure differences that cause water to rise and fall over time. This movement of the ocean's surface creates tides, which can be affected by factors such as the shape of the coastline, the depth of the water column, and the orientation of the land relative to the direction of the prevailing winds. In areas with flat or sloping coasts, the tide tends to move more slowly, resulting in smaller tidal ranges. Conversely, in areas with steep or undulating coastlines, the tide moves faster, leading to larger tidal ranges. Additionally, coastal features like estuaries, bays, and harbors can also influence tidal patterns by amplifying or reducing the size of tidal waves and currents."
