All three advantages of using panel data over pure cross-sectional or pure time-series modeling:\n\n(i) The use of panel data can increase the number of degrees of freedom and therefore the power of tests: This is true because panel data analysis allows for more observations per unit, which increases the number of degrees of freedom in the regression model.\n\n(ii) The use of panel data allows the average value of the dependent variable to vary either cross-sectionally or over time or both: This is true because panel data analysis allows for the variation in the average value of the dependent variable across different groups (e.g., countries, regions, firms).\n\n(iii) The use of panel data enables the researcher allows the estimated relationship between the independent and dependent variables to vary either cross-sectionally or over time or both: This is also true because panel data analysis allows for the variation in the relationship between the independent and dependent variables across different groups."
