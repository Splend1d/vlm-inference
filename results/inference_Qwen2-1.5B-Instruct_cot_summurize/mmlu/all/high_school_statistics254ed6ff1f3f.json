The range of scores considered is from 620 to 740, which covers 2 intervals: [620, 740] and [620, 650]. Since there are 2 intervals, we can find the proportion of applicants within each interval as follows:\n\nFor the interval [620, 740], the number of points above the mean is \\(740 - 620 = 120\\). Since there are 2 intervals, the total number of points above the mean is \\(120 \\times 2 = 240\\). Given the total points scored among all applicants is 1500 (as per the question statement), the proportion of applicants scoring above 700 (which includes those scoring 740 or higher) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Proportion} = \\frac{240}{1500} = 0.16 \\]\n\nConverting this fraction to a percentage gives us approximately 16.7%.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **(D) 86.7%**."
