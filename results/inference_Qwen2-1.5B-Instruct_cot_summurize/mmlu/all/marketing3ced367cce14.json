When there are high levels of business failures and unemployment, it indicates that the economy is entering the trough phase of the business cycle. This is because during this phase, businesses are facing difficulties due to economic downturns or market fluctuations, leading to increased job losses and reduced investment in new projects. As a result, the economy enters a period of contraction, characterized by low growth rates and decreased demand for goods and services. Therefore, option D (trough) is the correct answer."
