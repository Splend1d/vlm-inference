It is made up of four types of nucleotides: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). These nucleotides are arranged in a double helix structure, with each strand containing one molecule of each type of nucleotide. The sequence of these nucleotides determines the genetic information that our cells inherit from our parents during reproduction."
