One of the most significant discoveries made with these images was the resolution of Pluto's disk. This allowed scientists to measure the size of Pluto using the distance between its surface and its largest moon, Charon. The result was an accurate measurement of Pluto's diameter, which is now known as 2378 km. \n\nOption A, New Horizons' flyby in the 1990s, did not directly resolve Pluto's disk and therefore could not provide an accurate measurement of its diameter. Option C, brightness measurements made during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon, also cannot be used for this purpose because it would only tell us about Pluto's brightness rather than its actual size. Option D, radar observations made by the Arecibo telescope, while useful for studying Pluto's composition, does not involve measuring its diameter."
