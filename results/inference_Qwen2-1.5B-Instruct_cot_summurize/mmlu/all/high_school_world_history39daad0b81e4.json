It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following conclusions about imperial treatment of \"barbarian\" (foreign) peoples in the period 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage?\n\nA. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\nB. Empires welcomed migrations of barbarian peoples as sources of military manpower or economic productivity.\nC. Empires used military force against all neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence.\nD. Empires used religion to convert barbarian peoples so that they might become friendlier to the state.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is A. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state. The passage describes how the Romans fought against rival tribes, which suggests that the Romans were using military force to maintain control over their territories. This aligns with the idea that empires would use military force against neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the passage does not mention the Romans welcoming migrations of barbarian peoples as sources of military manpower or economic productivity.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the Romans were using military force against all neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence. The passage specifically mentions the Romans fighting against rival tribes rather than promoting war with all neighboring barbarian peoples.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the Romans were using religion to convert barbarian peoples so that they might become friendly to the state. The passage only mentions the Romans fighting against rival tribes, not converting people through religious practices."
