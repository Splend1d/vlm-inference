However, it was not until the 19th century that the cheese was produced and marketed as Cheddar cheese. The name \"Cheddar\" comes from the village of Cheddar in the English county of Gloucestershire, which is part of the Cotswold District. The cheese is made from cow's milk and has a distinctive yellow color and sharp taste."
