Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2:\n- The ReLU function has a discontinuous gradient at the point where its input equals 0.\n- The gradient of the ReLU at this point is undefined since the function changes from 0 to 1 abruptly.\n\nSigmoid Function:\n- The gradient of the sigmoid function is discontinuous at the points where its input equals 1 or 0.\n- At these points, the gradient jumps from 0 to infinity.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is D. False, True."
