No, even though all peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes, the latter may also spring from treaties regulating objective regimes or unilateral acts.\n\nPeremptory norms refer to rules that are binding on every state and must be followed by them without exception. These norms include human rights laws, treaty provisions, and certain customary international law principles. However, peremptory norms do not automatically apply in every case. They can be overridden by more specific norms within a treaty or by unilateral actions taken by states.\n\nIn contrast, international organizations, such as the United Nations, have the power to make binding decisions and adopt resolutions that can create new legal obligations for states. Similarly, international courts, such as the International Court of Justice, can issue rulings that establish new legal obligations under international law.\n\nTherefore, while peremptory norms set out general duties owed by states to each other, they are not always the only source of legal obligations in international law."
