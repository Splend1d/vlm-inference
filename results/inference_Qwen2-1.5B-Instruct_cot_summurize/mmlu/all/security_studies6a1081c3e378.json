Whilst energy consumption is correlated to levels of industrialisation, developed states of the North continue to increase their demands for energy. This is balanced by a lesser demand from states in the South; due to their lack of industrialisation their demands on energy are forecast to remain low.\nB. Energy demand in the industrialised states has peaked in recent years and data indicates that consumption levels in the North have become constant and are not likely to increase.\nC. Whilst forecasts predict that energy consumption in the industrialised states of the North will continue to increase, the major increase in demand will come from the developing states of the South, posing major challenges to global energy security.\nD. Although demand from developing states is set to increase the global consumption of dwindling energy resources, technological advancements in alternative energy sources, coupled with comprehensive understanding of current resource levels and access, will secure energy supply in the foreseeable future.\n"

Although demand from developing states is set to increase, technological advancements in alternative energy sources, coupled with comprehensive understanding of current resource levels and access, will secure energy supply in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing trend towards renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. These technologies have shown significant potential for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, advancements in battery technology and storage capacity have made it possible to store excess energy generated during peak production periods for use when needed.\n\nFurthermore, governments around the world are increasingly investing in sustainable infrastructure and policies to promote renewable energy adoption. For example, many countries have implemented feed-in tariffs or other incentives to encourage the installation of solar panels and wind turbines on private property.\n\nAs a result, while energy demand may continue to grow in some regions, particularly in developing countries, there is increasing confidence that alternative energy sources can meet this demand without compromising energy security. The future looks promising for securing energy supplies through the widespread adoption of clean, renewable energy technologies."
