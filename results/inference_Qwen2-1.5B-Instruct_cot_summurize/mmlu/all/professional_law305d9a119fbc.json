The employee determined that his boss was not breathing, immediately rendered CPR to his boss, and succeeded in reviving him. The employee then called the paramedics, who took the boss to the hospital. Two week later, the boss returned to work. Grateful for the employee's quick action in saving his life, the boss said to the employee, \"You'll have ajob with me for life. \"Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that date?\n\nA. &s per the boss's oral promise, the employee had an enforceable lifetime employment contract.\nB. The boss had a duty to pay the employee reasonable compensation for saving his life, based upon a contract implied-in-fact.\nC. The employee's act of saving the boss's life was sufficient past consideration to render enforceable the boss's subsequent promise.\nD. Since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment.\n"

The employee's act of saving the boss's life was sufficient past consideration to render enforceable the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment.\n\nPast consideration is a concept in contract law that allows for the creation of a new contract based on a previous act or omission by one party. In this case, the employee saved their boss's life, which was an act of good faith and bravery that was sufficient to create a new contract between them. The boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment was therefore valid and enforceable."
