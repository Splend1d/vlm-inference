The volume of the remaining water in the cone after it has dropped to half its original height.\n2. The rate at which this volume is changing with respect to time.\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) of the remaining water can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cone: \\(V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} r^2 h\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the base and \\(h\\) is the height of the cone.\n\nWhen the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone, the new height of the water will be \\(2 - 0.5 = 1.5\\) cm. This means that the volume of the remaining water is:\n\\[V_{remaining} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} (1)^2 (1.5) = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\cdot 1.5 = 0.5\\pi \\text{ cubic centimeters}\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the rate at which the volume is changing with respect to time. The rate of change of volume with respect to time (\\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\)) can be found by differentiating the volume equation with respect to time:\n\n\\[\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{3} r^2 h \\right)\\]\n\\[= \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\cdot 2rh \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt}\\]\n\nWe know that the rate of water dripping out from the hole at the vertex of the cone is 3 cubic centimeters per minute, so:\n\\[3 = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\cdot 2r \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt}\\]\n\\[3 = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\cdot 2r \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt}\\]\n\nSince \\(r = 1\\) and \\(h = 1.5\\), we substitute these values into our equation:\n\\[3 = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1.5 \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt}\\]\n\\[3 = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt}\\]\n\\[3 = \\pi \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt}\\]\n\nTherefore, the rate at which the height changes with respect to time is \\(\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{3}{\\pi}\\) cm/min.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. \u22124/(3\u03c0) cm/min."
