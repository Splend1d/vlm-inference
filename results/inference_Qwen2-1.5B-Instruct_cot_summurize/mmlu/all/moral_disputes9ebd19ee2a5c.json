Consequentialist considerations.\n\nVelleman argues that euthanasia may be considered morally acceptable if it results in a net increase in overall happiness or well-being, even if some individuals suffer unnecessarily as a result. This is known as the \"harm principle,\" which suggests that we should only take actions that do not cause unnecessary harm to others. Therefore, according to Velleman, if euthanasia leads to an overall improvement in society's quality of life, it could be considered morally permissible under certain circumstances. However, this argument raises significant ethical and philosophical questions about the morality of ending someone's life for any reason."
