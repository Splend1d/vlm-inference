Since the digit in the tens place (the next digit after the hundreds) is 9, which is greater than or equal to 5, we know that the digit in the ones place must also be 5 or less for the number to round up to 800.\n\nTherefore, rounding 794 to the nearest hundred gives us:\n\nB. 794\n\nThis means that when you multiply 794 by 100, you get a result that rounds up to 800."
