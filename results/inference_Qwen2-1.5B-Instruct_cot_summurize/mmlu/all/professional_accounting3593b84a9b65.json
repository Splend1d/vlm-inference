Modified the review report to reflect the fact that the financial statements were presented on another comprehensive basis of accounting.\n\nWhen an accountant determines that a company maintains its accounts on a comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP, it means that the company's financial statements do not conform to GAAP. This could be due to various reasons such as using a different set of accounting principles or methods. In this case, the accountant may modify the review report to include a statement that reflects this fact and advises management to take corrective action to bring the financial statements into compliance with GAAP."
