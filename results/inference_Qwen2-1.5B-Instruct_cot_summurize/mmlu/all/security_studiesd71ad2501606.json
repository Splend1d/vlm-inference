For societal security dilemmas ambiguity can stem from two sides of nationalism; cultural (positive) and ethnic (negative). Ethnic (political) nationalism is often described as more malign and linked to state disintegration, whereas cultural nationalism is often seen as benign, working within existing state structures.\nB. Clear distinctions between cultural nationalism and political nationalism are difficult to make: cultural nationalism may sometimes be compelled to change itself from a solely cultural movement into a political movement and be conflated with political nationalism.\nC. Dominant actors may exaggerate threat perceptions with the intent of mobilizing political support which can result in action reaction processes.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Security dilemmas refer to situations where conflicting interests or values among different groups or nations create tension or conflict that can escalate into violence or war. In such cases, dominant actors may exaggerate threat perceptions with the intent of mobilizing political support which can result in action-reaction processes. Cultural nationalism and ethnic nationalism can also lead to security dilemmas if they are not managed properly."
