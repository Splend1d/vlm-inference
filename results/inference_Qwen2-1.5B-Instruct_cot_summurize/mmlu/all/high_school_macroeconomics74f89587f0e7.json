Allow banks to make more loans and buy more investments thus increasing the money supply. Lowering reserve requirements would also allow banks to lend more money without having to hold as much cash in reserve, which could lead to an increase in the overall amount of money available for circulation. However, it's important to note that this can also lead to inflation if the economy is already experiencing high levels of spending and production."
