The performance by the homeowner would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the roofer.\nC. The performances of the homeowner and the roofer would be constructive concurrent conditions.\nD. The contract would be unenforceable, because it was oral.\n"

The performance by the homeowner would be an implied condition subsequent to the performance by the roofer.\n\nThis means that the homeowner's promise to pay $10,000 is an implied condition that the roofer must perform their obligations in accordance with the contract. This implies that if the roofer does not complete the repair work within 30 days, they may face consequences for breaching their contractual obligation."
