Buy bonds, increases the money supply, increases aggregate demand, and fights unemployment.\n\nOpen market operations refer to the buying or selling of government securities by a central bank. When the central bank buys government securities (i.e., sells them), it injects money into the economy by increasing the money supply. This increases aggregate demand, as more money can be lent out at lower interest rates. At the same time, this also helps fight unemployment by providing people with jobs through the expansionary effect of higher wages and prices. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the central bank should sell bonds, which would decrease the money supply and decrease aggregate demand. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that the central bank should sell bonds, which would decrease the money supply and decrease aggregate demand. Option D is incorrect because it suggests that the central bank should buy bonds, which would increase the money supply and decrease aggregate demand."
