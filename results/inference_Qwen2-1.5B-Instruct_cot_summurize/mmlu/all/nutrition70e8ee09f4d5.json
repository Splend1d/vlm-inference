Smoking causes lung cancer through several mechanisms, including exposure to carcinogens in tobacco smoke that can damage DNA and promote cell growth. Other factors that have been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer include obesity (which can increase the size of the lungs), high doses of certain vitamins or supplements (such as beta carotene), and alcohol consumption. However, alcohol itself does not directly cause lung cancer; rather, it can interact with other factors that increase the risk of the disease."
