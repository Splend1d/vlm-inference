Loaded language\n\nLoaded language refers to words or phrases that carry strong emotional associations and can be used in ways that are not necessarily accurate or fair. When someone uses highly emotionally charged terms during an argument without providing any reason for their use, they may be committing loaded language. For example, saying \"you're lying\" without providing evidence could be considered loaded language because it implies dishonesty without providing any factual basis for the accusation."
