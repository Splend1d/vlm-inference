However, it is not true that all ResNets also use self-attention. Residual Networks (ResNets) were originally proposed by Kaiming He et al. in 2015, while Transformers were introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017. While both types of architectures can be considered feedforward neural networks due to their reliance on convolutional layers for feature extraction, only the Transformers have been shown to be effective at natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and question answering. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
