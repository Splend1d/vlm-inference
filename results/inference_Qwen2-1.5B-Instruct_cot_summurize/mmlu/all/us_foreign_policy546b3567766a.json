All of the above\n\nThe US avoided catastrophe at the hands of the British in 1814 due to a combination of factors, including:\n\n- Naval victories: The American navy under Commodore Stephen Decatur and Captain Matthew Perry was able to defeat British warships during the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813, which forced the British to abandon their plans to invade the United States.\n- Diplomacy: President James Madison successfully negotiated a peace treaty with Britain that ended the War of 1812 and secured favorable terms for the United States, such as the Treaty of Ghent, which provided the U.S. with control over its own territory and a free trade agreement with Britain.\n- British preoccupation with Europe: During the late 18th century, Britain was preoccupied with conflicts in Europe, particularly the Napoleonic Wars, which prevented them from sending large armies or navies to the Americas.\n\nTherefore, all of these factors combined played a role in preventing the US from facing a catastrophic outcome at the hands of the British in 1814."
