The law code first promulgated by Chinggis Khan ordered human interaction. The result was an important new stage in international contact. From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n\u2014Robert Guisepi, 1992\nThe legacies or adaptations of legacies from the Mongol empire are varied. Most notably, they include which of the following selections?\n\nA. Public libraries\nB. Universal health care\nC. The game of chess\nD. Religious tolerance\n"

Religious tolerance\n\nThe passage mentions that under the rule of the Mongols, there was \"virtually all religions being tolerated,\" which suggests that religious tolerance was a legacy of the Mongol empire. \n\nPublic libraries, universal healthcare, and the game of chess are not mentioned in the passage at all.\n\nReligious tolerance is a common legacy of empires like the Mongol Empire. It allowed people from different backgrounds to live and interact peacefully, leading to cultural exchange and understanding."
