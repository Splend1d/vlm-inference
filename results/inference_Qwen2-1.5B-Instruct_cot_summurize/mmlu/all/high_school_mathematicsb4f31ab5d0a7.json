Let's check these cases:\n\nFor \\(x = 0\\):\n\\[3(0)^2 + (0)(-1/3) - (-1/3)^2 = 0 + 0 - 1/9 = -1/9 < 0\\] (This doesn't necessarily imply a vertical tangent as per the original problem's condition.)\n\nFor \\(x = -1/3\\):\n\\[3(-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(-1/3) - (-1/3)^2 = 1/3 + 1/9 - 1/9 = 1/3\\] (This does not yield a negative number, but still less than zero, suggesting it might lead to a vertical tangent if considered.)\n\nThus, considering both possibilities, the correct answer should include \\(x = -1/3\\) along with the other valid solution from the initial calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. 0 or -1/3**\n\nThis is consistent with the given conditions that \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = -1/3\\) both satisfy the given condition for a vertical tangent."
