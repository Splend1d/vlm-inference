I come to place before the Legislature of Massachusetts the condition of the miserable, the desolate, the outcast. I come as the advocate of helpless, forgotten, insane and idiotic men and women; of beings, sunk to a condition from which the most unconcerned would start with real horror; of beings wretched in our Prisons, and more wretched in our Alms-Houses. . . .\n\"If my pictures are displeasing, coarse, and severe, my subjects, it must be recollected, offer no tranquil, refined, or composing features. The condition of human beings, reduced to the extremest states of degradation and misery, cannot be exhibited in softened language, or adorn a polished page.\n\"I proceed, Gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of Insane Persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience!\"\n\u2014Dorothea Dix, \"Memorial to the Massachusetts Legislature\" (1843)\nDorothea Dix's testimony to the Massachusetts legislature reflects the influence of which of the following?\n\nA. Social Darwinism.\nB. The Second Great Awakening.\nC. Second-wave feminism.\nD. The Christian Science movement.\n"

The Second Great Awakening.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening was a religious revival that swept through the United States during the late 19th century. It emphasized the importance of personal spiritual transformation and social reform, particularly in regards to issues such as poverty, inequality, and social justice. Dorothea Dix's testimony to the Massachusetts legislature can be seen as an example of the social reforms advocated by the Second Great Awakening, including efforts to improve conditions for the poor and marginalized members of society, including those who were mentally ill or homeless."
