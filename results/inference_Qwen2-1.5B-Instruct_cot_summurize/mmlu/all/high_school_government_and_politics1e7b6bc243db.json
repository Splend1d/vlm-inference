Typically, the general population is less ideological than the delegates.\n\nDelegates to presidential nomination conventions are individuals who represent various groups within society and their interests. They may be affiliated with specific political parties or have no affiliation at all. This means that the ideologies represented by these delegates can vary widely, from those who are ideologically left-wing or right-wing to those who are more moderate on both sides of the spectrum.\n\nIt's important to note that while the general population may not necessarily share the same ideology as the delegates, they do share common values and concerns that often influence public policy decisions. Therefore, it is possible for the general population to become more ideologically aligned with certain candidates during the nomination process, even if they initially did not align with them before attending the convention."
