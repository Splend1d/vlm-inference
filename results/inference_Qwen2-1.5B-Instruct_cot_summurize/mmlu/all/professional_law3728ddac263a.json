The consumer did not read the notice and used the machine on a steep hill. As a result, it falls over and crushes him. He sues on a theory of strict liability, alleging a defect in the manufacture of the product. The manufacturer defends that the consumer misused the product. Will the Court likely grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment based on the indisputable fact that the consumer did not read the warning, which the defendant argued renders the lawsuit invalid as a matter of law?\n\nA. No, because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability in a products liability case.\nB. No, because the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\nC. Yes, because the consumer assumed the risk of the danger when he used the product on a steep hill.\nD. Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.\n"

Yes, because the consumer ignored the warning and misused the product.\n\nStrict liability refers to a legal principle where a person or entity is held liable for an injury caused by their actions even if they did not intend to cause harm. In a products liability case, the manufacturer may argue that the plaintiff must prove that the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous before they can recover damages.\n\nIn this scenario, the consumer ignored the warning about using the lawn mower on a steep hill and used it anyway, resulting in an accident. This shows that the consumer was aware of the potential dangers associated with the product but chose to ignore them. Therefore, the court is more likely to find that the consumer assumed the risk of the danger when they used the product on a steep hill, making the suit valid under the doctrine of strict liability.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that strict liability does not absolve manufacturers of responsibility for any defects in their products. If there were known defects in the product that could have led to the accident, the manufacturer would still be responsible for providing a safe product."
