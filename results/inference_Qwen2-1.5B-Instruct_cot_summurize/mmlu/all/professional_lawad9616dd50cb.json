False imprisonment occurs when someone is confined by another person or entity without their permission. In this case, the police officer confined the student without his consent, as the student was not arrested or charged with a crime. Therefore, the student may have a viable claim for false imprisonment. However, it is important to note that the student must also show that the police officer's actions were unreasonable or unlawful in order to prevail on the claim."
