The streamlined body has a selective advantage in that environment.\n\nThis is because the streamlined shape allows these animals to move more efficiently through water, which is crucial for survival in their respective environments. For example, sharks have streamlined bodies to help them swim quickly and efficiently through the ocean currents, while dolphins use their streamlined bodies to navigate and communicate within their pod groups. Tuna also have streamlined bodies to help them swim faster and catch prey in the open ocean. Therefore, it can be concluded that the streamlined body shape is advantageous for each of these species and has evolved over time to provide them with an edge in their specific environments."
