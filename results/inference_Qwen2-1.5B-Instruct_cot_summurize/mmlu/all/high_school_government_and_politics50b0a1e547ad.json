It is a social and economic concept that refers to the distribution of wealth or income among individuals, groups, or nations. While it may be an important issue in some contexts, it does not necessarily represent the core values of American political culture as a whole. Other core values include democracy (the principle of government by the people), individual liberty (the right to freedom of thought, speech, religion, etc.), and due process (the legal requirement that all citizens have access to a fair trial)."
