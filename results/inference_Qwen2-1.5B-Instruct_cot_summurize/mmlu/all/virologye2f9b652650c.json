Food and Drug Administration reforms: The HIV/AIDS Act of 1986 required the FDA to approve new treatments for AIDS, including antiretroviral therapy (ART). This helped ensure that patients had access to effective medications.\n\n2. Easier access to investigational drugs: Activists pushed for easier access to investigational drugs that were being developed by pharmaceutical companies for the treatment of AIDS. As a result, many of these drugs became available on the market more quickly than would have been possible without such advocacy efforts.\n\n3. Changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S.: The AIDS crisis also led to increased awareness and understanding of the importance of HIV testing and prevention. This contributed to broader changes in how medicine was practiced in the U.S., including improvements in public health policies and initiatives aimed at preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS."
