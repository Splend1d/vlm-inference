The patient described in your scenario feels as if their experiences were not real while they were occurring, which aligns with the symptoms of depersonalization disorder. \n\nAnxiety disorders involve feelings of fear or unease that can be triggered by specific situations or events. Schizophrenia involves a loss of touch with reality, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and impaired social interaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Depersonalization disorder."
