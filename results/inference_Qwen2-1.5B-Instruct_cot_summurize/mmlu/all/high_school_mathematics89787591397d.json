Since 23 is congruent to 1 modulo itself, it means that all numbers raised to a power modulo 23 have their own unique behavior based on the base number being congruent to 1 or not.\n\nLet's look at \\(25^{1059}\\):\n\n- If \\(25\\) is congruent to \\(1\\) modulo \\(23\\), then \\(25^{1059} = (1)^{1059}\\).\n- If \\(25\\) is not congruent to \\(1\\) modulo \\(23\\), then \\(25^{1059}\\) would involve a calculation involving both \\(25\\) and \\(1\\).\n\nGiven that \\(25\\) is not congruent to \\(1\\) modulo \\(23\\), we need to calculate \\(25^{1059}\\) directly. However, since we're looking for a specific remainder when dividing by \\(23\\), and knowing that \\(25\\) isn't congruent to \\(1\\) modulo \\(23\\), we can deduce that the remainder must come from \\(2^{1059}\\) when considering its congruence modulo \\(23\\). \n\nWe can further simplify this by recognizing that \\(2^{1059}\\) is equivalent to \\(2^{1056} \\cdot 2\\), because \\(2^{1057}\\) would result in \\(2^{1059}\\) which is congruent to \\(2^{1059 - 1056} = 2^3\\) modulo \\(23\\).\n\nNow, \\(2^3 = 8\\) modulo \\(23\\), so the remainder when \\(25^{1059}\\) is divided by \\(23\\) is \\(8\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(C) 8**."
