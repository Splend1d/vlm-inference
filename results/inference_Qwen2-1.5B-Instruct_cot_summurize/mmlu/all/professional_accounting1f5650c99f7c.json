The slope of the regression line represents the beta (or correlation coefficient) of the stock's returns with respect to the market returns. This allows us to estimate the stock's idiosyncratic risk or alpha, which measures the excess return of the stock relative to the market returns. By fitting the errors, we can also obtain a more precise estimate of the stock's beta."
