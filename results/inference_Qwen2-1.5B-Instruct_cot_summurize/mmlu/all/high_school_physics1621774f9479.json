In other words:\n\nWork = \u0394P \u00d7 V\n\nIn this case, since the cycle is counterclockwise, the work done by the gas is positive, meaning it's doing work against the external pressure. The negative sign indicates that the internal energy of the gas decreases as it expands.\n\nHowever, if we consider the overall process from start to finish, with the gas initially at a high temperature but with a small volume, and then expanding until it reaches a lower temperature but has a larger volume, there would be no net work done because the system gains thermal energy due to the increase in temperature.\n\nTherefore, the heat transfer during this compression-expansion cycle is equal to the work done, which is 300 J into the system. This means the heat transferred out of the system is zero, making option D correct."
