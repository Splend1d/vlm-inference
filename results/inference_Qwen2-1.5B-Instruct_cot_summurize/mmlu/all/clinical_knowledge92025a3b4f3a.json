A respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.\n\nThis statement contradicts the given information, as it suggests that a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (or more) would be considered \"normal\" or \"within normal limits.\" The given options suggest that all four of these situations could indicate an increase in the work of breathing, which is generally defined as the effort required to breathe and is influenced by factors such as physical activity, emotional stress, and underlying medical conditions. Therefore, D is not correctly described as not associated with an increase in the work of breathing."
