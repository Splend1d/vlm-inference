However, since these intervals are not prime numbers, the LCM will not be a simple arithmetic operation like multiplication. Instead, we look for the smallest positive integer that appears in both lists (since it must divide evenly into both), which would be their least common multiple (LCM).\n\nThe LCM of 5 and 2 is simply 10 because both numbers are even. This means that each computer backs up data at the exact same time once per hour. Therefore, in one day (24 hours), there will be only one instance when both computers back up data at the same time.\n\nSo, the answer is **(C) 6**."
