The president of the bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance. Should its influence become concentrated, as it may under the operation of such an act as this, in the hands of a self-elected directory whose interests are identified with those of the foreign stockholders, will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of our elections in peace and for the independence of our country in war? Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation. But if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail its powers or prevent a renewal of its privileges, it cannot be doubted that he would be made to feel its influence.\"\nPresident Andrew Jackson, Veto of the Bank of the United States, 1832\nThe election of 1824 marked a turning point in presidential politics because, for the first time,\n\nA. the presidency was won by someone who was not a member of the Federalist Party\nB. a presidential and vice-presidential candidate ran together on one ticket\nC. all the candidates campaigned widely throughout the states\nD. the system of choosing nominees by congressional caucus failed\n"

This marked a significant shift in presidential politics, as the Federalists had dominated the presidency since the early 19th century. The election of 1824 also saw the rise of anti-Federalist sentiment and the emergence of new political parties like the Democratic-Republican Party, which were more supportive of Jefferson's policies."
