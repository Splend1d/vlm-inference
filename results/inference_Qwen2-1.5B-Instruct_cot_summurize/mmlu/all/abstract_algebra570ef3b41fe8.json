Every equivalence relation is a partial ordering relation.\n\nThe reason why this statement is true is because an equivalence relation on a set $S$ partitions $S$ into disjoint subsets that are pairwise comparable with respect to the relation. This means that every element in $S$ is related to every other element in $S$, forming a chain of comparisons between all elements in $S$. In contrast, a partial ordering relation only requires that two elements be related by the relation, but does not require them to be comparable or connected in any way.\n\nTherefore, option A is true. Option B is false, as the number of relations from set $\\{x,y,z\\}$ to set $(1,2)$ is actually 8, since there are 3 choices for each element of the first set when paired with one of the three possible elements of the second set.\n\nOption C is also false, as an empty relation is considered to be reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, making it a complete binary tree, which has $2^k-1$ nodes where $k$ is the number of non-empty subsets of the domain.\n\nOption D is true, as a symmetric relation is one where if $aRb$ then $bRa$, while an anti-symmetric relation is one where if $aRb$ and $bRa$ then $a=b$. The negation of a property is simply the opposite of that property, so properties of symmetry and anti-symmetry indeed have opposite meanings."
