Based on the properties of conditional probability the next toss is more likely to be an even number given that three in a row have been even.\nC.

Based on the properties of conditional probability, the next toss is more likely to be an even number given that three in a row have been even.\n\nThis is because when we toss a fair die, there is an equal chance of getting any number from 1 to 6. However, if all three tosses result in an even number, then the next toss is less likely to be an even number (since the total sum of the last three outcomes was an even number) but still has an equal chance of being any one of the remaining five numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Therefore, the probability of getting an even number on the next toss is higher compared to the probability of getting an odd number."
