Simple foragers typically rely on a limited number of food sources, such as plants or animals in their immediate environment, while complex foragers may have access to a variety of different resources, including hunting, fishing, gathering, and cultivation. They may also be able to store and preserve food, which can help them survive during times of scarcity."
