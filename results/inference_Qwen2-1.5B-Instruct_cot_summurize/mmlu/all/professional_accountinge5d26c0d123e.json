The federal unemployment system is funded by both employer and employee taxes.\n\nUnder the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), employers must pay a tax on each dollar they spend on hiring temporary workers or employees, with the goal of helping to stabilize the job market during economic downturns. This tax is then passed on to the government as part of the unemployment insurance program, which provides financial support to individuals who have lost their jobs due to business closures or other reasons and are unable to find new employment. \n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer."
