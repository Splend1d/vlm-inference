In general, question wording is important in research design to ensure that participants understand the purpose and nature of the study, and to minimize biases such as response bias or selection bias. It is also important to have a control group to compare against to determine if the observed effects are real or just a result of chance or other factors. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider the wording of the questions when designing a study."
