The choice of which penalty to use depends on the specific problem and the trade-off between bias and variance.\n\nThe L0 norm, also known as the nuclear norm, is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the model. This penalty can help prevent overfitting by forcing the model to have few nonzero coefficients, which reduces the complexity of the model.\n\nThe L1 norm, also known as the lasso penalty, adds a penalty term that encourages the coefficients to be small but non-zero. This penalty helps to balance the trade-off between bias and variance.\n\nThe L2 norm, also known as the ridge penalty, adds a penalty term that encourages the coefficients to be large but not too large. This penalty helps to prevent overfitting by penalizing larger coefficients.\n\nTherefore, any of these penalties could have been used to regularize a linear regression model with a regularization penalty."
