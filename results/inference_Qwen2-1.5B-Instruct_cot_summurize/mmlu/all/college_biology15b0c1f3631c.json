Low relative humidity can actually decrease the rate of transpiration from plants, as it reduces the amount of water vapor in the air that plants need to evaporate and release into the atmosphere. This is because the lower relative humidity makes it harder for plants to absorb water vapor from the air, which they use to conduct their metabolic processes. High temperature and wind also increase the rate of transpiration from plants, while high relative humidity does not affect this process."
