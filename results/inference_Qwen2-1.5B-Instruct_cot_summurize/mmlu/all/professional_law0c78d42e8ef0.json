Two of the guests got into an argument, and one of them got up from the table and lunged at the other with a large hunting knife. The host stepped in with a baseball bat and hit the attacker in the chest with it, preventing the imminent contact by the attacker with his target. The blow knocked the attacker down and caused several broken ribs. The injured guest sued the host for aggravated assault and battery. Is the court likely to grant the host's motion to dismiss the claim for failure to state a sufficient claim for relief?\n\nA. Yes, because the host had the privilege of \"defense of others.\"\nB. No, because the host's use of force was excessive under the circumstances.\nC. Yes, because the host has the privilege of host immunity.\nD. No, because the host escalated the conflict by getting involved.\n"

In this case, the host used a baseball bat to prevent a potentially deadly attack on another person who was present during the incident. This action falls within the realm of self-defense and is generally considered appropriate in such situations. Therefore, the court is less likely to grant the host's motion to dismiss based on the justification provided for the use of force. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that each case is unique, and the court will consider various factors when determining whether to grant the motion to dismiss. It may also be relevant to consider any previous incidents involving the host and the injured guest, as well as any evidence of prior agreements or understandings regarding the level of protection or responsibility the host may have in these types of situations. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case."
