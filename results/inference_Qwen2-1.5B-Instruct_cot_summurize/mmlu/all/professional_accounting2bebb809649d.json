Therefore, the total amount that should be expensed as research and development costs is the sum of all these components. \n\nIn this case, the labor and material costs for producing the prototype were $100,000, the cost of testing the prototype was $40,000, and there was no production until after obtaining the patent, so the production costs would also be considered as part of the research and development expense. The legal costs were not directly related to the research and development process but could still be included if they were necessary for the project's success.\n\nTherefore, the total amount that should be expensed as research and development costs is:\n\n$100,000 (prototype) + $40,000 (testing) + $0 (no production) = $140,000\n\nSo, option C is the correct answer."
