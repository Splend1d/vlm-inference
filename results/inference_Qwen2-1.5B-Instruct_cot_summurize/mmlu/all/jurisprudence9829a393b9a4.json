This means that even if a particular law does not apply to someone, they may still have a prima facie duty to obey it based on their understanding of what the law entails and their moral obligations as citizens.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the prima facie duty to obey the law is an absolute duty that applies to all individuals, regardless of whether the law is clear or ambiguous.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because it suggests that there is no duty to obey a law to which one hasn't agreed, which is not necessarily true. People often have a prima facie duty to obey laws that do not explicitly conflict with their personal beliefs or values.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the prima facie duty to obey the law applies to everyone, so it cannot be limited to those who are directly affected by the law."
