Implementing a class-wide behavior management plan, such as a response cost raffle.\n\nThis approach allows the teacher to use incentives to encourage positive behavior while also addressing any underlying issues or problems that may contribute to the student's disruptive behavior. It can include rewards for good behavior, consequences for bad behavior, and other strategies to reinforce positive behavior and discourage negative behavior. This type of intervention is often more effective than relying solely on punitive measures, which can have negative consequences for both the student and the classroom environment."
