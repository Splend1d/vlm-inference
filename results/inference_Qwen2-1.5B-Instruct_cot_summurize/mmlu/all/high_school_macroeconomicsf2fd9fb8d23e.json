The tax multiplier and the spending multiplier are inversely related.\n\nIf the tax multiplier increases, it means that a larger increase in taxes will lead to a smaller decrease in disposable income. This could be due to several factors, such as an increase in the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which is the proportion of after-tax income that is spent on goods and services. If the MPC increases, then a larger percentage of after-tax income will be spent on goods and services, leading to a larger decrease in taxes.\n\nOn the other hand, if the spending multiplier falls, it means that a larger increase in government purchases or private consumption will lead to a smaller increase in output. This could be due to several factors, such as a reduction in the marginal propensity to save (MPS), which is the proportion of after-tax income that is saved rather than spent on goods and services. If the MPS decreases, then a larger percentage of after-tax income will be saved, leading to a smaller increase in government purchases or private consumption.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: government spending increases. An increase in government spending will lead to a larger increase in output, which will result in a larger decrease in taxes."
