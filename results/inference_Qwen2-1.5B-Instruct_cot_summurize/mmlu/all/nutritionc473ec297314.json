This involves asking individuals about their intake of various foods and beverages over a specific period, such as a week or month, to estimate their daily dietary patterns. The FFQ can be completed by self-reporting, either through a paper-based questionnaire or an online platform. Other methods, such as weighed diaries and 24-hour recalls, may also be used depending on the study design and availability of resources."
