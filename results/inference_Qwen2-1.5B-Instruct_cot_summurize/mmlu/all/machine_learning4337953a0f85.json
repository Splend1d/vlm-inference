Instead, they add connections between hidden layers to improve model interpretability and reduce overfitting.\n\nStatement 2 is true because DenseNets have been shown to require more memory compared to ResNets due to their dense connectivity structure and the need to store additional information at each layer. This increased memory requirement can lead to slower training times and higher computational costs. However, it's important to note that this statement only applies to certain types of architectures and might not hold universally."
