Changes in the price level must be proportional to changes in the money supply.\n\nThis is because in the equation of exchange, the relationship between the quantity of goods (Q) and the value of money (V) is given by:\n\nQ = MV/P\n\nwhere M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the quantity of goods or services. If we assume that V and P remain constant, then the only way for Q to change is if M changes. Therefore, changes in the price level must be proportional to changes in the money supply.\n\nOption B is incorrect because changes in the money supply can affect the price level through changes in the money demand curve, which in turn affects the quantity of goods demanded.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because changes in the price level can affect the money supply through changes in the demand for money, which in turn affects the quantity of money available for transactions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the equation of exchange is valid under certain assumptions, such as the presence of a fixed money supply and a stable price level. However, these assumptions do not necessarily hold in all economic situations."
