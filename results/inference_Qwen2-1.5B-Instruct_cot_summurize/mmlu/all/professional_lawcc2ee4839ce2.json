A woman, whose mother worked as a secretary to the wealthy man for years, filed a claim against the estate, alleging that she was the wealthy man's daughter. At trial, the woman's attorney called the wealthy man's butler to testify. The butler testified that it was Common knowledge in the household that the wealthy man and the woman's mother were having an affair. The butler also testified that the wealthy man had often confided in him and told him shortly after the woman's birth that the woman was the wealthy man's daughter. Upon objection by the attorney for the executor of the wealthy man's estate, the court will most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection bc butler's testimony would be violative of hearsay rule.\nB. sustain, bc butler's testimony would be violative of Dead man's statute.\nC. overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be relevant to the ultimate issue in the case.\nD. overrule objection because the butler's testimony would qualify under the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.\n"

Overrule the objection because the butler's testimony would be relevant to the ultimate issue in the case.\n\nIn this scenario, the butler's testimony is being offered to prove that the wealthy man had a son with his wife, which would have been known among the household staff at the time of the man's death. This information is relevant to the question of whether the woman who is now claiming to be the child of the wealthy man is indeed the legitimate child of the man. Therefore, the testimony is admissible under the relevant party exception to the hearsay rule."
