When you round a number to the nearest hundred, you are essentially looking for the largest whole number that is less than or equal to the given number and the smallest whole number greater than or equal to the given number.\n\nGiven that the rounded number is 500, let's analyze each option:\n\n- A. 458 rounds down to 450.\n- B. 463 rounds up to 460 (since 463 is closer to 460).\n- C. 547 rounds up to 550 (since 547 is closer to 550).\n- D. 559 rounds up to 560 (since 559 is closer to 560).\n\nNone of these options can be the original number before it was rounded to the nearest hundred because they all round up to a value above 500. Therefore, none of them could have been the original number before being rounded. \n\nThe correct answer is **none**."
