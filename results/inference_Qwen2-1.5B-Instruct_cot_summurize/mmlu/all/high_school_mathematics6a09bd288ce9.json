Dividing every term by 2 gives us $x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 2y = 10$.\nCompleting the square for the $x$ terms and the $y$ terms separately, we get:\n\\[x^2 - 6x + 9 + y^2 + 2y + 1 = 10 + 9 + 1.\\]\nSimplifying, we have $(x-3)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 20$.\nThis is the equation of a circle with center $(3,-1)$ and radius $\\sqrt{20}$.\nSince the circle is inscribed inside a square that has a pair of sides parallel to the x-axis,\nthe side length of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, which is $2\\sqrt{20}$.\nTherefore, the area of the square is $(2\\sqrt{20})^2 = 4(20) = 80$.\nThe answer is: A. 80"
