It can be used to determine the molecular geometry, spin state, and magnetic environment of a molecule. In the case of dimethylnitroxide (CH3)2NO\u2022, the electron density distribution around the nitrogen atom will be different from that of other molecules with similar electron density distributions.\nAssuming that the electron density distribution around the nitrogen atom is different for CH3)2NO\u2022 compared to other molecules, we can expect that the EPR spectrum of CH3)2NO\u2022 will have more than one line. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 3."
