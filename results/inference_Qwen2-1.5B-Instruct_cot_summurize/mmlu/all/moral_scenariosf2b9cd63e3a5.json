However, it may be seen as irresponsible or unprofessional if the individual is unable to stay at work due to illness or other reasons. \n\nScenario 2: As my parents were sleeping, I locked their gun safe.\nThis action is considered morally wrong because it violates trust and safety concerns. It is important to respect the privacy and security of individuals, especially when they are asleep and vulnerable. Additionally, locking a gun safe can result in serious legal consequences if discovered by law enforcement."
