The current in the power source will remain constant because the voltage across each lamp remains the same and the power dissipated by each lamp is proportional to its resistance (I^2R), so the power supply must maintain the same voltage to keep the power dissipation constant. However, this does not necessarily mean that the current will increase or decrease; it depends on other factors such as the total resistance of the circuit and the load being placed on it."
