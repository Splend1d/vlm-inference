Quakers\n\nNote: The Quaker movement emerged from the Protestant Reformation and was known for its beliefs on religious toleration and non-violent protest against the Church of England's practices. William Penn, like other Quakers, believed in the freedom of conscience and the right of individuals to follow their own spiritual path without interference from the state."
