In this case, the father's will provides that if his dogs do not receive proper care, the property should go to his son and his heirs (if he has any) or to the American Society for the Protection of Animals. However, since the rule against peremptuities applies, the son's interest in the property is contingent upon the dogs receiving proper care.
