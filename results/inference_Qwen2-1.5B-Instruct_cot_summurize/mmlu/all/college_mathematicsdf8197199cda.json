It can be proven using the definition of absolute value as the distance from zero on the number line.\n\nHowever, option D is also not always true. While it is generally true that $|x+y|\\leq|x|+|y|$ for any real numbers $x$ and $y$, this inequality does not hold for all pairs of real numbers $(x,y)$. For example, consider the case where $x=1$ and $y=-2$. In this case, we have $|x+y|=3>1+|-2|=3$, so $|x+y|$ is not necessarily less than or equal to $|x|+|y|$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A)."
