This increased participation is likely due to factors such as greater awareness of the benefits of exercise and sport for overall health and well-being, as well as changes in societal attitudes towards gender roles and opportunities for women to participate in physical activity. Additionally, advancements in technology and training methods have also contributed to improvements in women's performance. However, it's important to note that factors such as genetics, environment, and individual differences also play a role in athletic ability."
