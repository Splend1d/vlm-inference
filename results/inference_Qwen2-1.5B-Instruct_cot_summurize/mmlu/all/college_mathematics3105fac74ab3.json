If $f$ is a bounded function on $\\mathbb{R}$, it means that for all $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists some $M > 0$ such that $|f(x)| < M$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This implies that $f$ can be approximated by a sequence of step functions (piecewise constant functions) that are continuous and uniformly bounded. In particular, this means that $f$ is Riemann integrable on any finite interval $[a,b]$ (where $a<b$), since we can approximate $f$ with a sequence of step functions that are continuous and uniformly bounded on each subinterval $(a_i,b_i)$, where $a_1 < a_2 < \\dots < b_n = b$. Therefore, option A is false.\n\n2. Option B is also false because if $f$ is not differentiable at every point in a set $E$ of real numbers, then there would be a sequence of points $x_n \\in E$ such that $f'(x_n)$ does not exist. However, this does not mean that $f$ cannot be continuous at these points or that $f$ is not Riemann integrable on any finite interval containing one of these points. For example, consider the function $f(x) = |x|$ on $[-1,1]$. It is continuous everywhere but its derivative is undefined at $0$, yet it is Riemann integrable on any finite interval. Therefore, option B is also false.\n\n3. Option C is also false because if $f$ is not differentiable at every point in a set $E$ of real numbers, then there would be a sequence of points $x_n \\in E$ such that $f'(x_n)$ does not exist. However, this does not mean that $f$ cannot be continuous at these points or that $f$ is not Riemann integrable on any finite interval containing one of these points. For example, consider the function $f(x) = |x|$ on $[-1,1]$. It is continuous everywhere but its derivative is undefined at $0$, yet it is Riemann integrable on any finite interval. Therefore, option C is also false.\n\nIn summary, none of the given options are necessarily true based on the information provided about a bounded function being Lebesgue integrable. The correct answer is D. None of the above."
