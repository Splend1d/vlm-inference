We want to find the exponent of $109$ in the prime factorization of $x^{11} = x \\cdot x \\cdots x$, where there are $11$ terms.\n\nSince $109$ is a prime number, it's obvious that the exponent of $109$ in the prime factorization of $x$ is $5$. Therefore, the exponent of $109$ in the prime factorization of $x^{11}$ is also $5$.\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
