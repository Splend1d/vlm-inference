If there is a leverage effect, then the market may react differently to positive and negative shocks.\n\nIn general, if there is a leverage effect, the news impact curve will be skewed towards the positive side. This means that the market may respond more strongly to positive news (such as an increase in GDP or a decrease in unemployment) than it does to negative news (such as a decrease in GDP or an increase in unemployment).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. It would rise less quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude."
