In this case, we're looking for an exponent such that when we raise 3 to that power, it equals 81 (which can also be written as 8 over 1 or simply 8).\n\nGiven that 81 = 8/1 = 8, we know that the base (in this case, 3) must be raised to the power of 2 because:\n\n\\[3^2 = 9\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 27**."
