Minimum wage legislation is typically associated with the social safety net policies, which do not fit under the umbrella of the redistribution-with-growth policy approach. The other options (land reform, progressive taxation, and increased access to education) are all elements of the redistribution-with-growth policy approach, as they aim to redistribute wealth and promote economic growth by increasing government spending on public goods and services."
