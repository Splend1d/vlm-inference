Given that the actual unemployment claims will be 2% of eligible gross wages (which is the first $15000 of gross wages paid to each employee), we can find the number of claims per employee:\n\nNumber of claims = Total eligible wages / $15000\n\nFor each employee:\nNumber of claims = $20000 / $15000 = 1.333...\n\nSince we cannot have fractions of claims, we round down to 1 claim per employee.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of claims across all employees:\n\nTotal claims = Number of claims per employee * Number of employees\nTotal claims = 1 * 4 = 4 claims\n\nThe total eligible gross wages for all employees is:\n\nTotal eligible wages = $20000 * 4 = $80000\n\nThe amount that Boca should report as accrued liability for unemployment claims is:\n\nAccrued liability = Total eligible wages * 2%\nAccrued liability = $80000 * 0.02 = $1600\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $1,600."
