When these substances come into contact with water, they tend to float on the surface rather than sink or settle out. This phenomenon is known as emulsification. The small droplets of oil or grease that are dispersed in water form an emulsion, which can be easily removed using detergents or other cleaning agents. \n\nHowever, if the water is cooled below its freezing point, some of the emulsion may begin to solidify, forming larger droplets of oil or grease that may not be so easily removed by traditional methods. In this case, the water is said to have \"regulated\" or \"thawed,\" and the process is called freezing or \"ice formation.\" \n\nSo, while all of the factors mentioned (specific heat, open-structured ice crystals, high rate of expansion) play a role in water's behavior, the one most relevant to your question is the slight tendency to freeze at lower temperatures."
