The state is willing to sell the crawfish to in-staters for $1 per pound and to out-of-staters who come to the state for $5 per pound. The state felt that the increased fee for out-of-staters was a reasonable contribution toward the protection they received from the state. Assume that the federal court decided to hear the case. The statute is likely to be found\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a valid exercise of the state's police power.\nB. constitutional, because the fee was a reasonable contribution toward the protection that the state government gave nonresidents.\nC. unconstitutional, because it places a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause under Article IV.\n"

In other words, states must treat all persons equally within their borders and must provide fair treatment for individuals within their jurisdictions.\n\nIn this case, the state is charging different prices for crawfish sold to in-state residents versus out-of-state residents, which creates an unequal treatment between the two groups. This violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it treats one group differently than another based on where they live, which is not allowed by the Constitution.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer."
