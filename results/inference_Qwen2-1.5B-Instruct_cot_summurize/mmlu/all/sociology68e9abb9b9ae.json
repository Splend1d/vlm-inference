They can be organized around economic activities (e.g., markets), political systems (e.g., governments), cultural norms and values (e.g., religions), or other types of relationships (e.g., friendships). These institutions are often highly specialized and interconnected, as they serve different functions within society. However, it's important to note that social institutions can evolve over time, and new ones may emerge as society changes."
