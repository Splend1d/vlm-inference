At trial, she calls another shopper to testif' that he rode the same escalator just moments before the woman's accident and had to jump in the air at the last minute to avoid getting his foot crushed in the escalator. This testimony is\n\nA. inadmissible, because it is irrelevant.\nB. inadmissible, because it is not known whether the other shopper the woman was exercising reasonable care in riding the escalator.\nC. admissible, because it tends to prove that a dangerous condition was present at the time the woman's foot was crushed in the escalator.\nD. admissible, because of its probative value in establishing that the woman's injury was caused by the malfunctioning escalator.\n"

The other shopper's testimony about jumping in the air to avoid getting their foot crushed provides direct evidence of the presence of a dangerous condition that led to the woman's injury. Therefore, this evidence is admissible under Rule 407 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which allows for the admission of evidence that tends to show a fact in issue if it has \"a tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable than it would be without the evidence.\" In this case, the testimony is relevant to proving that the escalator was defective and caused harm to the plaintiff."
