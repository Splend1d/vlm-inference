This action goes against the duty to protect one's children and provide them with appropriate care.\n\nIn scenario 2, calling the police on your mother for simply expressing love towards you may be perceived as interfering in her personal life without any justifiable reason or consideration for her feelings. It also involves breaking the law if you were not following a legal procedure such as seeking permission from the authorities before taking any action that might cause harm or distress to someone else.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions. The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
