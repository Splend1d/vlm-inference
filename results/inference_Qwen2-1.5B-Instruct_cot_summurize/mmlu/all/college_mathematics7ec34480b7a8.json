True, False\n\nStatement 1 is true because if we have a limit as n approaches infinity for both the sum of the series (lim_n\u2192\u221e s_n) and the product of the series (lim_n\u2192\u221e s_nt_n), then by definition of limits, it follows that the product also has a limit. This can be applied to both statements involving sums and products in sequences of complex numbers.\n\nStatement 2 is false because there does exist a bounded sequence of real numbers with no convergent subsequence. A simple example would be the sequence where each term is equal to the reciprocal of the natural number: (1/1, 1/2, 1/3, ...). This sequence is clearly bounded but has no convergent subsequences, since every subsequence either diverges to positive or negative infinity."
