                    "text": "The correct statement about proteolysis is:\n\nB. All tissue proteins undergo catabolism at more or less the same rate.\n\nThis is because all cells have a specific amount of protein, which is constantly being synthesized and broken down by various processes like proteolysis. This process helps maintain homeostasis within the cell. The rate of this catabolism varies depending on the organism's needs, but it generally remains relatively constant over time. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the rate can vary during different times of the day due to factors such as changes in metabolism and hormones.\n\nOption C is incorrect because not all proteins are tagged with the peptide ubiquitin. Proteins that are destined for degradation usually contain a signal sequence that marks them for destruction. This signal sequence typically contains a lysine residue followed by an acetylation mark (acetylated lysine). However, not all proteins need to be tagged with ubiquitin; some can be targeted by other mechanisms like autophagy.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because lysosomal enzymes do not provide the only mechanism for tissue protein catabolism. While they play a significant role in this process, other pathways like autophagy and endocytosis also contribute to the breakdown of cellular components. Additionally, some proteins are degraded outside of the lysosome through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway."
