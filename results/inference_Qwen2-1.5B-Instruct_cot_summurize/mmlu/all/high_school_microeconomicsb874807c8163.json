This is a sign of diminishing marginal returns to short-run production. As the quantity of labor increases, the marginal product of labor decreases until it reaches zero or a negative value, indicating that the level of output has reached its maximum and further increases will lead to a decrease in the marginal product of labor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D."
