This will lead to a decrease in the equilibrium price level because there is less willingness for firms to sell their goods or services at higher prices. As a result, the equilibrium quantity of output will also decrease as firms will be able to produce fewer units at any given price level. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases."
