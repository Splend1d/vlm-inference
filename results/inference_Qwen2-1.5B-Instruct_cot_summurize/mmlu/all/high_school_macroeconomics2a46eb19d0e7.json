In this case, if Kevin needs shoes but doesn't have enough money to buy them, he can use his turnips as collateral (the medium) to trade for shoes from Lisa, who has sheets of metal that she is willing to sell to him (the exchange). This transaction would be facilitated by the medium of exchange, which allows for the exchange of goods and services without the need for physical currency."
