This is because the patient is experiencing severe dyspnea and cough productive of tenacious, brownish-yellow sputum, which suggests that there may be airway obstruction or inflammation. Oxygen therapy can help to improve breathing by increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body and reducing the workload on the respiratory system. It can also help to reduce the production of mucus, which can further exacerbate symptoms. However, it is important to note that this should only be done under the supervision of a healthcare professional as it requires specialized equipment and monitoring."
