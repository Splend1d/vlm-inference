Disagreement about the appropriate use of religious iconography\n\nThe passage from John of Damascus suggests that the controversy was over the proper representation of the divine in art, with some arguing for the use of images and others opposing them. This aligns most closely with the context provided by the later 8th century religious debates in Byzantium regarding the use of religious iconography. The decree of the Second Council of Nicaea, which the passage quotes, does mention the importance of visual representations in the spread of the Christian faith, but the main focus of the passage is on the controversy surrounding their depiction and use."
