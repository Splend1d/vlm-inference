The system is consistent: This statement is true because we have at least one non-trivial solution for each equation.\n\nB. The system has infinitely many solutions: This statement is false. Since we have an infinite number of solutions to each equation individually, it does not necessarily imply that there are infinitely many solutions to the entire system combined.\n\nC. The sum of any two solutions is a solution: This statement is true. For example, if \\(s_1 = (w_1, x_1, y_1, z_1)\\) and \\(s_2 = (w_2, x_2, y_2, z_2)\\), then \\(s_1 + s_2 = (w_1 + w_2, x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2, z_1 + z_2)\\). This means that every pair of solutions sums up to another solution.\n\nD. Every solution is a scalar multiple of \\((-5, 1, 1, 0)\\): This statement is false. While it is possible that some solutions are multiples of \\((-5, 1, 1, 0)\\), this does not guarantee that every solution is a scalar multiple of that vector. There could be other solutions that do not correspond to any scalar multiple of \\((-5, 1, 1, 0)\\).\n\nTherefore, the only FALSE statement among the options provided is D. Every solution is a scalar multiple of \\((-5, 1, 1, 0)\\)."
