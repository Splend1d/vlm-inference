The conclusion must affirm the consequent.\n\nThis is because in a conditional syllogism, the major premise and the minor premise together form a condition that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. If the minor premise denies the antecedent (i.e., it does not make the statement \"if P, then Q\"), then the conclusion cannot be drawn from the given premises alone, as there is no logical connection between the two statements. Therefore, the conclusion must affirm the consequent to satisfy the conditions of the conditional syllogism."
