So, we set up the equation:\n\n\\[4t + t = 112\\]\n\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\n\\[5t = 112\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 5 yields:\n\n\\[t = 22.4\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of one ticket is $22.40. However, since the question asks for the cost of one ticket in dollars, the closest match to the given options would be option D, where the cost per ticket is $28."
