For the numbers 011000 and 011000, both MSBs are 1, indicating they are non-negative. The addition would proceed normally with the carry being added as well.\n\nGiven these considerations, the answer is **D. All three representations** because no matter what representation we use, the addition of the two numbers will not cause overflow."
