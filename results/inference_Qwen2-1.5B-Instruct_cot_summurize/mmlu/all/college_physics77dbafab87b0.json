An excimer laser.\n\nAn excimer laser is the most commonly used laser for spectroscopy because it has a high output power, high coherence, and low thermal damage to materials. It can also be tuned to specific wavelengths within the visible spectrum, making it ideal for spectroscopy applications that require narrow-band spectral resolution. Additionally, excimer lasers are relatively inexpensive compared to other types of lasers, making them a cost-effective option for spectroscopic analysis."
