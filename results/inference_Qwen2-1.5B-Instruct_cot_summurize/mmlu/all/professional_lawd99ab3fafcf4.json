One day Howard came home early from work and caught his wife and the other man in bed together. In a violent rage, Howard picked up a large metal lamp and severely beat his wife and the other man. Both victims were seriously injured and hospitalized. Howard was charged with the attempted murder of the other man. He was acquitted of the crime. After Howard's acquittal, his wife and the other man died from injuries that were related to the beating. The state now wishes to prosecute Howard for manslaughter for the deaths of his wife and the other man. Howard should be found\n\nA. guilty of manslaughter of his wife, but not guilty of manslaughter of the other man.\nB. guilty of manslaughter of the other man, but not guilty of manslaughter of his wife.\nC. guilty of manslaughter of both his wife and the other man.\nD. not guilty of manslaughter of either his wife or the other man.\n"

If Howard was responsible for causing the death of both his wife and the other man, he would be guilty of two separate homicides, which are considered first-degree murders under most jurisdictions. However, since the charges against him were originally for attempted murder, it appears that the prosecution may have been attempting to bring forward additional charges based on the circumstances of the incident. In this case, however, the evidence does not support such an interpretation. Therefore, if Howard is ultimately convicted of any crimes at all, he will likely face charges for the deaths of his wife and the other man, making option C the correct answer."
