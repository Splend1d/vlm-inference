A higher-order central place function refers to a location where customers typically spend a significant amount of time, such as a mall or a shopping center. The other options listed do not fit this definition because they are either locations that sell products (grocery stores and shoe stores) or businesses that provide services (mercedes-benz dealership). A family doctor, on the other hand, is a healthcare provider who provides primary care for patients, which involves spending a significant amount of time with each patient. Therefore, a family doctor would be considered a higher-order central place function."
