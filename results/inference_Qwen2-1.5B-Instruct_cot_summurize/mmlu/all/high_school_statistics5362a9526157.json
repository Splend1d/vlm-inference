She selects a random sample of students and collects information about their family income. A 95 percent confidence interval computed from this data for the mean income per family is ($35,095, $45,005). Which of the following provides the best interpretation of this confidence interval?\n\nA. 95 percent of the students in her school are from families whose income is between $35,095 and $45,005.\nB. There is a 95% probability that the families of all the students in this school have an income of between $35,095 and $45,005.\nC. If we were to take another sample of the same size and compute a 95 percent confidence interval, we would have a 95% chance of getting the interval ($35,095, $45,005).\nD. There is a 95% probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.\n"

There is a 95% probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.\n\nA 95 percent confidence interval means that if we were to take multiple samples of the same size and calculate a confidence interval each time, there is a 95% probability that the true value of the population parameter (in this case, the mean income per family) will fall within the range of the confidence interval calculated from those samples. In other words, it's a measure of how confident we can be that our estimate of the population parameter is accurate.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that there is a 95% probability that the income distribution of all students is between $35,095 and $45,005, which is not necessarily true. The confidence interval represents the variability around the estimated mean, not the entire population distribution.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because it suggests that if we took another sample with the same size, we would have a 95% chance of getting the same confidence interval. Confidence intervals are based on sample statistics, so they do not depend on the sample size or the number of samples taken.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation of the given 95 percent confidence interval is that it represents the variability around the estimated mean income per family among the selected sample of students, not any claim about the proportion of students who belong to families with incomes between certain ranges."
