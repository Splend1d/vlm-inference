Sensory adaptation refers to the process by which our senses become less sensitive over time due to repeated exposure to stimuli. In this case, walking into an anatomy lab repeatedly would not cause the sensory system to adapt in any way.\n\nOption A: Putting on a shirt and feeling the fabric on your back is an example of sensory adaptation because your body becomes accustomed to the texture of the material after wearing it for a while.\n\nOption B: Walking into a crowded room and being distracted by the conversation is also an example of sensory adaptation, as your brain learns to ignore the distractions over time.\n\nOption C: Walking outside on a sunny day and being blinded by the brightness of the light is an example of sensory adaptation because your eyes become used to the bright environment after experiencing it frequently.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
