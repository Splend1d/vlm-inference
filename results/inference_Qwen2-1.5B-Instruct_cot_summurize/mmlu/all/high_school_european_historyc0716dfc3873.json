And as each machine will do as much work in twelve hours, as ten men can in that time do by hand, \u2026 [And, as the machines do] as much work in one day as would otherwise employ twenty men, \u2026 [a] full four thousand men are left to shift for a living how they can, and must of course fall to the Parish, if not timely relieved. \u2026 How are those men, thus thrown out of employ to provide for their families; and what are they to put their children apprentice to, that the rising generation may have something to keep them at work, in order that they may not be like vagabonds strolling about in idleness? \u2026 Many more evils we could enumerate, but we would hope, that the sensible part of mankind, who are not biased by interest, must see the dreadful tendency of their continuance; a depopulation must be the consequence; trade being then lost, the landed interest will have no other satisfaction but that of being last devoured.\nLeeds Woolen Workers Petition, 1786\nThis document can be used as evidence for\n\nA. the spread of revolutionary ideas among the British working class in the eighteenth century\nB. the rise of the Luddite movement in Britain in the eighteenth century\nC. the replacing of traditional laborers by machines in the industrialization of Britain in the eighteenth century\nD. an increase in the use of child labor in eighteenth-century Britain\n"

The petition describes the displacement of workers due to the introduction of new technologies, such as the \"scribbling-machines\" which replaced traditional weaving methods. Therefore, this document can be used as evidence for the replacing of traditional laborers by machines in the industrialization of Britain in the eighteenth century."
