Therefore, the total charge \\(Q\\) on both balls remains constant.\n\nApplying Coulomb's law with the correct values for \\(m\\) and \\(2m\\), we get:\n\\[ F_{new} = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{9}}{(m)(2m)^2} = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{9}}{4m^2} \\approx \\frac{9 \\times 10^{9}}{4} = 22.5 \\times 10^6 \\, N = 2.25 \\times 10^7 \\, N \\]\n\nTherefore, the new electric force between the balls is \\(2.25 \\times 10^7 \\, N\\), which corresponds to option C."
