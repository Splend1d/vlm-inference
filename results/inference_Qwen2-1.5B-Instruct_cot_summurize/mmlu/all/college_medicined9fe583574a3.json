A diversified and developed economy.\n\nSemi-periphery countries are characterized by a combination of economic activities that span across different sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services. They have a diversified economy that is not heavily reliant on a single natural resource or sector. This allows them to develop their economies in various ways and diversify their income sources. Therefore, option C (a diversified and developed economy) is most closely associated with semi-periphery countries."
