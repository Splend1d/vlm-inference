Agglomeration costs refer to the cost of establishing and maintaining a large-scale manufacturing or service facility within a particular location due to its proximity to other firms with similar operations. These costs include factors such as transportation costs, labor costs, and regulatory burdens associated with operating in a highly concentrated area. Therefore, agglomeration costs are seen as the primary determinant of where industries should locate to minimize overall costs and maximize efficiency."
