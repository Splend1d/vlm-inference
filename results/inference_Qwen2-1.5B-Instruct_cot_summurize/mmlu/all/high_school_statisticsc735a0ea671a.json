                    "text": "To find the mean setting that minimizes the probability of an overflow occurring more than once per 100 uses, we need to calculate the Z-score (which is the number of standard deviations from the mean).\n\nThe formula for calculating Z-scores is:\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{\\text{Observed Value} - \\text{Mean}}{\\text{Standard Deviation}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the observed value is the average amount of soda consumed by one user over 100 uses, and the mean is the target mean setting you're aiming for, which is 12 ounces. The standard deviation is given as 0.3 ounces.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ Z = \\frac{12 - 12}{0.3} = 0 \\]\n\nThis means that the average consumption per use is exactly 12 ounces, which is not optimal because it guarantees an overflow less than 1% of the time.\n\nNow, let's adjust the mean slightly to minimize the probability of an overflow happening more than once per 100 uses. To do this, we'll increase the mean slightly but still within the range where the probability of an overflow is less than 1%. We want to find the minimum value of \\( x \\) such that the probability of an overflow occurring more than once per 100 uses is less than 1%.\n\nLet's denote the new mean as \\( x \\). The probability of an overflow occurring more than once per 100 uses can be represented by the cumulative area under the standard normal curve between \\( z=0 \\) and \\( z=x \\), divided by 100. Since the total area under the standard normal curve is 1 (or equivalently, 100%), we have:\n\n\\[ P(Z < x) = \\frac{P(Z < x)}{100} = 1 - \\frac{P(Z > x)}{100} \\]\n\nWe know that the probability of an overflow occurring more than once per 100 uses is at least 1%, or 0.01. Therefore,\n\n\\[ P(Z > x) = 0.01 \\]\n\nSince \\( P(Z < x) \\) represents the area under the standard normal curve from \\( z=0 \\) to \\( z=x \\), we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 1 - P(Z > x) = 1 - \\frac{P(Z > x)}{100} \\]\n\\[ 1 - 0.01 = 1 - \\frac{0.01}{100} \\]\n\\[ 0.99 = 0.01 - \\frac{0.01}{100} \\]\n\\[ 0.99 = 0.01 - 0.0001 \\]\n\\[ 0.989 = 0.001 \\]\n\\[ x = 0.99 \\]\n\nTherefore, the mean setting should be 12 + 0.99 = 12.99 ounces to ensure that the probability of an overflow occurring more than once per 100 uses is less than 1%. This corresponds to option D."
