He contacted an architect, who designed plans and specifications for a major \"facelift\" of the homeowner's home. The homeowner was very pleased with the plans and specifications. He showed the plans and specifications to his neighbor, who agreed that the facelift would greatly enhance the value of the homeowner's home. The homeowner contacted a contractor, who was considered to be the best in the area, to rebuild his house according to the plans and specifications. The contractor reviewed the plans and specifications and told the homeowner that he could do all the work called for by the plans and specifications for $100,000. The homeowner replied, \"That's a little more than I can afford. I really can only free up $80,000 for this project. Would you do it for that amount?\" The contractor responded, \"That's awfully low. I'll have to think about it,\" and then left. The next day, the neighbor telephoned the contractor. The neighbor explained to the contractor that he realized the value of his home would be enhanced by the improvement done to the homeowner's property. For that reason, the neighbor told the contractor he would pay him $10,000 if he would accept the homeowner's proposal and do the work called for by the plans and specifications. The contractor agreed. The next day the contractor informed the homeowner that he would accept his $80,000 offer. The contractor did all the work called for by the plans and specifications, and collected the $80,000 due him from the homeowner. However, the neighbor refused to pay the contractor the $10,000. If the contractor brings a breach of contract action against the neighbor, judgment for whom?\n\nA. The contractor, because his signing a contract with the homeowner and completing the work according to the plans and specifications was legally sufficient consideration to support the neighbor's promise to pay him the $10,000.\nB. The contractor, provided the neighbor realizes an increase in his property value as a result of the work done by the contractor.\nC. The neighbor, because his promise to the contractor was illusory.\nD. The neighbor, because at the moment the contractor accepted the homeowner's offer, he came under a pre-existing obligation, which was insufficient consideration to support the neighbor's promise.\n"

The neighbor, because at the moment the contractor accepted the homeowner's offer, he came under a pre-existing obligation, which was insufficient consideration to support the neighbor's promise.\n\nWhen the contractor accepted the homeowner's offer to pay $80,000 for the work to be done on the homeowner's property, he was bound by that agreement. This acceptance constituted a new consideration for the contractor to fulfill his promise to complete the work according to the plans and specifications.\n\nHowever, the neighbor's promise to pay $10,000 was not legally binding until the contractor completed the work and received payment. At that point, the contractor had already fulfilled the terms of the original contract with the homeowner. Therefore, the neighbor's promise to pay the $10,000 was not sufficient consideration for the contractor to fulfill his promise.\n\nIn summary, the contractor is entitled to judgment against the neighbor, even though the neighbor made a promise to pay the $10,000. The contractor's acceptance of the homeowner's offer constitutes a new consideration for the contractor to fulfill his promise, while the neighbor's promise was insufficiently considered as it related to the completion of the work."
