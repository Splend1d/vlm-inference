Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.\n\nThis approach challenges traditional security paradigms by emphasizing the interconnectedness of natural systems and the need to protect them as a whole rather than just their individual components. This can lead to questions about the sovereignty of nations or the role of international institutions in protecting the environment.\n\nB. Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.\n\nThis view sees the protection of the environment as primarily an issue of economic development or personal health, rather than a matter of collective well-being. It may also overlook the potential negative impacts of environmental policies on certain groups or regions.\n\nC. The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.\n\nThis argument suggests that environmental security is too narrowly defined to have a significant impact on broader security concerns, such as terrorism or conflict. It also highlights the complexity of managing environmental issues across different countries and regions.\n\nD. The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. Ecological security displays continuity with major interpretations of security, which typically centralizes the security of the state.\n\nThese views suggest that environmental security is often viewed within the context of other security concerns, such as national defense or economic stability. While it does not directly challenge the traditional focus on state sovereignty and territorial integrity, it still raises important questions about how to balance economic development with environmental protection."
