In this context, the two options you provided - A. killing them by sending poisoned food, and B. refusing to give them the money they need to purchase food - both involve taking someone's life through violence or economic deprivation.\n\nOption C. withholding medicine that they need to survive, while also involving some form of deprivation, does not directly lead to death. However, it still involves denying someone their basic needs and therefore raises ethical concerns about the extent to which individuals have a right to access essential resources.\n\nOption D. depriving them of knowledge they need to produce food, while potentially leading to starvation if they cannot produce enough food themselves, does not necessarily involve taking someone's life but could contribute to their suffering and deprivation.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to the question of whether the killing/letting die distinction is morally relevant would depend on the specific circumstances and the intention behind the actions involved. It is important to consider all aspects of a situation when determining whether an action violates moral principles."
