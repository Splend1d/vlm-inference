It involves countries seeking to secure their own energy supplies and influence others, leading to tensions and competition among major powers. This can result in geopolitical rivalries and the emergence of new alliances or blocs. Additionally, attempts to exert control over energy reserves can have significant implications for the sustainability of cooperation between core powers and the potential for international security."
