One of his teachings was that the desire for one's loved ones to live forever is not a natural instinct or sign of genuine love. Instead, it is often driven by fear and insecurity, which can lead to obsession and irrational behavior. Therefore, he advised individuals to focus on living in the present moment and cultivating virtues such as wisdom, courage, and justice."
