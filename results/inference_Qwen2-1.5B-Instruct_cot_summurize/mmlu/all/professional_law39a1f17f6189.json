The owner told the woman that he was sorry but it was his policy not to cash Social Security checks. Terribly upset, the woman reached into her pocketbook and said, \"Listen, buddy, I've got a bomb in here, and if you don't give me the money, I'm going to blow up this joint. \" Actually, the woman did not have a bomb in her possession. The owner, who was not deceived by her threat, felt sorry for the woman and agreed to cash the check. The woman, who walked with the assistance of a cane, took the money and limped out of the store. After she left, the owner noticed that the woman had not endorsed the check. The woman has committed which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. No crime.\nB. Robbery.\nC. Attempted robbery.\nD. False pretenses.\n"

Attempted robbery.\n\nThe woman attempted to rob the convenience store by threatening to blow up the store if they didn't comply with her demand for the cash from her Social Security check. She then proceeded to take the money after the owner complied with her demands, indicating that she was successful in carrying out her plan. Additionally, the fact that she had a bomb in her pocket suggests that she may have been planning to use the check as part of her scheme to commit an act of terrorism. Therefore, the woman's actions can be considered an attempt at committing a robbery."
