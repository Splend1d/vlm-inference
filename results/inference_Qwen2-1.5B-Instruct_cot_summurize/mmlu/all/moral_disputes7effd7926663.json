It's important to challenge our own assumptions and biases, as well as those of others. And while we may never truly know everything, it's important to engage with information and evidence, rather than simply accepting whatever someone says without question. This can lead to more informed decision-making and understanding of complex issues. So while it's understandable to have strong feelings about certain topics, it's also important to consider alternative perspectives and arguments."
