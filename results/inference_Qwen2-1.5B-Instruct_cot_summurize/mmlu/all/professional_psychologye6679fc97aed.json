The criterion variable was unreliable.\n\nCross-validation of a set of predictors can lead to great shrinkage of initial encouraging multiple correlation coefficients if the criterion variable is unreliable. This means that the model's performance on unseen data (i.e., the cross-validation) is worse than its performance on the training data (i.e., the original dataset). In other words, the model is not generalizing well to new data and may be overfitting the training data. This suggests that the criterion variable may not be a good predictor of the outcome variable, or that there may be other factors influencing the outcome that are not captured by the current model."
