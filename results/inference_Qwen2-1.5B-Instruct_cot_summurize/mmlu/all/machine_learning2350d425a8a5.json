While it's true that some models have achieved accuracy over 98% on the CIFAR-10 dataset as of 2020, there are many other models and techniques that can achieve higher accuracy. For example, in recent years, models such as DARTS (Deep Residuals with Swish) and ResNet50 have been shown to outperform ResNets in terms of accuracy.\n\nStatement 2 is true. The original ResNets were not optimized with the Adam optimizer. In fact, the Adam optimizer was introduced much later than the ResNets, which were developed before Adam was even created. Therefore, statement 2 is correct."
