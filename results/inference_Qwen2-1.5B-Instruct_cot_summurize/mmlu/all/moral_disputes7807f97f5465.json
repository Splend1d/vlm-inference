Cloning does not necessarily produce harmful biological mutations as clones produce further clones, which means that there would be no genetic mutations passed on to future generations. This is different from natural reproduction where genetic mutations can occur over time through inheritance. Therefore, option C is not an objection that Kass makes against cloning."
