Market equilibrium quantity rises as firms exit the industry.\n\nIn the long run, if the market price is below the minimum average total cost (ATC), it indicates that the industry is not operating efficiently and there are resources available to be used more effectively elsewhere. As a result, some firms may decide to exit the industry by reducing their production levels or even shutting down altogether. This can lead to an increase in supply, resulting in a rise in the market equilibrium quantity. However, this does not necessarily mean that the price will fall; it could still remain at the current level or even rise due to other factors such as changes in demand or competition within the industry."
