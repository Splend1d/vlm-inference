This diversity displays the unsearchable depth of the divine judgment, and is without doubt subordinate to God's purpose of eternal election. But if it is plainly owing to the mere pleasure of God that salvation is spontaneously offered to some, while others have no access to it, great and difficult questions immediately arise, questions which are inexplicable, when just views are not entertained concerning election and predestination[,] . . . the grace of God being illustrated by the contrast, viz., that he does not adopt all promiscuously to the hope of salvation, but gives to some what he denies to others.\n\u2014John Calvin, from The Institutes of Christian Religion, Book 3: Chapter 21, 1545\nWhich of the following is the biggest contrast between the ideas of Calvinists when compared to their fellow Protestant Lutherans?\n\nA. Calvinists believed that the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization.\nB. Calvinists believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation.\nC. Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.\nD. Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all of the seven sacraments while the Calvinists chose to honor only two of them.\n"

Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nLutherans, like Calvinists, believe in justification by faith alone and sola fide (faith alone) as central to their theology. However, Lutherans also emphasized the importance of church reform and the authority of the Bible over the Pope and other church authorities. They believed that the Reformation was necessary to restore the true doctrine of Christianity and to bring back the original teachings of Jesus Christ to the Church. On the other hand, Calvinists, especially after John Calvin's time, emphasized the sovereignty of God and the role of the Bible in defining Christian doctrine. They rejected many of the practices and beliefs of the Catholic Church, including the papacy, the sale of indulgences, and the sale of indulgences. Therefore, Lutherans' use of the Reformed Faith to break away from the influence of the Catholic Church and establish their own churches was seen as an attempt to break free from the domination of the Holy Roman Empire and the pope. This is not the case for Calvinists who, unlike Lutherans, did not emphasize the need for political change or the overthrow of existing institutions."
