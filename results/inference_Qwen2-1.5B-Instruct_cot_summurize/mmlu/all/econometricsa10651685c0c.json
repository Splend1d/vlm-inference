Parameter estimates may be biased.\n\nUsing non-stationary data in levels form means that the data values change over time, which can lead to bias in parameter estimates. This is because the model assumes that the data are stationary and consistent over time, but this assumption may not hold when the data are non-stationary. As a result, the estimated parameters may not accurately reflect the true relationship between the independent and dependent variables."
