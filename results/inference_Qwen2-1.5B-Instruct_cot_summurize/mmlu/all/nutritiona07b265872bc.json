May be associated with constipation\n\nIBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) is a condition that affects the digestive system and can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea or constipation, bloating, gas, nausea, and fatigue. While IBS may not always resolve with a gluten-free diet, it is important for individuals with IBS to avoid foods that trigger their symptoms, such as dairy products, beans, and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cabbage. Additionally, some people with IBS may benefit from a low-fiber diet, which can help reduce symptoms of constipation. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider before making any significant changes to your diet."
