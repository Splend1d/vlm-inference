They are known for their distinctive shape when observed under an electron microscope, which resembles a star or a cluster of points. This observation led to the name \"astrovirus\" being coined by scientists who first described these viruses in 1974.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the superficial appearance of an astrovirus may be visually striking, it does not directly contribute to its classification as a member of the astrovirus family. The family name is based on the fact that these viruses have a unique morphology and can cause diseases similar to those caused by other astroviruses, such as gastroenteritis and enteroviral infections."
