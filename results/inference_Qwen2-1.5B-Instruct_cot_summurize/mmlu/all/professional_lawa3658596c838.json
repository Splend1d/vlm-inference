The informant gave a detailed description of the two men and the license number of the vehicle. A patrol car was immediately dispatched to the movie theater. A few minutes later, the police saw a car matching the description given parked about two blocks from the movie theater. When the police approached, they saw one man fitting the description provided. The police proceeded to the car and opened the doors of the vehicle. The police then pried open a locked tool case that was situated in the rear of the vehicle. Inside, the police found an envelope that contained about one gram of cocaine. They then placed the driver of the vehicle under arrest. Immediately thereafter, the police opened the glove compartment and found a small amount of marijuana. The driver of the van was subsequently prosecuted and charged with two counts of possession of controlled dangerous substances. He filed a motion to exclude the cocaine and marijuana from evidence. His motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, as to the cocaine only.\nB. granted, as to the marijuana only.\nC. granted, as to both the cocaine and the marijuana.\nD. denied, as to the cocaine and the marijuana.\n"

In this case, the police have already established probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed the crime. Therefore, any items obtained during the search, including the cocaine and marijuana, are admissible as evidence against the defendant.\n\nIt's important to note that the exclusionary rule does not apply retroactively, meaning that if the evidence was obtained illegally, it cannot be used against the defendant. However, in this situation, the evidence was obtained legally, so it cannot be excluded on the basis of its illegality."
