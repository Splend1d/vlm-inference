Higher disposable income, higher consumption, higher real GDP, and lower unemployment.\n\nThis is because lowering personal income taxes generally leads to increased disposable income for individuals, which in turn increases their spending power. This can lead to higher levels of consumption, which would increase total demand (real GDP) and potentially lead to lower unemployment rates if there is enough demand for goods and services. However, it's important to note that these effects may vary depending on other factors such as changes in consumer confidence and expectations, business investment decisions, and government policies related to taxation, regulation, and infrastructure development."
