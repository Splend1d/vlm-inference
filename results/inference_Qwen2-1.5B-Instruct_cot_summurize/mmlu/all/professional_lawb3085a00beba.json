The defendant, who did not challenge the legality of the airport search, was subsequently prosecuted for possession of heroin. At trial, the defendant testified on his own behalf and said that the suitcase belonged to his girlfriend who was accompanying the defendant when he was arrested. The girlfriend died in a skydiving accident two weeks before the defendant's trial. Moreover, the defendant testified that although he was a former heroin addict, he had not used any heroin in the past three years. On cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney asked the defendant to roll up the sleeves of his shirt and exhibit his arms to see if there were any needle marks. This request is\n\nA. objectionable, because the defendant has a privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. objectionable, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nC. permissible, because such evidence is relevant to the defendant's credibility.\nD. permissible, because the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination by taking the stand.\n"

However, the question about the defendant's arms is irrelevant to the case and should have been objected to under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which allows for the exclusion of irrelevant evidence to avoid unfairly prejudicing the jury. The prosecution may still introduce other evidence to prove the defendant's guilt or innocence."
