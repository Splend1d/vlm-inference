The height and size of its monumental architecture: The IVC had impressive structures such as the Harappa and Mohenjodaro cities, which were larger than any other ancient city in the world at their time.\n\n2. Urban Planning: The IVC developed sophisticated urban planning with well-planned streets, drainage systems, and sewage disposal facilities. This level of urban organization was not seen elsewhere until much later in history.\n\n3. The degree of urban planning: The IVC had well-defined areas for residential, commercial, religious, and public spaces. This level of urban organization was not seen elsewhere until much later in history.\n\n4. Storage of surplus wheat: The IVC produced large quantities of surplus wheat, which was stored in granaries or granary-like structures. This level of surplus grain production and storage was not seen elsewhere until much later in history.\n\nTherefore, options A, C, and D are correct answers. Option B is incorrect because the Indus Valley Civilization did not experience significant levels of violence compared to other civilizations."
