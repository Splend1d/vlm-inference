                    "text": "The correct answer is D: relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.\n\nWhen we perform short bursts of exercise, our muscles rely more heavily on aerobic metabolism (the process of using oxygen to generate energy) as opposed to anaerobic metabolism (the process of generating energy without oxygen). As we increase the intensity and duration of these sprints, our body adapts by increasing the efficiency of aerobic metabolism in order to meet the increased demand for energy.\n\nIn terms of pH levels, the muscle can compensate for changes in pH during exercise through its ability to adjust its internal pH balance. However, if the pH drops too low or too high, it can lead to negative effects such as muscle fatigue or injury.\n\nRegarding blood glucose levels, they should be maintained within a normal range during moderate-intensity exercise, but may drop slightly during longer-duration, high-intensity exercises due to the breakdown of glycogen stored in the liver and muscles. However, this does not necessarily fall below 3 mmol/L, which would indicate that there has been a significant decrease in blood glucose levels.\n\nOverall, the key factors influencing the adaptation of muscle performance during sprint training include the intensity and duration of the workouts, the quality of the workout (e.g., rest between sets, use of proper form), and the individual's overall fitness level. The specific adaptations that occur will depend on each individual's unique physiology and training history."
