Therefore, Magic Memory can provide the functionality of an atomic Test-and-Set. \n\nIt can also be used to coordinate processes running on a shared-memory multiprocessor by providing a way to synchronize access to the memory. However, this is not specifically mentioned as one of the properties of Magic Memory."
