The main reason this can happen is because:\n\n\nA. Foods containing large amounts of vitamin D are eaten by both poor and wealthy people according to various cultural reasons.\nB. The content of vitamin D in foods depends on the soil in which the food was grown so is not related to wealth or age.\nC. Most vitamin D in the body does not come from food so access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status.\nD. Diets containing sufficient other nutrients to promote growth can increase the requirement of vitamin D so that it becomes limiting.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Diets containing sufficient other nutrients to promote growth can increase the requirement of vitamin D so that it becomes limiting.\n\nThis statement is supported by scientific research that shows that diets high in certain nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus can lead to increased requirements for vitamin D. This is because these nutrients compete with vitamin D for absorption in the intestines, leading to lower levels of vitamin D being produced in the liver. As a result, people with diets high in these nutrients may need higher doses of vitamin D supplements to maintain adequate levels.\n\nTherefore, the lack of vitamin D in a person's diet is more likely due to their diet lacking in nutrients like calcium and phosphorus rather than simply because they are poorly nourished. This means that factors such as poverty, age, and lifestyle choices do not play as significant a role in vitamin D deficiency as previously thought."
