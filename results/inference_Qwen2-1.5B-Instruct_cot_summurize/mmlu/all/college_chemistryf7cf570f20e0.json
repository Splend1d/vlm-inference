The total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases.\n\nSpontaneous processes, also known as\u81ea\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b, refer to processes that occur without external input or energy, and they tend to increase the disorder or randomness in the universe. A spontaneous process is characterized by the following properties:\n\n1. **No external input:** Spontaneous processes do not require an external source of energy for their occurrence. They can occur naturally through various means like friction, temperature differences, or chemical reactions without needing an external agent.\n\n2. **Decrease in disorder:** A spontaneous process tends to make the universe more disordered over time. This is because it involves interactions between particles, which often lead to collisions and rearrangements, increasing the overall number of possible arrangements for the particles involved.\n\n3. **Increasing entropy:** In a spontaneous process, the entropy (a measure of the disorder) of the system generally increases. Entropy is related to the probability of finding the system in its current state. As a process proceeds, the probability distribution changes, leading to increased entropy. For example, when a gas expands, the molecules move faster and farther apart, making the gas more disorganized than before.\n\n4. **Contribution to global warming:** Spontaneous processes contribute to global warming and climate change by releasing heat from the Earth's surface into space. This leads to an increase in the greenhouse effect, trapping more heat in the atmosphere, causing the Earth's average temperature to rise.\n\nIn summary, a spontaneous process satisfies all the criteria mentioned: it occurs without external input, decreases in disorder, increases entropy, and contributes to global warming. Therefore, option D is correct."
