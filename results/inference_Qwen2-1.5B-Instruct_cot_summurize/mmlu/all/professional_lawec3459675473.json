The man moved a giant magnolia tree from another section of his property and had it replanted on his property at a spot just 10 feet from the woman's property. At that time, the woman protested that by locating the tree so close to her land, the man was increasing the risk of injury to the woman's greenhouse, in which the woman cultivated prizewinning flowers. Hurricanes are quite common in the area. Severalyears after the replanting of the tree, in the midst ofa hurricane, the tree fell on the woman's greenhouse,destroying rare and valuable plants valued at$25,000. The woman asserted a claim against the man to recover damages for the harm caused by the tree falling on the greenhouse. During trial, the only evidence the woman presented was that the hurricane uprooted the tree, causing it to fall onto her property, and thereby resulting in the damage as claimed. At the end of the woman's case, the man moved for a directed verdict. The man's motion will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the woman did not produce any evidence to show that the man was negligent.\nB. granted, because the woman's damages resulted from an act of God.\nC. denied, because hurricanes were common in the area.\nD. denied, because the trier of fact may still infer liability for trespass.\n"

This is considered an act of God, as natural disasters like hurricanes are beyond the control of human beings and are therefore considered unforeseeable events.\n\nTherefore, the man's motion for a directed verdict should be granted if the woman does not produce any evidence to show that the man was negligent or that the tree was damaged due to human negligence.\n\nOption A is incorrect because negligence must be proven by the plaintiff in order for the defendant to be held liable.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because hurricanes can be predictable based on historical data, and the woman has provided evidence that the hurricane caused the tree to fall.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while it is possible for a court to infer liability for trespass, this would typically happen when there is direct evidence linking the defendant to the conduct that caused harm. In this case, the woman's only evidence is that the hurricane uprooted the tree, which does not establish a direct link between the man and the tree's fall."
