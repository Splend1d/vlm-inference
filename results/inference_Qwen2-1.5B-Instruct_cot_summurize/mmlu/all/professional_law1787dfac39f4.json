The defendant pulled a large serrated hunting knife and stabbed the victim in the chest, killing him. The authorities charged defendant with murder. The defendant argued at trial that he only intended to scare the victim to shut him up, and that he did not have the intent to kill. Is the defendant guilty of murder?\n\nA. Yes, his use of a deadly weapon demonstrated the requisite intent to kill.\nB. No, defendant responded to the victim's provocation and did not intend to kill.\nC. No, he acted on the spur of the moment and could not have formed the requisite intent.\nD. No, his behavior was reckless but not intentional.\n"

In this case, the defendant used a deadly weapon (a large serrated hunting knife) and intended to cause serious bodily harm or death to the victim. The fact that he did not intend to kill the victim demonstrates that he had the necessary intent to commit murder. However, it does not absolve him of all responsibility for his actions since he still committed a crime that resulted in the death of another person."
