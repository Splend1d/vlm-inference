All of the above.\n\nThe extinction of many animal species could lead to a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services that are essential for human survival. This could result in negative impacts on agriculture, water quality, and human health. For example, the loss of pollinators such as bees and butterflies could lead to declines in crop yields and reduce food security. The decline of certain plant species could also impact soil health and nutrient cycling. Additionally, the loss of keystone species such as predators or grazers can have cascading effects throughout an ecosystem. Therefore, it is important to take steps to protect biodiversity and mitigate the potential negative impacts of these extinctions."
