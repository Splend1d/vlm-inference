Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to carnitine, which is an amino acid that acts as a carrier for fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix. This process is known as carnitination and helps to shuttle fatty acids from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix where they can be oxidized in the electron transport chain."
