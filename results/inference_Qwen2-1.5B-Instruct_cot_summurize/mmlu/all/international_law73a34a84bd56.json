The courts exercise discretion as to the enforcement of foreign judgments on the basis of the rule of comity, which means that they consider the principles of justice, equity, and good conscience in deciding whether to enforce a judgment from another country.\n\nThis principle of comity has been recognized by many international legal systems, including the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments (also known as the New York Convention), which sets out the rules for recognizing and enforcing foreign judgments.\n\nIn summary, while there may be some overlap between the rules governing the recognition of foreign judgments and the incorporation and transformation of treaties, the key distinction is that the former involves a discretionary decision based on the principles of comity, whereas the latter involves an obligation to recognize and enforce treaty provisions."
