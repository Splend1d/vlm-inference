The woman conveyed the land to a friend \"for life,\" and when the friend died the land was to go to the woman's neighbor \"and her heirs.\" The neighbor died and in her duly probated will devised her entire estate to a local charity. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. Who has what interest in the land?\n\nA. The friend has a fee simple absolute, because his life estate merged with the remainder conveyed to him by the daughter.\nB. The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.\nC. The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.\nD. The friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion, because the neighbor's remainder was void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.\n"

The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.\n\nUnder the Rule Against Perpetuities, if a devisee dies before the devisee's heir (in this case, the neighbor), then the remainder of the devisee's interest must vest in someone else who can survive until the end of the perpetuity period. In this case, the neighbor's interest was devisable, meaning it could be transferred to someone else during the life of the devisee (the neighbor). Therefore, the friend, who inherited the neighbor's interest upon the neighbor's death, has a life estate in the land. Additionally, the neighbor's remaining interest, which was not devisable, became vested in the charity upon the neighbor's death.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
