Increasing, as lower interest rates tend to increase the value of the dollar, making imports cheaper and exports more attractive.\n\nIn this scenario, lower interest rates would make borrowing money cheaper for both consumers and businesses, leading to an increase in consumer spending and business investment. This could result in higher demand for imported goods, driving up their prices relative to domestic products, and potentially increasing the value of the dollar against other currencies, including those used to trade with foreign countries. However, it's important to note that the relationship between interest rates, currency values, and exports can be complex and may vary depending on various factors such as inflation, economic growth, and global market conditions."
