As an aid to weaning patients from a ventilator.\n\nA tracheostomy is typically performed when a patient's breathing becomes too difficult or dangerous, such as when they have severe lung disease, respiratory failure, or if the patient has been intubated for an extended period of time. The purpose of a tracheostomy is to provide temporary access to the airway while the patient undergoes treatment or recovery. This allows for better control and management of the patient's oxygen levels and can help prevent complications such as aspiration."
