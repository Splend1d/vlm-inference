Following the expansion of peace studies in the decline of the Cold War, the field has emerged as an independent and autonomous area of study that addresses issues surrounding conflict resolution, economic security and the cessation of violence at both an international and sub-national level. As a field of research, peace studies are best defined by their distinction from development studies and international relations.\nB. Peace studies are best defined by its research agenda that focuses on the search for non-violent measures by which to end conflict. Peace researchers adopt a 'top-down' approach to conflict resolution that prioritises the issues surrounding violence and the use of force, focusing on instigating agents in an attempt to secure that actor as the referent object to security.\nC. Peace studies cannot be defined as a specific academic approach due to the shifting nature of its research agenda and the diversity of interests addressed by peace researchers. However, following the Cold War the success of the field has been such that it boasts a number of research institutes and attracts global and interdisciplinary attention.\nD. Peace studies is defined by a concern with the underlying causes of phenomena in IR, a global outlook, an interdisciplinary approach, the search for non-violent transformations, an analytical and normative approach, and the adoption of multi-level analysis that links theory and practice within research.\n"

Peace studies is defined by a concern with the underlying causes of phenomena in IR, a global outlook, an interdisciplinary approach, the search for non-violent transformations, an analytical and normative approach, and the adoption of multi-level analysis that links theory and practice within research.\n\nPeace studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that seeks to understand and address the root causes of conflicts around the world. It draws on theories and methodologies from various fields including political science, sociology, psychology, economics, and anthropology. The goal of peace studies is not just to find peaceful solutions to conflicts but also to explore why conflicts occur in the first place and what might be done to prevent them in the future. \n\nWhile some peace researchers may focus specifically on the use of non-violent means to resolve conflicts, others may instead prioritize the issue of violence and the role of violent actors in conflict. Some peace studies may adopt a top-down approach to conflict resolution, while others may emphasize bottom-up approaches that involve local communities and organizations in efforts to build peace. Additionally, peace studies often involves a commitment to normative principles, such as the idea that resolving conflicts through dialogue and cooperation is preferable to resorting to violence or repression. \n\nOverall, peace studies is a dynamic and evolving field that continues to evolve and adapt as new research questions arise and new insights into the complex dynamics of conflict emerge."
