So,\n\\[(\\frac{x-\\sqrt{14}}{7})(2) + (\\frac{y-\\sqrt{14}}{7})(1) + (\\frac{z-\\sqrt{14}}{7})(3) = 0\\]\nSimplifying gives us:\n\\[2(x-\\sqrt{14}) + y + 3(z-\\sqrt{14}) = 0\\]\n\\[2x - 2\\sqrt{14} + y + 3z - 3\\sqrt{14} = 0\\]\n\\[2x + y + 3z = 3\\sqrt{14}\\]\n\nSince we already have the equation of the plane in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), it suffices to find the value of \\(z\\) that satisfies this new equation. However, since we're asked for the point closest to the origin, we don't need to solve for \\(z\\) explicitly; instead, we recognize that any point on the plane will satisfy this equation, and thus all points will be equally close to the origin.\n\nTherefore, the point on the plane with the minimum distance from the origin is the same as the point itself, because all points lie on the same line passing through the origin and parallel to the plane. The answer is not one of the provided options, but rather the entire set of solutions to the equation of the plane. Therefore, none of the given options A, B, C, or D are correct. Instead, the correct choice would be to select \"All points on the plane\" as the coordinate system representing the point on the plane closest to the origin."
