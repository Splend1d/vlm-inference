Acromegaly is a condition in which the growth hormone (GH) levels are too high, leading to excessive bone growth and a protruding jaw. This can cause a \"dished face\" appearance. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it describes a recessive maxilla, which refers to a flat or low-arched palate that results from a failure of the cranial base to develop properly.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because it describes an enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephaly, but this term typically refers to an enlarged forehead rather than a protruding jaw.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it describes defective development of the maxillary air sinus, which is related to nasal breathing issues rather than facial structure."
