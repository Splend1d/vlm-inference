These symptoms can be a manifestation of unconscious impulses or defenses that have been compromised by the development of cognitive functions. Symptoms can take many forms, including physical illness, psychological distress, and behavioral patterns that are not typical of one's age or social status.\n\nRepression refers to the unconscious process of suppressing thoughts, feelings, or memories that are deemed too painful or threatening for the conscious mind to handle. Regression refers to the tendency of individuals to revert to earlier stages of development when faced with overwhelming stress or trauma.\n\nFixation refers to the phenomenon where an individual becomes overly fixated on a particular object or idea, often to the point of neglecting other aspects of their life or relationships. This can lead to maladaptive behavior such as obsession, compulsion, or neurosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. symptom."
