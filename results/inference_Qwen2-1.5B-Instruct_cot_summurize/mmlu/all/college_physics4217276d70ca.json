The Planck's law equation relates the intensity of a blackbody radiation field to its frequency and temperature:\n\nI = A * \u03c3 T^4\n\nwhere I is the intensity, A is the area of the emitting surface, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature.\n\nFor a blackbody at a given temperature, the maximum intensity occurs when the frequency matches the Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength \u03bbmax for a blackbody at a fixed temperature is related to the temperature by:\n\n\u03bbmax = (2R)^(-1/4) * (T/(k))^(1/4)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant, k is Boltzmann's constant, and we take the limit as R \u2192 \u221e.\n\nAt a temperature of 300 K, \u03bbmax \u2248 100 pm (picometers). Therefore, the correct answer is B. 100 Pm."
