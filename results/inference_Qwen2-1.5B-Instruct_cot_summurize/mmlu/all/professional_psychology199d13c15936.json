However, it does not support the idea that high temperatures increase aggression, nor does it suggest that feelings of anonymity lead to more uncharacteristic violence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be B: high temperature leads to more aggression. Research has shown that high temperatures can increase aggression and impulsivity, which may contribute to violent behavior."
