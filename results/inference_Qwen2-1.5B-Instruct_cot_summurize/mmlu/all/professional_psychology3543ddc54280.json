Job analysis helps in identifying the necessary skills and knowledge required to perform a specific job, which can be useful in ensuring that employees have the proper training and qualifications before they start working. However, establishing safety standards typically involves other factors such as regulatory compliance, industry best practices, and employee training programs."
