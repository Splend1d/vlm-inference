This behavior goes against the principle of respecting others' belongings and can be considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves disposing of waste in an environmentally harmful way, specifically by discarding sexually explicit objects in a landfill. This action not only contributes to pollution but also violates societal norms around responsible disposal of waste. Therefore, this scenario is also considered morally wrong."
