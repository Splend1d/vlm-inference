The mortgage was promptly recorded. The next year, the father died intestate. The father's heirs were the son and his two sisters. The sisters first learned of the mortgage just after their father died. The sisters now assert that the son, their brother, holds the mortgage for their benefit as well as for himself because as a tenant in common with his sisters, he has a fiduciary duty toward them. There are no applicable statutes. Are the sisters correct?\n\nA. No, because the mortgage was granted before the tenancy in common was created.\nB. No, because the three siblings took the farm as tenants in common rather than as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\nC. Yes, because a fiduciary relationship exists among tenants in common.\nD. Yes, because their three interests are equal.\n"

No, because the three siblings took the farm as tenants in common rather than as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nTenants in common hold property according to an agreement that they will divide any proceeds from the sale of the property equally, but they do not have any rights or duties to one another regarding the management of the property or the payment of debts. In contrast, joint tenants with right of survivorship share ownership of the property equally and each have a legal obligation to pay off the debt if it becomes due.\n\nIn this case, the son held the mortgage on the farm as a joint tenant with right of survivorship, which means that he had a legal obligation to pay off the debt if it became due. However, since the son did not die intestate (i.e., did not leave behind a valid will), the mortgage passed to the son's estate through probate, where it would be sold to satisfy the debt. Therefore, the sons' sister cannot claim that she is entitled to the mortgage as a tenant in common, as there was no agreement between the siblings that they would divide the proceeds equally."
