For an atom with n = 1, there is only one electron, and for an atom with n = 2, there are two electrons. However, when we add another principal quantum number (n) to this sequence, we are essentially adding more energy levels to the system. In this case, when n = 3, there would be three electrons, but since our question asks about the total number of electrons, not the specific value of n, it's important to note that this scenario is hypothetical and doesn't actually exist in reality. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, the correct answer is D: 10."
