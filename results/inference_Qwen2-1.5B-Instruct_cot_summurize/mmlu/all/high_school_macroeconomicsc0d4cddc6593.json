A contractionary monetary policy involves reducing the money supply or increasing interest rates, which can lead to decreased economic activity and lower aggregate demand. This in turn can cause the discount rate (the rate at which banks lend to each other) to increase as well. Therefore, the nominal interest rate would also increase, leading to decreased aggregate demand."
