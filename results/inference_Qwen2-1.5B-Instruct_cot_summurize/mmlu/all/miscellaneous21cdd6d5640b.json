Increased varieties of each crop planted\n\nThe Green Revolution, which took place from the late 1940s to the early 1970s, was a period of significant agricultural innovation that led to increased yields and the cultivation of new crop varieties. This was achieved through various methods including genetic modification, hybridization, and improved seed production techniques. The increased variety of crops cultivated during this time allowed for more diverse food supplies and helped feed growing populations. However, it's important to note that while the Green Revolution did increase agricultural productivity, it also had negative effects such as the spread of pests and diseases, soil degradation, and environmental pollution."
