Prostaglandins are chemical messengers that regulate various physiological processes, including pain perception and uterine contractions during menstruation. Low levels of prostaglandin can lead to menstrual cramping. The other options listed do not directly cause menstrual cramps. Frequent masturbation does not have any impact on menstrual cramping."
