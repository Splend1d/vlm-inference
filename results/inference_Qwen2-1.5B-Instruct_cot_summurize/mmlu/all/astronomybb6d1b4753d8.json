They are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed.\n\nAccording to the Solar Nebular theory, the solar system was formed through a process called gravitational collapse. The Sun, along with its eight planets, were all initially small and hot balls of gas and dust that eventually cooled and solidified into rocky planets and gaseous atmospheres like Earth's atmosphere. \n\nDuring this time, many smaller particles of rock or ice were also being pulled together due to their mutual gravitational attraction. These particles would have eventually come closer together than they could withstand the force of gravity alone, leading to the formation of larger bodies such as asteroids and comets.\n\nComets are specifically made up of frozen water and other icy substances, while asteroids are typically composed of rock and metal. Both types of objects are thought to have been formed in the early stages of the solar system, but they differ in their size, composition, and location within the solar system. Comets are generally much smaller and more numerous than asteroids, and they tend to be found further away from the Sun."
