Both algorithms work correctly on all input values.\nB. Algorithm I always works correctly, but Algorithm II only works correctly when the maximum value is not the first value in the list.\nC. Algorithm II always works correctly, but Algorithm I only works correctly when the maximum value is greater than or equal to -l.\nD. Neither algorithm will correctly identify the maximum value when the input contains both positive and negative input values.\n"

Algorithm I always works correctly, but Algorithm II only works correctly when the maximum value is not the first value in the list.\n\nAlgorithm I iterates through the list of integers once, comparing each element with the current maximum value and updating it if necessary. This means that Algorithm I can handle lists with any number of elements, including those with repeated maximum values.\n\nOn the other hand, Algorithm II starts by setting the maximum value to the first element in the list. Then, for each subsequent element in the list, it compares it with the current maximum value. If the new element is larger than the current maximum, it updates the maximum value accordingly. However, this process may lead to incorrect results if there are multiple elements with the same maximum value at the beginning of the list.\n\nFor example, consider the list [5, 3, 8, 4]. Algorithm I would initially compare 5 (the smallest element) with 5, which is smaller than 5. So it would update the maximum value to 5, resulting in an incorrect output of 5 as the maximum value. On the other hand, Algorithm II would start by comparing 5 (the largest element) with 3, which is also the largest element. Since 3 is larger than 5, it would update the maximum value to 3, resulting in an accurate output of 3 as the maximum value."
