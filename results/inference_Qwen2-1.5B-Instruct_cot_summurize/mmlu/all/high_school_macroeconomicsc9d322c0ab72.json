When the deficit is negative the debt decreases.\n\nThis is because when there is a surplus in the budget, it means that more money is coming into the government than what is spent. This surplus can be used to pay down the debt by reducing the amount owed or by investing in long-term assets that will generate interest income over time. Conversely, if the deficit is negative, it means that more money is being spent than is coming in, which results in an increase in the national debt. Therefore, as the deficit decreases, the national debt also decreases."
