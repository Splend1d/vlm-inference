In the case of a non-governmental not-for-profit organization, this includes both unrestricted and restricted net assets. Unrestricted net assets are those that can be used by the organization to fulfill its mission without any restrictions or conditions attached. Temporarily restricted net assets are those that have been set aside for specific purposes but will eventually be released back into the general pool of assets when the purpose has been fulfilled. Permanently restricted net assets are those that have been set aside for specific purposes with no possibility of release back into the general pool of assets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Unrestricted net assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets."
