The Green Revolution, which took place in the 1960s and 70s, involved the introduction of high-yield crop varieties such as rice, wheat, maize, and soybeans. These crops were chosen because they were more productive than traditional crops, but they were also foreign to many African farmers who had limited knowledge about how to cultivate them.\n\nIn addition, the Green Revolution was not able to address the underlying issues that led to poor agricultural productivity in Africa, such as lack of access to water, soil degradation, and inadequate infrastructure. As a result, while some areas experienced increased yields, the overall impact on African agriculture was largely negative.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: It targeted crops Africans don't grow and eat."
