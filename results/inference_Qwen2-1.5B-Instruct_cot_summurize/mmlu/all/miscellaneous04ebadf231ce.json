In the song, Jimmy Buffett sings about finding \"the margarita in my glass\" and looking for someone to make it just right, which suggests that he is seeking assistance from a bartender or mixologist. The lyrics also mention looking for a \"shaker of salt,\" which could be another ingredient needed for making a good margarita. However, the main focus of the song is on the search for the perfect drink, not necessarily any specific ingredient. So, the correct answer is D. the bartender."
