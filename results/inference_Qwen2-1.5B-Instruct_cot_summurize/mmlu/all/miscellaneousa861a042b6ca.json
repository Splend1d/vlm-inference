In contrast, demand for necessities such as water, bread, and salt is generally considered inelastic because they are basic needs and people tend to have a high level of income elasticity of demand. Demand for pork, on the other hand, is often considered elastic because it is a luxury good with relatively low income elasticity of demand.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nD. Pork"
