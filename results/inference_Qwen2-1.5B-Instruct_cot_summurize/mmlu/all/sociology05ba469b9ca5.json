Social interaction reinforces the ideas and images that audiences select.\n\nAccording to this theory, audiences have the ability to selectively interpret what they choose to hear or see in the media. They may also passively absorb information but actively engage with it through discussion and debate. Additionally, social interactions can reinforce certain ideas and beliefs that audiences select as important. Therefore, social interaction plays an important role in shaping how audiences perceive and respond to the media."
