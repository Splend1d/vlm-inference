However, there's no unique characteristic for a finite product of rings with the same characteristic, so we cannot say whether it's 0, 3, or 12 without more information about the specific structure of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3\\).\n\nGiven the context, the correct answer would depend on additional constraints or properties not provided in the question. If you provide more details or if there's another context in which these numbers might appear, I'd be happy to help further!"
