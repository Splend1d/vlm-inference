According to Aristotle, virtue is a result of living virtuously, which involves acting according to reason and doing what is right. Virtue can be developed by consistently engaging in actions that promote the good life and avoiding those that harm it.\n\nVice, on the other hand, refers to actions that deviate from virtuous behavior, such as laziness, greed, anger, and other negative emotions. Vice cannot be entirely controlled or eliminated through willpower alone, but rather requires habitual modification through deliberate effort and self-reflection.\n\nIn summary, Aristotle believes that both virtue and vice are within the human power of choice and development. While some aspects of virtue may be more easily achieved than others, they can still be cultivated through personal effort and discipline."
