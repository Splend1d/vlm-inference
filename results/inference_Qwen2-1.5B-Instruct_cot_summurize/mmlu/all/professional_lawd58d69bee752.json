The loaves were to be delivered on the first day of each week, with payment to be made within four days of delivery. For the first four weeks, the bakery delivered loaves to the supermarket and the supermarket made the appropriate payments. When the fifth delivery arrived, the supermarket discovered that the shipment contained 80 whole wheat loaves and 20 sourdough loaves. The manager of the supermarket immediately called the bakery to complain about the shipment. The operator of the bakery apologized and offered to send 20 loaves of whole wheat bread within 24 hours. What is the probable legal effect of the operator's conversation with the manager with regard to the fifth shipment?\n\nA. The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment and cancel their contract.\nB. The supermarket would have the right to reject the fifth shipment, but would be held liable for the remaining deliveries.\nC. The supermarket would not be entitled to reject the operator's offer to \"cure. \"\nD. The supermarket would have a right to \"cover\" by purchasing substitute loaves of bread.\n"

The supermarket would not be entitled to reject the operator's offer to \"cure.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the supermarket has already accepted the shipment containing 80 whole wheat loaves and 20 sourdough loaves as part of its agreement with the bakery. However, when the fifth delivery arrives, it contains only 80 whole wheat loaves instead of the agreed-upon 100 loaves.\n\nSince the supermarket had already paid for the 80 whole wheat loaves in the first four weeks, they are obligated to pay for the additional 20 whole wheat loaves as well. This means that the supermarket would have no financial obligation to pay for the sourdough loaves or any other items included in the fifth delivery.\n\nTherefore, the supermarket does not have the right to reject the fifth shipment based on the quantity provided. They must accept the shipment and continue paying for the agreed-upon number of whole wheat loaves until the end of the contract period."
