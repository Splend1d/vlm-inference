When examining the correlates of admission acceptance, two obvious factors that strongly correlated with admissions were GPA and standardized test scores, with correlation values of +0.41 and +0.55 respectively. However, the study also demonstrated that those students who had social networks that overlapped with the alumni networks of the selective colleges were even more likely to be admitted, with a correlation between social network and alumni network of +0.61. This correlation demonstrates:\n\nA. the value of cultural capital.\nB. a meritocracy. \nC. he value of social capital.\nD. a false association.\n"

The correlation between social network and alumni network suggests that having connections within the alumni community can increase the likelihood of being accepted into an elite college. Social capital refers to the resources and relationships people have access to, which can be valuable in accessing opportunities or achieving success. In this case, the ability to build and maintain strong social networks can provide individuals with advantages when applying to selective colleges."
