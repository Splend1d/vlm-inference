But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset. He told them also of another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of this place, who had been in England and could speak better English than himself.\n\u2014William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation\nSamoset and Squanto can most directly be compared to whom?\n\nA. Tecumseh\nB. Crazy Horse\nC. Sacagawea\nD. Geronimo\n"

Sacagawea\n\nSamoset and Squanto can most directly be compared to Sacagawea, as both were Native American allies who helped European explorers navigate unfamiliar territories during the 19th century. They are both known for their bravery and intelligence, helping to lead their tribes through difficult situations and providing valuable insights into foreign cultures and languages.\n\nTecumseh is an example of someone who fought against the United States during the War of 1812, and therefore cannot be compared to Samoset or Squanto.\n\nCrazy Horse is a Lakota leader who led the Sioux tribe during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and although he was involved in conflicts with the U.S. government, he did not help Europeans navigate unfamiliar territories or provide valuable insights into foreign cultures.\n\nGeronimo is a member of the Apache tribe who led the Apache nation during the mid-1800s and early 1900s, and while he played a significant role in resisting U.S. expansion westward, he also engaged in warfare with other Native American tribes and did not interact with Europeans in the way that Samoset and Squanto did."
