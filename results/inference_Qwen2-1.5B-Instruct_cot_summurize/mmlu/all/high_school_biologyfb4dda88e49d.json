Adding more enzyme K\n\nEnzymes act as catalysts in reactions, meaning they increase the rate at which a chemical reaction occurs without being consumed or altered themselves. In this case, if there is an excess of enzyme K (more than needed for the current reaction), it could lead to more products C being produced because the enzyme will be able to facilitate the reaction faster and more efficiently. This is known as the \"enzyme-catalysis\" effect.\n\nRemoving reactants like A or C from the system would not affect the overall reaction rate or the production of products C; however, adding more enzymes would have no direct effect on the rate but might increase the efficiency of the existing enzyme(s) already present in the system. Increasing the temperature would also speed up the reaction but does not directly alter the amount of reactants available or their conversion into products."
