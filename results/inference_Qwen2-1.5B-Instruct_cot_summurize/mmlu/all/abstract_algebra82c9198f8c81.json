This property ensures that every element of R can be expressed as a polynomial combination of roots of p(x), which is known as the splitting field property.\n\nStatement 2: \"There is a field with 60 elements.\"\nThis statement is false because there is no finite field with exactly 60 elements. Finite fields are characterized by having a prime number of elements, and 60 is not a prime number. Therefore, there cannot exist a finite field with 60 elements.\n\nTherefore, based on these analyses, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
