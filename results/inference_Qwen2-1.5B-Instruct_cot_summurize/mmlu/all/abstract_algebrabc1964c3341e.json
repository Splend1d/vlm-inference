For example, consider the direct product of two non-abelian groups (e.g., $G_1 \\times G_2$), which is non-Abelian but its factor group ($G_1 / ker(f)$) may also not be Abelian if $f$ is not an isomorphism.\n\nStatement 2 is true because in a direct product of groups, subgroups are preserved under composition of groups, meaning that if $K$ is a normal subgroup of $H$, then $HK = KH$. This property applies to all groups and their subgroups, including those within larger groups like $G$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
