                    "text": "To find the maximum possible order for an element of $S_6$, we need to understand that the group $S_6$ consists of all permutations of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\nThe number of permutations in $S_6$ is given by the factorial function: $n!$, where $n$ is the size of the set being permuted (in this case, 6). Therefore, $|S_6| = 6! = 720$. \n\nNow, let's consider the cycle structure of each permutation in $S_6$. The cycle structure of a permutation can be determined by counting the length of its cycles and arranging them in descending order. For example, if a permutation has one cycle of length 3, it would have a cycle structure of $(3)$. If a permutation has two cycles of lengths 2 and 3, it would have a cycle structure of $(2,3)$.\n\nSince there are no fixed points in $S_6$, any permutation will have at least one cycle of length greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the maximum possible order for an element of $S_6$ cannot be less than 2^6 = 64.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies \"for n = 6\", we need to consider only those permutations with cycle structure of length 2 or greater. There are 5 such permutations: $(12)(3456), (13)(2456), (14)(2356), (15)(2346),$ and $(16)(2345)$. Each of these permutations has a cycle structure of length 2 or greater.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible order for an element of $S_6$ for n = 6 is 64 + 5 = 69.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 105."
