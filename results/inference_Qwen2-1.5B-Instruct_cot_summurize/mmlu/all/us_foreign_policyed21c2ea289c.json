The merchants argued that they were being unfairly taxed by the crown, and that this was causing them to lose business to other countries. The crown responded by increasing the tax rate on imports from other countries, which had the effect of reducing competition from foreign goods and increasing profits for the merchant class. This ultimately contributed to the economic decline of the American colonies and the eventual outbreak of the American Revolution."
