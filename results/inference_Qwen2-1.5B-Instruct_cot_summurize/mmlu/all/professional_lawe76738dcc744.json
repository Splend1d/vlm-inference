                    "text": "A prisoner was serving a life sentence in a state prison as a result of his conviction for the murder of a child who had trespassed onto his farmland. The prisoner came from a family of farmers, dating back to at least 1750. His family believed that all nourishment comes from the ground and that one's soul will be saved only if his diet consists totally of natural, farm-grown food. The prisoner followed that belief and ate only fresh fruits and vegetables. He further believes that a higher power has commanded him to eat only vegetarian foods. When the prisoner entered the prison state prison officials agreed to grant his wishes and served him only fresh fruits and vegetables for his meals. After six months, deciding that catering to his special diet was overly burdensome and administratively unworkable, the officials decided to stop giving the prisoner special treatment and began to serve him the same food as served to the rest of the prison population. Although nothing physically prohibited the prisoner from eating and surviving on the general prison population's diet, he refused to eat the food that was not in conformity with his special diet. The prisoner's best constitutional argument to support his claim of the right to a fresh fruit and vegetable diet is based on\n\nA. the First Amendment.\nB. the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, as applied to the states.\nC. the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process clause.\nD. the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

                    "text": "The prisoner's best constitutional argument to support his claim of the right to a fresh fruit and vegetable diet would likely be based on the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, which prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. In this case, the prisoner argues that the state prison officials denied him equal protection by providing him with a special diet that was not available to the other prisoners. Therefore, the prisoner's argument could be based on the idea that the state prison officials violated his due process rights by denying him access to the same food as the other prisoners.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the prisoner's argument may also be based on other constitutional provisions, such as the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, as applied to the states. This provision applies to state prisons and their conditions of confinement, including the types of food provided to prisoners. If the prisoner can demonstrate that the state prison officials were violating his constitutional rights by providing him with a special diet that was not available to the other prisoners, then he may have a valid argument under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the prisoner's best constitutional argument may be based on the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, it is possible that other constitutional provisions may also apply depending on the specific facts of the case."
