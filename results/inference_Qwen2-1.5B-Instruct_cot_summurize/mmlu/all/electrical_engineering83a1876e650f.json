Clean.\n\nElectrical resistance welding requires that the metal surfaces to be welded are clean and free of any contaminants or impurities, such as oil, grease, or dust. A dirty surface can cause the welding process to fail or result in poor quality welds. Therefore, it is important to keep the metal surfaces clean before starting the welding process."
