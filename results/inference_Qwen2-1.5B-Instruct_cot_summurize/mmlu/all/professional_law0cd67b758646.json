Near the end of the flight, the pilot saw a cloud of fog ahead but decided that he could navigate through it. He got lost in the fog and crashed the plane into the side of a mountain. The pilot and his passenger were both killed instantly in the crash. If the passenger's family brings a wrongful death action against the pilot's estate, the most likely result is that the plaintiffs will\n\nA. recover under strict liability, because the pilot engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\nB. recover under negligence, because the pilot failed to exercise reasonable care in the operation of his airplane.\nC. not recover, because the passenger did not pay to go on the flight.\nD. not recover, because the passenger unreasonably exposed himself to a known danger.\n"

Negligence refers to failing to act with the level of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under similar circumstances. In this case, the pilot was aware of a cloud of fog ahead but still chose to fly through it, which resulted in the crash. This shows a lack of due diligence and a failure to take necessary precautions to ensure safety. Therefore, the pilot would be found negligent and liable for the death of the passenger."
