A gestating mother is somewhere in between a mere biological mother and a mother in a thick, normative sense.\n\nThis statement refers to the concept of moral development, which suggests that individuals' moral reasoning and values evolve over time. In this case, the gestating mother's moral reasoning and values are not yet fully developed, but they do have some capacity for autonomy and self-awareness. She may still be influenced by her cultural, social, and personal experiences, but she is also subject to external pressures such as societal norms and expectations. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the abortion issue from multiple perspectives, including the fetal rights argument, the rights of the mother, and the ethical considerations surrounding the termination of pregnancy."
