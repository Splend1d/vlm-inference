One employee of the department of treasury brought an action claiming a denial of equal protection and due process by taking away his right to a job. It is claimed that the prohibition is necessary to protect the public from potential problems that could arise. Which test of constitutional validity would be likely applied to this regulation?\n\nA. Strict scrutiny, since drug users are a special class of persons often discriminated against by the public.\nB. Intermediate scrutiny, because, like gender, this can be a sensitive area where discrimination is common.\nC. The rational basis test, because discrimination is generally favored with drug users or even those getting treatment.\nD. The rational basis test, because the regulation need only be related to a legitimate state interest to be valid.\n"

The rational basis test, because the regulation need only be related to a legitimate state interest to be valid.\n\nThe rational basis test is used when there is no suspect classification or a compelling state interest that justifies the law. In this case, the regulation is aimed at preventing potential problems associated with drug use in certain state-run facilities. While it may be seen as a form of discrimination, the government's interest in protecting the public outweighs any perceived discrimination against individuals with a history of drug use. Therefore, the regulation would be upheld under the rational basis test."
