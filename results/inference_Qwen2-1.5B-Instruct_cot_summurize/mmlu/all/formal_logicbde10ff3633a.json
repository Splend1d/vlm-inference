Therefore, if we assume that I is true, then it logically follows that either L or M must be true based on the second premise.\n\nHowever, the third premise states that \"I implies (~L)\", which means that if I is false, then L must be true. This contradicts the first premise, which says that I implies (J \u2261 K), which cannot be true unless J \u2261 K is also false, which would make L true by the third premise.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. I \u2283 (~L)."
