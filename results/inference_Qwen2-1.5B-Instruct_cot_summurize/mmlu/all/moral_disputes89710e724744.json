It emphasizes that one's actions should only be condemned if they cause harm, even if the intention behind those actions was good.\n\nBased on this understanding:\n\n- A. Human persons do indeed have a right to life, which is considered a fundamental moral principle in many ethical frameworks.\n  \n- B. Harm can sometimes be seen as a necessary evil, especially in situations where direct harm would result from not taking any action at all (e.g., saving lives by risking one's own).\n  \n- C. The \"ends justify the means\" approach is also consistent with deontological ethics, which suggests that the morality of an action depends solely on whether it adheres to certain moral rules, regardless of the intended outcome.\n  \n- D. The \"hostility should be directed at its true object\" is a common theme in both utilitarian and deontological theories, suggesting that one should aim to achieve a desirable end through the least harmful means possible.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and D align most closely with the core of the absolutist position, while option C might not fully capture the essence of absolute justice. However, without additional context about Nagel's specific view, it is difficult to definitively state which part of the absolutist position he considers central."
