In this case, the denominators are 4 and 8, so we need to find a common multiple of these two numbers that is also divisible by both 4 and 8 (which would be their least common multiple).\n\nThe least common multiple of 4 and 8 is 8. Now let's convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 8:\n\n- $\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{4 \\times 2} = \\frac{6}{8}$\n- $\\frac{1}{8}$\n\nNow we can subtract them:\n\n$$\\frac{6}{8} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6 - 1}{8} = \\frac{5}{8}$$\n\nSo the answer is C. 5 over 8."
