However, even in these cases, there should be an understanding that confidentiality cannot be guaranteed due to the potential for the information to become known outside of the professional relationship.\n  * D: The obligations of confidentiality can sometimes be relaxed in certain circumstances, such as when a therapist suspects that a client is at risk of harm to themselves or others, or when legal requirements dictate disclosure of information. However, these situations must be carefully managed and reviewed by the therapist and the client, and the therapist must still adhere to the overall principles of confidentiality.\n\nIt's important to note that confidentiality is a complex issue and different therapists may have different practices and policies regarding its use. It's always best to check with your therapist or a qualified mental health professional before discussing any concerns you might have about confidentiality."
