Perceived as support\n\nSocial support refers to the resources, information, encouragement, advice, assistance, or other forms of help that individuals receive from others. It can take many different forms, such as family, friends, colleagues, community members, or professional organizations.\n\nWhen social support is perceived as supportive, it can have a positive impact on an individual's health and well-being. This is because social support can provide emotional comfort, reduce stress, improve mood, enhance resilience, and facilitate recovery from illness or injury.\n\nIn contrast, external support (such as financial aid) may not be as effective in promoting health and well-being as internal support (such as emotional comfort). Internal support comes from within oneself, whereas external support often requires external sources beyond one's control.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer."
