                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to find the minimum number of questions required for each possible value of the number Bob writes down.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(N\\) as the maximum number of digits in the number written by Bob.\n- \\(M\\) as the maximum number of questions asked by Mary before determining the number.\n- \\(K\\) as the base case, which is when \\(N = M = 1\\).\n\nThe base case is when Bob writes down a single-digit number (i.e., \\(N = 1\\)). In this case, it takes \\(M = 1\\) question to determine the number because there's only one possibility: Bob says the number is less than 100. So, \\(M = 1\\), \\(N = K = 1\\).\n\nNow, let's consider \\(N > 1\\). When \\(N > 1\\), we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: The first digit is greater than or equal to 2. This means the number starts with 2, so Bob would say something like \"No, not 2.\" Then, Mary asks if the number has more than one digit. Since Bob answers \"Yes,\" this means the number has more than one digit. Therefore, Mary needs to ask \\(M+1\\) questions here, making \\(M'=M+1\\).\n\nCase 2: The first digit is less than 2. This means the number starts with 3, so Bob would say something like \"No, not 3.\" Then, Mary asks if the number has more than two digits. Since Bob answers \"Yes,\" this means the number has more than two digits. Therefore, Mary needs to ask \\(M+1\\) questions here, making \\(M''=M'+1\\).\n\nThus, the total number of questions \\(M'\\) or \\(M''\\) depends on whether the first digit is greater than or less than 2. Let's calculate these values for \\(N > 1\\):\n\n- If the first digit is greater than or equal to 2, \\(M' = M + 1\\).\n- If the first digit is less than 2, \\(M'' = M + 2\\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of questions \\(M\\) or \\(M''\\) required to determine the number from \\(N > 1\\) depends on whether the first digit is greater than or less than 2. We need to check all possibilities:\n\n1. For \\(N = 2\\): \\(M = 2\\) since Bob could start with any digit greater than 1.\n2. For \\(N = 3\\): \\(M = 3\\) since Bob could start with any digit greater than 2.\n3. For \\(N = 4\\): \\(M = 4\\) since Bob could start with any digit greater than 3.\n4. ...\n5. For \\(N = 9\\): \\(M = 9\\) since Bob could start with any digit greater than 8.\n\nFor \\(N = 10\\), \\(M = 10\\) since Bob could start with any digit greater than 9.\n\nSo, the total number of questions required is the sum of the numbers corresponding to each \\(N\\):\n\n\\(M = \\sum_{n=2}^{9} n + 10\\)\n\nThis series sums up to:\n\n\\(M = 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 9 + 10\\)\n\\(M = \\frac{(9)(10)}{2} + 10\\)\n\\(M = 45 + 10\\)\n\\(M = 55\\)\n\nSince \\(M\\) represents the total number of questions asked by Mary, and \\(M = 55\\), we conclude that Mary will determine the answer at the end of exactly 55 questions in the worst case scenario. \n\nHence, the correct answer is **(D) 10**."
