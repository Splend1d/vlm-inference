It has become more influenced by evangelical Christians.\n\nThe Republican Party has traditionally leaned towards conservative values and policies, particularly when it comes to issues such as limited government, traditional family values, and opposition to abortion. This is often reflected in the party's stance on social issues, including gay rights, marriage equality, and immigration reform. In recent years, there has been a growing influence from Evangelical Christians within the Republican Party, who tend to prioritize religious values over economic concerns. As a result, the Republican Party has become more aligned with evangelical Christianity than other major political parties."
