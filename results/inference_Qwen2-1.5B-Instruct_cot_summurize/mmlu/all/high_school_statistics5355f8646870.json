This study was an experiment in which the subjects were used as their own controls. \n\nAn experiment is a systematic investigation conducted under controlled conditions with the primary purpose of testing the relationship between variables. In this case, the subjects were randomly selected and given three beers to consume. Their reaction time to a simple stimulus was then measured before and after consuming the alcohol. This study meets all the criteria for an experiment, including the manipulation of a variable (in this case, the amount of alcohol consumed), measurement of a dependent variable (reaction time), and control of extraneous variables by using the participants themselves as their own controls.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that the study was an observational study, which is not true since there was an intervention (the consumption of alcohol) that could have affected the results.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that lack of blocking makes the study poorly designed, but without more information about the specific details of the study design, it's impossible to determine whether blocking would have improved or worsened the study's design.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it claims that the placebo effect is irrelevant in this type of study, but without more information about the specifics of the study design, it's impossible to determine whether the placebo effect would be relevant or irrelevant."
