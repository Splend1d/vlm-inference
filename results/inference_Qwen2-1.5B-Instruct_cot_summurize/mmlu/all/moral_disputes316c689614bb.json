All of the above.\n\nAccording to Lee and George, ova/sperm are not considered human beings because they lack the necessary genetic and functional characteristics that define a fully developed individual with the capacity for reproduction and self-reproduction. This includes having a human genetic profile, being capable of reproducing themselves, and exhibiting the ability to develop into an adult organism with the capacity for growth and development. While it may be possible for some individuals to have non-human reproductive partners, such as in cases of artificial insemination or surrogacy, these relationships are not recognized by most societies as genuine human relationships."
