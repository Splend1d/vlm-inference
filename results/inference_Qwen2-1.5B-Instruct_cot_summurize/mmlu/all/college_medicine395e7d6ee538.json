Creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power.\n\nCreatine is a supplement that has been shown to improve muscle strength, power, and endurance in athletes and individuals who engage in high-intensity exercise. It works by increasing the availability of creatine phosphate, which is used as an energy source during exercises that require quick bursts of power.\n\nA. Increasing the protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day does not directly stimulate muscle growth or increase strength. However, it may contribute to overall health and fitness goals.\n\nC. Amino acid supplements do contain amino acids that are essential for muscle repair and growth, but they do not have a direct effect on muscle strength or power.\n\nD. Shortening contractions are a type of exercise that can cause muscle damage, but it is not typically associated with muscle building or strength gains. Muscle damage is more commonly caused by resistance training, where muscles are progressively loaded beyond their ability to withstand stress."
