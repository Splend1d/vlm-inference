So,\n\\[5 + 15 = 20\\] straws per additional shape.\n\nSince there were \\(9\\) initial shapes and \\(x\\) additional shapes, the total number of straws used is:\n\\[45 + (9 + x) \\times 20\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[45 + 180 + 20x = 225 + 20x\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of straws used to make all the shapes is \\(225 + 20x\\), which corresponds to option **C** (45)."
