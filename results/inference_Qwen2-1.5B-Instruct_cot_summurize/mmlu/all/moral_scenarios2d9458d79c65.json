This behavior is not only morally questionable but also illegal, as it constitutes possession and use of drugs without a prescription or medical supervision. In this case, the character's actions violate societal norms regarding drug use and possession.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character pulls down the shade when they see the neighbor undressing through the window. While this action may be considered inappropriate or even disturbing, it is generally not considered morally wrong. The character's behavior is not illegal or harmful, and there is no clear violation of any societal norms or laws. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
