This can be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \\frac{h_2}{h_1}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) are the pressures at the bottom of the tubes (\\(h_1 = 0\\)), and \\(h_2\\) is the height of the mercury in the narrow tube.\n\nGiven that both tubes have the same initial height (0 m), but different areas for the mercury, we can see that the pressure will also be different because the height of the mercury column will be different in each case.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. None of these**"
