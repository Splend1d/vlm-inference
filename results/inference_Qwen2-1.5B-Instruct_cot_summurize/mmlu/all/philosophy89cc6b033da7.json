Stevenson claims to have offered an account of just such a property, which suggests that he has attempted to provide a logical or philosophical explanation for the existence of goodness as an objective and a priori quality. This is in contrast to option A, which suggests that Stevenson has disproven the existence of such a property, which is unlikely given the nature of his work. Option C is incorrect because Stevenson's work does address the issue of goodness being objective and a priori. Finally, option D is also incorrect because Stevenson's claim implies that he has provided some sort of explanation for the existence of goodness as an objective and a priori quality."
