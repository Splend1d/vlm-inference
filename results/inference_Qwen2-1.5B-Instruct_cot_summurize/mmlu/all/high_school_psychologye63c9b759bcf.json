Classical conditioning involves pairing stimuli, and operant conditioning involves pairing a response with a stimulus.\n\nOperant conditioning is based on the idea that behavior can be modified through consequences or rewards, while classical conditioning involves pairing stimuli in order to elicit a particular response. In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus (such as a bell) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (such as a sound), causing the animal to associate the two stimuli and learn to respond to the bell. This process is repeated until the animal responds automatically to the bell without any further reinforcement. On the other hand, operant conditioning involves using positive or negative reinforcement or punishment to modify behavior. For example, if a child receives praise for doing their homework, they may become more likely to do it again in the future. Conversely, if they receive punishment for not doing their homework, they may become less likely to do it again."
