Which of the following statements is a negative consequence of clear-cutting the tropical rain forests?\n\nA. Indigenous populations will have access to modern conveniences.\nB. There will be less precipitation in those clear-cut areas.\nC. U.S. markets will have access to less expensive beef.\nD. Deforestation will allow more sunlight to penetrate areas that were kept dark by dense vegetation.\n"

Clear-cutting the rain forests releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change. This can lead to rising temperatures and changing weather patterns, making it harder for farmers to grow crops and raise livestock like cattle. As a result, prices for beef can go up, making it less affordable for consumers in the United States. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
