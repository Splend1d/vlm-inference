In a perfectly competitive labor market, there is no employer-supplied labor, and all workers have the same amount of skill and education. Therefore, anyone who wants to work will be able to find employment.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nB: Individual firms face downward sloping labor demand curves - This would imply that firms cannot hire more workers than they need, which is not necessarily true in a perfectly competitive market.\n\nC: Unemployment can reach as high as 10-15% - While unemployment can increase due to changes in the economy or technological advancements, it is unlikely to reach these levels without some form of government intervention or change in economic policy.\n\nD: Individual firms face upward sloping labor demand curves - This implies that firms must pay higher wages to attract workers, which is not true in a perfectly competitive market where firms can offer lower wages to attract workers."
