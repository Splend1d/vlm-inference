The entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system will always increase over time, unless there is a net flow of heat into or out of the system (a process called a thermodynamic cycle). In a reversible thermodynamic process, all of the work done by or on the system is exactly canceled out by the change in the internal energy of the system. This means that the temperature of the system remains constant throughout the process, and the entropy of the system and its environment remains unchanged. Therefore, option C is correct. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they imply that there are changes in the internal energy or entropy of the system and environment, which violates the second law of thermodynamics."
