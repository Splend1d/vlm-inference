Dr. Solo receives a call from his son's teacher who says she would like to begin therapy with him. As an ethical psychologist, Dr. Solo should:\n\nA. tell the teacher that he is ethically prohibited from seeing her because to do so would constitute a multiple (dual) relationship.\nB. begin therapy with her and discuss the potential for conflicts during the initial session and, if necessary, in subsequent sessions.\nC. begin therapy with her but seek consultation if any problems arise.\nD. begin therapy with her but take special precautions to ensure that client confidentiality is maintained.\n"

While it may be tempting to see this as a unique opportunity to work with a parent and child, it is important to maintain boundaries and avoid creating dual relationships.\n\nOption A is not appropriate because it suggests breaking ethical guidelines by seeing the teacher, which could create a conflict of interest and potentially harm the therapeutic relationship between the therapist and the student. Option B is also not appropriate because it suggests beginning therapy without discussing potential conflicts, which could lead to misunderstandings and difficulties in the future.\n\nOption C is not appropriate because it suggests taking special precautions to ensure client confidentiality, which could create additional stress and anxiety for the patient and their family.\n\nTherefore, the best option is to begin therapy with the teacher and discuss potential conflicts during the initial session and, if necessary, in subsequent sessions. This will allow both parties to understand each other's perspectives and work together to establish clear boundaries and minimize potential conflicts."
