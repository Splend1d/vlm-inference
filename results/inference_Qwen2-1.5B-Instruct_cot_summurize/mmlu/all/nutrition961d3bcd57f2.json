Monounsaturated fatty acids\n\nMonounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, and alpha-linolenic acid, have been shown to lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels by reducing inflammation and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol levels. They also help to prevent the formation of plaque in the arteries. On the other hand, saturated and trans fatty acids can increase LDL cholesterol levels and contribute to an increased risk of heart disease."
