Services do not have traditional supply and demand characteristics like goods do. Instead, their value is often based on the quality of the experience they provide or the perceived benefits derived from them. Factors such as A (tangibility), B (performance-value), and D (delivery method) could be relevant for services, but variations in supply and demand would depend more on the specific context within which the service is offered and consumed."
