The referent object can be objectively studied and should be considered accordingly.\n\nCritical Security Studies, like other approaches in Security Studies, aims to understand security from multiple perspectives and consider the subjective experiences of individuals involved in security issues. However, it also challenges traditional epistemological frameworks such as positivism and realism, which may prioritize objective understanding over subjective experience. Therefore, while the referent object can indeed be studied and considered, Critical Security Studies often goes beyond objective analysis to include an examination of how security is constructed through social interactions and power dynamics. This perspective is distinct from a purely positivistic or realist one, where the focus would typically be on objective facts rather than subjective interpretations."
