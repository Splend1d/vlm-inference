An opening in the anterior wall of the trachea above the cricoid cartilage. \n\nA tracheostomy is an incision made in the anterior wall of the trachea (windpipe) to provide access for mechanical ventilation, intubation, or other procedures involving airway management. It is typically performed through a small incision that allows for easy insertion and removal of tubes and equipment. The procedure may also be used as a temporary measure when definitive repair or reconstruction of the airway is not possible or appropriate."
