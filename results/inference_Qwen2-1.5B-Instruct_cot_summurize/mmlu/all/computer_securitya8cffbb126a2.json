False, False\n\nWithout file descriptor passing, there would be no way for services to pass file descriptors to other processes or to inherit file descriptors from their parent process when using the `fork` and `exec` commands. This means that services would have to use different mechanisms to communicate with each other, which could introduce complexity and potential bugs into the system. For example, services might need to implement their own message passing mechanism or use network protocols such as UDP or TCP to transfer data across processes. However, these alternatives would require additional implementation effort and may not offer the same level of flexibility or performance as file descriptor passing in Unix."
