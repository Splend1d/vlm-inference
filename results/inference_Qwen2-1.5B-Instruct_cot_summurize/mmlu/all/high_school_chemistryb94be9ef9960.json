Hold the copper penny with crucible tongs, and heat strongly in the flame of a Bunsen burner.\n\nThis method involves using a crucible tongs to hold the penny over a flame, which can be easily done by holding it with both hands or using a pair of tweezers if desired. The flame is then turned up to high heat for several seconds until the penny starts to melt. This method uses only a single flame source and requires no additional equipment beyond a Bunsen burner. It is also relatively quick and easy to perform."
