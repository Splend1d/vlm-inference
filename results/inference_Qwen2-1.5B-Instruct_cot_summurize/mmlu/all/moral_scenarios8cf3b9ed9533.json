Calling the police on someone who is violent can be seen as an inappropriate and potentially harmful response, especially if the person being called has not committed any crimes or is not posing a threat to others. On the other hand, singing a romantic song for your wife at your wedding is generally considered to be a positive and loving act. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
