                    "text": " Let's denote the side length of the cube as $s$ in feet. The surface area of the cube is then $6s^2$. \n\nGiven that David can cover a cube of side length 2 feet with exactly 16 quarts of paint, we have the equation:\n\\[6(2)^2 = 16.\\]\nSolving this equation gives us $16 = 8$, which means David can cover an entire cube of side length 1 foot.\n\nNow, let's consider the problem from a different perspective. We want to find out what size cube can be covered by 169 quarts of paint. Since David can cover a cube of side length 1 foot with 16 quarts of paint, and he has 169 quarts of paint, we need to find the smallest number of cubes that can fit into 169 quarts.\n\nWe know that 169 quarts is equal to $\\frac{169}{1} = 169/10$ cubic feet. This means that the volume of each cube is $\\frac{169}{10} / (6s^2)$ cubic feet. Setting this equal to 1 foot ($= 1/12$ cubic feet), we get:\n\\[\\frac{169}{10} / (6(1/12))^2 = 1.\\]\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\\[\\frac{169}{10} / (1/2) = 1,\\]\nwhich simplifies further to:\n\\[169/10 = 1.\\]\n\nThis means that each cube can be covered with 1 foot cubed of paint, or equivalently, with 1/12 cubic feet of paint per cube.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. $\\frac{13}{2}$ feet."
