His birth weight was 3500 g (7 lb 11 oz), and Apgar scores were 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. At the age of 15 months, physical examination showed no abnormalities, but he was not yet talking. Both of his parents had learning difficulties in school, and his mother stopped attending after the 10th grade. He has a maternal uncle with cognitive disabilities. He is at the 25th percentile for height, 15th percentile for weight, and 90th percentile for head circumference. He appears irritable, he resists making eye contact, and he is flapping his hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?\n\nA. Frameshift mutation\nB. Missense mutation\nC. Nonsense mutation\nD. Trinucleotide repeat expansion\n"

Trinucleotide repeat expansion\n\nTrinucleotide repeat expansions, such as those found in fragile X syndrome, can lead to developmental delays and other symptoms in individuals who have mutations in specific genes that code for proteins involved in brain development. In the case of this 2-year-old boy, it is possible that the trinucleotide repeat expansion in his fragile X chromosome could be causing some of the observed symptoms."
