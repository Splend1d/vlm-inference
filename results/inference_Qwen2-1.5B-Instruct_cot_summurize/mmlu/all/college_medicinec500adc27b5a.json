                    "text": "The electron configuration of gold (Au) is given by:\n\n```\n[Ar] 4s1\n```\n\nIn this configuration, the principal quantum number (n) is 4, which corresponds to the energy level of an electron in the outermost shell of the atom.\n\nFor the electron with l = 2, its energy level is 3rd from the highest occupied energy level. Therefore, it can be found in the 3d subshell. The formula for determining the number of electrons in a specific orbital depends on the value of l and n. For l = 2, we use the following equation:\n\n```\n(n - l + 1)^2 * n! / [l!(n - l)!]\n```\n\nwhere n is the principal quantum number and l is the angular momentum quantum number.\n\nApplying this formula to the case where l = 2, we get:\n\n```\n(4 - 2 + 1)^2 * 4! / [2!(4 - 2)!] = 6^2 * 4! / [2!*2!] = 36 * 12 / 4 = 81\n```\n\nTherefore, there are 81 electrons in the 3d subshell of gold, which means that there are 29 electrons in total in the Au atom. So the correct answer is C. 29."
