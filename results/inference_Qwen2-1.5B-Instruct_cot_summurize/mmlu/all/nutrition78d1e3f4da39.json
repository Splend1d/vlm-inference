Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary lifestyle: This refers to an increase in calorie intake relative to physical activity levels. The availability of high-calorie foods, lack of exercise, and increased sitting time are all contributing factors.\n\n  B. Decreased leisure-time activity: With modern lifestyles, people tend to spend less time engaging in physical activities like walking, running, or playing sports. This reduction in physical activity leads to weight gain over time.\n\n  C. Changes in genetic profiles: While genetics play a role in some individuals' susceptibility to obesity, it's not the only factor. Environmental influences such as diet, lifestyle choices, and access to unhealthy food options also contribute to obesity.\n\n  D. None of the options given is correct: While none of these options are incorrect individually, they collectively describe the complex interplay of environmental, social, and biological factors that contribute to the obesity epidemic."
