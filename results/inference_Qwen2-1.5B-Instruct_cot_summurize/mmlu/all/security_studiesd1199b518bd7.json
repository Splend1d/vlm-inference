The responsibility to prevent.\n\nR2P (Responsibility to Protect) was originally proposed by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 2004 as an international response to the Rwandan genocide and other genocides that had occurred since World War II. It states that when a state fails to protect its citizens from mass atrocities, the international community has a responsibility to intervene to save them. This principle emphasizes the importance of preventing mass atrocities before they occur rather than responding after the fact."
