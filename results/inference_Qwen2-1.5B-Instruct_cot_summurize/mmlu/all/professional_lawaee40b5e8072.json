It authorizes the president of either country to issue a proclamation nullifying any state or local laws in that country that have the effect of impeding imports from the other country. The foreign country uses the metric system of measurement, and thus all goods produced there and exported to the United States are packaged in metric sizes, such as liters and kilograms. A law of a state in the United States requires all goods sold in that state to be packaged in traditional American sizes, such as quarts or pounds. Because the state law substantially impedes imports from the foreign country, the President of the United States has issued a proclamation nullifying the state law pursuant to the treaty. Is the President's proclamation valid?\n\nA. No, because the Constitution vests in Congress the exclusive authority to specify binding legal standards for weights and measures, and the President therefore lacks constitutional authority for the proclamation.\nB. No, because the principles of federalism embedded in the Constitution prohibit the President from taking action to invalidate a state law.\nC. Yes, because it is authorized by a valid treaty of the United States and is not prohibited by any provision of the Constitution and, therefore, is the supreme law of the land.\nD. Yes, because the President has inherent authority to nullify any state law that substantially impedes commerce between substantially impedes commerce between the United States and another country.\n"

Yes, because it is authorized by a valid treaty of the United States and is not prohibited by any provision of the Constitution and, therefore, is the supreme law of the land.\n\nTreaties between the United States and foreign countries establish binding legal standards for weights and measures, which are enforced by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. Therefore, the President can use the provisions of the treaty to nullify state laws that substantially impair trade with foreign countries.\n\nHowever, the President does not have inherent authority to nullify state laws without congressional approval. The principles of federalism require that the powers granted to the states and the federal government be compatible with each other. In this case, the President's proclamation may be considered an exercise of his executive power to enforce the terms of the treaty, but it would still be subject to judicial review to ensure that it complies with the Constitution.\n\nIn summary, the President's proclamation is valid if it complies with the treaty and is not preempted by the Constitution."
