No, technological and institutional innovations have permitted food supplies to more than keep pace with population growth.\nB. Yes, it is only because of widespread famines that population has not overwhelmed food supplies altogether.\nC. No, but it is only because of the introduction of genetically modified food that supplies have kept pace with population growth.\nD. No, but supplies are not likely to keep pace with population growth over the next 10 years.\n"

Malthus was an English economist who made many predictions about the future of humanity based on his theory of population control. However, he never accurately predicted the rate at which populations would grow or how food production would respond.\n\nMalthus's prediction was that as populations increased, food production would increase proportionally, meaning there would be enough food for everyone. However, this assumption was based on the idea that people could work harder and longer hours to produce more food. In reality, this did not always happen, especially during times of war or famine. This led to overcrowding, malnutrition, and other negative consequences.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. No, but supplies are not likely to keep pace with population growth over the next 10 years."
