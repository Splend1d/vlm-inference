It occurs when people assume that if two events happen together, one event must have caused the other, even though this may not be true due to multiple possible causes.\n\nFor example, if someone believes that eating chocolate causes tooth decay, they may not realize that there could be other factors such as poor oral hygiene or diet that contribute to tooth decay in addition to chocolate consumption. Similarly, if someone believes that getting sick after taking antibiotics means that the antibiotics caused the illness, but this is not necessarily true because there could be other reasons for the sickness.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer."
