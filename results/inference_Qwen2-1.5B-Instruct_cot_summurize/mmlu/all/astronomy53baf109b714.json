The Cassini division is a wide ring system that lies between two large gaps in Saturn's rings, and it is the most widely known and studied part of Saturn's rings. It is also referred to as the \"dark\" or \"dusty\" ring because of its lack of bright stars within it. The Cassini division is named after the NASA spacecraft that was launched in 1997 to study Saturn and its moons."
