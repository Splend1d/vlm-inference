This is equivalent to finding the area under the curve to the left of x=2,500 in the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution).\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, the probability that a randomly selected loaf would be less than or equal to 2,500 loaves is approximately 0.8333.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. 0.8333**."
