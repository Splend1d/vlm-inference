She says her heart is \"racing\" and she is coughing up a small amount of bloodstreaked sputum. Medical history is significant for hypothyroidism, for which she takes levothyroxine. An intravenous catheter is placed. Vital signs are temperature 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse 132/min, respirations 32/min, and blood pressure 135/78 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen via nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Auscultation of the lungs discloses decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally. Cardiac examination discloses an irregularly irregular rhythm, an indistinct point of maximal impulse, and a loud S1. A grade 3/6, low-pitched, diastolic, rumbling murmur is audible at the apex; a distinct snapping sound precedes the murmur. Fetal heart rate is 144/min. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the findings in this patient?\n\nA. Chronic mitral regurgitation secondary to rheumatic heart disease\nB. Coarctation of the aorta\nC. Congenital aortic stenosis\nD. Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation\n"

Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation\n\nMitral stenosis can cause a decrease in left ventricular filling pressures, leading to symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. In patients with atrial fibrillation, the presence of a high-frequency component in the ECG leads to increased parasympathetic tone, which may exacerbate these symptoms. Additionally, the presence of a high-pitched, systolic, blowing diastolic murmur at the apex suggests the diagnosis of mitral stenosis. The absence of other significant cardiac findings supports the diagnosis of mitral stenosis."
