Cave paintings: Some of the oldest known cave paintings depict scenes of hunting, fishing, and other activities that suggest Neandertals had some form of art and social organization.\n\n2. Stone tools: Neandertals were skilled at making stone tools, such as knives and axes, which they used to hunt and prepare food. These tools show signs of advanced tool-making techniques and have been found in abundance at archaeological sites around Europe.\n\n3. Body adornment: While there is no direct evidence of Neandertals wearing jewelry or adornments, it is possible that they did so. The presence of body decorations in other early human cultures suggests that Neandertals may have also engaged in this type of cultural expression.\n\n4. Burial practices: Neandertals were likely buried alongside their dead, which provides evidence of their belief in an afterlife or spiritual beliefs. This practice is also common among modern humans and is thought to be related to religious or spiritual beliefs.\n\n5. Social structures: There is evidence from cave paintings and other artifacts that Neandertals may have lived in small groups or even families, which suggests they had some form of social organization.\n\nOverall, the evidence presented supports the idea that Neandertals were capable of producing complex stone tools, burying their dead, and engaging in artistic expression, all of which provide strong support for their existence."
