This is called a replay attack.\nReplay attacks occur when an attacker intercepts and retransmits data that was sent to them from a legitimate user. The attacker then uses this intercepted data to their advantage, such as stealing sensitive information or causing denial of service (DoS) attacks.\nIn order to defend against replay attacks, websites and systems can implement measures such as authentication, encryption, and rate limiting to prevent unauthorized access and limit the damage caused by replay attacks."
