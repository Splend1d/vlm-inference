Because they regard empiricism as a more reliable method by which to understand the concept of law.\n\nThe Scandinavian realists, such as Thorstein Veblen and Ragnar Frisch, rejected a metaphysical approach to law because they believed that empirical methods were more reliable for understanding legal concepts. They argued that laws should be understood as social constructs that emerge from the interaction between individuals and society, rather than being based on abstract principles or supernatural explanations.\n\nTheir approach was based on the idea that laws are formed through a process of negotiation and compromise among different groups within society, rather than being imposed by an external authority. This view was influenced by the work of Immanuel Kant, who argued that laws should be based on rational principles and not just on tradition or custom.\n\nOverall, the Scandinavian realists viewed law as a social construct that emerges from the interactions between individuals and society, and they rejected a metaphysical approach to law in favor of an empirical one."
