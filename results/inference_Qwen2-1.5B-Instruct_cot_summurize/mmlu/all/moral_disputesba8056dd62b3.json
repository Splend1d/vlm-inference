All of the above.\n\nAccording to Singer, international corporations that deal with corrupt dictators are analogous to murderers of those who witness crimes because they engage in unethical behavior by profiting from the oppression and suffering of others. They are also comparable to prostitutes who knowingly spread disease, as they facilitate illegal activities for profit. Additionally, they are similar to people who knowingly buy stolen goods, as they participate in the exploitation of vulnerable populations for financial gain. Therefore, all of these actions can be seen as morally reprehensible and should not be condoned or justified."
