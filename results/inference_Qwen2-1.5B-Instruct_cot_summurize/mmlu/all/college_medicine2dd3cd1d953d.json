Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria and are bound to carnitine, which acts as a carrier molecule for fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix. Coenzyme A (CoA) is involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, but it is not directly involved in their transport into the mitochondria. Thiokinase and acetyl-CoA are also involved in fatty acid metabolism, but they are not specific carriers for fatty acids into the mitochondria."
