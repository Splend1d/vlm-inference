This alliance was formed during the medieval period in India, where both classes were deeply affected by the harsh realities of life under the yoke of feudalism.\n\nLegalistic asceticism was a form of spiritual discipline that aimed at purifying one's mind through rigorous self-discipline and adherence to strict ethical codes. However, it often came with a heavy burden of austerity and sacrifice, which could be oppressive for the common people who were expected to follow these rules without question.\n\nIn contrast, the Kshatriyas, as rulers, sought to maintain their power and authority over the Shramanas, who served them as laborers and provided them with raw materials. The alliance between the two groups was thus shaped around mutual resentment towards the oppressive influence of legalistic asceticism and the desire to assert dominance over the Shramanas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Legalistic asceticism."
