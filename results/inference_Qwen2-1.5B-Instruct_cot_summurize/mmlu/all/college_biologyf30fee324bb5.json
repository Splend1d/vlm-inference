Eukarya utilize the general transcription factors TBP (TATA-binding protein) and TFIIB in transcription, whereas Bacteria do not. At least one member of Archaea has a protein similar to TBP and a protein similar to TFIIB. Based on this observation, which of the following scenarios is most likely?\n\nA. Archaea and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Bacteria.\nB. Archaea and Bacteria diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Eukarya.\nC. Bacteria and Eukarya diverged after their common ancestor diverged from Archaea.\nD. Archaea, Eukarya, and Bacteria diverged simultaneously from a common ancestor.\n"

However, there is no evidence provided to suggest that they diverged at the same time or from the same ancestral state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. Archaea, Eukarya, and Bacteria diverged simultaneously from a common ancestor. This scenario is consistent with the idea that these domains of life emerged independently and evolved separately from each other over time."
