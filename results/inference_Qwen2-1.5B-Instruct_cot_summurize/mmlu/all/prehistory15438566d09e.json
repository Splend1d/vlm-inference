These paintings were typically made by prehistoric humans using natural pigments and techniques such as scratching and smearing. The lion man is particularly notable for its realistic depiction of a human face and body, suggesting that the artists had developed a level of skill and artistic expression beyond what was previously thought possible at that time."
