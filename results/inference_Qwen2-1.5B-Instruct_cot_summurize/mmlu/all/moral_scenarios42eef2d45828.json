This action goes against ordinary moral standards regarding safety and environmental responsibility. \n\nIn scenario 2, wearing a clown costume to a funeral may be seen as disrespectful or inappropriate by some people, particularly if the person being mourned was not known for their clownishness. However, this is subjective and depends on cultural norms and individual beliefs about appropriate attire at funerals. Therefore, while it may not align with universal moral standards, it's not necessarily considered morally wrong based on the given information."
