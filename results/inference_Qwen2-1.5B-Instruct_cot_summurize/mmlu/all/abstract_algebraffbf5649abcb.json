This follows from the properties of direct product and Lagrange's theorem in group theory.\nStatement 2: The first part of the statement is false. There exist non-abelian groups of order 2p for any prime p (e.g., the dihedral group D_4). However, the second part is true. Any group of order 2p is cyclic if and only if it has exactly one subgroup of order p, which can be proven using the Sylow theorems or other group-theoretic methods. Therefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
