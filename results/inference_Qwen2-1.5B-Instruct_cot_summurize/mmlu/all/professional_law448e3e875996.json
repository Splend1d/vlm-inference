In light of the defendant's lengthy juvenile criminal history, which included violent offenses, and the fact that armed robbery is a crime of violence, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Did the life-without-parole sentence violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment?\n\nA. No, because a juvenile may be sentenced to life without parole if release would pose a danger to the community.\nB. No, because the Eighth Amendment does not apply outside the context of capital punishment.\nC. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\nD. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for an adult or juvenile defendant convicted of a nonviolent offense.\n"

Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\n\nUnder the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. This means that any punishment must be imposed according to fair procedures and must not be excessive in relation to the penalty prescribed by law for the particular crime committed.\n\nIn the case of a juvenile defendant who has committed a nonhomicide offense, the Eighth Amendment does not apply because it only applies to capital punishment cases. Therefore, the court did not have the authority to impose a life-without-parole sentence based solely on the severity of the crime.\n\nIt is worth noting that while the Eighth Amendment prohibits certain punishments, it does not prohibit all forms of punishment. The Supreme Court has held that the Eighth Amendment may apply to cases involving juveniles, but only when the state has a compelling interest in imposing such a sentence. Additionally, some states have laws that allow for life-without-parole sentences for juveniles who commit serious crimes, but these laws must meet certain constitutional requirements."
