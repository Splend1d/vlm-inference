The condition causes the body's immune system to attack healthy tissue, leading to inflammation and scarring. One of the most common features of SSc is arachnodactyly, which refers to a shortened or curled finger or toe. This is often associated with the disease and can help in making a diagnosis.\n\nThe other options are not accurate:\n\n- Systemic Sclerosis does affect both males and females equally.\n- Telangiectasia (a type of vascular abnormality) may occur in some cases but is not specific to SSc.\n- A beaked-shaped nose and waxy skin are not characteristic features of SSc.\n- Waxy skin is often seen in patients with psoriasis, which is different from SSc."
