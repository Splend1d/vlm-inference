Increases decreases deficit\n\nIn an economy experiencing prolonged periods of growth, there is typically a rise in tax revenues due to increased economic activity and productivity. However, this increase in tax revenue may not necessarily lead to an increase in government spending on welfare programs. This can occur if the government prioritizes other areas such as infrastructure development or military expenditures.\n\nIf the government does prioritize welfare programs during times of economic expansion, it could potentially create a budget deficit rather than a surplus. This is because increased spending on welfare programs would reduce the available funds for other areas, which could lead to a decrease in overall tax revenue and an increase in the deficit. Conversely, if the government decides to cut back on welfare programs when the economy slows down, it could result in a decrease in tax revenues but also a reduction in spending on welfare programs, leading to a surplus instead of a deficit."
