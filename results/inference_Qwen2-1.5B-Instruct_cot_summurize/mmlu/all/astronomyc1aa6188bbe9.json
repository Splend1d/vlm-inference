The average Earth-like planet receives about 1380 W/m2. \n\nLet's calculate how much light Europa would receive if it had the same luminosity as the Sun.\n\nThe luminosity of Europa can be calculated by multiplying its radius and surface area with the luminosity of the Sun:\n\nLuminosity(Europa) = Luminosity(Sun) * (Surface Area(Europa)) / (4\u03c0r^2)\n\nwhere r is the radius of Europa in meters.\n\nGiven:\n- Surface area of Europa: 4\u03c0(1.7\u00d710^10 m)^2 \u2248 1.4\u00d710^16 m^2\n- Luminosity of the Sun: 3.9 \u00d7 10^26 watts\n\nWe want to find the luminosity of Europa when it has the same luminosity as the Sun, so we set the equation equal to the luminosity of the Sun and solve for Luminosity(Europa):\n\nLuminosity(Europa) = 3.9 \u00d7 10^26 watts = 1.4\u00d710^16 m^2 * Luminosity(Europa) / (4\u03c0r^2)\n\nSolving this equation gives us the value of r:\n\nr \u2248 sqrt((4\u03c0*1.4\u00d710^16 m^2 * 3.9 \u00d7 10^26 watts) / (1.4\u00d710^16 m^2))\n\nr \u2248 1.44 \u00d7 10^9 meters\n\nSo, the radius of Europa is approximately 1.44 x 10^9 meters or 1.44 x 10^6 km.\n\nNow, let's convert the luminosity of the Sun back into a dimensionless number since we're comparing brightness relative to the Sun:\n\n1380 W/m^2 * (1.44 x 10^6 m) / (4\u03c0(1.7x10^10 m)^2) \u2248 1380 W/m^2 * (1.44 x 10^6 m) / (5.4 x 10^24 m^2)\n\nThis calculation shows that the luminosity of Europa is approximately 1380/1.44 x 10^6 = 100 times greater than the Sun's luminosity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 100 times brighter."
