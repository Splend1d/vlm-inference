The wall construction is believed to be of high quality and requires advanced engineering skills that are typically associated with more developed civilizations like Egypt or Rome. Therefore, it is likely that the walls were built by an advanced civilization that had access to resources and technology beyond what was available in sub-Saharan Africa at the time. It is also possible that the walls were built by European colonizers who established themselves in the region and used their own architectural techniques to build the structures. However, this is just speculation based on current knowledge and there is no concrete evidence to support any particular theory."
