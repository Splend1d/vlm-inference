Causal harm refers to harm caused by someone's words or actions, while expressive harm refers to harm caused by someone's words or actions being expressed in public. By addressing both types of harm, speech codes can help ensure that individuals are not subjected to harmful speech or expression.\n\nIt is important to note that Altman does not explicitly state that only one kind of harm will have the best prospects for success with speech codes. Instead, he suggests that addressing both types of harm is more likely to result in successful outcomes than focusing on one type at the expense of the other."
