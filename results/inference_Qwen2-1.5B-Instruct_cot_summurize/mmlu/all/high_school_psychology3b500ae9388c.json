When light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea and then enters the pupil, which is the circular opening at the center of the iris. The size of the pupil can be controlled by the iris, allowing more or less light to enter the eye depending on the activity of the eye muscles. So when light enters the eye, it first goes through the cornea and then into the pupil, not the lens or retina."
