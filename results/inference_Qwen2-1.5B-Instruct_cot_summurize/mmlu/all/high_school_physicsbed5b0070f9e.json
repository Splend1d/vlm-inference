Therefore, in this case, each cart will experience the same force, time of collision, and change in kinetic energy.\n\nCollision B involves a ball sticking to a rigid rod. The ball sticks to the rod, causing the rod to rotate about its center of mass. This rotation causes the rod to have an angular acceleration (torque) due to the applied force.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is:\n\nC. Collision A: Each cart experiences the same force, time of collision, and change in kinetic energy. Collision B: The ball and the rod each experience the same torque, time of collision, and change in angular momentum."
