The complaint sought $50,000 in damages and alleged that the entrepreneur's use of the name \u00d2Best Hot Sauce\u00d3 infringed the company's federal trademark. The entrepreneur filed an answer denying the allegations, and the parties began discovery. Six months later, the entrepreneur moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the court grant the entrepreneur's motion?\n\nA. No, because the company's claim arises under federal law.\nB. No, because the entrepreneur waived the right to chal-lenge subject-matter jurisdiction by not raising the issue initially by motion or in the answer.\nC. Yes, because although the claim arises under federal law, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.\nD. Yes, because although there is diversity, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.\n"

Yes, because although there is diversity between the states where the plaintiff and defendant are located, the amount in controversy is not satisfied.\n\nThe question involves the application of the concept of subject-matter jurisdiction in federal courts. Subject-matter jurisdiction refers to the power of a federal court to hear and decide cases that fall within its specific area of expertise or competence. In this case, the plaintiff claims that the defendant's use of a trademark infringes their rights, which is a matter of federal law (as evidenced by the reference to federal trademark infringement). Therefore, the court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this claim.\n\nHowever, the plaintiff also alleges that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional limits set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1) - (4), which provides that the court lacks jurisdiction if the amount in controversy is less than $75,000, or if the dispute is about a claim arising under state law, or if the relief claimed does not exceed $75,000.\n\nIn this case, the amount in controversy is $50,000, which falls below the jurisdictional limit. Thus, the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the claim based on the amount in controversy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Yes, because although there is diversity between the states where the plaintiff and defendant are located, the amount in controversy is not satisfied."
