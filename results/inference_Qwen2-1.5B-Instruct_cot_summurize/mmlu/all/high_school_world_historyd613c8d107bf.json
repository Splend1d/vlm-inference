W. de Klerk\n\nThe poem mentions that Sharpeville, South Africa, symbolizes the end of apartheid, which was the system of institutionalized discrimination in South Africa. The poem states that the \"classic event\" of Sharpeville was when police fired at unarmed protesters, killing many. This event marked the end of apartheid because it showed the brutality and violence used by the government against its own people.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct, as the election of F. W. de Klerk in 1994 marked the end of apartheid in South Africa."
