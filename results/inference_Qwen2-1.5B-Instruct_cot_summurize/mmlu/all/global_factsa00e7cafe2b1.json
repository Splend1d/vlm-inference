The percentage of children in Vietnam who report physical punishment by teachers can vary widely depending on various factors such as age group, location, and socio-economic status. Additionally, there may be other factors that influence whether or not children experience physical punishment at school, such as cultural norms and educational policies. Therefore, it is important to gather more information before making any assumptions or conclusions about the percentage of children who have experienced physical punishment by teachers in Vietnam."
