However, this does not necessarily mean that the log-likelihood will always increase. It depends on various factors such as the nature of the likelihood function and the optimization process being followed. \n\nRegarding Q-learning, while it's correct that it requires some prior knowledge of the environment to work effectively, it can still be used even if the agent doesn't have any prior information about its environment. The key aspect is that the agent learns from experience by interacting with the environment and making decisions based on those experiences. So, the choice between Q-learning and other methods like SARSA or DQN, which do not require any prior knowledge, depends on the specific problem at hand and the resources available for experimentation. Therefore, the answer would be B. False, False."
