It is responsible for converting several molecules into carbon dioxide, water, and ATP.\n\nIn the Krebs cycle, oxygen is required because it acts as an electron acceptor during the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. This process generates a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, which drives the synthesis of ATP using the energy stored in the ADP-ATP ratio. The final step of the cycle involves the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ via the electron transport chain, where oxygen is consumed as a byproduct."
