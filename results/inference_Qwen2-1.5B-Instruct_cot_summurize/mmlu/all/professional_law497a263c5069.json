A deposition of a person against whom another person contemplates filing an action may be compelled by the party contemplating the action, without leave of court, before the action is filed.\n\nII. A deposition of the defendant in an action may be taken by the plaintiff without service of a subpoena on the defendant.\n\nIII. A deposition may be taken even though all the testimony secured by it will be inadmissible at the trial.\n\nIt's important to note that the right to compel a deposition is limited by the requirement that the party contemplating the action must have served a notice of intent to sue on the person against whom the deposition is sought, unless the person has waived this right under certain circumstances. Additionally, the testimony taken during the deposition cannot be used as evidence at trial if the person being deposed is unavailable for cross-examination due to a lack of personal knowledge or inability to recall facts relevant to the case."
