In this case, there are four pairs of electrons involved: one from the nitrogen atom and three from the oxygen atoms.\n\nSince the nitrogen atom has four electrons and the oxygen atoms have eight electrons each, they can share these electrons equally. This results in:\n\n- One sigma bond between the nitrogen atom and the oxygen atom (each donating one electron)\n- Three pi bonds between the oxygen atoms\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 3 sigma and 1 pi."
