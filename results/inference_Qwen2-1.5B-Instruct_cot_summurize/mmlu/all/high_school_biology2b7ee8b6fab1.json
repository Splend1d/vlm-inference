This can be achieved through changes in gene expression, such as altering the sequence of DNA or the way that certain genes are expressed at different stages of development.\n\nDifferentiation occurs at various stages during embryonic development and continues throughout life in many tissues. The cells in different tissues contain different sets of genes, leading to structural and functional differences. These differences arise from changes in gene expression patterns, rather than differences in the reading frames of mRNAs or spontaneous morphogenesis.\n\nTherefore, the most correct answer is:\n\nA. Cells in different tissues contain different sets of genes, leading to structural and functional differences."
