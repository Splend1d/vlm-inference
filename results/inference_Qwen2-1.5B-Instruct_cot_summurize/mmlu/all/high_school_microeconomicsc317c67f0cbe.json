A consumer pays more for a pizza than she thought it was worth at the margin of the purchase.\n\nIn this scenario, the consumer bought a pizza and paid more than they would have if they had not purchased it. This excess payment represents the consumer's surplus because it is an additional amount of money that the consumer received over what they would have paid otherwise. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
