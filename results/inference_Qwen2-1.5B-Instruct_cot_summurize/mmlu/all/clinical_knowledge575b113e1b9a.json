This process involves several steps and generates energy through the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). In the first step of glycolysis, one molecule of glucose is converted into two molecules of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG), which then undergoes a series of reactions that produce three molecules of ATP and one molecule of NADH + H+, as well as other products such as CO2 and H2O. Therefore, the net formation of ATP during glycolysis is three molecules per molecule of glucose."
