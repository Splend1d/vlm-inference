Two officers testified that they examined \"track\" marks on the defendant's arms and wrists, and that he admitted to past drug usage. The accused testified that he was not an addict and the marks were from an allergic reaction. The trial court instructed the jury that it could find him guilty on proof that he was an addict, without proof of drug usage. The jury did not believe the defendant's denials, and found him guilty based on the observed track marks. The court sentenced him to six months imprisonment. He appealed, claiming cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. Will the conviction likely be reversed on appeal?\n\nA. No, because the arrest is based on the regular use of illegal narcotics and is a proper concern of the criminal law.\nB. No, because the state has the power to forbid the use of narcotics within its borders and that's what this statute does.\nC. Yes, because the statute makes it criminal to use illegal drugs, which constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\nD. Yes, because the statute punishes having the illness of drug addiction, which is like punishing someone for having a cold, and it is thus cruel and unusual punishment.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C: Yes, because the statute makes it criminal to have the illness of drug addiction, which is considered cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment prohibits the government from imposing excessive penalties for crimes. In other words, the punishment must not be excessively harsh or disproportionate to the crime committed. The Supreme Court has held that laws that make drug addiction a crime can violate this constitutional prohibition if they result in overly harsh sentences.\n\nIn contrast, the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. However, the Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to drug possession offenses as long as the police have probable cause to suspect the presence of illegal drugs. Therefore, the fact that the man was arrested and charged with drug addiction alone does not automatically mean that his rights under the Fourth Amendment were violated.\n\nIn summary, the conviction is likely to be overturned on appeal because the statute making drug addiction a crime violates the Eighth Amendment by imposing overly harsh sentences for such a minor offense."
