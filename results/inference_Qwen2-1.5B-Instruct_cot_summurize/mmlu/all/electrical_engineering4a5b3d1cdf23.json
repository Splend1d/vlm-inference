Either series or parallel.\n\nA snubber circuit, also known as a surge suppressor, is an electronic device that is used to protect electrical equipment from high voltage spikes caused by lightning strikes, power surges, or other sources of sudden high current. It works by absorbing excess energy and preventing it from causing damage to the equipment.\n\nWhen using a snubber circuit with an SCR (Solid-State Relay), the snubber circuit can be connected either in series or parallel with the SCR. In a series connection, the snubber circuit is placed after the SCR and before the load. This allows the snubber circuit to absorb any excess energy generated by the SCR during operation. A parallel connection would involve placing the snubber circuit between the SCR and the load, allowing the snubber circuit to absorb any excess energy generated by the SCR when the load is not present.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is C. Either series or parallel."
