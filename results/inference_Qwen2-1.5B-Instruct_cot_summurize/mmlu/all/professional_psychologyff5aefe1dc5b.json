Useful for promoting an egalitarian relationship between the therapist and client.\n\nFeminist therapy emphasizes the importance of creating an environment where clients feel safe and supported, and where they can express their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or criticism from the therapist. Therapist self-disclosure can be seen as a way to build trust and establish a rapport with the client, which can help create a more supportive and empowering therapeutic relationship. However, it's important to note that therapist self-disclosure should not be used as a tool for manipulation or control, and should always be done in accordance with ethical guidelines and informed consent."
