This can include measures such as building infrastructure, deploying military forces, and maintaining diplomatic relations with other states. It also involves taking steps to prevent the spread of harmful ideologies or activities, such as propaganda campaigns or cyberattacks. Ultimately, security is about ensuring that individuals and communities have the tools and resources they need to thrive in their own environments."
