This trisomy results in an extra chromosome 13, which can cause various physical and developmental abnormalities depending on the specific genetic makeup of the individual. However, it is generally less severe than other trisomies that involve an extra chromosome or two. The other options listed have more severe effects on human development, including intellectual disabilities, growth problems, and heart defects."
