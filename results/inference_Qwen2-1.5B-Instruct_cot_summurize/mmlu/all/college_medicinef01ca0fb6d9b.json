The subjects consist of undergraduate students at the university where the experiment is being conducted. The subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, are given either 15 minutes or 30 minutes to learn the facts, and are asked to recall the facts either in the same room in which they learned the facts or in a very different, unfamiliar setting. Which of the following are dependent variables in this experiment?\nI. The amount the subjects were compensated.\nII. The room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts.\nIII. The number of facts the subjects can recall.\nIV. The time the subjects were given to learn the facts.\n\nA. II only\nB. III only\nC. I and IV only\nD. I and III and IV only\n"
