It is used to describe the ways in which these relationships can be difficult to pin down or understand due to their fluid and dynamic nature. The concept of thick space suggests that the international is not simply a series of hierarchical structures or binary oppositions, but rather a more nuanced and interconnected system of power and influence. Therefore, option C (countries that are oppressed or marginalised within imperial readings of IR) is a correct answer."
