Then we have:\n\\[a_n = a_{n-1} \\cdot r\\]\nfor all $n > 1$.\nWe want to find the fifth term, so we substitute $n = 5$, $a_{n-1} = a_4$, and $a_1 = 2$ into the equation above:\n\\[a_5 = a_4 \\cdot r = (a_3 \\cdot r) \\cdot r = (a_2 \\cdot r^2) \\cdot r = (a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}) \\cdot r = (2 \\cdot r^{n-2}) \\cdot r = 2r^{n-2+1} = 2r^{n-1}\\]\nNow we can substitute $n = 5$:\n\\[a_5 = 2r^{5-1} = 2r^4 = 2(-2)^4 = 2(16) = 32.\\]\nSo the fifth term is 32.\nThe answer is: B. 32"
