Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. A skull x-ray shows a linear, nondepressed basal skull fracture. Two weeks later, the patient develops polyuria and polydipsia. Laboratory studies show a serum glucose concentration within the reference range, increased serum osmolality, and decreased urine osmolality. Following the administration of desmopressin, urine osmolality increases. The beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to activation of which of the following?\n\nA. Adenylyl cyclase\nB. Ca2+ channels\nC. Janus kinase\nD. Serine kinase\n"

This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), which activates protein kinase A (PKA) and stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone is known to increase urine osmolality by increasing sodium reabsorption and decreasing water reabsorption in the kidneys.\nTherefore, the answer is A. Adenylyl cyclase."
