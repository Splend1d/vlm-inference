Therefore, when using the ideal gas law with these conditions, we can rearrange the equation to solve for V:\n\nV = (nRT)/(P)\n\nSince the value of R cancels out, we can see that the units of V will be m^3/mol, or liters per mole. So, when using the ideal gas law at standard temperature and pressure conditions, we would expect the result to be in liters per mole, regardless of the value of n.\n\nNow let's consider the other options:\n- A. 0 K and 0 torr: This is not possible because the temperature must be positive.\n- B. 25\u00b0C and 1 atmosphere pressure: This option gives a value for V in atmospheres, not liters.\n- D. 0\u00b0F and 1 atmosphere pressure: This option also does not make sense since temperature cannot be negative and pressure must be in atmospheres.\n\nTherefore, the only valid answer is C. 0\u00b0C and 760 torr."
