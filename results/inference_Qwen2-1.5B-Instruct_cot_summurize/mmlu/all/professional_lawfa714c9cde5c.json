They retained a reverter back to themselves, however, as follows: \"RESERVATION in favor of the Grantors, their heirs and assigns, an automatic reverter, should the property conveyed herein ever be mortgaged or encumbered within the life time of either Grantor.\" After husband died, the niece mortgaged the property. Can the surviving wife enforce the automatic reverter putting title back in herself?\n\nA. No, this is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\nB. No, an automatic reverter is unenforceable.\nC. Yes, the provision can be enforced because the grantors and the grantee were blood relatives in pari mutual.\nD. Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.\n"

                    "text": "The provision in question is likely an enforceable restriction on alienation under common law principles of equitable servitudes. An automatic reverter is a form of such a restraint that allows the owner of a property to retain possession until the property is sold, mortgaged, or otherwise transferred to another party without the consent of the original owner. The provision in question gives the grantors an automatic right to reclaim the property if it is mortgaged during their lifetime, which is not uncommon in estate planning documents.\n\nUnder the common law principle of equitable servitude, the court will look at the fairness of the restriction and determine whether it is reasonable. In this case, the court would consider whether the grantors had a legitimate interest in protecting the property from being encumbered by debt, and whether the provision was necessary to achieve that goal.\n\nIf the court determines that the provision is reasonable, then the surviving wife could potentially enforce it through a legal action to remove the mortgage. However, if the court finds that the provision is unreasonable, then the wife may have no remedy against the niece's breach of the agreement.\n\nIn summary, while there may be some uncertainty around the specific language of the provision, in general, an automatic reverter is a valid form of equitable restraint on alienation that can be enforced in certain circumstances."
