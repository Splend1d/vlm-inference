As the hiker came around a bend in the trail, he suddenly saw a hunter standing next to the trail, looking in the other direction. The hunter was holding a rifle. The hunter turned, causing the rifle to be pointed at the hiker. The hiker felt sure that he was going to get shot, but the gun did not go off. The hiker asserts a claim for assault against the hunter. In his action, the most likely result is that the hiker will\n\nA. recover, because the hunter's rifle was pointed directly at him.\nB. recover, because the hunter's decision to carry the gun was voluntary.\nC. not recover, unless the hunter intended to scare the hiker.\nD. not recover, if the hunter did not intend to shoot the hiker.\n"

For an assault claim to succeed, the defendant must have acted with the specific intent to cause fear in the plaintiff. If the defendant did not intend to cause harm or fear, then they cannot be held liable for assault. \n\nIn this case, it is unclear whether the hunter intended to shoot the hiker or simply wanted to scare them. Without more information about the defendant's intentions, it is impossible to determine whether the hiker would recover in their action. Therefore, the most likely result is that the hiker would not recover based on the facts provided."
