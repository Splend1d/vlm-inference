The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the stadium was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. Assume that three years after the stadium had been in operation, a subsequent session of the state legislature passed a bill entirely prohibiting baseball because four players were killed in playing mishaps. This statute is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.\nB. constitutional, because of the clear and present danger of baseball playing in the state.\nC. unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders'contract.\nD. unconstitutional, because it violates the due process rights of the baseball team owners.\n"

However, when the state legislature passed a bill prohibiting baseball play, it interfered with the contractual obligations of the bondholders. This is a violation of their right to receive compensation for the use of their property as agreed upon in the bond agreement. Therefore, this act is unconstitutional."
