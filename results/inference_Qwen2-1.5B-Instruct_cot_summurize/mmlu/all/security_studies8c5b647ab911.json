Military warfare enhances the ability of people's access to resources and to aid the development in ecologically sustainable ways; it can secure access routes and rights that would otherwise be denied; rebuild infrastructure and equitable access of resources; benefit the management of environmental problems; and also to bolster social institutions and cohesion.\nB. It is when considering the military and the security institutions that some of the greatest contradictions with the concept of environmental security are raised. War impacts negatively on the sustainable growth of the nation but armed forces may be required to manage the effects.\nC. Stronger militaries and technological advances have reduced the negative impact on the environment having greater impact with fewer materials, whilst the spectre of mass destruction warfare has been reduced with the ending of the Cold War.\nD. All of these options.\n"

By rebuilding infrastructure and equitable access to resources, the military can help mitigate environmental problems. Additionally, the military can benefit from managing environmental issues and strengthening social institutions and cohesion.\n\nB) While military activities can lead to negative impacts on the environment due to their destructive nature, they are necessary for national security and stability. Therefore, the military must be managed carefully to minimize its negative impact while still being able to protect the country.\n\nC) Technological advancements such as renewable energy sources and sustainable materials have made war less destructive and more environmentally friendly. However, the specter of mass destruction warfare remains a concern, even if it has been reduced with the end of the Cold War.\n\nD) All of these options are correct, as each option highlights a different aspect of how the military can contribute to environmental security."
