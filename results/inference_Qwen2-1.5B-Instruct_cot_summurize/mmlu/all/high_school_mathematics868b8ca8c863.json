Therefore, if one side of a triangle is 4 units long and another side is 12 units long, then the third side must also be 12 units long for the triangle to be isosceles.\n\nHowever, if we take the sides as given in option C (4, 12, 12), none of these values can form an isosceles triangle because they do not satisfy the condition of having two equal sides. The sum of any two sides of a triangle must always be greater than the third side, which means that 4 + 12 = 16 cannot be true for an isosceles triangle with sides of lengths 4, 12, and 12.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 4,12,12."
