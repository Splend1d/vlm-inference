The crops that were domesticated before groups became sedentary were typically those that could be grown in arid or semi-arid environments, such as wheat and barley, which were domesticated in the Near East around 10,000 years ago. These crops were then brought to Europe by nomadic peoples who had access to them through trade networks. Other crops that were domesticated in Europe include potatoes, tomatoes, and maize."
