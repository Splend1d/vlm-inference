This does not lead to a contradiction.\n\nFor case 2, the counterexample would be if K is false and L is true, in which case the conclusion is true but the premise is false. Again, this does not lead to a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Invalid. Counterexample when L is true and K is false."
