In this scenario, the female fruit fly carries the recessive allele for gray body and vestigial wings, while the male fruit fly carries the dominant allele for black body and normal wings. When they mate, the female's allele segregates to her daughters, who will all have the recessive allele for gray body and vestigial wings. Her sons, on the other hand, will receive the dominant allele from his mother, resulting in vestigial-winged males. This results in a high proportion of gray-body, vestigial-winged offspring."
