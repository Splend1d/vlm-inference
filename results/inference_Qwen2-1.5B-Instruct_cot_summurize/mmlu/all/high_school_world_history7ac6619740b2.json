The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, 1.4 billion strong.\nIndonesian leader Sukarno, keynote address to the Bandung Conference, 1955\nThe passage above is most associated with which of the following developments?\n\nA. The formation of the non-aligned movement\nB. Global disarmanent and nuclear non-proliferation\nC. The Green Revolution in agriculture\nD. Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology\n"

The formation of the non-aligned movement\n\nThe reference text mentions \"the peoples of Asia and Africa,\" which aligns with the objectives of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) formed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1960. NAM was established as an alternative to the Soviet Union-led bloc known as the Warsaw Pact and sought to promote international cooperation among nations without aligning themselves with either the Western or Eastern Bloc.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The formation of the non-aligned movement."
