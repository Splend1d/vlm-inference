This action is not explicitly illegal or immoral, but it goes against common culinary practices that involve waiting for the tomatoes to ripen fully before using them. Therefore, this action can be considered morally questionable, but it is not necessarily morally wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, in scenario 2, the main character knocked over a standing stone at an old quarry. This action could potentially cause harm to people or property if not done carefully. It is also dangerous and may violate laws related to property damage or trespassing. Therefore, this action is definitely morally wrong."
