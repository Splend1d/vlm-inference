A higher learning rate can lead to faster convergence but also more sensitive to small changes in the input data. On the other hand, a lower learning rate may require more iterations to converge, but it is less sensitive to random initialization or perturbations of the input data.\n\nStatement 2 is false because dropout is not a technique that multiplies randomly chosen activation values by zero. Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning models to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out some neurons during training. This ensures that each neuron has an equal chance of being active at any given time, which helps in reducing the complexity of the model and improving its generalization ability. The value of the dropped-out neuron is then replaced with the mean of the remaining activations, which is typically set to zero."
