The funding for Head Start comes from a variety of sources, including grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and other federal agencies. Some of these grants may be categorized as categorical grants, which refer to funds that are specifically designated for a particular purpose or program. In this case, the Head Start program receives funding through categorical grants, which means that the specific use of the funds is determined by the HHS and other federal agencies."
