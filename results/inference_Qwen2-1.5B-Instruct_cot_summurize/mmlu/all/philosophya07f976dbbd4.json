In his book \"On the Essence of Empirical Knowledge\", Anscombe argues that Kant's concept of the categorical imperative, which states that one should only do what one would want everyone else to do in similar circumstances, is not applicable to individuals. Instead, she suggests that individuals should be free to act according to their own desires and inclinations, provided they do not harm others or violate moral rules that apply to all rational beings. Therefore, Anscombe criticizes Kant's idea of legislating for oneself."
