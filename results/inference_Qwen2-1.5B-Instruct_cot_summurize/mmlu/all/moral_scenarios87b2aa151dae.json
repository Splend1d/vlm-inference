It violates the trust that students place in their teachers and peers, and it undermines the integrity of the educational process.\nScenario 2 is not considered morally wrong because telling someone else's crush in private is generally considered acceptable behavior. However, it may be considered inappropriate or insensitive if done in a way that could potentially harm the person's feelings or cause them distress. Additionally, sharing such information with others without consent can also be seen as disrespectful or unprofessional."
