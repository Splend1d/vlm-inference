The landowner, who is a resident of the state, has been informed by his attorney that his sales agreement with the farmer is null and void under state law. Which of the following is the best constitutional argument to contest the validity of the state statute?\n\nA. The contract clause prohibition against a state from enacting any law that will impair the obligation of contracts.\nB. The privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nC.

The contract clause prohibition against a state from enacting any law that will impair the obligation of contracts.\n\nThis argument argues that the state's law preventing non-residents from owning agricultural land in the state violates the principle that contracts should not be affected by laws that are discriminatory or unjust. In this case, the contract between the farmer and landowner is being impaired by the state law, so it may be considered invalid."
