However, based on common philosophical perspectives, it seems likely that they would hold some form of belief in morality.\n\nIf Wolf believes that morality is merely a cultural artifact, then they may view it as something that arises from social interactions and norms rather than being an inherent part of human nature or the universe itself. This could suggest that moral decisions and values are subject to change over time and can be influenced by factors such as culture, society, and personal experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, if Wolf believes that morality is not really relevant to our lives, then they may argue that morality is just one aspect of larger issues such as ethics, justice, and fairness, which are often more fundamental concerns for individuals and societies. In this case, morality might be seen as a tool for achieving these broader goals, but it is not necessarily the most important or defining aspect of life.\n\nFinally, if Wolf believes that morality does not provide a comprehensive guide to conduct, then they may argue that different cultures, societies, and individuals have different understandings and applications of morality, and that what is considered \"right\" or \"wrong\" can vary widely depending on context and perspective. In this case, morality might be seen as a complex and multifaceted concept with no single universal definition or application."
