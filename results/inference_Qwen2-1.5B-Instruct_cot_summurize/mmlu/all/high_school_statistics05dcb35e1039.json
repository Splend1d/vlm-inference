In an experiment, the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable; in an observational study, he or she simply observes and records the observations.\nC. Experiments must use randomized treatment and control groups; observational studies also use treatment and control groups, but they do not need to be randomized.\nD.

In an experiment, the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable; in an observational study, he or she simply observes and records the observations.\n\nIn an experiment, researchers manipulate one or more variables to determine whether changes occur as a result of that manipulation. For example, they might test different teaching methods to see which one leads to better student performance. The results of this experiment would provide evidence about what works best for certain students.\n\nAn observational study, on the other hand, involves observing behaviors without trying to influence them. Researchers might watch people's interactions with each other during a social event to understand how different factors affect their behavior. This type of study does not involve any manipulation of variables.\n\nThe other options provided (A, C, and D) are incorrect because:\n\n- A. Experiments can be conducted on both human and non-human subjects.\n- C. Experiments typically don't require randomization of treatments, while observational studies often do.\n- D. Observational studies may sometimes involve double-blind procedures if the participants are aware of who is conducting the study, but it isn't required for all types of studies."
