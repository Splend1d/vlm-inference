Higher government funding of research on clean energy supplies\n\nFaster rates of economic growth can be promoted by various factors, but one key factor is investing in technology and innovation that leads to new sources of production or efficiency improvements. This could include investments in renewable energy technologies like solar and wind power, as well as advancements in materials science and other areas that enable greater productivity.\n\nIn contrast, a more restrictive immigration policy, negative net investment, higher taxes on households and firms, and lower government funding for research and development are all likely to slow down economic growth by limiting access to skilled labor, reducing capital formation, and discouraging innovation."
