                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The proton will be bent in a circular path.\n\nWhen a charged particle (such as an electron or proton) enters a magnetic field, it experiences a force that causes it to follow a curved path called a Lorentz force. This force is given by F = q(v x B), where F is the force on the particle, q is the charge of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nIn this case, the proton is entering a solenoid, which creates a strong magnetic field perpendicular to its direction of travel. As a result, the proton will experience a force directed perpendicular to both its velocity and the magnetic field. This force will cause the proton to move in a curved path around the center of the solenoid.\n\nSince the proton's velocity remains constant throughout the process, it will continue to move in a straight line for a short time before beginning to spiral inward due to the increasing curvature of its path. Over time, the proton will slow down as it approaches the ends of the solenoid, where the magnetic field becomes stronger and begins to exert more force on it. However, the overall effect will still be bending the proton into a circular path.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect because a parabolic path would not be possible with a uniform magnetic field without any external forces acting on the particle. Option C is also incorrect because the proton would not continue in a straight line at constant velocity if there were no force acting on it. Option D is incorrect because the proton's speed would decrease over time due to the increase in magnetic field strength near the ends of the solenoid, but it would not slow down to zero."
