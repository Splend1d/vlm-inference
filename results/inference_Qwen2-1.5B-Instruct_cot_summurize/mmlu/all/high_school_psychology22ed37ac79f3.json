Introductive speech.\n\nIntroductive speech is a stage in the development of language that typically occurs in infants and young children, but it is not universal across all cultures or languages. It refers to the use of simple words and phrases to communicate basic needs and desires. \n\nBabbling, telegraphic speech, and Telegraphic speech (also known as \"telegraphic babble\") are all stages in the development of language that occur earlier than introductive speech. Babbling is the use of noises or sounds to make communication before the ability to form words and sentences. Telegraphic speech is the use of short, repetitive sounds to communicate basic information. \n\nTherefore, the only stage in the development of language that is not one of the options listed is D. Introductive speech."
