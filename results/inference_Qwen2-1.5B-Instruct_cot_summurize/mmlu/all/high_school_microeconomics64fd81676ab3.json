This can result in lower consumer surplus, as consumers are paying more than they would if there were competition. Additionally, monopolies may also lead to reduced innovation and investment, as firms may be less willing to invest in new products or services due to concerns about market power. Overall, these factors can contribute to reduced economic welfare and social welfare."
