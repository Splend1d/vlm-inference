Mutations are the main source of all variation in a population.\n\nThe principle of evolution by natural selection states that organisms will tend to evolve towards becoming more similar to each other over time due to differences in their environment and chance mutations. However, this does not mean that mutations are the only source of variation in a population. Natural selection can also act on genetic variations, such as those caused by inherited traits or environmental pressures, to shape the distribution of populations within an ecosystem. Therefore, while mutations play a role in shaping the diversity of life on Earth, they are not the sole cause of evolutionary change."
