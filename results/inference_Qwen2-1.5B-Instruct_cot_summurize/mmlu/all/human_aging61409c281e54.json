Some may find it easier to cope with stress by using relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga, while others might prefer talking things out with friends or family members. Additionally, some older adults may turn to medication or therapy for help managing their symptoms. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to coping with stress in old age."
