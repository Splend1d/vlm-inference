One dark evening before the street lights turned on, Rover was chasing cars in the street, and Ginny Grandmother, aged 85, swerved to avoid hitting the dog. As she swerved, Ginny hit a parked car and suffered a head injury. If Ginny brings suit against Doug Dogman under a strict liability theory, the court will likely find for\n\nA. Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.\nB. Doug, because Retriever is a domesticated animal.\nC. Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.\nD. Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.\n"

Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.\n\nStrict liability is a legal doctrine that holds someone responsible for an injury caused by their actions even if they did not intend to harm anyone. However, this doctrine does not apply to animals unless they exhibit certain characteristics, such as being dangerous or vicious. In this case, the dog in question, Rover, was described as a good, friendly dog who loved to run and chase cars but had never hurt anyone. Therefore, the court would likely find for Doug Dogman based on the fact that he did not intend to harm anyone and that his dog was not known to be dangerous or vicious."
