Using professional judgment to select from among the tests or combinations of tests, depending upon the goals of the program.\n\nThe psychologist's role is to evaluate the effectiveness of the new school program based on its impact on the students' learning outcomes. Therefore, it is important to choose appropriate pre- and post-intervention measures that can accurately assess the changes in the students' behavior and performance.\n\nWhen evaluating the effectiveness of educational programs, it is common to use standardized tests as pre-intervention measures to determine the baseline level of achievement for the students. These tests can be administered before the program begins to see how well the students are prepared for the program. Post-intervention assessments can then be used to measure the extent to which the program has had an impact on the students' learning outcomes.\n\nIn this case, the psychologist would need to choose from among the available pre- and post-intervention measures to determine the most appropriate ones for the evaluation. It is not necessary to average the scores from the tests to increase their reliability and validity; rather, it is important to choose the best measures for the specific goals of the program.\n\nAdditionally, the psychologist may also consider the opinions of other professionals involved in the program, such as teachers and administrators, to ensure that the assessment criteria are relevant and valid. However, the decision to select the criteria ultimately lies with the psychologist and should be made based on their expertise and understanding of the program and its goals."
