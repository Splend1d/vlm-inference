Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder, and it has been shown that individuals with schizophrenia tend to have higher levels of dopamine in their brains. This suggests that excess dopamine or sensitivity to dopamine may play a role in the development of schizophrenia. However, there is no evidence to suggest that white patients are more symptomatic than people of other ethnicities. In fact, studies have found that African American patients have a lower rate of diagnosis of schizophrenia compared to other racial groups. Additionally, remission rates for schizophrenia can vary depending on many factors such as the severity of symptoms, treatment adherence, and individual differences in response to medication. Therefore, while it is true that some individuals with schizophrenia experience high levels of dopamine in their brains, this does not necessarily mean that white patients are more symptomatic."
