They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S. Truman, 1947\nThe ideas expressed in the passage above most directly reflect which of the following continuities in U.S. history?\n\nA. Debates about the relationship between Congress and the president.\nB. Debates about the use of military force in volatile situations.\nC. Debates about the role of the United States in world affairs.\nD. Debates about the proper role of political parties.\n"

Debates about the role of the United States in world affairs.\n\nThe passage discusses the idea that totalitarian regimes can be fueled by misery and want, leading to the growth of such regimes. This suggests that debates about the role of the United States in world affairs may be relevant, as the country's actions can contribute to global instability or peace. The other options do not seem to relate to the ideas presented in the passage."
