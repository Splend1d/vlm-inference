The two vectors must have equal magnitude and be pointing in opposite directions.\n\nWhen you add two non-zero vectors together, their resultant (the vector that results from adding them) will be either zero or point in the same direction as one of the original vectors. If the resultant vector points in the same direction as both vectors, then they have the same magnitude and direction. If the resultant vector points in the opposite direction, then they have different magnitudes but still point in the same direction. However, if the resultant vector points in the same direction as neither of the original vectors, then it cannot be zero because it would require at least one of the original vectors to be zero, which is impossible since they are non-zero vectors. Therefore, the only option that satisfies these conditions is B."
