He observed that the angle between the sun's rays and the observer's line of sight changes as the sun moves across the sky, which can be measured using a sundial or a barometer. By observing the change in this angle over several days, he was able to determine how far away the observer was from the equator. This gave him an estimate of the size of the Earth."
