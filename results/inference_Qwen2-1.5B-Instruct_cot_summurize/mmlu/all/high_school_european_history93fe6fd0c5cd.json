The passage states that \"any delay in beginning perestroika could have led to an exacerbated internal situation in the near future,\" indicating that a restructuring of the socialist society was necessary to prevent further deterioration. Additionally, the passage mentions that the Soviet Union had long been yearning for such changes, suggesting that a restructuring was both necessary and desirable. Therefore, option C is the correct inference from the passage."
