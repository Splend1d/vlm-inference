This is because the conquerors may not fully understand the values, beliefs, and customs of the local population, which can lead to conflicts and instability.\n\nTherefore, option D (all of the above) is the correct answer. The statement highlights the fact that conquerors often face challenges in maintaining their power and authority, and it suggests that this is due to their inability to understand and appreciate the unique qualities and characteristics of the communities they conquer."
