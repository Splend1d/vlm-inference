Gross negligence.\n\nGross negligence is a legal term that refers to a failure to exercise reasonable care or diligence in performing a duty, resulting in harm to another person. In the context of accounting and auditing, gross negligence can occur when a CPA conducts an audit without following the appropriate standards of due care, which includes making a reasonable effort to obtain all necessary evidence and information to support their conclusions, and making inquiries and tests as necessary to ensure the accuracy of financial statements.\n\nUnder the law of negligence, if a CPA engages in gross negligence during an audit, they may be held liable for any damages or losses caused by the errors or omissions found in the financial statements. This could include claims made by third parties who were affected by the inaccurate financial statements. Therefore, it is important for CPAs to follow strict ethical standards and take reasonable steps to avoid engaging in gross negligence during their audits."
