                    "text": "A state legislature has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state electionswho wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink in an appropriate space. A write-in candidate for the office of Attorney General is a Chinese-American. The candidate is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of Chinese voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered Chinese voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidates name along with the office of Attorney General. Since many native Chinese people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against the election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Thereafter, one of the candidate's opponents filed suit in state court seeking to prevent state election officials from counting any write-in ballots with stickers. The state court has now scheduled a prompt hearing on this matter. In addition, the state court has indicated that it hopes to render a decision on the merits within the next three weeks. Which of the following statements is correct concerning the federal court's adjudication of the candidate's suit?\n\nA. The federal court should hear the case on the merits.\nB. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nC. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because of the abstention doctrine.\nD. The federal court should remand the case to the state court to decide the constitutional issue presented.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The federal court should refuse to hear the case because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.\n\nA political question is a legal question that cannot be resolved by a court based on existing law or facts, but rather requires a policy judgment about the meaning or application of the law. Political questions arise when a court is asked to decide a matter that involves values, policies, or principles that are fundamentally political in nature, rather than purely legal. In other words, a political question is a type of question that can only be decided by the legislative branch of government.\n\nIn contrast, a judicial question is a legal question that can be resolved by a court based on existing law and facts. For example, whether a particular law is unconstitutional is a judicial question that can be resolved by a court.\n\nTherefore, since the state court has already ruled on the constitutionality of the state statute and has indicated that they hope to render a decision on the merits within the next three weeks, the federal court should refuse to hear the case because it presents a nonjusticiable political question."
