In both scenarios, the main character did something that was clearly morally wrong, but only one of them involved explicitly breaking a social norm or rule. \n\nIn scenario 1, the main character did not follow their own advice and gave their brother permission to use more than what they had suggested. This could be seen as neglecting their responsibility to provide accurate information and guidance. Additionally, giving someone else permission to break a rule can also be considered morally wrong if it goes against the rules themselves.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character acted out of curiosity rather than malicious intent. They were simply trying to impress their sister with their cutting skills. However, this act still went beyond what was socially acceptable and could have been perceived as disrespectful or inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that go against ordinary moral standards, making option B the correct answer."
