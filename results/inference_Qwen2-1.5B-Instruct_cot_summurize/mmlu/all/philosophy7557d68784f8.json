This skepticism often involves questioning whether our beliefs can be justified by reason alone or if there are inherent flaws in our reasoning.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that skepticism does not necessarily mean that all arguments are inherently flawed or invalid. Skeptics might argue for critical thinking and rationality, but they also recognize the limitations of human knowledge and cognitive biases. The specific argument or method used depends on the context and the individual's perspective.\n\nIn summary, while skepticism can lead to critical examination of arguments, it doesn't necessarily imply the existence of any logical self-refutation or linguistic confusion within arguments themselves. It primarily concerns the validity and reliability of evidence and the limits of human understanding."
