Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration)\n\nThe Kussmaul sign refers to an increase in the size and amplitude of the jugular venous pulse when the patient inhales. This may indicate right-sided heart failure or other conditions that cause an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure. In this case, it's possible that the patient has congestive heart failure due to her intravenous drug use, which can lead to right-sided heart failure. The increased intensity of the heart murmur with deep inspiration could also suggest left-sided heart failure, but without additional information about the severity of her condition, we cannot definitively say that the Kussmaul sign is present. It's important to note that the presence of a systolic heart murmur over the precordium also suggests a potential underlying cardiac problem."
