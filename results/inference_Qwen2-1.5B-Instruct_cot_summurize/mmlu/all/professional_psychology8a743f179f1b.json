This approach can help individuals become more attuned to their own biases and assumptions, which can then be used to inform their interactions with clients from diverse backgrounds. Cultural humility also encourages individuals to listen actively to their clients' experiences and perspectives, rather than imposing their own cultural norms or values onto them. Therefore, option C (the need to focus on personal and cultural meaning for each individual client) aligns with this Emic approach to multicultural counseling training."
