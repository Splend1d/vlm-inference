When the spread of scores increases (for example, as more scores are added to the data set), the variance will also increase because each score will be farther away from the mean, and therefore, there will be more variability in the data set. However, if the spread of scores decreases (as fewer scores are added), then the variance will decrease because each score will be closer to the mean, and therefore, there will be less variability in the data set. So the variance can increase or decrease depending on the changes in the spread of scores."
