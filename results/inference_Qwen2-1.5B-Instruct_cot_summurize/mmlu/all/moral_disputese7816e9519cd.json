He identifies four types of speech:\n\n1. Hate Speech: This type of speech is directed at groups of people based on factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, etc., with the intent to incite fear, hatred, or prejudice against them.\n2. Misogynistic Speech: This type of speech refers to expressions that demean women or portray them in a negative light, often using derogatory language or stereotypes about women's abilities, characteristics, or roles.\n3. Sexist Speech: This type of speech involves the use of language that promotes discrimination against men or women, whether it is based on sex or other attributes like age, class, or nationality.\n4. All of the Above: These categories encompass many different types of speech that may be considered offensive or inappropriate due to their content or impact on individuals.\n\nTherefore, according to Richardson-Self, the correct answer would be \"all of the above\" for the kind of speech that he is concerned with discussing."
