They are a type of immune cell that is activated by the body's own immune system to remove damaged or diseased tissues. Once activated, osteoclasts release enzymes such as cathepsins which break down bone matrix and dissolve it into smaller fragments. This process leads to the formation of new bone tissue in its place. Osteoclasts can be found throughout the body, including in bones, cartilage, and other connective tissues."
