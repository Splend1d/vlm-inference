The buyer paid 10% of the purchase price and financed the rest by executing a promissory note and purchase money mortgage to the builder. A year later, the buyer missed several mortgage payments to the builder and became unable to make payments to the builder and became unable to make payments. During that year, property values in the neighborhood declined substantially. The builder suggested that the buyer deed the house back to the builder to settle all claims and avoid the costs and other disadvantages of foreclosure. The buyer deeded the house back to the builder. Does the builder now own fee simple title to the house?\n\nA. No, because the deed back to the builder constitutes a disguised mortgage.\nB. No, because the owner of a personal residence cannot waive the right to foreclosure.\nC. Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.\nD. Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.\n"

Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.\n\nWhen a homeowner deems it necessary to sell their home due to financial difficulties or distress, they may choose to deed the property back to the lender, often referred to as a \"deed back\" or a \"sale back.\" This can be an option if the lender agrees to forgive the remaining debt, typically through a \"short sale,\" which involves paying less than the outstanding balance on the loan.\n\nIn this case, the builder has agreed to accept the deed back from the buyer in exchange for forgiveness of any remaining debt. This agreement is considered reasonable and fair under the circumstances, as it allows both parties to move forward with minimal disruption to their respective interests.\n\nTherefore, the builder retains fee simple title to the property."
