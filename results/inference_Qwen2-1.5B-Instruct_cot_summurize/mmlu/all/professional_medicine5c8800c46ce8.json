Increased peripheral vascular resistance\n\nIncreased peripheral vascular resistance can lead to an increase in blood pressure because it causes the heart to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed vessels. This increases the workload on the heart and can result in higher blood pressure levels. Other factors that can increase blood pressure include decreased cardiac output (which would decrease stroke volume), but this is not directly related to peripheral vascular resistance as much as it is related to overall cardiovascular health. Pulse rate does not typically affect blood pressure significantly unless there is a specific medical condition or medication affecting it."
