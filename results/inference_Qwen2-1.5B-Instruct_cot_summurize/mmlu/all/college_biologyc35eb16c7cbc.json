Tyrosine kinase. \n\nTyrosine kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate (add phosphate groups to) tyrosine residues in proteins, including those involved in signal transduction pathways such as the Ras-MAPK pathway. They are encoded by the src oncogene.\n\nAdenylate cyclase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cAMP, which plays a role in signaling pathways like cAMP-PKA.\n\nG protein-linked receptors are membrane-bound proteins that bind G proteins and mediate cell surface signals. \n\nProtein phosphatase is an enzyme that dephosphorylates proteins, removing phosphate groups from their serine or threonine residues. It is not directly related to the addition of phosphate groups to cellular proteins."
