Phytochrome\n\nPhytochrome is a type of light-sensitive protein that plays a crucial role in the photoperiodic flowering response of many plants, including angiosperms. It binds to specific wavelengths of light and triggers the expression of genes that regulate flowering time. This process is known as the photoperiodic signaling pathway. Other components of this pathway include auxin, gibberellins, and other hormones. However, phytochrome is considered the key component for regulating flowering under different photoperiods."
