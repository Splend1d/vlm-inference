This finding suggests that women may be more susceptible to stress due to lower levels of social support compared to men. The study by Brown & Harris (1978) provides evidence for this relationship between social support and vulnerability to stress in women. However, it does not provide information about the prevalence of depression among men or women, nor does it suggest that men are more vulnerable to depression due to traditional gender roles."
