The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\nC. The cell would need to consume another food source other than glucose because it will not be able to make adequate ATP with only glucose.\nD.

The cell would need to consume glucose at a much greater rate because aerobic respiration is much more efficient as compared with anaerobic respiration.\n\nThis is because aerobic respiration produces more ATP per glucose molecule than anaerobic respiration, which means that a cell in an aerobic environment can produce more ATP from a given amount of glucose than one in an anaerobic environment. Therefore, if a yeast cell is moved from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment, it would need to consume more glucose in order to maintain its metabolic activities. This increased demand for glucose could lead to cell division or growth if the cell has sufficient energy reserves available. However, without additional food sources, it may also die due to lack of ATP production."
