The woman.\n\nIn the deed, the woman reserved the right to re-enter the tract of land and take back her property if the interest she conveyed to her cousin was invalid. Therefore, if the interest was invalid, the woman would have the right to reclaim her property, including any proceeds from selling the crop. Since the friend died intestate before the wheat could be harvested, it is possible that the interest in the tract of land was invalid, and the woman would have the right to reclaim her property and receive the proceeds from the sale of the crop."
