Food surpluses, specialists, urban settlements, and a system of record keeping.\n\nCivilization refers to the development of complex societies that have developed specialized forms of culture, technology, social organization, and economy. Some of the key characteristics of civilization include:\n\n1. Food surpluses: Civilizations typically experience periods of surplus production of food due to advances in agriculture and trade.\n2. Specialists: Civilizations often develop specialized professions and trades that require specific skills and knowledge.\n3. Urban settlements: Large populations can lead to the development of cities with specialized functions such as commerce, government, education, religion, and entertainment.\n4. System of record keeping: The creation and use of written records has been essential for recording transactions, managing resources, and preserving knowledge over time.\n\nArt, monumental architecture, and museums may be part of a civilization's cultural or artistic expression, but they do not necessarily define what it means to be a civilization."
