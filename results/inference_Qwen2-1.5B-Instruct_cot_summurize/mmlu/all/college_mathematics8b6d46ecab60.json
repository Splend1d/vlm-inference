Let f be a continuous function defined on K. By the Heine-Borel theorem, we know that K is closed and bounded. Therefore, for each i, U_i contains at most one point from K, so f(U_i) contains at most one point from K for each i. Thus, f(K) has at most one point, which contradicts the fact that f(K) is uncountable since K is uncountable. \n\nTherefore, if K is not compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K cannot be bounded. So statement I is false.\n\nNow let's consider statement II. Suppose K is compact but not bounded. Then there exists an open cover {U_i} such that the union of these sets does not contain all points of K. However, if every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then for each i, the set f^{-1}(f(U_i)) = U_i contains at most one point from K, so f(U_i) contains at most one point from K for each i. Since K is compact, this implies that f(K) has at most one point, which contradicts the fact that f(K) is uncountable since K is uncountable. Therefore, if K is compact but not bounded, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K cannot be bounded either. \n\nSo statement II is also false.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is statement I, which states that if K is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded. The correct answer is A. I only."
