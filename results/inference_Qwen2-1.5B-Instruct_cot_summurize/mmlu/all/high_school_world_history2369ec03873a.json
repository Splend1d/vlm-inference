On the contrary, he returned not only determined to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force.

Development of a constitutional monarchy\n\nThe passage states that Peter the Great believed that \"if Russia was to be transformed,\" he would have to provide both the direction and the motive force for the changes. This suggests that he embraced the idea of creating a constitutional monarchy, which is a form of government where a king or queen holds limited powers while a representative assembly or parliament has more control over laws and policies."
