This involves altering genes that affect athletic abilities, such as muscle growth and strength, with the aim of improving an athlete's performance. Gene doping can involve using hormones or other substances to alter gene expression, or it may involve manipulating the DNA sequence of genes involved in muscle development. It is illegal and unethical in most sports, and it has been heavily criticized for its potential to give unfair advantages to athletes."
