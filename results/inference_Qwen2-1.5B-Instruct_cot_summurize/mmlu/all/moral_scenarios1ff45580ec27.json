Putting mouse feces in someone else's coffee is not only morally wrong but also physically harmful. Picking all of the flowers in someone else's yard may be considered an act of kindness if done with good intentions and respect for the owner's property rights. However, it can still be seen as morally wrong due to the potential harm caused by removing all of the flowers. Therefore, neither scenario is considered morally right or wrong."
