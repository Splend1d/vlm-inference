This theory suggests that children form attachment relationships with their caregivers and that these relationships have significant implications for later development. Research on this topic has indeed been conducted longitudinally, meaning it has tracked the same individuals over time to see how their relationships develop and change.\n\nCross-sectional research, on the other hand, refers to studies that compare groups of people who share a common characteristic or event at one point in time but not necessarily over time. While cross-sectional research can provide valuable insights into patterns of behavior and development across different populations, it does not necessarily offer support for theories like Attachment Theory which focus on individual relationships and developmental trajectories over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
