They are produced by the process of protein synthesis and play various roles in the body, including signaling pathways, immune responses, and tissue repair.\n\nIn the context of your question, the scientist's discovery of a new hormone that is found both inside and outside cells, increases nucleic acid production within the cell, and comes from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings suggests that it is a peptide hormone. The presence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) within a molecule is characteristic of peptides, and the fact that it can be generated from a structure with four hydroxycarbon rings also supports this conclusion. Therefore, the hormone fits into category C. Peptide.\n\nOption A. Enzymatic, B. Steroid, and D. Amino acid do not fit the description given in the question."
