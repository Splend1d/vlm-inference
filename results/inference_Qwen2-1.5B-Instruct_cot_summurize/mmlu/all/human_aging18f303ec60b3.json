Specifically:\n\n- Young survivors may be at higher risk due to their vulnerability and lack of life experiences.\n- Those who have not previously experienced depression may be more susceptible to developing it following a significant life event like losing someone close.\n- People with poor health status may be more prone to mental health issues, including depression.\n- Marital status does not necessarily correlate directly with the likelihood of depression but can contribute to stress levels that might lead to depression.\n\nTherefore, it is important for individuals who have experienced a loss to seek support from professionals or trusted friends and family members to manage any potential depression they may feel."
