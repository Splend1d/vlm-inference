Its distance from you\n\nTo estimate the distance between an object and yourself, you would need to know both the actual brightness of the object (which is directly related to its luminous intensity) and the apparent brightness from your location (which depends on factors such as atmospheric transparency and color perception). Using these two pieces of information, you could calculate the distance based on the formula:\n\nDistance = (Actual Brightness / Apparent Brightness) * 100 meters per lux\n\nWhere \"apparent brightness\" is the ratio of the object's visible light to the average background light level at your location.\n\nSo in summary, knowing the actual brightness and apparent brightness allows you to calculate the distance using basic trigonometry and logarithmic relationships."
