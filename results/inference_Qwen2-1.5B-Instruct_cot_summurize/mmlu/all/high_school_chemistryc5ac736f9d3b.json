The stronger the interaction, the higher its energy and thus the greater its tendency to prevent separation of the interacting particles. \n\n- Dipole-dipole interactions involve the repulsion between two dipoles (positive and negative charges). These are weaker than hydrogen bonds but stronger than induced dipole interactions.\n- Hydrogen bonds are weak van der Waals interactions that occur between polarizable atoms such as oxygen in water molecules. They are relatively strong compared to other intermolecular attractions.\n- Induced dipole interactions result when an electron density difference causes a net positive or negative charge to be localized near a molecule's surface. This leads to a dipole moment, which can interact with another dipole or form a hydrogen bond. They are also relatively strong."
