After the dishwasher had been installed in the buyer's home, it functioned properly for the first month. Then it began to make a loud rattling noise whenever it was in use. The buyer called the appliance store, and a manager there assured her that it was not uncommon for the dishwasher to make such a noise. Moreover, he indicated that the machine's clamorous sound would eventually disappear with continued use. One week later, after a dinner party, the buyer placed her most expensive china set in the dishwasher and turned on the machine. After the dishwasher had been in operation for a few minutes, the buyer heard the rattling noise followed by the sound of breaking china. She immediately stopped the machine. Upon looking inside, she saw that a blade from the dishwasher had broken, destroying her entire china set. If the buyer asserts a claim for strict products liability against the appliance company, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\nB. Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.\nC. No, because the buyer was not personally injured.\nD. No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.\n"

The fact that the manufacturer has acknowledged the issue with the racketting noise suggests that they were aware of a potential defect in their product.\n\nSecondly, the buyer was the actual user of the dishwasher and experienced significant harm as a result of the defect. Even if the noise did eventually subside with continued use, the fact that the damage occurred during the initial period of use indicates that the defect was present at the time of purchase.\n\nThirdly, the buyer was not injured in any way other than by the loss of her china set. In order to establish strict liability, the plaintiff must prove that the defect caused them to suffer an injury that was not covered by the warranty or by any other means. Since the buyer lost her valuable china set, this demonstrates that the defect was sufficient to cause her to suffer an injury.\n\nTherefore, based on these factors, it seems likely that the buyer would prevail in asserting a claim for strict products liability against the appliance company."
