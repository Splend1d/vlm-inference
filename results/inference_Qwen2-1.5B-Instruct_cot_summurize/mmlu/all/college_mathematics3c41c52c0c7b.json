For $n=4$, we have $\\frac{4^4}{4!} = \\frac{256}{24} = 10.833...$, which is not an integer. So $n=4$ does not give exactly two solutions.\n\nB. For $n=7$, we have $\\frac{7^7}{7!} = \\frac{823543}{5040} = 163.983...$, which is also not an integer. So $n=7$ does not give exactly two solutions.\n\nC. For $n=8$, we have $\\frac{8^8}{8!} = \\frac{409672}{40320} = 10.170...$, which is not an integer. So $n=8$ does not give exactly two solutions.\n\nD. For $n=12$, we have $\\frac{12^{12}}{12!} = \\frac{1795304}{47900160} = 0.3647...$, which is not an integer. So $n=12$ does not give exactly two solutions.\n\nTherefore, none of the options provided directly satisfy the condition that there are exactly two abelian groups of order $n$ up to isomorphism. However, if we consider the general case and look at the pattern, it seems like there might be a mistake in the question or the options provided. The correct answer should reflect the fact that the only possible values for $n$ such that there are exactly two abelian groups of order $n$ up to isomorphism are those that are prime numbers greater than 2. This is because for any composite number $n > 2$, the number of abelian groups of order $n$ would exceed 2, as shown by the formula above. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a prime number greater than 2, but without the specific values given, it's impossible to determine the exact value from the information provided."
