The shopper contended that the doors, which were programmed to swing inward, swung outward and injured him as he attempted to enter the store one afternoon. The shopper's brother-in- law, who was an eyewitness to the accident, was not called to testify at trial. Moreover, the shopper's attorney failed to depose the brother-in-law, who redomiciled out of state shortly after the accident. With respect to the shopper's failure to offer the brother-in-law's testimony at trial, on request by the supermarket's attorney, the court should\n\nA. instruct the jury that it raises the presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nB. instruct the jury that it constitutes an adoptive admission that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nC. permit the supermarket's attorney to argue that it raises a presumption that the brother-in-law's testimony would have been unfavorable to the shopper.\nD. neither instruct the jury on the matter nor permit the supermarket's attorney to argue the matter.\n"

In this case, the shopper's attorney failed to depose his brother-in-law, who may have provided valuable evidence about the accident. However, the court cannot instruct the jury to raise such a presumption unless the attorney made a specific objection during the trial. Similarly, the supermarket's attorney cannot argue that there was a presumption of prejudice if the attorney did not object during the trial.\n\nTherefore, the proper course of action is for the court to neither instruct the jury on the matter nor permit the supermarket's attorney to argue the matter. This will allow the parties to present their cases without any bias introduced by the other side."
