It is simply a matter of personal preference and does not involve any harm or wrongdoing towards others.\n\nIn scenario 2, laughing when someone gets injured is generally considered morally wrong because it involves causing harm to another person for amusement. While it may be seen as harmless by some people, it goes against the general expectation that we should treat others with kindness and respect. Therefore, this action is considered morally wrong."
