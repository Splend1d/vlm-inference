Increased pH levels can also affect the rate of glycogen breakdown during exercise, but it's not directly related to the hormones mentioned. Insulin and cortisol are hormones that regulate glucose metabolism and blood sugar levels, respectively, and they play a role in energy production rather than glycogen breakdown."
