It is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme G6PD, which leads to the accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate in the blood and tissues. This accumulation can cause a range of symptoms, including jaundice, black stools, and seizures, depending on the severity of the deficiency. The pattern of inheritance for G6PD deficiency is autosomal recessive, meaning that both parents must have the gene mutation for their child to inherit it."
