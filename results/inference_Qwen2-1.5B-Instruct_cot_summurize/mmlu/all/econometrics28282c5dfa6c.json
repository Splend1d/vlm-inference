Produce a 1-step ahead conditional variance forecast, take its square root, and multiply it by the square root of 10.\n\nThis method calculates the 10-day forecast of the volatility by taking the square root of the 1-step ahead conditional variance forecast. This approach is commonly used in financial time series analysis to estimate the future volatility of an asset based on historical data. The square root of 10 is approximately 3.16, so multiplying this by the square root of the 1-step ahead conditional variance forecast will give us a reasonable estimate of the 10-day forecast of volatility."
