Since the mean is 167 minutes and the standard deviation is 76 minutes, we can calculate the z-score using the formula:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nwhere \\(x\\) is the value (in this case, the duration of an emergency room visit), \\(\\mu\\) is the mean, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation.\n\nFirst, convert all values to decimal form:\n\n- Mean (\\(x\\)): 167 minutes\n- Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)): 76 minutes\n\nNow, calculate the z-score:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{167 - 167}{76} = \\frac{0}{76} = 0\\]\n\nThis means that the 80th percentile corresponds to the mean, which is 167 minutes.\n\nNext, we want to find the range within which 80% of the durations fall. This range will be determined by adding and subtracting half the standard deviation from the mean. The z-score for the median (which is halfway between the mean and the upper quartile) is 0.5. Therefore, we add and subtract half the standard deviation (which is 38 minutes) from the mean to get the lower and upper bounds:\n\nLower Bound: \\(167 + 38 = 195\\) minutes\nUpper Bound: \\(167 - 38 = 129\\) minutes\n\nSo, the interval containing the middle 80% of emergency room visit durations is from 129 minutes to 195 minutes, or about 15 minutes to 319 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 15 minutes to 319 minutes."
