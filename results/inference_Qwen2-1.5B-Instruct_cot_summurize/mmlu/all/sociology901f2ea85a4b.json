Judith Butler's concept of gender performance refers to how individuals construct their own sense of identity and social role based on their actions and behaviors. She argues that gender is not fixed at birth but rather constructed through the way individuals present themselves in society. This includes things like clothing, hairstyles, and other physical attributes that can be used to signal one's gender identity. So while biological factors such as sex hormones or reproductive anatomy may play a role in some aspects of gender, they do not determine it entirely."
