One week later, the purchasing agent received a telephone call from the vice president of the dressmaking company, who informed her that the dressmaking company's sales representative had made an error in calculating the contract price. As a result, the vice president said that unless the women's clothing store agreed to pay an additional $15,000, the garments would not be delivered. If the purchasing agent should have known that the dressmaking company's original price term of $75,000 was in error, but agreed to the contract anyway, which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake resulted from an error in computation, not in judgment.\nB. There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.\nC. There was no valid contract formed, because there was no mutuality of assent.\nD. There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.\n"

There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.\n\nUnder U.S. law, when a party enters into a contract based on false or misleading information, they can rescind the contract and demand restitution if they discover the truth before performance has been completed. In this case, the purchasing agent did not know of the error until after the contract was signed and the garments were already ordered. Therefore, they could potentially rescind the contract and recover any payments made by the purchasing agent under duress."
