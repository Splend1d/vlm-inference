The truth table shows that the conclusion could be either T or F depending on how the premises are interpreted. Without further context, we cannot definitively say what the conclusion should be based on the truth table alone.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not valid, but without additional information about how the conclusion should be interpreted, it is impossible to provide a specific counterexample. However, one possible interpretation of the conclusion is that it depends on how the premises are combined. For example, if premise 1 is \"X\" and premise 2 is \"Y\", then the conclusion would be \"Z\". In this case, premise 3 would still be true regardless of whether X or Y was true. Therefore, another counterexample could be when X is true and Y and Z are false. \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when X is true and Y and Z are false"
