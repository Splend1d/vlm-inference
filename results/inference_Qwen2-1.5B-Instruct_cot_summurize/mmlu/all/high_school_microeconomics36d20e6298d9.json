These externalities can lead to negative outcomes such as pollution, crime, and loss of property, but they also have positive outcomes such as education and healthcare improvements. Externalities exist when market mechanisms fail to allocate resources efficiently because they don't consider all possible outcomes or the effects on others. This lack of information leads to inefficiencies in resource allocation, and therefore the equilibrium price may not reflect the true cost or benefit to society."
