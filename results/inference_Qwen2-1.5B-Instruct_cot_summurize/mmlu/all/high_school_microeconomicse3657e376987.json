A decrease in the marginal product of labor. \n\nIf the marginal product of labor (MP) decreases, it means that each additional unit of labor produces fewer units of output than the previous one, and the market demand curve shifts to the left. This occurs when firms need to reduce their production levels or even shut down if they cannot afford to pay higher wages to attract more workers. The price of the good will also decrease as a result of reduced demand, but this does not affect the demand curve itself."
