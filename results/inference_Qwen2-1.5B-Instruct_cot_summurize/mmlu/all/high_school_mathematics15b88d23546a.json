Since there are two options for each question (true or false), the total number of ways to arrange these 5 questions is \\(2^5\\).\n\nGiven that the order in which the questions are answered matters (F-T-F-T-F) but not necessarily the specific order within each category (T-T-T-F-F), we calculate the probability by considering only the arrangements without regard to whether they match the conditions given:\n\n- There are 2 choices for the first question.\n- For the second question, since it's T/F, there are 2 choices again.\n- The third question has 2 choices after the first two have been chosen.\n- Similarly, the fourth question also has 2 choices.\n- Finally, the fifth question has only 1 choice because it's T/F.\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 16\\).\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when flipping the coin is \\(2\\) (heads or tails).\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting the correct sequence of answers is the ratio of favorable outcomes to possible outcomes:\n\\[P(\\text{correct sequence}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{16}{2} = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C**."
