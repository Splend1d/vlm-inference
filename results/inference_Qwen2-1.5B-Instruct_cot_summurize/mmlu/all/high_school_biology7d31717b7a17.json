It is the differential survival and reproduction of the most-fit phenotypes.\n\nThis statement accurately describes how evolution is commonly understood in the scientific community, where natural selection plays a key role in shaping the diversity of life on Earth. Natural selection occurs when individuals or populations that possess advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits along to their offspring. This process can lead to changes in the genetic makeup of populations over time, leading to new species and evolutionary divergence."
