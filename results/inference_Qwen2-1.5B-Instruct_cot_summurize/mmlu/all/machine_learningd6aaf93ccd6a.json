Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts to memorize the training data instead of generalizing well to new, unseen data. This can happen if the regularization parameter (which controls how much the model's weights shrink during training) is set too low, leading to overly complex models that fit the training data perfectly but perform poorly on new, unseen data. Conversely, setting the regularization parameter too high can lead to underfitting, where the model doesn't have enough flexibility to capture the underlying patterns in the data. \n\nIn summary, increasing the training loss with an increase in number of epochs suggests that either the regularization parameter needs adjustment or there may be other issues related to the complexity of the model being trained."
