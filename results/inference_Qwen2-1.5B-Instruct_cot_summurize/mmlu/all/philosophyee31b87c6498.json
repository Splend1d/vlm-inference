If Gauthier is indeed a philosopher or someone familiar with the subject matter, their claim could potentially be about the nature of practical rationality, which is often discussed in ethical theories.\n\nPractical rationality refers to the ability to make decisions based on evidence and reason rather than intuition or emotions alone. It's also known as reflective equilibrium, where one evaluates options based on criteria such as what is best for oneself or others. This type of reasoning is typically considered more rational compared to emotional-based decision-making.\n\nThe question asks which option among A (moral justification), B (deliberative justification), C (epistemic justification), and D (an illusion) is the most appropriate answer for Gauthier's claim. However, without knowing the context of his claim or the specific philosophical position he holds, it's challenging to provide a precise response.\n\nIf Gauthier argues that practical rationality exists only in relation to moral reasons or ethical considerations, then option A (moral justification) would align with this view. On the other hand, if he suggests that practical rationality can exist independently of ethics or values, then options B (deliberative justification) and C (epistemic justification) could be relevant. Option D (an illusion) implies something else entirely, which doesn't fit well with the concept of practical rationality.\n\nWithout additional information, it's difficult to definitively say which option Gauthier means by \"there is nothing for practical rationality to be besides.\" The choice depends on how he defines practical rationality and its relationship to moral, ethical, and epistemic justifications."
