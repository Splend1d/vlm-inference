Populations tend to increase at a faster rate than their food supply normally allows.\n\nDarwin was influenced by the ideas presented in \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\" by Thomas Malthus, who argued that populations grow too quickly relative to available resources, leading to famine and poverty. This idea helped Darwin to develop his own theory of evolution by natural selection, which suggests that populations naturally select traits that improve survival and reproduction over time."
