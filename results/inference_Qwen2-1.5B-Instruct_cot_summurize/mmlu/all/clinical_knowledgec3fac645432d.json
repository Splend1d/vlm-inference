This occurs in two steps: \n\n1. Translation initiation - The ribosome binds to the start codon on mRNA, which signals the beginning of protein synthesis.\n\n2. Protein synthesis - As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, it reads the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA and translates them into an amino acid sequence that forms a polypeptide chain. The resulting polypeptide chain is called a protein.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. DNA, mRNA and RNA polymerase."
