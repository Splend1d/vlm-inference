Active Transport\n\nActive transport is a process where molecules move from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration against the concentration gradient using energy provided by ATP. This process requires active transport proteins that use energy from the cell's metabolic activity to move substances across the cell membrane.\n\nOsmosis and passive transport do not involve the movement of molecules against their concentration gradient; instead, they rely on pressure differences or chemical gradients to facilitate the movement of substances across the cell membrane.\n\nEndocytosis involves the formation of vesicles around molecules or particles before they enter the cell, which can then be transported into the cell cytoplasm without requiring energy. However, this does not directly involve the use of a concentration gradient to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane."
