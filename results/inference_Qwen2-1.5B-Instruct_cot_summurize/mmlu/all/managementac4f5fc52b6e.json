This type of leadership is characterized by clear directives from the leader to their team members, with little room for creativity or innovation. The leader sets goals and expectations for their team members, assigns tasks and responsibilities, and provides direction on how to achieve those goals. Transactional leaders rely heavily on rewards and punishments to motivate their team members, often using them as a way to control behavior rather than fostering a sense of trust and collaboration."
