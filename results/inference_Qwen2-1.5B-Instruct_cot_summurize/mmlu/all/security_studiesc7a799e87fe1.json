Diplomacy cannot achieve agreements among small groups of nations where global agreements have failed. Global endorsement is required to legitimize the process, providing greater cooperation, agreements and great power backing. Failure to attain global consensus on what terrorism is will result in disparities between states' counterterrorism methods which will severely reduce the scope of employing multi-level measures in a consistent and cohesive fashion, and may afford some terrorist groups the opportunity to seek refuge in states whose domestic laws are weaker.\nB. A great deal of international diplomacy has involved attempts to define terrorism so that all countries could take steps to eradicate it. However, these efforts have largely faltered: countries often support or sympathize with dissidents who use violence against repressive governments; governments in developing countries have wanted to avoid anti-colonial struggles being labelled as terrorism; and countries want to retain a degree of flexibility regarding extradition and punishment of political dissidents.\nC. Intelligence agencies are highly centralized, organized structures that operate at a maximum functional level within their domestic context. There is no reason to presume that collaboration would enhance their ability to contribute to the prevention of terrorism. The multi-agency approach would also broaden the scope for potential errors, miscommunication, and intelligence failures.\nD. Multi-partner initiatives to support the reforms necessary for the prevention of terrorism have proved ineffective. Sanctions against countries that provide a territorial base for terrorism may be misplaced, having negligible effects on the terrorist organizations themselves.\n"

Diplomatic efforts can involve negotiations and dialogue between countries to establish common ground and find solutions to issues related to terrorism. Intelligence sharing involves exchanging information about terrorist activities and threats, while sanctions can be used to target individuals and entities involved in terrorism.\n\nWhile international measures can be effective in combating terrorism, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. For example, the lack of global consensus on what terrorism is can lead to disparities in counterterrorism methods between different countries, which can undermine the effectiveness of multilevel measures. Additionally, the centralization of intelligence agencies and the potential for errors and miscommunications can limit their effectiveness in preventing terrorism. Finally, the success of multi-party initiatives to support reforms necessary for preventing terrorism may depend on factors beyond the control of any single country, making them difficult to measure and evaluate."
