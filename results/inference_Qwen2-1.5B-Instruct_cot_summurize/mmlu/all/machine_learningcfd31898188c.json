Each individual tree may have its own bias towards certain features or data points, and by combining them, the model can learn to better generalize across different subsets of the input data. This can lead to a more robust and accurate prediction. On the other hand, increasing variance (the variability between predictions) would be detrimental because it would make the model less predictable and more likely to give incorrect results."
