This can help them to better align the organization's goals with the values and aspirations of their employees, as well as to provide clear guidance on how to achieve these goals. Additionally, framing can help leaders to reduce personal biases in decision-making by providing a structured approach to analyzing data and making decisions based on objective criteria rather than subjective judgments or personal preferences. Finally, framing can also help leaders to adapt their leadership style to the characteristics of their subordinates by recognizing and leveraging each individual's strengths and weaknesses in order to maximize their potential and ensure that they are working towards common goals."
