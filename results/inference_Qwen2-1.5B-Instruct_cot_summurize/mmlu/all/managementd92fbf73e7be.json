Instinct\n\nIntuitive decision-making refers to the process of making decisions or choices without fully processing all available information, relying instead on one's gut instincts or emotions. This type of decision-making can be seen as an instinctive response that allows individuals to make quick and often subconscious judgments about situations they encounter in their daily lives. While rational decision-making involves careful consideration of all available information and logical reasoning, intuitive decision-making is more likely to involve making choices based on emotional responses or personal experiences."
