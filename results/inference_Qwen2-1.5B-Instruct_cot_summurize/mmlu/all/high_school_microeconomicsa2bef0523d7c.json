Technology in the harvesting of coffee beans improves.\n\nIf technology in the harvesting of coffee beans improves, it can make it more efficient and cost-effective to produce coffee. This could lead to higher profits for farmers who grow coffee, which could ultimately increase their willingness to sell coffee at a higher price. As a result, this would most likely lead to an increase in the demand for coffee, even if there is no change in consumer income or the price of tea.\n\nOption A (consumer income falls) and option C (the wage of coffee plantation workers falls) are unlikely to have a significant impact on the demand for coffee because they do not directly affect the supply of coffee. Option B (the price of tea rises) may also have some effect on the demand for coffee, but it is less likely than option D because the relationship between coffee and tea consumption is not as strong as the relationship between coffee production and coffee prices."
