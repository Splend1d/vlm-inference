S. foreign policy, the assemblyman and the foreign country's leader issued a joint statement criticizing the United States' involvement in the political affairs of neighboring countries. Following the assemblyman's return to the United States, he was prosecuted under a federal criminal statute making it unlawful for any citizen not specifically authorized by the President to negotiate with a foreign government for the purpose of influencing the foreign government in relation to a dispute with the United States. The law further provides that \"any citizen who knowingly counsels, aids, or abets a foreign government in a dispute with the United States. . , shall, upon conviction. . . be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine of not more than $10,000, or by both fine and imprisonment. . . . \"Which of the following is the strongest constitutional basis for upholding the validity of the aforementioned federal statute?\n\nA. Federal criminal laws dealing with international affairs need not be as specific as those dealing with domestic affairs.\nB. Under its enumerated powers, Congress may legislate to preserve the monopoly of the national government over the conduct of U. S. foreign affairs.\nC. The President's inherent power to negotiate for the U. S. with foreign countries authorizes him to punish citizens who engage in such negotiations without permission, even in the absence of statutory authorization.\nD. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress concurrent power with the President to regulate external affairs with foreign countries.\n"

This means that Congress has the authority to pass laws related to foreign relations and diplomacy, including legislation aimed at preventing citizens from engaging in activities that could influence foreign governments in a way that harms U.S. interests. In this case, the federal statute being challenged prohibits citizens from negotiating with foreign governments for the purpose of influencing them in disputes with the United States, which falls within the scope of the enumerated powers granted to Congress under Article I, Section 8. Therefore, the federal statute is constitutional because it is within the boundaries set by the Constitution."
