This is because many African countries have struggled with poverty and underdevelopment for decades, leading to high birth rates and poor access to healthcare and education. Additionally, some African countries have implemented policies that have led to rapid population growth, such as large-scale immigration from neighboring countries or a lack of natural resources that limit economic opportunities. Therefore, option A (in Africa) seems like the most accurate answer based on current circumstances. However, this is not an absolute statement, as other factors can also contribute to population growth, such as migration or technological advancements."
