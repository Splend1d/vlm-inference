Let's try to find a pattern or relationship between these two expressions.\n\nGiven that \\(T(1) = 7\\), let's calculate some values:\n\n\\[T(2) = 3 \\cdot 2 - T(1) = 6 - 7 = -1\\]\n\\[T(3) = 3 \\cdot 3 - T(2) = 9 - (-1) = 10\\]\n\\[T(4) = 3 \\cdot 4 - T(3) = 12 - 10 = 2\\]\n\\[T(5) = 3 \\cdot 5 - T(4) = 15 - 2 = 13\\]\n\\[T(6) = 3 \\cdot 6 - T(5) = 18 - 13 = 5\\]\n\nFrom these calculations, it seems there might be an exponential growth pattern based on the sequence of differences between consecutive terms. However, without a more systematic approach or additional information about the sequence, it's difficult to definitively state the order of growth directly from the given recurrence relation.\n\nHowever, if we were to guess at the order of growth based on the behavior observed, it would likely fall into one of the options listed:\n\nA. \\(\u0398(n)\\): This corresponds to \\(T(n) = O(n)\\), meaning \\(T(n)\\) grows slower than any polynomial function of \\(n\\).\nB. \\(\u0398(n\\log n)\\): This indicates \\(T(n) = O(n \\log n)\\), suggesting a linear growth rate.\nC. \\(\u0398(n^2)\\): This suggests \\(T(n) = O(n^2)\\), implying quadratic growth.\nD. \\(\u0398(n^2\\log n)\\): This implies \\(T(n) = O(n^2 \\log n)\\), indicating cubic growth.\n\nWithout further analysis, none of the options provided directly match the calculated values of \\(T(n)\\) up to \\(n=6\\), so the correct answer cannot be determined solely from the given information.
