Increased use of imported or \"exotic\" materials\n\nOpportunistic foraging is the act of searching for food in places that are not typically used by humans, often involving the use of exotic or unusual resources. This type of foraging can be opportunistic because it relies on finding whatever food sources are available at the time rather than carefully planning and scheduling where to look for food. It may involve using imported or exotic materials to supplement what is available locally. However, careful planning and scheduling are important for sustainable foraging practices, but they are not necessarily involved in opportunistic foraging."
