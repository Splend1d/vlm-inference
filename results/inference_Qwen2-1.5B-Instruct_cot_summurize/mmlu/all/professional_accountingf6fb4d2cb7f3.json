So, if current liabilities are $322,000, then current assets would be:\n\nCurrent Assets = 3 * $322,000 = $966,000\n\nSince we have the current ratio and the current assets, we can also calculate the total assets by dividing the current assets by the current ratio:\n\nTotal Assets = Current Assets / Current Ratio = $966,000 / 3 = $322,000\n\nTherefore, the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is $322,000.\n\nThe correct answer is A. $322,000."
