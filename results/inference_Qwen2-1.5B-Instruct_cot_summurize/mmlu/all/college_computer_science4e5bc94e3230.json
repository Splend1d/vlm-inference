However, the debugger has mapped this same text segment at 0x01000000 in its own virtual address space using the \"COPY-ON-WRITE\" mapping mode. This means that the debugger will not overwrite any data in the text segment until it is explicitly written to or read from, ensuring that any changes made by the debugger do not affect the original content of the text segment.\n\nTherefore, when the debugger performs a WRITE operation on the virtual memory page containing the address 0x01001234, the page will be mapped as COPY-ON-WRITE access, meaning it can only be written to from the debugger itself. The actual value of 0x01001234 will remain unchanged since it was previously mapped as READ/WRITE access."
