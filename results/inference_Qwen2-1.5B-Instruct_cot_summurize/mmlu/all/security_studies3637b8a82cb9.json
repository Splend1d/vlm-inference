While some argue that neoliberal principles behind them have been beneficial for promoting human welfare, there is little evidence to support this claim. In fact, there is overwhelming evidence that structural adjustment policies have caused significant harm to developing countries' economies and populations. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
