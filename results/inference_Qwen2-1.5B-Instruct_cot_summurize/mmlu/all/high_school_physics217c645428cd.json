This normal force is equal to the force of gravity (Fg) times the mass of the object (m), which can be written as Fg = m * g. \n\nIn this case, the force exerted on the block by the table (f) acts perpendicular to both the direction of motion of the block and the surface it is resting on. Therefore, f is perpendicular to the table."
