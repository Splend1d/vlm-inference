There are two distinct varieties in one population of snail that inhabits an island in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis is because the statement \"There are two distinct varieties in one population of snail that inhabits an island in the Pacific Ocean\" describes a case where different individuals within a population have genetic differences that allow them to reproduce with each other, leading to the formation of new varieties or strains over time. This process is known as evolution by natural selection."
