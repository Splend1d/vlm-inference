Integrative Awareness.\n\nIn Atkinson, Morten, and Sue's (1993) Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model, the process of racial/cultural identity development begins with the individual rejecting all aspects of the dominant culture and feeling a sense of absolute loyalty to their own culture. However, as the individual continues to explore their cultural background and integrate different elements into their identity, they move from dissonance to integrative awareness. This stage involves recognizing and valuing both one's cultural heritage and the broader society."
