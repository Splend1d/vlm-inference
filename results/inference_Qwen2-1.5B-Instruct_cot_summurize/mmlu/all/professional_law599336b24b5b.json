On a hunch, she went to her boyfriend's apartment one afternoon and, using her key, she entered the apartment. Once inside, she found her boyfriend and his new girlfriend in bed together. In a rage, the defendant retrieved the gun from the nightstand and killed her boyfriend and his new girlfriend. After the shooting, the defendant left on a two-day trip to the mountains to get the week's events off her mind. She called her teenage neighbor to take care of her apartment while she was gone and to look after her 4-year-old daughter. That night, after the defendant left, the police came to the apartment. They asked the neighbor if they could search the apartment, and the neighbor gave them permission. The police found in the defendant's bedroom the gun used to kill her boyfriend. At a motion to suppress the gun prior to trial, which of the following facts would the defendant's attorney be LEAST likely to attempt to prove?\n\nA. The defendant gave her neighbor the keys to her apartment.\nB. The police did not have a search warrant.\nC. The defendant told her neighbor not to answer the door to anyone.\nD. The police told the neighbor she would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.\n"

The police told the neighbor that they would be taken to the police station if she refused permission to search.\n\nThis fact would be less likely for the defense attorney to attempt to prove because it does not directly relate to the legality or propriety of the search itself. Rather, it focuses on the potential consequences of the neighbor's refusal to comply with the police's request, which may suggest coercion or compulsion rather than a genuine refusal. However, it is still relevant to the defendant's claim that she had a right to privacy and personal security during the time when she was alone with her boyfriend and his new girlfriend, as the defendant claims this incident caused her distress and fear. This information could potentially be used to argue that the search should not have been conducted without a warrant."
