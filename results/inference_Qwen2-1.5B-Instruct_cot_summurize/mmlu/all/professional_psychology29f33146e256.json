According to Hersey and Blanchard's Situational Leadership Model, employees at different stages of their careers may require different styles of leadership depending on their level of maturity and readiness to take on more responsibilities. For example, a new employee who has not yet developed the necessary skills or willingness to assume responsibility may need more support and guidance from a mentor or coach in order to succeed. On the other hand, an experienced employee with strong skills and a high level of motivation and readiness to take on more responsibility may be able to lead more independently."
