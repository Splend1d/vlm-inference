The vineyard, a 20-acre tract situated to the north of the orange grove, was owned by a rancher in fee simple absolute. A remote predecessor of the farmer had granted to a shepherd a way for egress and ingress across the orange grove under such terms and circumstances that an easement appurtenant to the vineyard was created. This right-of-way was executed by deed and properly recorded. The shepherd, however, never made any actual use of the right-of-way. In 2010, the rancher conveyed the vineyard to the farmer. The next year, the farmer conveyed the vineyard by deed to an investor for a consideration of $200,000, receipt of which was acknowledged. Neither the rancher \u0080\u0094farmer deed nor the farmer \u0080\u0094 investor deed contained any reference to the easement for right-of-way. The investor has now claimed that she has a right-of-way across the orange grove. The farmer, on the other hand, has informed the investor that no such easement exists. Assume that the orange grove abuts a public highway. The only access to that public highway for the vineyard is across the orange grove. If the investor initiates an appropriate action to determine her right to use the right-of-way across the orange grove, she should\n\nA. prevail, because an easement by implication arose from the farmer's conveyance to the investor.\nB. prevail, because once an easement is properly recorded, it remains in effect ad finem until expressly released.\nC. not prevail, because any easements were extinguished by merger when the farmer acquired a fee simple in the vineyard.\nD. not prevail, because the deed of conveyance from the farmer to the investor failed to contain any mention of the right-of-way.\n"

Not prevail, because the deed of conveyance from the farmer to the investor failed to contain any mention of the right-of-way.\n\nEasements by implication arise from the operation of law, and they do not require a written instrument to be valid. However, if there is a clear and undisputed easement, then it will continue to exist even if it is not mentioned in the deed or other legal documents. In this case, the farmer did not convey any rights of way to the investor, so the easement does not exist by implication.\n\nIf the investor wishes to proceed with a claim to the right-of-way, she can file a lawsuit challenging the validity of the easement by implication. However, if the farmer contests the existence of the easement, the court may decide that the easement does not exist by implication and that the farmer retains full ownership of the orange grove. In this case, the investor would have lost her right to use the right-of-way."
