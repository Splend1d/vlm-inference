One of the founding assumptions of Critical Security Studies is that theories about the world constitute that world and thus that theory, including security theory, has political effects. The consequence is that theory is the product of the system, and that analyses of the agent of security and the referent object is produced by its own practices.\nB. Central to the political and critical nature of post-structural literature is the idea of fostering an ethos of democracy and an ethos of critique which is finite and attainable. It is to this end that we must strive, but one that can only be met under the conditions prescribed, that of true democracy.\nC. A central notion of critique is to provide an answer to the problem of what it means to be critical. This invariably raises the question of revealing the interest behind knowledge claims with the goal of social change, what is accepted as the end of theory: that the practical and contextual understandings inform to whom knowledge claims serve.\nD. Poststructuralism accepts the form and foundations for knowledge claims that dominate the security studies debate. This has brought it into confrontation with the critical studies community, having little to contribute to the understanding of the ways in which knowledge is constructed.\n"

The key themes that make post-structuralism distinct include:\n\n  * The belief that theories about the world shape the world and have significant political consequences. This leads to the view that theory is shaped by the practices of those who create it, rather than being independent from them.\n  * The focus on fostering an ethos of democracy and critique, which requires a finite and achievable goal that can only be achieved within certain conditions, such as true democracy.\n\nCriticism of post-structuralism includes:\n\n  * The fact that it is based on the assumption that theories shape reality and have significant political consequences, which some argue is overly simplistic and ignores the complexity of human behavior and decision-making processes.\n  * The tendency for post-structuralists to privilege the interests of the dominant group over those of marginalized groups, which some critics argue undermines their commitment to promoting social change.\n  * The lack of contribution to the understanding of how knowledge is constructed, which some argue leaves post-structuralism open to criticism and questioning."
