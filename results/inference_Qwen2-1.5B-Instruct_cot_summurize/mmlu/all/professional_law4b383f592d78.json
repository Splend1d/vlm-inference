He finally saw a public defender who filed a motion to dismiss alleging an unconstitutional detention in violation of due process. The prosecution countered that the state's rules allowed for detention without a probable cause hearing for up to 30 days, and that the procedure was constitutional. Will the court most likely decide that this detention is unconstitutional?\n\nA. No, because the Supreme Court has ruled that detentions can properly last up to 30 days without a probable cause determination.\nB. No, because each case must be decided on its own facts and there may be many good reasons why the state has not yet provided a probable cause determination.\nC. Yes, because when the state arrests someone without a warrant it must provide a prompt probable cause determination.\nD. No, because it is constitutional to hold someone for up to 15 days without a probable cause determination.\n"

Yes, because when the state arrests someone without a warrant it must provide a prompt probable cause determination.\n\nIn order for a person to be detained without a probable cause determination, the government must have a legal basis for doing so, which typically includes a warrant or some other form of authorization from a judge. If the government does not have such a legal basis, then the person cannot be detained. In this case, the man was arrested without a warrant and held for 14 days without a probable cause determination. This would violate his rights under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Therefore, the court is most likely to decide that this detention is unconstitutional."
