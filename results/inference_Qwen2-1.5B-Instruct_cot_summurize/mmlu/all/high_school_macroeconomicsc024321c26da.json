Prices and/or Output is Higher.\n\nWhen real GDP (the nominal GDP adjusted for inflation) increases, it means that the overall economy has produced more goods and services in today's dollars than it did in previous periods. This increase could be due to an increase in the quantity of goods and services produced or a decrease in their price level. If the price level remains constant, then the increase in quantity produced will result in higher prices. If the price level decreases, then the same increase in quantity will result in lower prices.\n\nTherefore, if real GDP increases, we cannot conclude with certainty that prices are higher or employment is higher, but we can conclude that either prices or output must have increased. The other options (prices are higher, employment is higher) are not necessarily true based on the given information."
