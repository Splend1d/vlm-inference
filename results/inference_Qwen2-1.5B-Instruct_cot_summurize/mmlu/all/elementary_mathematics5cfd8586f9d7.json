According to the problem, Gary has 6 times as many cows as he has horses, which means:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of cows} = 6 \\times h \\]\n\nWe know that Gary has 72 cows, so we can set up an equation based on this information and solve for \\(h\\):\n\n\\[ 72 = 6h \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 6 to isolate \\(h\\):\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{72}{6} \\]\n\\[ h = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, Gary has 12 horses. The correct answer is A. 12 horses."
