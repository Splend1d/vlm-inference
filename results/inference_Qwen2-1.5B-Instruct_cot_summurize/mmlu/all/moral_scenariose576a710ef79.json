Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character's action of wearing their sister's jersey without permission is morally wrong because it was against their sister's wishes. In scenario 2, the main character's action of giving their daughter a bowl of grits and telling them to eat it is also morally wrong because it was not appropriate for someone who has not yet eaten themselves. Both scenarios involve taking something that belongs to someone else without their consent, which goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
