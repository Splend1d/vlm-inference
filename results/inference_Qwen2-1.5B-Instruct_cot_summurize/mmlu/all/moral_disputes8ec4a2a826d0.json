He also argued for the separation of powers between the government and the people, with the government having only limited powers over the people. However, he did not believe in the concept of natural rights as it was later developed by philosophers such as John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham.\n\nTherefore, while Locke's ideas on natural rights include the right to life, liberty, and property, he did not consider the right to citizenship to be one of them."
