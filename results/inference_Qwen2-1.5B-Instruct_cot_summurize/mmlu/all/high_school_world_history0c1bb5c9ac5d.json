The King of China is a Tartar, and one of the descendants of [Ghenghis] Khan\u2026In all the Chinese provinces, there is a town for the [Muslims], and in this they reside. They also have cells, colleges, and mosques, and are made much of by the Kings of China\u2026\nWhen we approached this city [of Hangzhou] we were met by its judge, the [elders] of Islamism, and the great merchants. The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand\u2026In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy. There are in the city a great number of [Muslims], with some of whom I resided for fifteen days; and was treated most [honorably]\u2026\"\nIbn Battuta, Voyages, 1332\u20131346 C.E.\nWhich of the following conclusions about the period 600 C.E.\u20131450 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage?\n\nA.

New religious traditions overturned prior lasting religious beliefs.\n\nThe passage describes the influence of various religions on different regions of China during the 13th century, including the rise of Islam and the growth of Christianity in the region. It suggests that new religious practices were introduced and accepted by the local populations, challenging traditional beliefs and values. This is an example of the \"unfolding\" or \"evolution\" of religious beliefs during this period, which can be seen as overturning prior religious beliefs rather than simply being stagnant. Therefore, option B best supports the idea that the period 600 C.E.\u20131450 C.E. saw significant changes in religious beliefs and practices throughout Eurasia."
