Finding a shortest cycle in G\n\nThis problem can be solved using various algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Prim's algorithm, both of which have running times that are polynomial in terms of the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The other problems (finding a longest simple cycle, finding all spanning trees, and finding a largest clique) are NP-hard problems, meaning they cannot be solved in polynomial time on general graphs. However, they can still be approximated efficiently using techniques like fractional coloring or spectral relaxation."
