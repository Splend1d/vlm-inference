In this case, we have two bonds with different maturities but the same type of debt (five- or ten-year bond). The difference in their yields can help us determine whether the yield curve is upward sloping, downward sloping, flat, or inverted.\n\nLet's calculate the yield on each bond:\n\nFor the five-year bond:\n\\[ \\text{Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Current Yield}}{\\text{Maturity Duration}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Yield} = \\frac{6\\%}{5} \\times 100\\% = 12\\% \\]\n\nFor the ten-year bond:\n\\[ \\text{Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Current Yield}}{\\text{Maturity Duration}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Yield} = \\frac{5\\%}{10} \\times 100\\% = 5\\% \\]\n\nTo find the yield curve, we need to compare these yields:\n\n- For a positive yield, it means that the longer the bond matures, the higher the yield.\n- For a negative yield, it means that the longer the bond matures, the lower the yield.\n\nComparing the yields:\n- Five-year bond: 12%\n- Ten-year bond: 5%\n\nSince the ten-year bond has a lower yield than the five-year bond, the yield curve would be downward sloping if you were looking at the comparison of yields over time rather than just comparing the current yields.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. downward sloping**."
