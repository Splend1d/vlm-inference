A claims adjuster from that insurance company contacted the pedestrian and discussed the accident with him. The insurance adjuster said, \"You're not actually entitled to any compensation for these injuries, under the laws of this state; but I feel bad for you, and I'm a nice guy, so I'm willing to approve a $1,000 payment to you. \" The insurance adjuster knew that, in fact, the pedestrian would be entitled to compensation under the state's tort law. The pedestrian rejected the offer, retained an attorney, and wound up winning a $550,000 jury verdict on negligence claims against the driver. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the insurance adjuster for misrepresentation, will the pedestrian prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the insurance adjuster's $1,000 settlement offer was grossly inadequate.\nB. Yes, because the insurance adjuster knew that laws of the state provided for recovery in such a case.\nC. No, because the insurance adjuster's statements did not cause the pedestrian any monetary loss.\nD. No, because the insurance adjuster did not have a fiduciary relationship requiring him to protect the pedestrian's interests.\n"

Yes, because the insurance adjuster knew that laws of the state provided for recovery in such a case.\n\nThe insurance adjuster's statement that the pedestrian would not be entitled to compensation for his injuries under the laws of the state was false. This caused the pedestrian to reject the offer made by the adjuster, which was a breach of the duty of candor and honesty required of all parties involved in a legal dispute. As a result, the pedestrian may be able to assert a claim against the insurance adjuster for misrepresentation."
