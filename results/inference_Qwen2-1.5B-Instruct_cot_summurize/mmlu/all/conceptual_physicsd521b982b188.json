When two protons and two neutrons are removed from the nucleus of an atom, it becomes a different element with a different atomic number and mass number. In this case, removing two protons and two neutrons leaves behind two alpha particles (two helium nuclei), so the resulting nucleus is magnesium-20, which has an atomic number of 12 and a mass number of 20."
