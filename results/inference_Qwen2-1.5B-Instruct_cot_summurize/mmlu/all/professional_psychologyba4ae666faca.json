This concept, known as \"analogy\" or \"analogy of the stranger,\" refers to the idea that children may compare their parents to strangers in order to understand themselves better and gain a sense of identity. However, this process can lead to feelings of inadequacy if the child's expectations do not match reality.\n\nIn contrast, options B, C, and D refer to different aspects of anxiety and defense mechanisms. Option B describes a failure to dissolve a symbiotic attachment, which refers to a lack of separation from caregivers during early development. Option C discusses an inability to cope with new situations, while option D focuses on a failure of defenses to modulate excitation adequately, which refers to difficulties in regulating emotions and behaviors."
