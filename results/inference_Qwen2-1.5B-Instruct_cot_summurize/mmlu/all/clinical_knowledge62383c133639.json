It is a synovial hinge joint, which means it has a sliding joint surface with synovial fluid between the bones to allow for movement. The articular surfaces of the elbow are convex (ball) shaped on the ulna and concave (socket) shaped on the radius. This allows for a range of motion in all directions, including flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and rotation."
