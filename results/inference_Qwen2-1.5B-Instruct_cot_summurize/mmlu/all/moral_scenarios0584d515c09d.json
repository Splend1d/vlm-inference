Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn this case, both actions involve taking something from someone else without permission or consent, but biting fruit at the grocery store does not seem like it would be seen as morally wrong by most people's standard of what is considered right and wrong. On the other hand, making sure your children give you their life jacket when there is only one available shows a lack of empathy and concern for the safety of others."
