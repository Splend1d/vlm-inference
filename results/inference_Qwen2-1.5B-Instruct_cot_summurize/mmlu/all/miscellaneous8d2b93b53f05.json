Option C, Things, contains the letters \"T,\" \"H,\" \"I,\" \"N,\" and \"E,\" which can be combined to form other words such as \"thing\" or \"things.\" Option D, Lamp, contains the letters \"L,\" \"A,\" \"M,\" and \"P,\" which can be combined to form other words such as \"lame\" or \"lamp.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B, Said."
