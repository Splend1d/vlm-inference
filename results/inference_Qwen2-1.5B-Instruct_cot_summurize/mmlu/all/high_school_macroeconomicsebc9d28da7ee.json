They can occur at any time during an economy's cycle, but they tend to be more frequent in times of high unemployment or inflation. While recessions can be disruptive, they are not a \"thing of the past\" or a \"very severe depression,\" as they do not necessarily indicate a permanent loss of economic stability. Rather, recessions are a normal part of the business cycle and help to promote economic growth and stability over the long term."
