They are all forms of residential segregation.\n\nApartheid was a system of racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa that was implemented from 1948 until it was abolished in 1994. Ethnic cleansing refers to the deliberate removal or expulsion of one's own people by another group, often motivated by political, economic, or social factors. Integration refers to the process of bringing together different groups of people into a single community or society. Residential segregation occurs when certain groups of people live in separate areas of a city or town, often due to historical patterns of discrimination or prejudice. Therefore, these terms share the commonality of being related to the separation of different ethnic groups based on race or ethnicity."
