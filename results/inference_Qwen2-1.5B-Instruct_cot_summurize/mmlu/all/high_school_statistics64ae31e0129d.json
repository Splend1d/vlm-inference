A 95% confidence interval of the proportion of students in a small town who are taking some AP class.\n\nUsing a census for this purpose would not be appropriate because a census is typically used to gather complete and accurate information about an entire population, rather than just a sample. In contrast, a sample (such as the proportion of students taking AP classes) can be collected using other methods such as random sampling or convenience sampling.\n\nA 95% confidence interval of mean height of teachers in a small town and a two-tailed hypothesis test where the null hypothesis was that the mean expenditure on entertainment by male students at a high school is the same as that of female students are examples of situations where a sample is more appropriate, while a census may not be necessary or even desirable."
