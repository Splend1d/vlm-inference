Has an uncertain relationship with skeletal health because research studies are confounded by associated lifestyle factors such as smoking, exercise and alcohol consumption\n\nWhile there is some evidence to suggest that certain nutrients or dietary patterns may influence bone health, the exact mechanisms involved and their potential effects can vary depending on many factors such as individual genetics, age, sex, diet, and physical activity levels. Therefore, it's important to consider both positive and negative associations when interpreting results from research studies involving fruit and vegetable consumption and its impact on skeletal health. It's also worth noting that while there have been some studies suggesting possible protective effects of certain nutrients on bone health, these findings are not always consistent across different populations or settings, making it difficult to generalize them widely."
