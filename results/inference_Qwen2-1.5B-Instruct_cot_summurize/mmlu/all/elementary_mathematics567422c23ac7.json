So, for one bag:\n\n- Black pens: \\(19\\) \n- Red pens: \\(12\\)\n\nThe total number of pens in one bag is \\(19 + 12 = 31\\).\n\nSince he put 5 bags of pens, the total number of pens is \\(5 \\times 31\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is **(5 \u00d7 19) + 12**.\n\nThis means that the total number of pens Mr. Lucci put into bags is \\(5 \\times 19\\) plus \\(12\\). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. (5 \u00d7 19) + 12."
