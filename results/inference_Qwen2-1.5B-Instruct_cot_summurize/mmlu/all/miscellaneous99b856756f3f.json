                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's first calculate Carmen's total utility from consuming the two goods:\n\nTotal Utility = (X utility) + (Y utility)\n\nWe know that the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on good X is 5, which means the utility gained by spending an additional dollar on good X is 5. Similarly, the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on good Y is 10, meaning the utility gained by spending an additional dollar on good Y is 10.\n\nLet's assume Carmen starts with a certain amount of money, say $M. After spending $1 on good X, her utility would be:\n\\[ \\text{Utility}_X = M - 1 + 5 \\]\n\nAfter spending another dollar on good X, her utility becomes:\n\\[ \\text{Utility}_X' = M - 2 + 5 \\]\n\nSo, the change in utility when spending another dollar on good X is:\n\\[ \\Delta\\text{Utility}_X = 5 \\]\n\nSimilarly, after spending $1 on good Y, her utility is:\n\\[ \\text{Utility}_Y = M - 1 + 10 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Utility}_Y' = M - 1 + 10 \\]\n\nThe change in utility when spending another dollar on good Y is:\n\\[ \\Delta\\text{Utility}_Y = 10 \\]\n\nNow, to maximize her utility, Carmen should spend all her money on good Y, as it gives her the highest possible utility given the constraints of her budget and consumption levels for each good.\n\nTherefore, Carmen should:\n\nB. buy fewer units of X and more units of Y"
