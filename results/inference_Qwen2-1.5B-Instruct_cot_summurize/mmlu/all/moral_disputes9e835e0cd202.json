He suggests that the pursuit of individual liberty should not come at the expense of the well-being of others or the stability of society.\n\nEgalitarian values suggest that everyone should have equal opportunities and resources, which can help eliminate inequalities and prevent people from being vulnerable to oppression. Libertarian values prioritize individual freedom and mobility, but they may also lead to negative consequences if they do not take into account the needs of others.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to balance individual freedoms with other values, and both A and B are valid options."
