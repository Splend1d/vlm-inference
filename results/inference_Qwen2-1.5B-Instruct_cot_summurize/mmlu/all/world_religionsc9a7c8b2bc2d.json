He is the last of the ascetic prophets.\n\nMahavira, also known as Gotama Buddha, was the last of the four major Indian religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Shintoism (which later became part of Japanese culture). He lived from 563 to 486 BCE and founded the Jaina tradition. As the last of the ascetic prophets, he emphasized self-discipline, meditation, and renunciation of worldly possessions. His teachings were influential in shaping the development of Jainism, which emphasizes non-violence, truthfulness, and chastity."
