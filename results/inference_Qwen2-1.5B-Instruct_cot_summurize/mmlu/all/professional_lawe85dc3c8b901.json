The neighbor's plan conformed to all local building ordinances and land use regulations. The owner had been in the house for 10 years and the neighbor recently bought the adjoining lot. The owner showed that a different placement of the house would not interfere with her use and enjoyment of her residence. The trial judge ruled in favor of the defendant on the basis that the defendant had a right to build his house anywhere as long as he followed the building/zoning laws. The owner appealed. Will the appellate court likely reverse the trial court's decision?\n\nA. Yes, because blocking a neighbor's sunlight is a constitutional deprivation of substantive due process.\nB. Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.\nC. No, because the trial court was correct in ruling that there had to be some violation of building regulations before the construction could be enjoined.\nD. No, because a comparative evaluation of the benefits and detriments of each position favor the neighbor's position.\n"

Yes, because the proposed use is a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property.\n\nPrivate nuisances occur when someone's actions or activities cause harm to another person's property or personal interests without their consent. In this case, the neighbor's house would block the owner's direct access to daily sunlight, which is a fundamental aspect of her enjoyment of her residence. This interference with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property constitutes a private nuisance.\n\nTherefore, the appellate court is more likely to reverse the trial court's decision if it finds that the neighbor's proposed use is indeed a private nuisance that unreasonably interferes with the owner's use and enjoyment of her property."
