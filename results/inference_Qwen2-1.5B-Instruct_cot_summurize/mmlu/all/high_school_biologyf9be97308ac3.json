For example, if we were discussing the effects of vaccination on the immune response, then statement A (which refers to the increase in receptor diversity) would be the most relevant. However, if we were discussing the mechanism by which vaccines work, then statements B, C, and D (all referring to changes in immune cell populations) would be more appropriate. Ultimately, the choice of the correct answer will depend on the level of detail or specificity required for the question at hand."
