Artifacts are often found within specific environments, such as near bodies of water, roads, or other significant features. By leaving them in place and recording their location and surroundings, archaeologists can gain valuable insights into the context in which they were produced and used. This information helps to reconstruct the social, economic, and cultural practices of the people who created them."
