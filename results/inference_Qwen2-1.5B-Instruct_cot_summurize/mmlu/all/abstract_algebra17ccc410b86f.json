False, False.\n\nStatement 1: Every ideal in a ring is a subring of the ring.\nThis statement is false because it assumes that all ideals are necessarily closed under addition and multiplication, which is not always true. For example, consider the ring Z (the set of integers) with the usual addition and multiplication. The ideal generated by any single integer is just that integer itself, but this ideal is not necessarily closed under addition or multiplication.\n\nStatement 2: Every subring of every ring is an ideal of the ring.\nThis statement is also false. While it's true that every subring of a ring must be closed under addition and multiplication within its own structure, it doesn't imply that it automatically satisfies the conditions for being an ideal in the larger ring. An ideal in a larger ring is defined as a subset that is closed under addition and multiplication with respect to both the original ring and the larger ring, whereas a subring merely has elements from one larger ring that are contained within another ring. Thus, while every subring of a ring will have properties similar to those of an ideal, it may or may not satisfy these properties completely depending on how it relates to the larger ring."
