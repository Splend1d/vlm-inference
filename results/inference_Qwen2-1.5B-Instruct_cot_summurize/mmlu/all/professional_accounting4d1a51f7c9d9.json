Planned reliance on substantive tests.\n\nWhen an auditor finds that the sample results indicate a higher than expected rate of deviation from the prescribed control, it indicates that there may be some errors or irregularities in the cash disbursements process. In this case, reducing the planned reliance on substantive tests would not be appropriate as it would not address the underlying issue and could lead to overlooking potential errors or fraud.\n\nInstead, the auditor should increase the reliance on substantive tests (such as audit procedures) to determine if the errors or irregularities exist and are material. This will help ensure that the cash disbursements process is operating effectively and efficiently."
