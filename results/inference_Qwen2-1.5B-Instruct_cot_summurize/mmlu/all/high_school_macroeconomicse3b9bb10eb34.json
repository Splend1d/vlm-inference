Your friends make a music CD that doesn't sell any copies.\n\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a specific time period. It includes both physical products like cars, CDs, and houses, as well as intangible goods and services like education, healthcare, and entertainment. \n\nOption A involves purchasing a car, which is a tangible good and contributes to GDP directly. Option B involves transportation infrastructure improvement, which also adds to GDP since it increases the flow of goods and services across the economy. \n\nOption D involves purchasing computer hardware for a university, which also contributes to GDP through increased production and consumption. Therefore, none of these options have an immediate impact on GDP unless there's a change in how the goods or services are used or consumed after they're purchased. However, option C does not involve the purchase of any goods or services; instead, it represents the creation of a product with no market demand or sale, hence having no direct impact on GDP."
