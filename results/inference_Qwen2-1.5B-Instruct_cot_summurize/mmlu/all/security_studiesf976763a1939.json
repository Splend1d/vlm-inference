War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where, among other reasons, states have the incentive and opportunity to buckpass.\nC.

War is more likely to occur when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion, and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behavior. In a realist perspective, a declining state may feel threatened by a rising power or group, leading it to act aggressively to maintain its position in the international system.\n\n2. War may be more likely to occur in multipolar international systems where states have the incentive and opportunity to bypass traditional alliances and form their own coalitions. In such systems, states may prioritize their own interests over collective security, increasing the likelihood of conflict between them.\n\n3. War is more likely when the offense-defense balance of the international system favors offense, as this creates an uneven playing field for states. States that are not able to defend themselves effectively may be forced to take action against others to protect their interests, leading to conflicts and wars.\n\n4. A realist perspective also considers the impact of economic factors on the likelihood of war. States with strong economies may be less inclined to use force, as they can afford to avoid conflict and maintain their status quo. Conversely, states with weaker economies may be more vulnerable to aggression and may be more likely to resort to war to secure resources and maintain control over territory."
