However, it's important to note that each of these movements had its own unique approach to creating art objects that were both traditionally inspired and saleable. For example, Impressionism was known for its focus on capturing the fleeting moments of light and color in nature, while Pop Art was known for its use of everyday objects and mass-produced materials. Abstract Expressionism was known for its emphasis on emotional expression through large-scale paintings and sculptures, and Conceptual art was known for its focus on ideas and concepts rather than physical objects. So while the intention of making traditional, saleable art objects may have been abandoned by some of these movements, they still produced many iconic works of art that continue to be celebrated today."
