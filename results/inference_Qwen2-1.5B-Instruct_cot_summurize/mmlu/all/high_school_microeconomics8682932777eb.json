A perfectly vertical supply curve.\n\nIn economics, a perfectly vertical supply curve indicates that there is no supply at all for a good or service, meaning that only one person has the original signed copy of \"The Wealth of Nations\" by Adam Smith. This scenario illustrates a monopoly situation where only one seller exists in the market, and they have exclusive control over the product."
