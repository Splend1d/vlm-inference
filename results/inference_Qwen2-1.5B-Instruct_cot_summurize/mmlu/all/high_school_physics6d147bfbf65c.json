The gravitational force, because by F = GMm/r^2, the force of the table on the wood at that close range is sufficient to balance the force of the Earth on the wood.\nC.

This is because the gravitational force between two objects is given by F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where F is the force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. In this case, the table and the wooden block are interacting through gravity, which is caused by the attraction between the positive charges of the table's atoms and the negative charges of the wooden block's atoms."
