This could lead to a shortage of goods and services, which would result in higher prices for those goods and services as demand exceeds supply.\n\nAssuming an upward sloping aggregate supply curve, this means that producers have more flexibility to adjust their output levels in response to changes in demand. In other words, they can produce more or less depending on the market demand. However, if there is a shortage due to the destruction of plant and equipment, the supply curve will shift to the right (i.e., producers will produce more) until the shortage is resolved. As a result, the equilibrium price level and quantity of output will increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase."
