The salesperson offered to sell the man 1,000 fire extinguishers for his hotel. The salesperson told the man that the cost of the fire extinguishers would be $35,000 (or $35 apiece), payable 90 days after delivery. The salesperson promised to have the fire extinguishers installed no later than April 15. On March 16, the man telephoned the salesperson and accepted the offer. The following day, the man mailed the following memo to the salesperson:\"Please be advised that I shall take a 15 percent discount for cash payment seven days after installation. \" The salesperson received the man's correspondence on March 20. On April 1, the salesperson sent a telegram to the man, stating: \"It's apparent we don't have an enforceable contract in effect. I will not be delivering the fire extinguishers on April 15 or any other time. \"The man brings suit against the salesperson for breach of contract. The salesperson asserts the defense of the statute of frauds under the UCC. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the salesperson's defenses?\n\nA. The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo was not sufficient to indicate that a contract was formed.\nB. The salesperson's defense is valid, because the man's memo was inconsistent with the terms of the salesperson's oral offer.\nC. The salesperson's defense is not valid, because the salesperson failed to respond to the man's memo within a reasonable period of time.\nD. The salesperson's defense is not valid, because under the UCC the statute of frauds is not applicable in agreements between merchants.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The salesperson's defense is not valid, because under the UCC the statute of frauds is not applicable in agreements between merchants.\n\nIn this case, the salesperson made an oral offer to sell the man 1,000 fire extinguishers at a price of $35 per unit, payable 90 days after delivery. The man accepted the offer and agreed to pay the purchase price by cash payment seven days after installation. However, the man's memo to the salesperson did not specify the date when the man would accept the terms of the sale, nor did it include any conditions that could be enforced by law. Therefore, the man's memo was not sufficient to indicate that a contract had been formed.\n\nFurthermore, the salesperson's memo to the man did not contain any express acceptance of the terms of the offer. The salesperson's memo simply stated that the man should take a 15 percent discount for cash payment seven days after installation, without specifying the date when the man would accept these terms. This lack of specific acceptance of the terms of the offer prevented the man from entering into a legally binding contract with the salesperson.\n\nTherefore, the salesperson's defense based on the statute of frauds is invalid because the terms of the oral offer were not sufficiently communicated to the man, and the man's memo to the salesperson was insufficient to indicate that a contract had been formed."
