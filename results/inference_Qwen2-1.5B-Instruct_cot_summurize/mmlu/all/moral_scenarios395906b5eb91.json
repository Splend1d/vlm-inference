Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nScenario 1 involves taking responsibility for picking up your child from school yourself, which is generally considered a good thing to do. However, it also implies that you were not following any specific rules or regulations regarding childcare, such as dropping off and picking up at designated times or locations.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, involves serving perfectly cooked chicken at a dinner party, which is a positive and respectful action. Serving food at a dinner party is a common and expected social behavior, and it shows consideration for others' preferences and needs.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are generally considered morally correct, but Scenario 1 introduces an element of confusion about whether there was a specific rule or regulation involved, while Scenario 2 does not introduce any ambiguity."
