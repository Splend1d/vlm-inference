Implicit memory refers to memories that are not consciously recalled but are still accessible and can be retrieved later through sensory cues or other means. Examples include remembering how to tie a tie, recognizing a celebrity, and recalling the name of your junior high school shop teacher. Describing the taste of the cake at your last birthday party would not fall under this category as it is something you would recall when prompted to do so, rather than something that is automatically available for retrieval without conscious effort."
