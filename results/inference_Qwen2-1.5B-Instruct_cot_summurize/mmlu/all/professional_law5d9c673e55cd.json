The neighbor then moved into possession of the farm and used it openly and exclusively, paying the taxes for 23 years. He did not use his easement during that period. The woman returned and tried to evict the neighbor from the farm. The court held that the neighbor had acquired the farm by adverse possession. The neighbor then sold the farm back to the woman, who then put a chain across the easement. The neighbor has now brought an action to remove the chain. In most jurisdictions, the neighbor will\n\nA. lose, because he abandoned his easement.\nB. lose, because he did not use his easement for the statutory period of 20 years.\nC. lose, because, rather than using his easement, he used all of the farm.\nD. win, because mere non-use of an easement does not extinguish it.\n"

If the easement holder does not use the easement for the required period, they cannot claim ownership of the land. In this case, the neighbor did not use his easement for 20 years, so he cannot claim ownership of the farm."
