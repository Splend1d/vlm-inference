When the speed of an object increases by a certain factor, its kinetic energy also increases by that factor.\n\nTherefore, if the model car's original speed was \\(v\\) and it speeds up to three times its original speed, then its new speed would be \\(3v\\). The kinetic energy of the car would increase from \\((1/2)mv^2\\) (where \\(m\\) is the mass of the car) to \\((1/2)(3)v^2 = 3(1/2)mv^2\\) = \\(3/2 mv^2\\).\n\nSo the correct answer is C: three times greater."
