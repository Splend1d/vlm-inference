At the same time, reducing taxes can encourage individuals and businesses to spend more, as they have less money in their pockets due to lower incomes or higher tax rates. This combination of increased government spending and reduced taxes can help mitigate the effects of a recession by increasing overall consumption and investment in the economy."
