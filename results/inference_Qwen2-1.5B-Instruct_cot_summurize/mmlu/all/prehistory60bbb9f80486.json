The use of seeds as a natural insecticide in Altamira cave in southwestern Europe is an example of new uses for plants during the Middle Stone Age.\n\nDuring the Middle Stone Age, people began using plants as a means of pest control by coating them with a substance that would kill insects. This practice was not limited to just one species of plant; it also included the use of various types of plants, including grains, fruits, and nuts. The specific type of plant used varied depending on its availability, but some examples include corn, beans, and rice.\n\nIt's important to note that while this method of pest control may have been effective at the time, it is not considered sustainable or ethical today. Today, we rely on chemical pesticides to control pests and protect crops from damage caused by insects."
