                    "text": "The answer is D: Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.\n\nAs the number of sprints increases, the body becomes more efficient at using oxygen and burning fat for energy. This leads to an increase in the proportion of aerobic metabolism in the muscles, as compared to anaerobic metabolism (which relies on lactic acid production). This adaptation helps the athlete maintain their performance over longer periods without fatigue. The pH of the muscle may also rise during intense exercise due to the release of carbon dioxide, but it does not fall below 6.0. Blood glucose levels will typically remain relatively stable during moderate-intensity exercise, but they can decrease slightly during high-intensity or prolonged exercise if glycogen stores are depleted. However, there's no specific reference given about blood glucose concentration falling below 3 mmol/L during sprints, so this option isn't directly supported by the information provided."
