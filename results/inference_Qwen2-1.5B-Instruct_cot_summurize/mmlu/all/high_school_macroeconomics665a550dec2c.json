More US dollars are being sent abroad than foreign currencies are being sent to the United States.\n\nA positive current account balance means that the country is importing less and exporting more, which results in a surplus. A negative current account balance means that the country is importing more and exporting less, resulting in a deficit. In other words, a negative current account balance indicates a trade deficit or a capital account deficit, but not necessarily a capital account surplus."
