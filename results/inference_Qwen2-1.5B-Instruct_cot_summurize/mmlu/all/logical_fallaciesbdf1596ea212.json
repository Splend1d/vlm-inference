This fallacy occurs when someone argues that they are a reasonable and intelligent person because they have certain qualities or traits that others may lack, which implies that those who do not share these qualities must be unreasonable or lacking in intelligence.\n\nIn this case, the speaker is using their own self-assessment to argue that their claim about the truthfulness of the other person's statement must be true, without providing any evidence for it. This is a logical fallacy, as it relies on the assumption that one's own judgment or perception is superior to another's, even though there may be no objective basis for making such an assertion."
