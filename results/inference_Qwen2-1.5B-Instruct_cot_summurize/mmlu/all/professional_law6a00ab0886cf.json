The defendant is alleged to have masterminded a scheme wherein he set up a nonexistent corporation that never conducted business. The victims were sent prospectuses containing false financial data, which induced them to purchase stock in the phony corporation. At trial, the prosecution seeks to introduce into evidence proof that the defendant had set up 10 other so-called dummy corporations that never existed. This evidence is\n\nA. admissible, to show defendant's character trait for dishonesty.\nB. admissible, to show his intent to defraud.\nC. inadmissible, because character cannot be proved by specific instances of misconduct.\nD. inadmissible, because the evidence is not relevant.\n"

The evidence of setting up 10 other dummy corporations that never existed would tend to prove that the defendant acted with the requisite intent to defraud. Character evidence, such as dishonesty or intent to deceive, can be introduced to establish motive and opportunity for the commission of an offense, but it must be limited to instances where the defendant engaged in conduct falling within the same pattern of behavior as the one at issue in the case."
