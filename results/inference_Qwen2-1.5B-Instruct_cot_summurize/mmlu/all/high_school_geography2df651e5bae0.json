This is known as \"off-target effects\" and can lead to long-term health consequences for individuals who consume foods containing GMOs. Additionally, some people worry that these crops could be engineered with traits that are not necessarily beneficial for human consumption or that could pose risks to the environment. Therefore, while GMOs can help increase crop yields and improve resistance to pests and diseases, their potential impact on human health and the environment must also be carefully considered and regulated."
