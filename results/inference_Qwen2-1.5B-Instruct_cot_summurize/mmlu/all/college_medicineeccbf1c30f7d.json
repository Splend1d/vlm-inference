Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is found mainly in cells that do not have DNA, such as viruses and some types of bacteria. Dinitro nucleic acids are a type of DNA that is formed by adding nitrogen to the sugar part of DNA, but this does not correspond to any existing biological system. Protein is another important type of molecule that plays various roles in biology, but it is not the genetic material itself."
