It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nWhich of the following led directly to the development of the economic system described in the journal?\n\nA. Military campaigns\nB. Meteorological phenomena\nC. Competition with European trade networks\nD. The presence of highly developed port cities\n"

The passage does not mention any of the options provided (Military campaigns, meteorological phenomena, competition with European trade networks, or the presence of highly developed port cities) as leading to the development of the economic system described.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nNone of the above.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the passage does not provide enough context or evidence to definitively conclude which of these factors directly contributed to the development of the economic system described. The passage simply provides information about the port city of Aden and its inhabitants, without discussing broader historical events or external influences that may have shaped the local economy."
