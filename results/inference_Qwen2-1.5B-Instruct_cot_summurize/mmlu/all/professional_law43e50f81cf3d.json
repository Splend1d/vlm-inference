The contract stated:\"The painting is to be done during the month of June, and payment is to be made within one week after the painting is completed. The rights under this contact are not to be assigned. \"The painter started the painting on June 1. On June 10, the painter assigned to his nephew the right to receive payment on the painter's contract with the homeowner. Which of the following statements is most accurate with regard to the painter's assignment to his nephew?\n\nA. The homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was nonassignable.\nB. Since personal service contracts of this nature are nonassignable, the homeowner would be under no duty to pay the nephew.\nC. The assignment would constitute a novation, relieving the homeowner of liability.\nD. The assignment would be irrevocable if it were reduced to writing and signed by the painter.\n"

In this case, the painter has assigned his rights under the contract to his nephew, who is now entitled to receive payment from the homeowner. This assignment does not affect the homeowner's obligation to pay the painter, as long as the assignment is valid and enforceable. Therefore, the homeowner would still be obligated to pay the painter even though the nephew is now receiving payment. However, the homeowner may have a defense against the nephew's claim if the assignment was made without the homeowner's consent or if there was fraud involved."
