This means that the code must be widely accepted and practiced by a large number of people within the society.\n\nAt the same time, the code must also have legal or governmental recognition, which allows it to be enforced and maintained through societal institutions such as law enforcement agencies or educational programs. In other words, the code must be institutionalized and supported by authority figures who enforce it.\n\nTherefore, for a moral code to become \"currency,\" it must be both widely accepted and legally recognized by the society."
