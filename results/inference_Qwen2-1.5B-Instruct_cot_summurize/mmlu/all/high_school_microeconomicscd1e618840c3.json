Economics is concerned with the allocation of resources and the satisfaction of human wants within the constraints of limited resources, such as money or time. It examines issues such as production, distribution, consumption, and pricing in order to understand how society efficiently meets its basic needs while also ensuring that all members of society have access to the goods and services they need to survive and thrive."
