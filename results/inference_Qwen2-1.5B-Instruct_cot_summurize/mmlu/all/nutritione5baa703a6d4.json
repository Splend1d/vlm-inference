Poor muscle strength\n\nPoor muscle strength is one of the major risk factors for osteoporosis, as it can lead to decreased bone density and increased fragility in bones. This is because muscles play a key role in supporting bones by providing resistance during movement and helping to maintain bone health. If muscles become weak or weakened due to injury or disease, they may not be able to provide enough support to bones, leading to a higher risk of fractures."
