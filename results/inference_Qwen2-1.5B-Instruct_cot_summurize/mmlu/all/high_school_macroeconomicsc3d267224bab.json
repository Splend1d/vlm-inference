                    "text": "The correct answer is B: the nominal interest rate falls.\n\nWhen nominal interest rates fall, households may perceive that their income is rising faster than the rate at which they can earn it through other investments or savings accounts. This perception can lead to an increase in household demand for assets such as real estate and stocks, as these assets offer higher returns compared to other investment options with lower expected returns. As a result, the price level (household demand) rises, leading to a rise in the overall price level (GDP). Therefore, option A is incorrect because nominal GDP does not affect household demand directly. Option C is also incorrect because falling bond prices do not necessarily cause a rise in household demand. Option D is also incorrect because a decrease in the supply of money would likely lead to a depreciation of currency values rather than an increase in household demand."
