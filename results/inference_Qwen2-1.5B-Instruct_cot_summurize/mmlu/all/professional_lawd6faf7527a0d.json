On June 1, 2005, the woman sells to a husband and wife an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by the husband). The deed to the husband and wife reads as follows: \"To (husband) and (wife) and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. \"On June 1, 2006, the woman sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to the husband and his brother for $125,000 (the husband pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and the brother pays the balance). The deed to the husband and the brother provides: \"To (the husband) and (the brother) and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. \"The husband conveys to his cousin all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds from the woman. The husband then dies. The brother then dies.

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. An undivided one-half interest in the land.\n\nWhen a person buys a property with a seller who is not related to them but instead with a third party, such as a tenant or a joint tenant, the original seller still retains an undivided one-half interest in the property. This means that the buyer cannot acquire any rights over the other half of the property without the permission of the original seller. In this case, the woman retained an undivided one-half interest in the property until she sold it to the husband and wife on June 1, 2005.\n\nTherefore, when the husband and wife bought the property from the woman, they acquired a one-half interest in the property. When the husband sold the property back to him on June 1, 2006, he was able to sell only one-half of his interest, leaving the other half to the husband's brother. Therefore, the husband's brother inherited an undivided one-half interest in the property.\n\nFinally, when the husband died, his interest in the property passed to his cousin, who became the sole owner of the property. Since the husband had only one-half interest in the property before his death, his cousin would inherit an undivided one-half interest in the property after his death."
