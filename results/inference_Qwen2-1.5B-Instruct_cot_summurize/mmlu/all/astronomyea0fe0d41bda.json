As the gas expands, it creates a tail made up of ionized gases. This tail is composed mainly of hydrogen atoms, which are electrically neutral and thus do not experience any net force or acceleration.\n\nHowever, the presence of charged particles such as electrons and protons in the tail can create a magnetic field around the tail. This magnetic field opposes the magnetic field of the Sun, causing the charged particles to move away from the Sun along their own paths.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as the \"plasma drag,\" and it causes the plasma tail to point away from the Sun. The strength of this effect depends on various factors, including the composition of the tail, the speed at which the tail is moving relative to the Sun, and the distance between the comet and the Sun.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: the conservation of angular momentum in the tail keeps it always pointing away from the Sun."
