This is because the centripetal acceleration required to maintain circular motion is proportional to the radius of the orbit and inversely proportional to the mass of the object undergoing the motion (i.e., it's independent of the mass of the satellite). Therefore, for a satellite orbiting Earth at a fixed height, the gravitational force acting on it will be constant regardless of how far it is from the center of Earth.\n\nIn contrast, the magnitude of the gravitational force on a satellite in an elliptical orbit around a planet can vary due to changes in the distance between the planet and the satellite as they move along their respective orbits."
