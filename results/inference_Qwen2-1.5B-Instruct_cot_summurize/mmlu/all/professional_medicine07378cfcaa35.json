He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. Arterial blood gas analysis\nB. Examination of sputum for eosinophils\nC. Sweat chloride test\nD. Sputum cytology\n"

Examination of sputum for eosinophils\n\nEosinophilic pleural effusion, which can be caused by eosinophilic pneumonia or eosinophilic pleurisy, is commonly seen in patients with allergic disorders such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this case, the presence of eosinophils in the sputum sample would help confirm the diagnosis of eosinophilic pleurisy.\n\nThe other options listed do not directly relate to the symptoms described:\n\n- A: Arterial blood gas analysis would be useful for diagnosing respiratory acidosis or hypoxia, but it does not specifically address the patient's history of frequent upper respiratory tract infections.\n- C: Sweat chloride test is used to diagnose renal tubular acidosis, which is unrelated to the patient's history of respiratory infections.\n- D: Sputum cytology is a technique used to detect abnormal cells in sputum samples, but it alone cannot confirm the diagnosis without further information about the specific pathologies associated with eosinophilic pleurisy."
