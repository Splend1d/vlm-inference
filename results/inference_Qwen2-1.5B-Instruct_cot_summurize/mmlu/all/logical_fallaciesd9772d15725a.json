A specific type of false cause fallacy that argues that since two events happened at the same time one event must have caused the other.\n\nThe false analogy fallacy, also known as the false analogy fallacy or the false analogy argument, occurs when someone compares two things that are very different and draws conclusions about them based on their similarity. For example, if someone says \"Since I ate pizza last night, I am going to get sick today,\" they are committing this fallacy because they are comparing a general experience with an individual's current state of health, which are not directly comparable."
