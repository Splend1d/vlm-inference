This is because the modification introduces changes to the nucleotide sequences of the RNA strand, which can alter the function and stability of the resulting protein. Without further information about the specific modifications made to the RNA strand, it is difficult to determine exactly what effect they will have on the protein's structure and function. However, based on the general principles of molecular biology, it is reasonable to assume that any significant changes to the RNA sequence would lead to altered protein expression or function."
