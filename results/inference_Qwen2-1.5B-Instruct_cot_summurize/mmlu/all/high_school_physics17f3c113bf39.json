Therefore,\n\n\\[ \u03c9_2 - \u03c9_1 = \u03b1 * \u0394t \\]\n\\[ \u03c9_2 = \u03c9_1 + \u03b1 * \u0394t \\]\n\\[ \u03c9_2 = 2 * 4 = 8 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\]\n\nNow we can use the circumference formula again to find the distance traveled:\n\n\\[ C = 2\\pi r \\]\n\\[ Distance = 2\\pi * 0.1 \\]\n\\[ Distance = 0.2\\pi \\]\n\\[ Distance \u2248 0.628 \\, \\text{meters} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is not listed among the options you provided. The distance traveled by a point on the rim of the rotating disk in 4 seconds is approximately 0.628 meters, which corresponds to option C: 1.2 meters."
