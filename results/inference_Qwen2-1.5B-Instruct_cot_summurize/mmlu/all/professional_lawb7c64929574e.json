Congress has enacted the statute solely for the purpose of enabling members of Congress to travel back and forth to the Capital without being tied up in heavy traffic each day. Before Congress enacted this law, the Washington, D. C. , City Council had previously passed an ordinance designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a two-lane street. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the federal statute designating Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street?\n\nA. It is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.\nB. It is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power.\nC. It is invalid because the Washington, D. C. , City Council has exclusive power over the public thoroughfares within the District of Columbia.\nD. It is invalid because it is a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce.\n"

The federal statute does not discriminate against any particular group or activity, so there is no basis for arguing that it is discriminatory under the Commerce Clause.\n\nAdditionally, the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce does not extend to the District of Columbia, so there is no argument that the federal statute violates that clause either. Therefore, the most accurate statement about the constitutionality of the federal statute designating Pennsylvania Avenue as a one-way street is that it is valid because it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated powers."
