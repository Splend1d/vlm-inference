This process is called phosphocreatine resynthesis and it requires oxygen for its completion. If there is a lack of oxygen during this process, the rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis will be slowed down or even stopped altogether, which can lead to muscle fatigue and weakness. \n\nOn the other hand, if there is an excess of creatine, hyperventilation, or an excess of oxygen, these factors would not affect phosphocreatine resynthesis as much as a lack of oxygen. Therefore, the correct answer is D. a lack of oxygen."
