Children actually have certain cognitive capabilities at particular ages that Piaget did not observe because he designed experiments that were too difficult.\n\nThis criticism of Piaget's theory of cognitive development states that Piaget's experiments were not suitable for observing children's cognitive abilities at specific ages, which means that his observations do not fully reflect what happens during this time period. The other criticisms mentioned are valid points about Piaget's theory, but they do not directly question his ability to observe children's cognitive abilities at different stages."
