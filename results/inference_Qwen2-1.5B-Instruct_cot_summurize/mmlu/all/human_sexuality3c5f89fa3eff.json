                    "text": "The answer is D. None of the above. \n\nGenital herpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), which primarily affects the skin and mucous membranes around the genitals, anus, and mouth. It is spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or through sexual contact with an individual who is actively shedding the virus.\n\nFalling asleep with someone else's semen on your face does not cause genital herpes because it involves oral-genital contact, but does not involve any physical contact between the genital areas themselves. Therefore, it would not transmit the virus to another person.\n\nIf Avalon contracted genital herpes, she cannot be cured with antibiotics as they do not have antiviral properties. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, such as urinary tract infections or respiratory infections, but not viral ones like herpes.\n\nLastly, even though there may be outbreaks of genital herpes, the virus remains latent for most people, so you can't be contagious unless the virus reactivates."
