Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, turning off the music when your neighbors complain is not considered morally wrong because it is a reasonable response to their complaints and helps maintain a peaceful living environment for everyone involved. However, it is still important to be considerate of others' feelings and not cause unnecessary disturbance.\n\nIn scenario 2, having lice in one's hair is a medical condition that requires immediate attention and treatment. It is not right to intentionally spread this condition to someone else by sharing a hairbrush or other personal items. Lice can transmit diseases and cause discomfort and embarrassment to those who come into contact with them. Therefore, lending a hairbrush to someone without checking if they have lice is not morally acceptable."
