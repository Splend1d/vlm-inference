In this analogy, the electric field (E) and magnetic field (H) are analogous to the force acting on a charged particle moving through a region with a varying magnetic field, while the current I is analogous to the flow of charges or the motion of electrons. The relationship between these quantities can be described by Faraday's law of induction, which states that the induced emf (\u03b5) across an inductor (L) is proportional to the rate of change of current (dI/dt), given by \u03b5 = - dW/dt, where W is the work done by the emf to move the charges around the loop. This analogy helps us understand how changes in one quantity (such as current) affect the other (such as magnetic field or displacement)."
