Stimulate production of insulin-like growth hormone\n\nInsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a protein that plays a key role in regulating bone, muscle, and fat tissue development during growth and repair. Increased intake of protein can stimulate the production of IGF-1, which can lead to increased bone density and muscle mass. However, it is important to note that excessive protein intake can also increase the risk of kidney stones and other health problems, so it's important to consume protein in moderation and balance with carbohydrates and healthy fats for optimal health."
