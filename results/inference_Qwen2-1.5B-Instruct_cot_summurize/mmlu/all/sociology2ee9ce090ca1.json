The theory suggests that the content of the media is influenced by market forces and that the media manipulates \"the masses\" as vulnerable, passive consumers. Additionally, the theory posits that the media serves the interests of the ruling class, and that the subordinate classes are often dominated by this ideology. Finally, audiences have the ability to selectively interpret media messages, but the theory argues that this interpretation can be influenced by various factors such as social norms and cultural context."
