The Secretary has the discretion to implement \"deferred action,\" which temporarily postpones the exportation of certain groups of undocumented immigrants. With 11.3 million people now here illegally, the Secretary implemented a program called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The program deferred removal for two years of individuals who came to the United States as children, met certain eligibility criteria, and cleared a background check. A Sheriff in a county near the Mexican border, sued the Secretary, claiming that the policy would increase crime and drain resources in his county. The U.S. District Court dismissed the Sheriff's claim for lack of standing. On appeal, will the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals likely affirm the dismissal?\n\nA. Yes because the Sheriff is stressing a speculative possibility that his office may incur funding shortages and more enforcement problems at some undefined future time.\nB. Yes, because the Sheriff, as a part of the executive branch himself, is not legally qualified to bring a claim against the executive.\nC. No, because anyone has the right to object to the executive branch when it tries to legislate its own opinion into the existing law.\nD. No, because the Sheriff's county is near the border and it will in fact suffer an ingestion of more immigrants from the policy.\n"

No, because the Sheriff's county is near the border and it will in fact suffer an ingestion of more immigrants from the policy.\n\nIn this case, the issue revolves around the Secretary of Homeland Security implementing policies related to immigration, specifically the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The lawsuit was brought by a sheriff who claimed that the implementation of these policies could lead to increased crime and resource strain on his county. This situation presents a hypothetical scenario where the sheriff's county might experience increased immigration due to the policies.\n\nWhile the sheriff does have the right to raise concerns about potential impacts on his jurisdiction, he cannot sue the Secretary of Homeland Security directly. His argument focuses on the potential negative consequences rather than challenging the constitutionality of the policies themselves. Therefore, the court will most likely dismiss his claim for lack of standing, as he lacks legal standing to challenge the policies being implemented by the executive branch.\n\nHowever, the question also raises the concern that such policies could lead to increased crime and drain resources in other jurisdictions, particularly those near the border. While this is a valid point, it is not necessarily relevant to the question of whether the sheriff has standing to sue. The primary focus should be on whether the sheriff can challenge the policies based on the specific impact they may have on his jurisdiction.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sheriff's concern about the potential negative effects on his county is understandable, the primary reason for dismissing his claim for lack of standing is that he does not have legal standing to challenge the policies being implemented by the executive branch."
