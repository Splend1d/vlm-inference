Then, $du = 2xdx$, so our integral becomes:\n$$\\int_{1^2 + 1}^{(1/2)^2 + 1} \\sqrt{\\frac{u}{2}} du$$\n\nSimplify further:\n$$\\int_{1+1}^{1/4+1} \\sqrt{\\frac{u}{2}} du$$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n$$\\int_{2}^{9/4} \\frac{\\sqrt{u}}{2} du$$\n\nThis integral cannot be evaluated analytically in terms of elementary functions (i.e., it does not have an elementary antiderivative). However, we can approximate its value using numerical methods or software like Mathematica or MATLAB. Using these tools, we find that the length of the curve from $x=1$ to $x=1/2$ is approximately $1.177$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1.18."
