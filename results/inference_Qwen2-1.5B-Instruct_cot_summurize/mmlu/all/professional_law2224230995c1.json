A merchant writes buyer offering to sell the widget for $35,000.\n\nThis is because the written offer is considered an offer by consideration, which means it must include something of value (in this case, money) from the offeror to the offeree. In this case, there is no consideration provided as the offer is only an expression of intent without any promise or obligation on the part of the offeror to perform the offer. Therefore, the offer cannot be enforced once the offeror decides to change their mind. \n\nOptions A, C, and D all have consideration and therefore can be enforced under the law."
