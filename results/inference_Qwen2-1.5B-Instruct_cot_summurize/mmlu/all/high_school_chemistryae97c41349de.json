The pKa values for each of the given oxoacids can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For HBrO:\n  - pKb = 14 - log(0.26) = 13.75.\n  - Therefore, the pKa of HBrO is approximately 13.75.\n\n- For HClO:\n  - pKb = 14 - log(0.19) = 13.87.\n  - Therefore, the pKa of HClO is approximately 13.87.\n\n- For HIO:\n  - pKb = 14 - log(0.13) = 13.93.\n  - Therefore, the pKa of HIO is approximately 13.93.\n\n- For HClO3:\n  - pKb = 14 - log(0.003) = 13.967.\n  - Therefore, the pKa of HClO3 is approximately 13.967.\n\nComparing these values, we see that HClO has the highest pKa value, indicating it is the strongest acid among the options provided. Therefore, the answer is **B. HClO**."
