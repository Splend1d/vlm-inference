Family therapy may not be appropriate for families with members who have eating disorders, as these issues can be complex and require specialized treatment. In some cases, it may be necessary to refer the family to a mental health professional who specializes in treating eating disorders. However, it is important to note that family therapy can still be beneficial in many other situations, such as when dealing with long-term marital conflict or when one of the family members has severe depression."
