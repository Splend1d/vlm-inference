War on Terror: The Bush administration launched the \"War on Terror\" following the September 111 attacks on the United States, which was aimed at dismantling al-Qaeda and its affiliates around the world. This led to significant military interventions in countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n2. Neoconservative ideology: The administration embraced a neoconservative approach to foreign policy, which emphasized the use of military force to promote democracy and human rights worldwide.\n\n3. Expansion of alliances: The administration expanded NATO to include former Soviet states, particularly Russia, and also established partnerships with countries such as Japan and South Korea.\n\n4. Increased international support: The Bush administration received strong backing from other nations, including the UK, France, and Canada, who were committed to supporting the administration's policies.\n\n5. Focus on homeland security: The administration placed a high priority on domestic issues, including terrorism prevention and counterterrorism efforts, which were not always aligned with broader international interests.\n\nTherefore, option D (increased international support for the United States) is correct."
