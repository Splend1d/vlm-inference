When an individual is conditioned to associate a specific stimulus with a specific response, they will respond to that stimulus even without being explicitly instructed to do so. In this case, your cousin's immediate reaction to using the keyboard after you leave the computer suggests that he has been conditioned to associate the act of using the keyboard with your presence or absence from the area. This type of conditioning is called classical conditioning."
