It can be dangerous if the child falls or gets hurt while playing on the playground.\n\nScenario 2 is not considered morally wrong because using a plunger to unclog a toilet is generally acceptable behavior. However, it is important to ensure that the toilet is clean before attempting to use a plunger, as it could spread germs."
