One person's use of the public good does not reduce the amount available to others. \n\nA public good is a resource or service that benefits all individuals in society and cannot be used by anyone except for their own benefit. In other words, it can't be hoarded or used by only a few people. This is why non-rivalrous access is important for public goods like roads, parks, and libraries.\n\nThe other options don't fit the description of a public good:\n\n- B. The public good is produced by the government without any competition: While governments may play a role in providing some public goods, this isn't necessarily true for all public goods. Some public goods are provided through voluntary agreements between private entities.\n- C. The public good is produced at zero marginal cost: This is a common misconception about public goods. Public goods typically have negative externalities (e.g., pollution) which require collective action to address, so they aren't produced at zero marginal cost.\n- D. The public good is mostly consumed by free riders: Free riders are people who take advantage of someone else's contributions without contributing anything themselves. This doesn't describe the nature of public goods. Public goods are resources that everyone benefits from, regardless of whether they contribute to their production or consumption."
