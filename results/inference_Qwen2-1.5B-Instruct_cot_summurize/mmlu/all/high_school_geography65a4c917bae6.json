A model showing the decrease in population growth for several countries after they industrialize\n\nThis curve shows the relationship between population size and economic development, where higher levels of economic development lead to lower birth rates and higher death rates, resulting in a decline in population growth over time. This concept is particularly relevant in developing countries as they transition from traditional agricultural economies towards more modern industrialized ones."
