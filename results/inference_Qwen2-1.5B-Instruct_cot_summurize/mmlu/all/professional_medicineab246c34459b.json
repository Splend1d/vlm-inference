She says, \"I haven't slept in 3 days and I am having trouble focusing at work.\" There is no history of trauma and she takes no medications. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 14 years but does not drink alcoholic beverages. Vital signs are temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 86/min, respirations 19/min, and blood pressure 182/100 mm Hg. Examination of the head shows no abnormalities. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light; there is mild photophobia. Funduscopic examination is normal. A serous effusion is noted on examination of the left tympanic membrane. Neck is stiff with painful flexion; when the patient's neck is flexed forward, she reports and electric shock sensation. Mild expiratory wheezes are heard on auscultation of the chest. A midsystolic click is heard best at the left sternal border; there are no murmurs or gallops. Abdominal examination shows striae, but is otherwise noncontributory. Examination of the lower extremities shows varicosities bilaterally and 1+ edema; muscle strength is 4/5. Neurologic examination shows no other abnormalities. Which of the following physical findings is most indicative of the need for immediate further evaluation?\n\nA. Abdominal striae\nB. Expiratory wheezes\nC. Midsystolic click\nD. Neck stiffness\n"

Neck stiffness\n\nThe patient's neck stiffness, along with her symptoms of persistent headache, difficulty concentrating, and photophobia, suggest that she may have an underlying neurological condition such as meningitis or a stroke. The presence of a midsystolic click and abdominal striae also support this diagnosis. The expiratory wheezes and muscle weakness do not necessarily indicate a neurological problem, but they could be related to the headache and difficulty concentrating. However, the neck stiffness is the most specific finding that suggests the need for immediate further evaluation."
