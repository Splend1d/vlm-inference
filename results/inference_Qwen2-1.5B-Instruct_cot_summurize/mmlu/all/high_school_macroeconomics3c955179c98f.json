The equilibrium price will fall and the equilibrium quantity will rise.\n\nWhen the price of good X rises, consumers will be willing to buy more of good Z because it becomes cheaper for them to purchase. As a result, the demand for good Z will increase, leading to an upward shift in the demand curve for good Z. This will cause the equilibrium price of good Z to fall as the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at that price level.\n\nAt the new equilibrium, the supply of good Z will remain constant since the price has fallen, but the quantity demanded has increased due to the higher price. Therefore, the equilibrium quantity of good Z will rise."
