Given that the payback period is 5.2 years, the total revenue is also equal to the sum of the first 5.2 terms of an arithmetic series with the first term \\( R_1 = 28,000 \\), common difference \\( d = 28,000 \\), and number of terms \\( n = 5.2 \\). Thus,\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = \\frac{5.2}{2}(28,000 + 28,000 \\times 5.2) = 28,000 \\times 5.2 = 145,600 \\]\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation for \\( C \\):\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{145,600}{P} + D \\]\n\nWe know that \\( D = 4,000 \\), so substituting this into the equation gives us:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{145,600}{P} + 4,000 \\]\n\nGiven that the expected payback period is 5.2 years, the total revenue (\\( R \\)) would be the same as the total operating costs (\\( O \\)), which includes both the revenue from the machine and the depreciation expense. Therefore,\n\n\\[ C = O \\]\n\\[ \\frac{145,600}{P} + 4,000 = 145,600 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{145,600}{P} = 145,600 - 4,000 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{145,600}{P} = 141,600 \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{145,600}{141,600} \\]\n\\[ P = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the company paid $1 for the new machine. \n\nThe correct answer is A. $145,600."
