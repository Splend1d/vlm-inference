                    "text": "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum cannot be less than Planck's constant divided by 4\u03c0 squared (\u2248 1.054 x 10^-34 J*s). \n\nGiven a quantum mechanical particle in the lowest energy level of a one-dimensional box, it means that the particle has zero energy and therefore its wave function is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian operator with eigenvalue E = 0.\n\nAccording to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation:\n\u0394x \u0394p \u2265 h/2\u03c0\n\nFor a single particle in a one-dimensional box, the wave function is given by:\n\u03c8(x) = A sin(kx)\n\nwhere k = sqrt(2mE)/hbar is the wavenumber. The wave function is normalized such that:\n\u222b |\u03c8|^2 dx = 1\n\nSo we have:\n\n\u0394x \u0394p \u2265 h/2\u03c0\n\nThis means that the minimum uncertainty in position (\u0394x) times the maximum uncertainty in momentum (\u0394p) must be at least equal to h/2\u03c0, which is approximately 6.635 x 10^-34 J*s. This implies that both position and momentum are uncertain to within this order of magnitude.\n\nTherefore, option D) \"Neither position nor momentum can be known exactly\" is correct."
