In such situations, it may not always be possible or desirable for high-level officials to make decisions in real-time. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nOption B also applies in this scenario because the decision-making process needs to be transparent and accountable to ensure that the actions taken are fair and just. High-level officials who make decisions in real-time may not have the opportunity to consult with others or gather information before making their decisions, which could lead to biased or inaccurate outcomes. Therefore, option B is also correct.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that there are many other factors that can influence the decision-making process in such situations, including the availability of resources, the state of emergency, and the potential consequences of any action taken. Therefore, options C and D do not apply in this specific context."
