Security is best defined using the traditional paradigm, with the state as the referent object to be secured using extraordinary measures where possible.\nC. To best understand security one must adopt a constructivist approach, threats exist only when articulated by a wider audience and may warrant the implementation of emergency measures.\nD. Security exists as an empirically verifiable and independent condition that changes only slightly, if at all, with regards to the social context in which it is applied.\n"
