H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p \u2260 0.60.\n\nThis is because the department store claims that over 60% of the mall's visitors shop at their store, which means that the proportion of shoppers (p) is greater than 0.60 but less than or equal to 1 (i.e., between 0.60 and 1). Therefore, the null hypothesis states that p equals 0.60, while the alternative hypothesis states that p is not equal to 0.60.\n\nOption A does not fit because it assumes that p is strictly greater than 0.60, which contradicts the given claim.\nOption C also does not fit because it assumes that p is strictly less than 0.60, which again contradicts the given claim.\nOption D does not fit because it assumes that p is strictly greater than 0.60, which contradicts the given claim."
