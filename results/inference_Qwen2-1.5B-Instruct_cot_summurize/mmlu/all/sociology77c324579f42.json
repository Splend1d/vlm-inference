The Macpherson Report, established to investigate the Stephen Lawrence case, found evidence of institutional racism in the British justice system, which has been ongoing for many years. This report highlights how certain groups within society are systematically disadvantaged due to structural inequalities, such as racial discrimination, bias, and lack of resources. It also suggests that these problems can be addressed through institutional reforms aimed at changing the way social institutions operate."
