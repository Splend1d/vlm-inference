Savigny\n\nSavigny famously stated: \"Jurisprudence is the eye of the law.\" This phrase highlights the importance of understanding and interpreting laws through legal reasoning, which can be thought of as the \"eye\" or lens through which the law is viewed. Savigny was a French jurist who played a significant role in developing the theory of legal positivism."
