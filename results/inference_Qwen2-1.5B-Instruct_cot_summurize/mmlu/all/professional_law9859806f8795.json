After telling his employer by phone that he was going for lunch and getting approval, he pulled into the entrance of a restaurant where he intended to have his usual 30- minute lunch break. While entering the parking lot, the driver carelessly ran over and seriously injured a pedestrian. The injured person sued the driver and the driver's employer for negligence in causing her injuries. Is the employer liable?\n\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\nB. Yes, because the employer owned the truck.\nC. No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\nD. No, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another.\n"

No, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another.\n\nUnder common law principles, an employer is only liable for the actions of their employees if those actions were committed within the scope of employment. In this case, the truck driver was acting outside the scope of his employment when he negligently caused the accident with the pedestrian. Therefore, the employer would not be held responsible for the driver's actions.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the specific facts of this case may vary depending on the laws and regulations in place in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred. It is always best to consult with legal experts or local authorities for accurate guidance."
