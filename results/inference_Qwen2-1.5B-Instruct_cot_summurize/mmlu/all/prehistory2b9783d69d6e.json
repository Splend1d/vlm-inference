The correct answer is option A.\n\nOption B is true: The walls of the Central Complex of Great Zimbabwe exhibit sophisticated masonry. They were built using traditional African techniques and materials such as mud, grass, and stones, which required skilled labor to construct.\n\nOption C is also true: The walls of the Central Complex of Great Zimbabwe stood 40 feet tall in places. This can be inferred from historical records and archaeological evidence.\n\nOption D is partially true: The mortar that holds the walls together was made from ground up ocean shells. While this is historically accurate, it should be noted that the exact source of the shell mortar is still a matter of debate among archaeologists. Some argue that it was sourced locally, while others believe it may have come from farther away."
