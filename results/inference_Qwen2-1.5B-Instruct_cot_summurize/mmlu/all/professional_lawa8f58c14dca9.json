As an accomplice, a person is guilty of the same offense as the principal offender, but only if they aid, abet, counsel, command, induce, or procure the commission of the crime. If the girl did not participate in the act of smoking marijuana, she would not be considered an accomplice to the crime.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
