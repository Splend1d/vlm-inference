The standard deviation is also given as 5 ohms.\n\nTo find the area under this normal distribution curve between 188 and 200 ohms (the range in which the resistor must fall), we can use the z-score formula:\n\n\\[z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\n\nwhere \\(x\\) is the value of interest (188 ohms in this case), \\(\\mu\\) is the population mean (200 ohms), and \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation (5 ohms).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the z-scores for both endpoints:\n\n- For 188 ohms:\n\\[z_1 = \\frac{188 - 200}{5} = -2\\]\n- For 200 ohms:\n\\[z_2 = \\frac{200 - 200}{5} = 0\\]\n\nNow, we'll look up these values on a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator to find the probabilities corresponding to each z-score:\n\n- P(Z < -2) \u2248 0.07\n- P(-2 < Z < 0) \u2248 0.12\n\nSo, the total probability that the resistance falls between 188 and 200 ohms (inclusive) is the sum of these two areas:\n\n\\[P(188 < X < 200) = P(-2 < Z < 0) + P(188 < X < 200)\\]\n\n\\[= 0.12 + 0.07\\]\n\n\\[= 0.19\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 0.93**."
