It would continue rotating on its axis, and it would revolve around the Earth as usual.\n\nIf the force of gravity between the Moon and the Earth were to stop, the Moon's orbit around the Earth would still be determined by the gravitational pull of both celestial bodies. However, without the force of gravity holding the Moon in place, it would no longer experience centripetal acceleration towards the Earth, causing it to lose speed and eventually slow down or even stop its rotation entirely. This is because rotational velocity depends directly on angular momentum, which is proportional to mass and inertia (the resistance to change). If there was no net force acting on the Moon, it would eventually come to a halt due to its own internal forces, such as friction and heat generated from its surface."
