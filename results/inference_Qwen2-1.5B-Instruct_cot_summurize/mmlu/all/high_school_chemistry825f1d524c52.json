These forces hold the atoms together, making SiC very hard and brittle. In contrast, diamonds are an example of an ionic crystal, where the ions themselves are held together by electrostatic attractions rather than covalent bonds. Molecular crystals typically have weaker intermolecular forces and can be more flexible and ductile. Metals are generally considered to be metallic crystals because they have free-moving electrons that allow them to conduct electricity."
