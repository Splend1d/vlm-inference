As these organisms converted inorganic compounds into organic molecules, they released oxygen into the atmosphere as a byproduct of photosynthesis or chemosynthesis.\n\nIt was not until later that heterotrophs, such as plants and animals, evolved the ability to obtain energy from other sources, such as eating other living organisms. This process allowed for an increase in biodiversity and the evolution of more complex life forms."
