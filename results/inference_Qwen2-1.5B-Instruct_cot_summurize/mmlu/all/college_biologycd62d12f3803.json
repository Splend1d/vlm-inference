They are eukaryotic: While some protists may have a nucleus and organelles like chloroplasts, not all do, making this option incorrect.\n- D. They possess cell walls composed of peptidoglycan: This is characteristic of fungi, not protists. Fungi belong to the kingdom Fungi, while protists belong to the kingdom Protista."
