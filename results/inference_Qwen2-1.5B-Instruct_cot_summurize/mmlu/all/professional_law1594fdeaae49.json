Immediately after the accident, the man ran over to the woman and said, \"I know I was driving fast, but you weren't paying attention where you were walking. Anyhow, I'm willing to pay all your medical expenses. \"At trial, the woman calls an eyewitness to the accident. The eyewitness proposes to testify that he heard the man tell the woman, \"I know I was driving fast. \" The man's attorney objects. If the eyewitness's testimony is admitted, it will most likely be because the proffered evidence is\n\nA. admissible as an opinion.\nB. admissible as an admission.\nC. admissible as a present sense impression.\nD. admissible as a declaration against interest.\n"

In this case, the man's statement that he knew he was driving fast is an admission of fact that could be used to establish his liability in the lawsuit.\n\nAdmissions are generally not admissible as evidence unless they are made under oath during a court proceeding. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, admissions made outside of court may still be admissible if they are relevant to the issue at hand and are made under circumstances that demonstrate the truthfulness of the statement.\n\nIn this case, the witness' testimony that the man told the woman he knew he was driving fast is relevant to whether the man was negligent in causing the accident and is made under circumstances that demonstrate the truthfulness of the statement. Therefore, it would be admissible as an admission."
