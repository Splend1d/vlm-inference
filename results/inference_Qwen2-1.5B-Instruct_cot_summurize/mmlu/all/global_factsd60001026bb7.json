It's recommended that you refer to reputable sources such as news outlets, polling organizations, and governmental bodies for the most accurate information on this topic.\n\nHowever, according to various surveys conducted by the Italian National Institute for Statistics (ISTAT), there has been a decline in public trust towards traditional media in recent years due to perceived bias and sensationalism. Some studies suggest that only around 30% of Italians trust the media, while others put the figure at closer to 50%.\n\nIt's worth noting that freedom of speech and press are fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 11 of the Italian Constitution, which states that \"the people shall be entitled to freely express their opinions and communicate with one another.\"\n\nIn summary, while there may not be a specific percentage mentioned in your question, it seems that the perception of free media in Italy has declined over time, leading to concerns regarding the balance between government censorship and the right to free expression."
