This is because the margin of error (which determines the size of the interval) increases proportionally with the level of confidence. Therefore, if we go from a 90% confidence interval to a 99% confidence interval, the width of the interval will be larger.\n\nTo calculate this exact change, we need to know the formula for calculating the width of a confidence interval given the sample proportion and the desired level of confidence. However, without knowing these details, it's not possible to accurately determine the percentage change in the interval size between the two levels of confidence."
