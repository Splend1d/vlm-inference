The most liquid measure of money is M1. \n\nM1 refers to the portion of the money supply that can be easily converted into cash without significant loss of value or liquidity. It includes bank deposits, traveler's checks, and merchant drafts.\n\nM2, on the other hand, is a broader measure of the money supply that includes M1 as well as savings accounts at credit unions and banks, certain time deposits, and certificates of deposit (CDs) held by individuals.\n\nM3, which is even further broadened, includes M2 plus all demand liabilities such as federal funds purchased by banks, repurchase agreements with commercial banks, and short-term, interest-bearing bills issued by corporations.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, the most liquid measure of money is indeed M1."
