The elderly\n\nMedicaid, which stands for Medical Assistance Programs, is a joint federal-state program that provides health insurance coverage to low-income individuals and families who meet certain eligibility requirements. It is one of the largest programs in the United States, providing benefits such as medical care, mental health services, and long-term care.\n\nIn terms of beneficiaries, Medicaid primarily serves the elderly population, as it is designed to help those over the age of 65 who may not be able to afford private health insurance or have limited income. Medicaid can also provide coverage for some younger individuals with disabilities or chronic conditions, but these individuals typically qualify based on their specific needs rather than age alone.\n\nIt's important to note that while Medicaid does benefit many different groups, including single men, women, and children, the primary focus of the program is to assist those who are most vulnerable and at risk of falling into poverty due to healthcare costs."
