The IRR takes into account both the time value of money and the risk associated with the investment, while NPV only considers the present value of future cash flows.\n\nIn general, when making investment decisions, it's important to consider both the IRR and NPV metrics to get a more comprehensive view of the potential return on investment. However, it's not necessary to choose one over the other as they can be used together to make a decision. For example, if you're evaluating several projects and want to prioritize them based on their potential returns, you might rank them using the IRR and then adjust your ranking based on your tolerance for risk and other factors."
