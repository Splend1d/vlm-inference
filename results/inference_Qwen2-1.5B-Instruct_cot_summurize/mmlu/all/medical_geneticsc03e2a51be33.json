It is more common in girls than in boys.\n\nHirschsprung disease is more common in both males and females, but it tends to be more severe in those who have long segments of the colon. The risk of recurrence is also higher for those who had long segments when they were treated, rather than shorter segments. However, there is no clear evidence that gender plays a role in the prevalence or severity of Hirschsprung disease."
