The glossopharyngeal nerve, which supplies taste sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and somatosensory (somaesthetic) sensation to the posterior one-third, is damaged by a malignant tumour. This can lead to loss of taste in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and loss of somatosensory sensation in the posterior third of the tongue."
