Within the liver peroxisomes serve to oxidise very long chain fatty acids to medium chain products.\n\nThis statement is not correct because the process of \u03b2-oxidation in the liver does not involve conversion of very long-chain fatty acids into medium-chain products. Instead, it involves the breakdown of longer chains of fatty acids (e.g., 12 or 14 carbons) into shorter ones (e.g., 6 or 8 carbons), which can then be used as energy sources or stored as fat molecules. This process occurs primarily in the mitochondria, but some intermediates can also be synthesized within the peroxisomes, as described in option A. However, the overall pathway is more complex than simply converting very long-chain fatty acids into short-chain products, as it also includes other steps such as acylation and deacetylation."
