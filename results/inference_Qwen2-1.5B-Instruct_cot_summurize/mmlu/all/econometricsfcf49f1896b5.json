(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nThe ARCH(q) model is less likely to be the more parsimonious than the GARCH(1,1) model because it assumes that the variance process is not stationary and therefore requires additional parameters to describe the long-term behavior of the variance process.\n\nThe ARCH(q) model allows for an infinite number of previous lags of squared returns to affect the current conditional variance, which may lead to overfitting and poor predictive performance.\n\nThe GARCH(1,1) model is usually sufficient to capture all of the dependence in the conditional variance if there is no autocorrelation among past returns. However, if there is significant autocorrelation, then the GARCH(1,1) model may not be able to accurately estimate the volatility dynamics and may need to include additional lags or other types of innovations processes to improve the fit.\n\nTherefore, the true statements are:\n\n(i) The ARCH(q) model is likely to be the more parsimonious\n(ii) The ARCH(q) model is the more likely to violate non-negativity constraints\n(iii) The ARCH(q) model can allow for an infinite number of previous lags of squared returns to affect the current conditional variance\n(iv) The GARCH(1,1) model will usually be sufficient to capture all of the dependence in the conditional variance if there is no autocorrelation among past returns, but may need to be extended if there is significant autocorrelation."
