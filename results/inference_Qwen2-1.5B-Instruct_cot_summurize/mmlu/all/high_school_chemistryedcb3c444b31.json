Correct for the vapor pressure of water\n\nWhen collecting a gas over water, it is important to correct for the vapor pressure of water because if you do not take this into account, the collected gas will contain dissolved water molecules, which can affect its properties and behavior. To correct for the vapor pressure of water, you need to know the specific temperature and pressure conditions under which the gas was collected. This information can usually be found in the gas chromatography column's manufacturer's data sheet or by consulting with an expert in the field."
