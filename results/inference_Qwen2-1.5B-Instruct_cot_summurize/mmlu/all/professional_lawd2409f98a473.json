Maybe she'll go home where she belongs.\" Is the plaintiff's proposed testimony admissible?\n\nA. No, because the janitor's statement is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, because the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, and the supervisor's statement is a statement of his then-existing state of mind.\nD. Yes, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are statements janitor and the supervisor are statements concerning a matter within the scope of their employment.\n"

Hearsay is a type of evidence that must be authenticated or corroborated in order to be admitted into court. In this case, the janitor's statement that he overheard the supervisor make a derogatory comment about the plaintiff is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement that is not directly related to the subject matter of the lawsuit. Similarly, the supervisor's statement that he would like the plaintiff to leave the workplace is also hearsay because it is not based on direct observation or proof. Therefore, neither statement can be used as evidence in the plaintiff's lawsuit."
