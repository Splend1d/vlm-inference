Reliable dose-response data are difficult to acquire and often unavailable.\n\nObservational epidemiological studies can be used to identify associations between certain foods or food components and various health outcomes. However, they cannot directly assess the causal relationship between these exposures and diseases. This is because it is challenging to determine if an observed association is due to the presence of a specific contaminant or some other factor. \n\nIn addition, human exposure through food may be lower than what has been studied in controlled animal experiments, which can lead to underestimation of risks. However, this does not necessarily mean that the results from observational studies should be disregarded; rather, researchers must carefully consider the limitations of their study design and interpret their findings accordingly."
