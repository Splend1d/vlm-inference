In this case, since the sum of two square roots is not necessarily another root of unity (i.e., it doesn't satisfy $1 = e^{2\\pi i/k}$ for some integer $k$), we don't have an exact formula like we would with fields like $\\mathbb{Q}(e^{2\\pi i/3})$, but we can still reason about its degree.\n\nThe sum of the square roots $\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3}$ does indeed satisfy $1 = e^{2\\pi i/3}$. However, it also satisfies $1 = e^{-2\\pi i/3}$. This means there are exactly two distinct cube roots of unity in the field generated by these square roots, which is enough to ensure that the degree of the field extension is at most 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 2."
