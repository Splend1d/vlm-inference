It might be a mistake in the question or provided answer choices. Let's check if there was a misunderstanding with how angles are measured in degrees: \n\nA full circle measures \\(360\\) degrees, and each quarter-circle (which is \\(180\\) degrees) would be \\(1/4\\)th of the total. So, a quarter-circle would indeed measure \\(90\\) degrees, not \\(67.5\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 90\u00b0, which corresponds to option A. The question seems to have been misinterpreted or misunderstood regarding the scale of the problem."
