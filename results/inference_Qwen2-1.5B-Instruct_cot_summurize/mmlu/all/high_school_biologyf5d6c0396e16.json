This can lead to changes in gene expression and eventually the development of cancerous cells if the integration site is located on genes that are involved in cellular processes critical for growth and survival.\n\nThe other options listed do not accurately describe the process of viral transformation leading to cancer:\n\n- A. Formation of a pilus does not occur during viral transformation.\n- C. Conversion of the host's genome into the viral DNA would result in the death of the host cell due to lack of essential components needed for life.\n- D. Release of spores into the mammalian cell is an example of virulence rather than transformation, as it involves the spread of the virus outside the host cell.\n  \nTherefore, the correct answer is B. incorporation of the viral genome into the mammalian cell's nuclear DNA."
