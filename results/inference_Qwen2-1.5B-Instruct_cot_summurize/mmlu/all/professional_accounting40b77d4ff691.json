The auditor should design tests of details to ensure that sufficient audit evidence supports the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.\n\nWhen designing tests of details, the auditor aims to obtain sufficient evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. This level of assurance depends on the specific requirements of the engagement and the nature of the financial statements being audited.\n\nIn general, the higher the level of assurance required by management or the entity's board of directors (e.g., high-level assurance), the more detailed and extensive the testing of details will be required. Conversely, lower levels of assurance may result in less comprehensive testing.\n\nTherefore, when assessing whether an auditor has designed tests of details effectively, they would evaluate how much detail was obtained regarding each significant accounting estimate, transaction, or event, as well as any other critical areas where materiality is likely to occur. If this detail is adequate to support the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level, then the tests of details have been designed effectively."
