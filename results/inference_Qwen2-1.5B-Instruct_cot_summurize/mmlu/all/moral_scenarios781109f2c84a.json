Telling a child that they cannot have candy until after dinner violates their basic right to access food and potentially leads to harm or discomfort for the child if they are denied the candy before they get hungry. This action goes against common ethical principles regarding respect for autonomy and the importance of providing children with adequate nutrition. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
