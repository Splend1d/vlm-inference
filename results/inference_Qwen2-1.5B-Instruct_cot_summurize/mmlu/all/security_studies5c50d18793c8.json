This approach emphasizes the importance of individual freedom, equality before the law, and the respect for human dignity.\n\nOption A (Modern human rights-oriented liberalism is concerned with self-determination) aligns well with this perspective as modern human rights movements often focus on promoting self-determination and equal representation for marginalized groups.\n\nOption B (Human rights-oriented liberalism will advocate separatism where conflict and bloodshed seem inevitable without it) goes against the core principles of human rights-oriented liberalism by suggesting that conflicts between nations could be resolved through the application of human rights rather than through violent means.\n\nOption C (Human rights-oriented liberalism is particularly focused on persons subject to economic, sexual, gender, religious, and political persecution, discrimination, or deprivation) directly addresses the concerns raised in the question about the extent of human rights violations and the need for protection against them.\n\nTherefore, all of these options are consistent with the human rights-oriented school of liberalism's stance on the importance of protecting and promoting human rights globally."
