After losing a large amount of money, the defendants accused the victim of cheating. When the victim tried to leave, the defendants beat him with their fists and, as the victim fell to the ground, they continued by kicking him in the head. The victim suffered a fractured skull in the beating and died as a result of severe head trauma. Thereafter, the defendants reached into the victim's pocket and stole his wallet. The defendants were arrested and charged with the murder of the victim. Prior to trial, the prosecutor admitted that it was impossible to determine which defendant was responsible for actually fracturing the victim's skull. If the defendants are prosecuted for felony murder, which of the following would provide their best defense?\n\nA. The jurisdiction adheres to the inherently dangerous felony requirement.\nB. The jurisdiction follows the independent felony murder rule.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the proximate cause theory.\nD. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory.\n\nUnder the agency theory, if an individual commits an act that causes harm or death, even though another person is the actual perpetrator, the individual who committed the act may be held criminally liable for the death. In this case, the defendants are alleged to have been acting as agents of each other when they beat and kicked the victim, so they could potentially be held criminally liable under the agency theory. However, it is important to note that the agency theory is not always applied in jurisdictions where felony murder applies, and whether it would apply depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the case."
