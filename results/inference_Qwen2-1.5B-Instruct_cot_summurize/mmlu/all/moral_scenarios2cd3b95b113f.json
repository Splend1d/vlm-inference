According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, breaking furniture for relaxation would be considered morally wrong because it goes against the principle of respect for property and harm to others. On the other hand, putting the parts of chicken into a vat of hot oil is not inherently wrong, but it may be considered harmful if the chicken is cooked or eaten by someone else who might be allergic or sensitive to certain types of meat."
