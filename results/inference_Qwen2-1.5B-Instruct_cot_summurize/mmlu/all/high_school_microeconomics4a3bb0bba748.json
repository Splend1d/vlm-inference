In this case, if the price of aluminum falls, manufacturers may increase their production of bicycles in order to take advantage of the lower cost. As a result, there will be less supply of bicycles available on the market, leading to a decrease in the overall supply of bicycles. This will also lead to an increase in the prices of bicycles, as the higher demand for them will offset the lower supply. Therefore, option C is the correct answer."
