The company was unable to keep up with the mill's needs, and its log deliveries fell short by 10% to 15% in each of the four quarters of the year. The mill paid the company on time for all delivered logs. The mill paid an attorney $2,000 for advice concerning its options in enforcing the contract. It paid a broker a reasonable fee of $5,000 to find additional logs to make up for the company's shortfall. The mill also incurred reasonable costs of $25,000 to transport the additional logs to its facility. Despite the mill's efforts to mitigate damages, it sustained $200,000 in losses because of the company's failure to timely deliver enough logs. The mill has sued the company for breach of contract. If the court finds for the mill, how much should it award in damages?\n\nA. $205,000.00\nB. $225,000.00\nC. $230,000.00\nD. $232,000.00\n"

                    "text": "To calculate the amount of damages that the mill should be awarded, we first need to determine the total number of logs the company was supposed to deliver to the mill over the course of the year. \n\nThe company failed to meet its delivery obligations by 10-15% in each quarter, meaning they were delivering 85-95% of what the mill needed. Let's assume the mill ordered 1000 logs per quarter (a conservative estimate), so the company was supposed to deliver:\n\n- Quarter 1: 1000 * 85% = 850 logs\n- Quarter 2: 1000 * 85% = 850 logs\n- Quarter 3: 1000 * 85% = 850 logs\n- Quarter 4: 1000 * 85% = 850 logs\n\nTotal logs due = 850 + 850 + 850 + 850 = 3250 logs\n\nNow, let's calculate the actual number of logs delivered:\n- Quarter 1: 1000 - 850 = 150 logs\n- Quarter 2: 1000 - 850 = 150 logs\n- Quarter 3: 1000 - 850 = 150 logs\n- Quarter 4: 1000 - 850 = 150 logs\n\nTotal actual logs delivered = 150 + 150 + 150 + 150 = 600 logs\n\nTherefore, the company delivered 600 logs out of the 3250 required, resulting in a shortfall of:\n\n- 3250 - 600 = 2650 logs\n\nThe mill paid $2,000 for legal advice and $5,000 for a broker's fee, totaling $7,000. Additionally, the mill incurred $25,000 in transportation costs.\n\nThe total damages suffered by the mill is therefore:\n\n$200,000 (losses) + $7,000 (legal fees) + $25,000 (transportation costs) = $227,000\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. $225,000.00."
