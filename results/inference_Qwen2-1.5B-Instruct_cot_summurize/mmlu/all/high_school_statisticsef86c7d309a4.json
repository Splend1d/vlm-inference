Dialysis center: Type I error, towel manufacturer: Type II error.\n\nIn the dialysis center example, if the equipment is not functioning properly but it is still considered \"satisfactory\" by the null hypothesis (that it is performing satisfactorily), then there will be a Type I error where the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected.\n\nIn the fabric factory example, if the sizes of towels are not meeting the specifications but they are still considered to be \"within acceptable limits,\" based on the null hypothesis, then there will also be a Type I error where the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected.\n\nTherefore, in both cases, the more serious concern would be a Type I error, as these errors lead to incorrect conclusions about whether the equipment or products are performing satisfactorily when they may actually need maintenance or replacement."
