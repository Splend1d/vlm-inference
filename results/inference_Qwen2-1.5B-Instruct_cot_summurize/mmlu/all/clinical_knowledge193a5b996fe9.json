Carbohydrates are essential for providing energy to muscles during exercise and help prevent fatigue. When there is a lack of sufficient carbohydrates in the body, muscles may rely more heavily on fat as an energy source, which can lead to reduced performance and increased risk of injury. Therefore, it's important to maintain adequate carbohydrate intake during exercise to support optimal performance."
