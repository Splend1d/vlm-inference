This means that powers not explicitly given to the federal government in the Constitution are reserved for the individual states or the people as a whole.\n\nIn contrast, American federalism is often characterized by the distribution of power between the national government and the states. For example, the national government has some powers over issues such as foreign affairs, defense, and taxation, while the states have more autonomy on issues such as education, healthcare, and property rights. This distribution of power reflects the idea that the federal government should be limited in its ability to interfere with the operations of the states, and that each state has the right to govern itself according to its own laws and traditions.\n\nTherefore, the Tenth Amendment is most clearly exemplified by American federalism."
