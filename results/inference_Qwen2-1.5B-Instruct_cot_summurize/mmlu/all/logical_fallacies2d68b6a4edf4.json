Fallacy of Division. \n\nThe Dean's statement implies that there is only one student for every hundred people on campus, which suggests that there are 100 students and 99 non-students. However, this conclusion contradicts the original question, which asks about the number of students on campus. Therefore, it is an example of fallacious reasoning known as division by zero or division by infinity."
