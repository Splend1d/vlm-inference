High levels of self-care behaviors have also been associated with higher levels of secondary control, which refers to the ability to maintain control over one's own life and circumstances despite external pressures or challenges. Self-care behaviors such as exercise, healthy eating habits, and adequate sleep can help individuals develop greater resilience and cope with stress more effectively. This can lead to improved mental health outcomes and overall well-being."
