This results in the production of haploid gametes with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. In contrast, during mitosis, which is a type of cell division that produces diploid daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell, sister chromatids do not separate until after the second division, resulting in the production of diploid daughter cells.\n\nTherefore, the key difference between meiosis and mitosis is the timing of sister chromatid separation."
