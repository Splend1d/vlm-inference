In accordance with the statute, the President was authorized to appoint a majority of six members to the agency, and the other three positions were to be filled by the Senate. The nine members were duly appointed to the agency, and all appointees were subsequently approved in confirmation hearings. Thereafter, the agency issued the following regulations:(a) Requiring each motor vehicle operating in the United States to be equipped with a specified air/fuel control device;(b) Requiring each gas or oil furnace located in the United States to be fitted with a specified device to reduce emissions;(c) Requiring each State to establish and maintain a program under which each vehicle and each furnace shall be tested annually for compliance with federal emissions standards. Which of the following arguments would provide the strongest constitutional grounds against the authority of the statute?\n\nA. The President does not have the constitutional power to appoint a majority of members to an administrative agency.\nB. Congress does not have the executive authority to appoint members to an administrative agency.\nC. An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to promulgate regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce.\nD. An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to require states to supervise federal regulatory guidelines such as those enumerated in Subsection (c).\n"

An administrative agency does not have the constitutional authority to require states to supervise federal regulatory guidelines such as those enumerated in Subsection (c).\n\nThis argument is based on the principle that an administrative agency's power to regulate must be limited to matters within its own jurisdiction. If an administrative agency is required to oversee actions taken by another level of government, it may encroach upon the separation of powers between the branches of government.\n\nIn this case, the statute requires each State to establish and maintain a program under which each vehicle and each furnace shall be tested annually for compliance with federal emissions standards. This would fall outside the scope of the agency's jurisdiction because it pertains to actions taken by the States, rather than the agency itself. Therefore, this provision may violate the principle of separation of powers, as the agency's power to promulgate regulations should only extend to issues within its own jurisdiction.\n\nAdditionally, this argument also aligns with the concept of federalism, as it suggests that the federal government should not interfere with state sovereignty and leave decisions about environmental regulation primarily to the States."
