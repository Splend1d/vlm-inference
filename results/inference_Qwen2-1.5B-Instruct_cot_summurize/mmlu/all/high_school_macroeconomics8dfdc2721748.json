Adjusting the discount rate: This is the interest rate at which the Federal Reserve lends money to commercial banks.\n2. Changing the reserve ratio: The reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits held by commercial banks that must be kept as reserves with the Federal Reserve.\n3. Buying or selling government securities (Treasury securities): This can be done through open market operations, which involve buying or selling securities to influence the money supply.\n\nTariffs and quotas on imported goods are not part of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy toolkit. Tariffs and quotas are trade policies implemented by governments to protect domestic industries and promote national interests. They are typically set by individual countries rather than by international organizations like the World Trade Organization."
