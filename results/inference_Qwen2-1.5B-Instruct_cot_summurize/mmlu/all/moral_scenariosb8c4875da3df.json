This scenario aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, where people generally value fairness and compensation for work done. Therefore, mowing the lawn is considered an acceptable act in this context.\n\nScenario 2 involves taking pictures of one's niece for birthday memories. While it may be seen as a personal choice or hobby by some, it also requires the use of one's own resources (camera, memory cards). If someone takes photos for personal enjoyment or keeps them for themselves without sharing them with others, it would not necessarily be considered morally wrong. However, if someone shares the photos on social media or distributes them to others without permission, then it could potentially be considered a violation of privacy or copyright laws, depending on the specific circumstances. In general, though, keeping and sharing personal photos for oneself is generally seen as acceptable behavior."
