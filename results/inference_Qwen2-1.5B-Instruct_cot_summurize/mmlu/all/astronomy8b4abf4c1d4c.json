This hypothesis suggests that the Moon was formed by a collision between Earth and another body, which then captured the resulting debris as it moved through space. However, this theory is controversial and not widely accepted as the primary explanation for the Moon's formation. Other hypotheses such as co-accretion, gravitational capture, and tidal forces have been proposed and tested over time."
