Add all taxable income: $15,000 + $10,000 + $9,000 = $34,000\n2. Subtract any deductions that exceed the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted basis for those deductions: Adjusted basis minus actual deduction = $15,000 - $9,000 = $6,000\n3. Deduct the difference between the AMTI and the adjusted basis of any itemized deductions claimed: AMTI - adjusted basis = $34,000 - $6,000 = $28,000\n\nSince West does not have dependents or an itemized deduction, he cannot claim the standard deduction. Therefore, the maximum amount of AMT tax preference items he can claim is the lesser of either the AMTI ($28,000) or the adjusted basis of any itemized deductions ($6,000).\n\nGiven these calculations, the correct answer is D. $34,000."
