The war ended with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which established the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity as the basis for international relations.\n\nIn the context of the song, the reference to Ferdinand being the legitimate king of Bohemia suggests that the conflict may have been related to the division of the Holy Roman Empire among various states during the Thirty Years' War. Ferdinand may refer to Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, who had been deposed by his brother Maximilian II in 1590 and replaced by Louis XIII of France. The Thirty Years' War was a struggle for control over territories that were once part of the Holy Roman Empire, such as Bohemia.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical context provided, the composition of \"Pardon Me, O Winter King\" most likely reflects the aftermath of the Thirty Years' War and the subsequent disputes over the succession to the Holy Roman Empire and its territories."
