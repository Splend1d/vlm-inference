A t-test for a difference in means.\n\nThis is because the study involves comparing two groups (the standard technique and the new technique) with respect to their mean recovery times, which is what the t-test allows us to do. The t-test can be used when we want to compare two related groups (e.g., before and after treatments), as it accounts for differences between groups due to chance rather than random assignment.\n\nIn contrast, a z-test is used when comparing two independent samples, not when comparing two groups where one group is a control."
