Decreasing the temperature. Lowering the temperature would reduce the concentration of NO2, leading to more N2O4 being produced due to the decreased competition between NO2 and N2O4 during the reaction. This would increase the equilibrium position towards the formation of N2O4 instead of decreasing its production."
