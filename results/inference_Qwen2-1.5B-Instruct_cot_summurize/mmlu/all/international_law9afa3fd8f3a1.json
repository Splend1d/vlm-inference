This principle generally means that an organization cannot be sued in a court of any country without its consent or without a waiver of immunity by the state it represents. However, there may be exceptions to this rule if the organization has entered into an agreement with another state that waives its immunity or if the organization has obtained immunity under a treaty.\n\nIn practice, most IOs have entered into agreements with host countries that provide them with certain types of immunity from legal process. These agreements typically include provisions allowing IOs to continue their operations while avoiding some of the normal legal obligations of states. For example, IOs may not be subject to taxation or may be granted certain privileges in exchange for their compliance with certain rules and regulations.\n\nTherefore, the primary source of immunity for IOs is usually an agreement between the organization and the host country that provides it with immunity or allows it to operate within the host country's laws and regulations."
