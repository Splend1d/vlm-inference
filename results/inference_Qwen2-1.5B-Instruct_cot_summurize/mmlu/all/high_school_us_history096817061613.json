The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nMaize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico is most analogous to which of the following?\n\nA.

Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois\n\nThe passage discusses how Juan de Sepulveda's statement about the \"slaves of nature\" reflects a Latin American form of rights discourse influenced by Thomistic moral philosophy, specifically Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas' condemnation of slavery and advocacy for the rights of the indigenous people in the Americas based on a natural right to liberty. This aligns with the idea that the Iroquois had mixed agriculture, meaning they cultivated both maize (a staple crop) and other crops like cornmeal and beans, while also engaging in hunting and fishing activities.\n\nThe other options do not fit this description:\n\nA. Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux is primarily focused on buffalo hunting, which is not a mixed agricultural practice.\nB. Wolf domestication by the Algonquians involves wolves being tamed and kept as pets or companions, not farming practices.\nD. Seal hunting among the Inuit typically involves hunting seals for food and clothing, not a mix of agriculture and hunting as practiced by the Iroquois."
