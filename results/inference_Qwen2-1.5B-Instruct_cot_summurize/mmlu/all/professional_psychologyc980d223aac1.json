The particular native language in a child's environment. \n\nWhile hearing loss, variation in the support for language acquisition in the social environment, and the quality of non-parental early care and education experiences can all contribute to individual differences in the development of vocal language skills, the specific native language in a child's environment does not directly affect these factors. However, it is important to note that some children may have difficulty developing vocal language skills due to various other factors such as genetic predispositions or cognitive impairments."
