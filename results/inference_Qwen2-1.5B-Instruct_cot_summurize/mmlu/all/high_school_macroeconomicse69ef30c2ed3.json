As a result, aggregate demand decreases, leading to lower output levels. However, because interest rates increase, banks lend at higher interest rates, reducing the money supply and causing the price level to decrease. This decrease in the price level will also contribute to a reduction in inflationary pressures, as prices fall relative to previous periods."
