Genuine moral rules should consider the welfare and rights of all sentient beings, including humans, animals, and other intelligent creatures.\n\nOption C (must take into account the interests of all living beings) is also correct but goes beyond just sentient beings. It includes consideration of all forms of life on Earth, from plants to bacteria to microorganisms.\n\nOption D (are primarily directed toward promoting self-interest) is incorrect. Moral rules exist to promote the well-being of individuals and society, not solely for personal gain. They aim to establish norms that guide behavior and help people live in harmony with each other and the natural world."
