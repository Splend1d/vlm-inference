All of these.\n\nAccording to general relativity, gravity causes spacetime to curve and bend, which means that objects in motion will follow curved paths. This includes the path of light as it travels through space-time. When light passes near a massive object like the Sun, its trajectory will be bent due to the gravitational field of the Sun. \n\nAs for the speed of light, it can be affected by gravity in two ways: bending and slowing down. Light from the Sun is indeed slowed down slightly by the gravitational force acting on it, causing it to take longer to reach us here on Earth. However, this effect is much smaller than the effects of other factors such as atmospheric refraction or the Doppler effect.\n\nClocks on different locations within the same gravitational field will also run at different rates because of the curvature of spacetime. The time dilation effect caused by gravity is particularly noticeable when considering the length of time taken for an event to occur, rather than simply the rate at which events occur. This effect has been measured accurately enough to confirm that the laws of physics do not change with the passage of time in the presence of strong gravitation, including the Sun's gravity.\n\nSo while there may be some differences in how light behaves relative to other phenomena, the effects of gravity on light and clocks are generally consistent across all known forms of matter."
