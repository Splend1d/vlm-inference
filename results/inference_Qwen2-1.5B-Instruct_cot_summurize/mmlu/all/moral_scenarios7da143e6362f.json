According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action goes against the principle of not harming others. \n\nScenario 2 involves returning faulty computer parts that one purchased, which is not considered morally wrong. This action aligns with the principle of honesty and integrity, as it was done voluntarily and without any intention to deceive or cause harm."
