Water does not have this property and therefore cannot be considered as one of the special properties that affect transpiration. Cohesion, adhesion, and capillary action are all properties that affect how water evaporates from the skin and contributes to transpiration. Hydrophobicity is a property that affects the way oil and fat molecules interact with water, but it does not directly relate to transpiration."
