Nagada, which had an estimated population of 5,000 people. \n\nNagada was located on the Euphrates River in modern-day Iraq and dates back to the Neolithic period (around 7,000 BC). It was one of the earliest known cities in the region and played a significant role in trade and commerce during its time.\n\nUruk was another important ancient city in Mesopotamia, located near the Tigris-Euphrates river system. It had a population of around 10,000 people at the beginning of recorded history (c. 4,000 BC), making it one of the largest cities in the world at that time.\n\nKnossos, also known as Crete, is an ancient city-state in Greece that existed from about 3000 BC to approximately 1450 BC. Its population is estimated to have been around 20,000 people, although this figure may vary depending on the source.\n\nGiza, Egypt, is famous for being the site of the pyramids and tombs of pharaohs, but it does not have any recorded information about its population. However, some estimates suggest that the city may have had a population of around 200,000 people during the Old Kingdom period (ca. 2686-2560 BC).\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is B. Uruk with an estimated population of 10,000 people."
