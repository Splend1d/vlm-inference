Lm \u2228 ~(Lj \u2022 Ll)\n\nExplanation:\nIn predicate logic, we use symbols to represent statements and connect them using logical operators. The statement \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar, but neither Janet nor Latoya did\" can be represented as:\n\nLm (Ms. Jackson lent you something) \u2227 (~Lj \u2228 ~Ll) (neither Janet nor Latoya lent you anything)\n\nHere, Lm represents the event that Ms. Jackson lent you something, Lj represents the event that Janet lent you something, and Ll represents the event that Latoya lent you something. We have used the logical operator \u2228 (or) to denote the conjunction between two events (i.e., either one or both of the conditions must hold). The logical operator \u2227 (and) is used to express the negation of a condition. So, \"~\" is equivalent to \u00ac in predicate logic, which means not. Thus, \"~Lj \u2228 ~Ll\" is equivalent to \"not Janet lent you anything\" and \"not Latoya lent you anything\". \n\nTherefore, the correct translation into predicate logic is D. Lm \u2228 ~(Lj \u2022 Ll)."
