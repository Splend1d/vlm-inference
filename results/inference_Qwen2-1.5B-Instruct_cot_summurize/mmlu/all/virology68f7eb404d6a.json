Air Travel.\n\nChikungunya is primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is found in many tropical and subtropical regions around the world. However, the introduction of Chikungunya to new areas can be facilitated by air travel, as people who travel on planes may bring the virus with them when they return home. The virus can then spread through contact with infected mosquitoes or humans.\n\nTherefore, option B is the best answer."
