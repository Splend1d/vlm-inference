Thus, \\(ab\\) must be either 60 or -60, but since it has to be greater than 0 (because both numbers are less than or equal to 12), \\(ab = 60\\).\n\nNow, using the fact that \\(ab = 60\\), we can find \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(a < b\\) and \\(a + b = 12\\), we can solve for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\nLet's assume \\(a = x\\) and \\(b = y\\). Then, \\(x + y = 12\\) and \\(xy = 60\\).\n\nFrom \\(xy = 60\\), we know that one of the factors of 60 must be even (since 60 is divisible by 2) and the other odd (to make sure \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different). The pairs of factors of 60 are: \\((1, 60)\\), \\((2, 30)\\), \\((3, 20)\\), \\((4, 15)\\), \\((5, 12)\\), and \\((6, 10)\\). However, we're looking for distinct pairs such that one is even and the other is odd.\n\nAmong these pairs, only \\((4, 15)\\) satisfies the condition that one is even (4) and the other is odd (15). This means our solution is \\(a = 4\\) and \\(b = 15\\).\n\nTherefore, the two numbers are \\(4\\) and \\(15\\), which corresponds to option **(D)**."
