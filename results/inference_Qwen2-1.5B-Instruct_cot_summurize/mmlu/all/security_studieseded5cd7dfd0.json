Social constructivism employs theories of causality in the study of international relations, in addition to prioritising the study of identity as a socially constructed theory. In contrast, realism regards state of actor behaviour in the international system to follow an 'action-response' pattern.\nB. Realism regards identity as a crucial point for consideration in international relations. Realist theory is based on the assumption that identity informs behaviour.\nC. Realism is based in the notion of causality whilst social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings.\nD. Social constructivists regard the state as an independent unit whose behaviour is shaped by the requirements of the international system, whilst realists regard state interaction as being the natural progression of identity formulation.\n"

Realism is based in the notion of causality whilst social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings.\n\nSocial constructivism is a theoretical perspective in sociology and anthropology that emphasizes the role of cultural and social processes in shaping human behavior and identities. This perspective argues that identities are not fixed or inherent, but rather are constructed through social interactions and shared understandings between individuals. Therefore, social constructivism focuses more on the construction of identities than on their underlying causes or mechanisms.\n\nRealism, on the other hand, is a philosophical and political theory that views states and societies as self-interested entities driven by their own interests and needs. It posits that the actions and behaviors of states are determined by their own internal motivations and goals, without any external influences or constraints. Realism does not focus on the nature of identity formation, but rather on how it shapes state behavior in the international system. \n\nTherefore, while both realism and social constructivism have some overlap in their approach to understanding identity within international relations, they fundamentally disagree about what constitutes the underlying causes and mechanisms of identity formation."
