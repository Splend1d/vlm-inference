In this case, the plaintiff's statement to the police accident investigator is hearsay because it is not directly related to the accident itself and is being offered for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., whether the defendant ran a red light). Therefore, it cannot be admitted as evidence unless it falls under one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule, such as a statement made by a party-opponent, a statement against interest, or a statement made during the commission of a crime. However, since the plaintiff's statement does not fall under any of these exceptions, it must be excluded from the trial."
