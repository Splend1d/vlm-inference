The correct answer would depend on the specific range or criteria for peak flow measurement that your organization or institution uses. In general, however, it is common to record peak flow readings at intervals of approximately 5 minutes (e.g., every 5, 10, or 15 minutes). This allows for a more accurate and consistent assessment of lung function over time. It's important to note that peak flow measurements should always be taken in a quiet room with minimal distractions, and the person being measured should be seated upright and free from any respiratory infections or illnesses."
