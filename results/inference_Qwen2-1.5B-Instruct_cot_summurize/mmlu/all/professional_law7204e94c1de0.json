The company's property was separated from the golf course by a fence on which the company had posted signs warning people not to enter the property because of the dangers of balloons landing. A golfer on the golf course hit an errant shot onto the company's property, ignored the warning signs, and jumped over the fence to retrieve her golf ball. At about the same time, one of the company's balloons experienced mechanical problems and had to make an emergency landing to avoid crashing. The balloon, which was out of control when it landed, struck the golfer and injured her. The jurisdiction has decided that hot-air ballooning is an abnormally dangerous activity. In an action by the golfer against the company, does the company have any affirmative defenses?\n\nA. No, because the balloon was out of control when it struck the golfer.\nB. No, because the company was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\nC. Yes, because the balloon landed to avoid crashing.\nD. Yes, because the golfer assumed the risk by coming onto the company's property.\n"

No, because the company was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\n\nAbnormally dangerous activities are those that involve risks beyond what ordinary people would consider safe or reasonable under similar circumstances. In this case, the golf course is considered a public place where people may come and go without being warned about potential hazards. The fact that the golfer did not heed warnings and jumped over the fence to retrieve her golf ball shows a reckless disregard for safety. Therefore, the company cannot rely on the defense that the golfer assumed the risk by entering the property. Additionally, the fact that the balloon landed to avoid crashing indicates that there were no inherent risks associated with its operation, further supporting the conclusion that the company was engaging in an abnormally dangerous activity."
