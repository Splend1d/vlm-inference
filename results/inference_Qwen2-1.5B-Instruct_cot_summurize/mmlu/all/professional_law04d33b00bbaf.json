The flier stated that recipients should come to a nearby storefront on election day, where there would be free food and drink, and other \"prizes\" for those who voted. Two police undercover agents went to the party, where they agreed to be taken to vote in return for $50 each. The campaign worker drove the men to their alleged poll location, where the agents arrested him on charges of conspiracy to violate the election bribery laws. The defense filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that it was legally impossible to commit the crime because the agents were not registered to vote in that district and they never intended to allow a crime to be permitted. Is the trial court likely to grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, because legal impossibility is a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\nB. Yes, because he could not be guilty of conspiring with two law enforcement agents who never intended to commit the crime.\nC. No, because the basis of the conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit the act, along with an affirmative step in that direction.\nD. No, because when the worker drove the agents to the voting place, he committed the complete crime of bribery and the conspiracy was an element contained within it.\n"

No, because when the worker drove the agents to the voting place, he committed the complete crime of bribery and the conspiracy was an element contained within it.\n\nThe defendant cannot be guilty of conspiring with two law enforcement agents who never intended to commit the crime. The basis of the conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit the act, along with an affirmative step in that direction. In this case, the agent's intent to commit the crime was not part of the conspiracy, as they never intended to do so.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant cannot claim legal impossibility as a defense to the crime of conspiracy. Legal impossibility refers to a situation where it is impossible to commit a specific crime due to the nature of the offense or the laws involved. However, in this scenario, the defendant's actions did not fall under any specific illegal act that required the presence of the agent's intention to commit a crime. Therefore, the defendant cannot claim legal impossibility as a defense.\n\nIn summary, the defendant cannot be guilty of conspiring with two law enforcement agents who never intended to commit the crime, nor can he claim legal impossibility as a defense to the crime of conspiracy. As such, the trial court is unlikely to grant the motion to dismiss."
