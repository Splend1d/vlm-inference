This is because producers will try to maximize profits by producing more than what the market demands, leading to higher prices.\n\nIn this scenario, if the substitute good (good Y) is more expensive than the good being regulated, consumers may choose to buy less of the regulated good as they can afford it. However, if the substitute good is cheaper or has a different utility to the consumer, they may still choose to purchase it instead of the regulated good. In either case, there would be an increase in the demand for the substitute good.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: an increase in the demand for good Y, a substitute for good X."
