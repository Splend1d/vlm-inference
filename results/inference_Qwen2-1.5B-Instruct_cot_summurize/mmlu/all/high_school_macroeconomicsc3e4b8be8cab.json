I and II are true.\n\nThe GDP Deflator is indeed an alternative to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in calculating inflation rates, as it takes into account both the price level of goods and services produced domestically and the price level of imported goods and services. It also allows for a comparison between different years or periods by using different prices at each time period.\n\nHowever, the GDP Deflator is not always considered more accurate than the CPI because its calculation method involves adjusting the prices of all goods and services produced domestically based on the production cost of those goods and services rather than simply comparing them with their prices from previous periods. This means that the GDP Deflator may not accurately reflect changes in the overall purchasing power of money over time if the production costs have changed significantly since the last time the GDP Deflator was calculated.\n\nIn summary, while the GDP Deflator can be useful in understanding inflation rates, it is not always considered more accurate than the CPI due to its limitations in capturing changes in the overall purchasing power of money."
