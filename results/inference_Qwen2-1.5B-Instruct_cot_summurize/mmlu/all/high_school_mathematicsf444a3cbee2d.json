So, she wants:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^5\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify this expression step by step using properties of exponents and fractions:\n\nFirst, let's express 10 as a fraction:\n\n\\[10 = \\frac{10}{1}\\]\n\nThen, apply the power to both the numerator and denominator separately:\n\n\\[\\left( \\frac{10}{1} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^5 = \\frac{10}{1} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{3^5} \\right)\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(\\left( \\frac{1}{3^5} \\right)\\):\n\n\\[\\left( \\frac{1}{3^5} \\right) = \\frac{1}{243}\\]\n\nSo, our simplified expression becomes:\n\n\\[\\frac{10}{1} \\times \\frac{1}{243} = \\frac{10}{243}\\]\n\nTherefore, the single fraction that allows John to satisfy Mrs. Busywork's request without changing the product from 10 to 10/3 is:\n\nD. \\(\\frac{1}{243}\\)."
