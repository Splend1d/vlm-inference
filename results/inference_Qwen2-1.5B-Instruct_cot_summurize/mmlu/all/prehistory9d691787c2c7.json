These artifacts have been found across Europe, including in France (at Chauvet Cave), Spain (at Lascaux), Italy (at La Cueva de los Cristales), and elsewhere. The images depicted by these artists include animals, humans, and abstract symbols that suggest they had some understanding of aesthetics and symbolism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to your question is:\n\nD. 36,000 BP, at Wharton Hill."
