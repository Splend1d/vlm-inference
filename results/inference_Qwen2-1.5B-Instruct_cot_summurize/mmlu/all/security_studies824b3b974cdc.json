This has led to increased efforts by governments to regulate and control the export of military equipment and technology. At the same time, there has been a growth in the volume of the arms trade as countries seek to modernize their militaries or acquire new technologies. Additionally, the changing nature of conflict has also influenced the nature of the defence trade, with some countries seeking to invest in defensive measures while others focus on offensive capabilities. Overall, the emergence of these trends is likely to continue as countries face new challenges and opportunities in the global security environment."
