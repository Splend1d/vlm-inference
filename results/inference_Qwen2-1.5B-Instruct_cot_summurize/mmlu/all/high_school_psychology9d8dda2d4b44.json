This type of conditioning occurs when a neutral stimulus (such as a sound or light) becomes associated with a behavior by repeatedly pairing it with a naturally occurring, but neutral, stimulus (such as food). Over time, this association can lead to the behavior being learned without any additional reinforcement or punishment. The conditioned stimulus (CS) is the original stimulus that triggers the conditioned response (CR), while the unconditioned stimulus (US) is the stimulus that has already been paired with the conditioned stimulus and is now used to elicit the conditioned response."
