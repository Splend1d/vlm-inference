This will put upward pressure on the nominal interest rate.\n\nWhen inflation is expected to increase, it implies that the cost of living will rise over time, which can lead to higher prices for goods and services. As a result, individuals may need to save more in order to maintain their standard of living, which could potentially push up the nominal interest rate. However, if inflation expectations remain high, the central bank may be forced to raise interest rates to combat the potential for inflation, which would further reduce the nominal interest rate. On the other hand, if inflation expectations decrease or stabilize, the nominal interest rate may actually decline, leading to lower real interest rates."
