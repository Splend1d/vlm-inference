This statement reflects the idea that individuals have agency and responsibility for their behavior, and that they should strive to maintain control over their lives.\n\nStatement B: It is morally wrong to try to control the lives of (adult) others means that individuals should not interfere with or exert influence on the lives of others without their consent. This statement reflects the importance of respecting individual autonomy and dignity, and of avoiding harmful interference or manipulation.\n\nStatement C: One cannot be morally assessed for what is due to factors outside one's control means that individuals should not be held responsible for events or circumstances beyond their control, such as accidents, illness, or external pressures. This statement reflects the recognition that people are not always able to control certain aspects of their lives and that it is unfair to hold them accountable for negative outcomes that were unforeseen.\n\nStatement D: One cannot be morally blamed for taking control of one's own life means that individuals should not be punished or criticized for making choices or decisions that align with their values and goals. This statement reflects the belief that individuals should be free to make their own choices and that punishment or blame should not be imposed based on unintended consequences or mistakes.\n\nIn summary, all of these statements reflect different aspects of the control condition, emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility, respect for autonomy and dignity, and fairness in evaluating individuals' actions and behaviors."
