Examples include rolling over on your stomach, sliding across a table surface, or simply lying down in bed.\n\nPassive movements can also refer to situations where an individual's muscles are relaxed or inactive, allowing for more natural movement patterns. This may occur during sleep or after a period of rest, and can lead to improved range of motion and increased comfort in certain positions."
