The mesoderm is the middle layer of cells in the embryo, between the ectoderm and endoderm. It gives rise to many different types of tissues in the body, including muscle, fat, bone, and connective tissue. The respiratory tract starts as a tube-like structure called an ectodermal tube that grows laterally into the lung, while the digestive tract starts as a tube-like structure called an endodermal tube that grows anteriorly into the intestine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and II."
