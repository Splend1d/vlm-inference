A lawyer for the movie studio negotiated an agreement with the screenwriter whereby the movie studio would pay the screenwriter $5,000 for the rights to the screenplay, and 10 percent of the gross receipts earned by the distribution of the movie, should the studio decide to film the screenplay. Both sides signed the agreement. Two weeks later, the screenwriter was at a birthday party for a close friend when she discovered she had forgotten to purchase a gift for her friend. She quickly grabbed a piece of paper and wrote on it:\"I promise that my friend is entitled to 5 percent of the proceeds I will receive for the distribution of the movie to be made from my screenplay. \"The screenwriter then signed the paper, placed it in an envelope, and handed it to the friend. The promise to pay 5 percent of the proceeds to the friend may best be interpreted as a (an)\n\nA. equitable lien.\nB. conditional assignment.\nC. irrevocable assignment.\nD. gratuitous assignment of future rights.\n"

In this case, the screenwriter has given her friend a written promise that she will receive 5% of the proceeds from the distribution of the movie based on the conditional terms of the agreement with the movie studio. This means that the friend can enforce the promise if they receive any money from the movie's distribution, but the friend cannot demand payment until such time as the screenwriter receives her promised share of the proceeds. Therefore, the screenwriter has given her friend a conditional assignment of her rights under the agreement with the movie studio."
