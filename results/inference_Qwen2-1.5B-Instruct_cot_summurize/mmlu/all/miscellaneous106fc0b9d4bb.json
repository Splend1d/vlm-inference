This leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded because consumers perceive the price as being lower than it actually is. As a result, the quantity supplied remains unchanged at the original equilibrium level, but the quantity demanded decreases due to the higher perception of the price. This leads to a shortage of leather garments rather than a surplus. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
