                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Nearly all of the enzyme molecules are interacting with acetaldehyde molecules.\n\nWhen the concentration of acetaldehyde is increased, the rate of the reaction increases initially because there are more enzyme molecules available to interact with the increasing number of acetaldehyde molecules. As the concentration continues to increase, the rate of the reaction plateaus and then starts decreasing again. This is because the enzymes become saturated with acetaldehyde, meaning that they cannot bind any more molecules until the enzyme itself has been consumed by the reaction. Once this occurs, further increases in the concentration of acetaldehyde will not lead to an increase in the rate of the reaction because the enzyme molecules are already fully occupied and cannot react anymore."
