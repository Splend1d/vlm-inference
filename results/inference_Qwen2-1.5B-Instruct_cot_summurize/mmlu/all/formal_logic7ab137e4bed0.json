Here's how it works:\n\n  * For each variable, there are two possibilities: True or False.\n  * We start with the first clause, \u00acK \u2228 \u00acL, and evaluate its truth value. Since \u00acK and \u00acL both have to be true for the entire argument to be valid, this means that the whole statement is always true.\n  * Next, we look at the second clause, \u00acM \u2228 L, and evaluate its truth value. Again, since \u00acM and L both have to be true, the entire statement is always true.\n  * Finally, we look at the third clause, (\u00acK \u2228 \u00acL) \u2227 (\u00acM \u2228 L), and evaluate its truth value. This is where things get tricky because we need to take into account the fact that the first two clauses must be true. So, if either of them were false, then the overall argument would not hold.\n\n  * Let's say we set \u00acK = F, \u00acL = T, \u00acM = F, and L = T. In this case, the first two clauses are both true, but the third one becomes false, so the argument does not hold.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Invalid. Counterexample when L and N are true and K and M are false."
