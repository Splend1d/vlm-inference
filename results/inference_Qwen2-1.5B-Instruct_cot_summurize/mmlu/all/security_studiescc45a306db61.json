In their rejection of class orientated political interaction, HM scholars refer to wealth instead as the accumulation or access to physical resources, coining the term materialism to describe this approach.\n\nHistorical materialism is a Marxist theory that emphasizes the role of material factors such as economics, technology, and culture in shaping society. It rejects the idea that society can be understood purely from an anthropological perspective and instead focuses on the material conditions that underlie social life. This includes the production relations between people, the means of production, and the distribution of goods and services. Historically, this has led to the development of theories like Marx's \"Das Kapital\" and later developments in socialist economics."
