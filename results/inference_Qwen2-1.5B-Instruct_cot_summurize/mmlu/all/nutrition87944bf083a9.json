They play a central role as producers of food, managers of natural resources, income earners and caretakers of household nutrition.\n\nWomen play a crucial role in ensuring food security by being both producers and consumers of food. They manage natural resources such as water and soil, which are essential to agriculture. Women also contribute significantly to household nutrition by cooking and preparing nutritious meals. In many cultures, women have historically held significant leadership roles within households, including decision-making about food production and distribution. Additionally, women often serve as caregivers for children and elderly family members, which can impact their ability to engage in food production and other agricultural tasks. However, there are still significant barriers to gender equality in agriculture, including limited access to land, education, and economic opportunities."
