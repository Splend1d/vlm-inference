Even tissue cells with longer telomere strands can show senescence.\n\nAntagonistic pleiotropy occurs when the same gene affects two different traits in different ways, one being beneficial and the other being detrimental. In this case, some animals show little or no senescence, which could be an example of antagonistic pleiotropy if it were caused by a single gene affecting both traits. However, even tissue cells with longer telomere strands can still show senescence, indicating that there may be additional factors at play beyond just the length of telomeres. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer. \n\nOption A is incorrect because women who have more children tend to live longer due to various factors such as better health care and social support. Option B is also incorrect because some animals do show senescence, although it's not necessarily related to the specific gene causing the senescence. Option D is incorrect because exercise does increase longevity, although it's not always true for all individuals."
