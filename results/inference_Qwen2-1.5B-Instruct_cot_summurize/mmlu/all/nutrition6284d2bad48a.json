Carotenoids and flavonoids both belong to the polyphenol class.\n\nCarotenoids, such as \u03b2-carotene and lycopene, are carotenoids which are derived from the same precursor molecule as vitamin A (retinyl palmitate). They have been shown to have antioxidant properties and may contribute to maintaining good vision.\n\nFlavonoids, on the other hand, include anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, flavones, and flavanones. They are plant pigments that give many fruits, vegetables, tea, wine, chocolate, and red wine their color. Flavonoids also possess antioxidant properties and may play a role in cardiovascular health.\n\nWhile some studies suggest that certain types of soybean products, particularly those containing isoflavones, can affect estrogen levels in women, this has not been consistently confirmed across all studies. Processing methods like soaking, cooking, and fermenting do not change the bioavailability or digestibility of isoflavones in soybeans. However, it's important to note that these effects vary among individuals and depend on various factors including age, genetics, and diet. Therefore, option B is incorrect. \n\nOption C is also incorrect because \u03b2-carotene does not contain Vitamin A, but rather acts as an antioxidant and can be converted into Vitamin A by the body through a process called carotenoid conversion. Lycopene, on the other hand, is a powerful antioxidant and has been found to reduce the risk of several diseases due to its antioxidant properties."
