Public records: Public records are always admissible in court, regardless of whether they are offered to prove the contents of the document.\n\nC. When it's not offered to prove the contents of the document: The best evidence rule does not apply if the document is offered for any other purpose than proving its contents. For example, if you want to use a document to establish a fact that is not relevant to the case, the best evidence rule would not apply.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above."
