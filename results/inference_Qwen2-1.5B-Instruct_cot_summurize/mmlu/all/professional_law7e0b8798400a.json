One day, the husband had been drinking beer while watching football on television. After his favorite team lost a close game, the husband went into a violent rage. As he was storming around the apartment, he suddenly grabbed his wife and led her outside to their car. He then ordered her to get inside the vehicle. The husband was driving around aimlessly when he negligently collided with another car. The other driver, who was injured in the accident, brought suit against the husband to recover damages. Thereafter, the husband retained an attorney to represent him. At his first consultation with the attorney, the husband was accompanied by his wife. During the conference, the attorney's secretary took notes of the meeting. Two weeks later, the wife separated from the husband. She then hired a lawyer to represent her in a suit against the husband for battery and false imprisonment. At the trial between the husband and the other driver, the other driver's attorney calls the wife to testify. She proposes to testify that her husband was intoxicated at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the husband's attorney, the wife's proposed testimony will most likely be\n\nA. admissible as a proper lay opinion.\nB. inadmissible, under the attorney-clientprivilege.\nC. inadmissible, under the marital privilege.\nD. inadmissible, because the wife is biased.\n"

Inadmissible, under the attorney-client privilege.\n\nThe attorney-client privilege protects communications made between an attorney and their client during the course of legal representation. In this case, the attorney has taken notes during the consultation with the husband about the possibility of taking action against the other driver. This information would not be protected if it were used in court to support the husband's claim of intoxication at the time of the accident.\n\nThe marital privilege protects communications made between spouses during marriage or within two years after divorce regarding matters of family life. However, the privilege does not protect communications made during the course of legal representation. Therefore, the testimony of the wife about her husband's state of mind at the time of the accident would not be protected under the marital privilege.\n\nThe bias of the wife as a witness cannot be considered a valid reason to exclude her testimony. Bias can only be grounds for excluding a witness if they have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. In this case, the bias of the wife is based on her own experiences, which do not rise to the level of a personal interest in the outcome of the case."
