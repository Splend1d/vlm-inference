This is a straight line in the plane.\n\nThe distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ in the plane can be found using the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$.\n\nIn this case, we have $x_1 = -4$, $y_1 = 6$, $x_2 = 4$, and $y_2 = 3$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the distance formula gives:\n$$\\sqrt{(4-(-4))^2 + (3-6)^2} = \\sqrt{(8)^2 + (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 9} = \\sqrt{73}.$$\n\nHowever, we are asked for the absolute value of this distance, since the ant travels from one point to another, the total distance traveled by the ant is twice this value.\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{5}$."
