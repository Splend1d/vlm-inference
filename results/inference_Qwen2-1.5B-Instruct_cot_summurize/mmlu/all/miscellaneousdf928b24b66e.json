While all the other minerals listed (quartz, lithium, and diamond) are indeed minerals, calcite is not considered a mineral in the strict sense because it is a carbonate rock that can be found in various locations on Earth's surface. It does not form naturally as individual crystals or have a crystalline structure like the others do."
