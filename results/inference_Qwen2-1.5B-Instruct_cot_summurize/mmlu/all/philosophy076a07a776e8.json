However, based on his views on happiness as expressed in \"On Liberty,\" it seems likely that he would prioritize the pursuit of individual freedom and autonomy over external factors such as happiness. Therefore, option C (both a and b) could be a reasonable interpretation of Mill's position on this topic.\n\nHowever, without further information or clarification from Mill himself, it's impossible to definitively say whether option A (tranquility) or option B (excitement) is the correct choice. Both options have their own benefits and drawbacks, so the ideal state of happiness may vary depending on an individual's values and priorities."
