This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that an action or object has a purpose or function that it does not have, leading them to believe it should behave differently.\n\nC.

This fallacy occurs when someone makes a claim without sufficient evidence or understanding of the topic at hand, leading to incorrect conclusions or arguments.\n\nD.
