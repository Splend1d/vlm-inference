In this case, it would make more sense to compare the values directly rather than using percentage changes.\n\nGiven that real GDP per capita is $20,000 in 1980 and $21,000 in 1990, the increase from 1980 to 1990 is:\n\n$21,000 - $20,000 = $1,000\n\nThis means there was an increase of $1,000 in real GDP per capita between these two years. To find the percentage increase, you divide the increase by the original value (in this case, $20,000) and multiply by 100:\n\n($1,000 / $20,000) * 100 = 5%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 5.0 percent."
