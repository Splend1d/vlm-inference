He argues that these goods can be pursued through various means, but ultimately, they should be sought after for their own sake rather than as tools for acquiring other goods. \n\nOne way in which humans may seek out beauty is by contemplating the truth or contemplative virtues (such as wisdom and justice). These pursuits can lead to greater happiness and fulfillment, which is one of the three goods listed above. Therefore, Aquinas would argue that humans are motivated by an intrinsic desire to pursue the contemplative virtues, even if it leads them to act wickedly in pursuit of wealth or power.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Those who contemplate the truth."
