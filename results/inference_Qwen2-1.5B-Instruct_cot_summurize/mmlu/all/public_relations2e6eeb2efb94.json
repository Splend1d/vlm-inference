The greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nUtilitarianism is a moral theory that advocates for actions that maximize overall happiness or pleasure and minimize suffering or pain. It posits that the best action is one that produces the greatest net benefit for society as a whole. This can include actions such as redistributing resources to those in need or providing assistance to individuals in distress. However, it does not necessarily imply that the ends justify the means, nor does it suggest that those who are better off should always give to those who are not. Rather, it focuses on promoting the welfare of the most people possible through the use of rational decision-making."
