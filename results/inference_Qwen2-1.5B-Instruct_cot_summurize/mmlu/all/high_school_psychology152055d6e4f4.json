While experimenting with dogs, Pavlov discovered that once his dogs became accustomed to seeing and hearing the attendant who brought them food at mealtime, they would salivate in response to the sight and sound of the attendant.\nC. While experimenting with cats, Pavlov discovered that if he placed a hungry cat inside a box and food outside the box, the cat could \"learn\" to press a lever to open the door of the box.\nD. While experimenting with pigeons, Pavlov discovered that if he placed a pigeon in a box, he could condition it to recognize that if it pecked at a particular key, it would receive a food pellet.\n"

While experimenting with dogs, Pavlov discovered that once his dogs became accustomed to seeing and hearing the attendant who brought them food at mealtime, they would salivate in response to the sight and sound of the attendant. This is the most accurate statement about Ivan Pavlov's accidental discovery. \n\nIn this experiment, Pavlov trained dogs to associate the sound of an attendant's voice with the presentation of food pellets. The dogs learned to salivate when they heard the attendant's voice, even before they had been conditioned to salivate upon receiving food. This is an example of classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus (in this case, the sound of the attendant's voice) is paired with a specific unconditioned stimulus (food pellets), leading to the conditioned response (salivation)."
