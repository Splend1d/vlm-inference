Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, the main character did something that was clearly morally wrong because pulling off someone else's wings is harmful and cruel. It goes against the principle of not causing harm or injury to others, which is an important moral standard in the US.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character did nothing that would be considered morally wrong. Surfing the internet while doing homework is a common practice and generally not seen as wrong. The main character simply continued with their daily routine without any negative consequences for anyone else."
