The contract stipulated that delivery would be \"F. O. B. at the dealer's shop,\" with payment to be made one week after tender. When the dealer received the tapestry, he noticed that it had been damaged in transit. The dealer immediately contacted the collector and notified him that he was rejecting the tapestry because it had ripped apart and was becoming unwoven. The collector told the dealer that he would get back to him with re-shipping instructions. The collector did not make any further contact with the dealer. After four weeks, the dealer then sold the tapestry to a buyer for $120,000. If the collector sues the dealer for damages, the collector should recover\n\nA. $120,000, for conversion.\nB. $108,000, because the dealer is entitled to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% on the resale.\nC. $100,000, which is the contract price.\nD. $20,000, which covers the difference between the contract price and the sale price.\n"

In this case, the dealer breached the contract by rejecting the tapestry because it was damaged during transit. The dealer is therefore entitled to recover the difference between the contract price ($100,000) and the actual sale price ($120,000), which is $20,000.\n\nOption A (conversion) is incorrect because conversion occurs when a person uses another's property without their consent or permission. In this case, the dealer has no right to use the tapestry, and the collector cannot claim conversion.\n\nOption B (reasonable sum not exceeding 10%) is also incorrect because the dealer does not have a legal right to the tapestry, and the collector cannot recover more than the loss suffered by them due to the breach of the contract.\n\nOption C (contract price) is also incorrect because the dealer accepted the tapestry for its full contract price of $100,000, but later rejected it and sold it for $120,000. Therefore, the collector cannot recover the contract price, which is $100,000."
