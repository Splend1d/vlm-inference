Since both parties have filed summary judgment motions that assert there are no genuine issues of material fact, summary judgment for plaintiff or defendant will be granted.\nD.

The court must review the evidence presented by both parties to determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact that require further investigation. In this case, both plaintiff and defendant have made summary judgment motions, which means they have provided their own evidence and arguments. The court will evaluate these submissions to determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact that need to be resolved through trial. If the court finds that there are no genuine issues of material fact, it may grant summary judgment in favor of one party based on the merits of the case."
