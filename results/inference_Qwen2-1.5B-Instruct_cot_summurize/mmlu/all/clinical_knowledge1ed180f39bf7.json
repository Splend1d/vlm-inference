The Y chromosome contains genes that determine the sex of an individual, and females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Therefore, if a male has only one Y chromosome (and no other X chromosomes), he will be considered to be a male with a recessive allele for the Y chromosome. If a female has only one X chromosome (and no Y chromosome), she will also be considered to be a female with a recessive allele for the X chromosome. This means that the inheritance of the sex of a child is solely determined by the presence or absence of a single Y chromosome from the father."
