While all of the other options (high level of confidence in central government, national transportation networks, and the national anthem) could be considered as forces that might lead to a sense of unity or cohesion within a country, the existence of strong separatist groups would not necessarily be a centripetal force that aims to bring people together. Instead, it would be more likely to lead to conflict and division within the country. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
