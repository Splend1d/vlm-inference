None of the above.\n\nWhile it is true that agreeing on the meaning of \"ought\" can sometimes lead to shared moral opinions, this does not necessarily mean that they will share all the same moral opinions. There may be different interpretations or applications of the concept of \"ought\" that result in differing moral views. Similarly, while disagreements over the facts of a particular situation may lead to differing moral conclusions, this does not necessarily mean that one person's moral conclusion must conflict with another's. \n\nIn other words, agreement on the meaning of \"ought\" is not sufficient for sharing all the same moral opinions or reaching a consensus on moral issues."
