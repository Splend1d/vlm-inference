When a group of teachers rated their ability to control their situation and their satisfaction with their job, the two variables had a correlation of 0.30. Which statement follows from this correlation?\n\nA. If you want teachers to be happy with their job, give them more control over their situation.\nB. If you want teachers to take more control over their situation, make them happier at their jobs.\nC. Teachers in the study who were more satisfied with their job were less confident in their ability to control their situation.\nD. 9% of the variability in job satisfaction can be explained by the linear model with self-efficacy as a predictor.\n"

The strength of the correlation between self-efficacy and job satisfaction suggests that these factors may be interrelated, but further research would be needed to determine causality."
