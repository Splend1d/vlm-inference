Since \\(25\\) and \\(30\\) share no common divisors, their orders will be different. However, since we're interested in finding how many elements there are in the cyclic subgroup generated by \\(25\\), it's important to note that \\(25\\) and \\(30\\) have no common factors other than \\(1\\).\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether \\(25\\) has a smaller or larger order than \\(30\\), both numbers divide into \\(30\\) evenly. Thus, \\(25\\) and \\(30\\) can generate the same cyclic subgroup within \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{30}\\).\n\nSince \\(25\\) and \\(30\\) share no common factors, they must each have a unique order when considered as elements of \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{30}\\). Therefore, the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup generated by \\(25\\) is equal to the order of \\(25\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{30}\\), which is \\(30/25 = 6\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. 6**."
