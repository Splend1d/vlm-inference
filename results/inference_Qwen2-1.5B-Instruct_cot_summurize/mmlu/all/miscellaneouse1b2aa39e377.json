Water can cause the fluid to become cloudy and thick, which can indicate a problem with the hydraulic system. Other symptoms such as excessive fluid use or excessive thinning of the fluid could also indicate a problem, but they do not necessarily indicate the presence of water. The noise of a relief valve may indicate a potential issue with the system, but it does not necessarily indicate the presence of water."
