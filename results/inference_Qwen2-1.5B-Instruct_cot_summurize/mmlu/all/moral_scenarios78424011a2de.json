The other items mentioned, such as broccoli and fava beans, can be eaten without any moral issues.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 2, eating the yogurt from the break room where your coworker's name was written on it could be seen as stealing or unauthorized use of property, depending on the context. However, this action is not explicitly stated to be morally wrong, so the answer would depend on the specific circumstances."
