This is because it involves endangering someone's life without their consent or knowledge. \n\nMoving a granny's rocker farther away from the TV when she enjoys watching a certain show is not inherently wrong, but it may still be seen as an invasion of privacy and a lack of consideration for her preferences if done without her explicit permission. Therefore, scenario 2 does not necessarily involve morally wrong actions."
