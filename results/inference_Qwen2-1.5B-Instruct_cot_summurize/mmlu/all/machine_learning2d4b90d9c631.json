Doesn\u2019t affect bias and variance\n\nAdding more basis functions to a linear model does not necessarily decrease bias or increase estimation bias, as these terms refer to the accuracy of the predictions made by the model. Adding more basis functions can increase the complexity of the model, which may lead to increased variance (i.e., the variability of the predictions). However, this is not always true, as some models may have better generalization properties even with more complex models. Therefore, without knowing the specific context and details of the problem being solved, it is difficult to say whether adding more basis functions will result in decreased bias or increased variance."
