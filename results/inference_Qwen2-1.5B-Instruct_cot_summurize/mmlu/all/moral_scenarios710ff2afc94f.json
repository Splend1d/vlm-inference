Scenario 2, on the other hand, involves taking action that could potentially cause harm to someone who is already vulnerable and in need of support, specifically by intentionally causing their diagnosis to be made in order to receive financial benefits. This action goes against the principles of fairness, respect, and compassion towards those in need, and therefore would be considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
