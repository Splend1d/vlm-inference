Under the Articles of Confederation, the national government did not have the power to negotiate treaties or establish a federal judiciary. The Articles provided for a weak central government with limited powers and decentralized authority at the state level. However, it was ultimately up to individual states to agree on how to organize their own governments and what kind of authority they wanted to give to the central government."
