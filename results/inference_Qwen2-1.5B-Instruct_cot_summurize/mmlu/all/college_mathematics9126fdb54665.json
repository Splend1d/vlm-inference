We know that if \\(x = y\\), then \\(f(0,0)\\) is a local minimum because both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms cancel out. If \\(y = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}x\\), then \\(f(0,\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}})\\) is a local maximum because the \\(x\\) term dominates over the \\(y\\) term.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven our analysis, we see that the correct statement regarding the relative extrema of \\(f\\) is **C**. The function \\(f\\) does indeed have a relative minimum at the origin \\((0,0)\\). However, since this conclusion comes from analyzing the critical points and not directly comparing the value of \\(f\\) at those points, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or in the options provided. \n\nThe most accurate answer should reflect the nature of the critical points found, considering they indicate where the function changes concavity and could potentially lead to minima/maxima depending on the values taken by \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Given the options available, none seem fully accurate without additional context or clarification."
