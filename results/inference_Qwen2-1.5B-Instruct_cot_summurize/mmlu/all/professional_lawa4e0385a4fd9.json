In this case, the plaintiff's testimony that his son screamed about the shattered car windows during the explosion is hearsay. It cannot be used against the defendant without being introduced through some form of authentication, such as a police report or eyewitness testimony from someone who saw the incident firsthand. Therefore, the trial judge should rule the plaintiff's testimony inadmissible."
