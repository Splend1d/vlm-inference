This is because the conditioned stimulus (the highway) and unconditioned stimulus (the fear of driving on highways) have been repeatedly paired together, leading to the formation of a new association between the two stimuli. As a result, when the conditioned stimulus is presented again, the conditioned response (anxiety) is elicited without the need for any additional stimuli or cues. Options B, C, and D do not involve the creation of a new association between stimuli and response, but rather rely on different mechanisms such as habituation, extinction, and motor learning respectively."
