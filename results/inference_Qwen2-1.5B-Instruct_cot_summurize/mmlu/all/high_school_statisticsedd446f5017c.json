Therefore, if we want to investigate the effect of taking fish oil capsules or garlic capsules on cholesterol levels, we need to control for other factors such as exercise intensity and sleep duration. By doing so, we can isolate the effect of the dietary supplement being tested and determine whether it has a positive or negative impact on cholesterol levels."
