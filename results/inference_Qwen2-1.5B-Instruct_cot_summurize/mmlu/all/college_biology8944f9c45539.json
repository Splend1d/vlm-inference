Thymine dimers, which are formed when thymine base pairs with a methyl group on guanine or adenine, are one of the common molecular lesions that accumulate in cells with this defect. Other options such as deamination of cytosine and depurination do not occur due to the presence of thymine in the DNA sequence."
