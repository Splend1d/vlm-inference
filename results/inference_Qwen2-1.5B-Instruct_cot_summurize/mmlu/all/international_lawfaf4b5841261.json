Functional immunity covers the act and incidentally also the person committing the act.\n\nFunctional immunity refers to the legal principle that an individual cannot be held liable for any harm caused by their actions if those actions were necessary to prevent a greater harm from occurring. This means that even if an individual commits a harmful act, such as breaking into a building or causing damage, they may still be protected under functional immunity if their actions were necessary to prevent a greater harm from occurring, such as saving lives or preventing a terrorist attack."
