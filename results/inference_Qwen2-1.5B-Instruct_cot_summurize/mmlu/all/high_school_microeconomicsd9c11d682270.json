                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's first establish that Melanie has consumed a total of \\(x\\) apples and \\(y\\) oranges, where \\(x + y = \\text{total amount of lunch money}\\).\n\nThe marginal utility of apples is given as 12, so the utility from each additional apple consumed is 12. Similarly, the marginal utility of oranges is given as 18, so the utility from each additional orange consumed is 18.\n\nMelanie wants to maximize her utility, which is the sum of the utilities from apples and oranges:\n\n\\[U = U_{\\text{apples}} + U_{\\text{oranges}}\\]\n\nSince the marginal utility per dollar is constant (since she doesn't have any more money), we can equate the marginal utilities:\n\n\\[12 = x/(\\text{cost of one apple}) = y/(\\text{cost of one orange})\\]\n\nGiven that the cost of an apple (\\(c_a\\)) is $1 and the cost of an orange (\\(c_o\\)) is $2, we have:\n\n\\[12 = x/c_a = y/c_o\\]\n\nWe also know that \\(x + y = \\text{total amount of lunch money} = c_a + c_o\\). Since \\(c_a = 1\\) and \\(c_o = 2\\), we have:\n\n\\[x + y = 3\\]\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Melanie should make no changes; she is consuming the utility maximizing combination of apples and oranges. This option does not involve changing her consumption decisions or increasing her consumption of either item.\n\nB. Melanie should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both. Let's calculate the optimal amounts for apples and oranges based on the given constraints.\n\nFrom the equation \\(x + y = 3\\), we can express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\):\n\n\\[x = 3 - y\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(x\\) into the marginal utility equations gives us:\n\nFor apples:\n\\[U_{\\text{apples}} = 12 = \\frac{x}{c_a} = \\frac{(3-y)}{1} = 3 - y\\]\n\\[y = 0\\] (This would mean she had no apples left, which contradicts the assumption that she has spent all of her lunch money.)\n\nFor oranges:\n\\[U_{\\text{oranges}} = 18 = \\frac{y}{c_o} = \\frac{0}{2} = 0\\]\n\\[y = 0\\] (Same issue as above)\n\nBoth scenarios lead to contradictions since it's impossible to consume zero apples while having enough money to buy apples. Therefore, there must be an error in our calculations or assumptions made about the utility functions.\n\nC. Melanie should decrease her apple consumption and increase her orange consumption until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both. To find the optimal consumption levels, we need to understand the relationship between the marginal utilities and the costs of apples and oranges. The marginal utility of each item is directly proportional to its cost. \n\nHowever, without knowing the exact utility function of Melanie, we cannot definitively determine the correct course of action. We could consider using calculus to find the minimum point(s) of the utility function subject to the budget constraint, but again, the information provided is insufficient to proceed with this analysis.\n\nD. Melanie should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both. This option involves changing the relative quantities of apples and oranges, which suggests that Melanie needs to adjust her consumption habits rather than simply spending more on apples or oranges.\n\nIn conclusion, without further information or context, it's impossible to determine the correct answer based solely on the given information. However, based on the analysis presented thus far, the most likely scenario is D: Melanie should increase her apple consumption and decrease her orange consumption until the marginal utility is equal for both items."
