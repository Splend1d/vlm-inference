This means that for every sequence of points in \\(X\\) which converges to a point in \\(X\\), the corresponding sequence of images under \\(f\\) also converges to a point in \\(Y\\).\n\nUniform continuity of \\(f\\) implies that for any two sequences \\(\\{x_n\\}\\) and \\(\\{y_n\\}\\) in \\(X\\) with \\(x_n \\rightarrow x\\) and \\(y_n \\rightarrow y\\) (where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are elements of \\(X\\)), we have \\(f(x_n) \\rightarrow f(x)\\) and \\(f(y_n) \\rightarrow f(y)\\).\n\nThus, while it is true that \\(f\\) must be uniformly continuous given the information provided about its continuity on the compact set \\(X\\), the converse does not necessarily hold. For instance, consider the constant function \\(f(x) = c\\) where \\(c \\neq 0\\). It is continuous but not uniformly continuous since for all \\(x\\), there exists a neighborhood around \\(x\\) such that no matter how small you make \\(x\\), \\(f(x)\\) will always be within a distance of \\(|c|\\) from \\(c\\), regardless of how close \\(x\\) gets to \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, **Statement 1 is False**.\n\n**Statement 2:**\n\nGiven that \\(f(x), g(x): \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) are everywhere differentiable, we can apply the chain rule correctly to find \\(f(g(x))\\) is also differentiable at any point \\(g(x)\\) where \\(g(x)\\) is defined.\n\nSince \\(g(x)\\) is differentiable, it follows that \\(g'(x)\\) exists for all \\(x\\) in some interval containing \\(g(x)\\). When we differentiate \\(f(g(x))\\), we need only look at the derivative of \\(f\\), which is known to exist by assumption. Therefore, \\(f(g(x))\\) is also differentiable at any \\(g(x)\\) where \\(g(x)\\) is defined.\n\nThus, **Statement 2 is True**.\n\nBased on these analyses, the correct answer is **B. True, False**."
