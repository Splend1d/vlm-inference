If the market price is above the average variable cost (AVC), the firm will earn a positive profit. If the market price is below the average variable cost but above the average fixed cost (AFC), the firm will earn a positive profit. And if the market price is below the average fixed cost, the firm will incur a loss.\n\nTherefore, the firm can earn both positive and negative profits in the short run."
