This involves actively processing and integrating new information into existing knowledge, rather than just memorizing it passively. It can involve summarizing or explaining the material to oneself, using analogies or metaphors to connect the new information to what one already knows, or creating connections between different pieces of information to make them more meaningful. Elaborative rehearsal is thought to be an important process in learning and memory, as it helps to solidify new information and integrate it with existing knowledge."
