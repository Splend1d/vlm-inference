Without the student's knowledge, the boyfriend executed a deed that purported to convey the hillside property to the co-worker in fee simple. The boyfriend signed his name and forged the student's name. He then delivered the deed of conveyance to the co-worker, who paid the boyfriend $150,000, which was the fair market value of the property. The co-worker immediately recorded the deed received from the boyfriend. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute.

The boyfriend and the student as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nIn California, the common law joint tenancy is established by the deed of grant if the parties intend it to be so, without any need for formal statutory provisions. In this case, the deed naming the couple as joint tenants with right of survivorship did not require additional statutory authorization. Therefore, upon the death of either party, the entire property would pass to the surviving spouse or children under intestate succession laws.\n\nThe deed also provided for a right of survivorship, meaning that upon the death of either party, the other would inherit the entire property outright rather than share it with their co-tenant. This provision is typical in joint tenancy agreements and ensures that the property will pass to the surviving tenant rather than being divided between them and their heirs.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific circumstances and intentions behind the deed play a crucial role in determining whether a joint tenancy exists. In this case, the deed clearly states the intent of the parties to have a joint tenancy with right of survivorship."
