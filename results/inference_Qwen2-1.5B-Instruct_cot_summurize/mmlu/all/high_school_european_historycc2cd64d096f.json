It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nThe type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to what Southern Renaissance movement?\n\nA. Neoplatonism\nB. Antitrinitarianism\nC. Pietism\nD. Rationalism\n"

The passage does not mention any of the options provided (Neoplatonism, Antitrinitarianism, Pietism, or Rationalism). Therefore, the correct answer cannot be determined based on the given information.\n\nHowever, based on the context provided, the passage suggests that Erasmus's contributions were more significant than the previous humanists, who had monopolized the treasures of classic culture. This suggests that Erasmus's humanism was more inclusive and accessible to the common people compared to the previous humanist movements.\n\nTherefore, the closest option would be:\n\nC. Pietism\n\nPietism is a form of Christianity that emphasizes personal piety and devotion to God, often associated with the Reformation period. While it is not directly related to Erasmus's work, it can be seen as an alternative to the previous humanist movements that focused on individual piety and devotion to God."
