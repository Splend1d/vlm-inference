After settling with the hotel, the guest sued the manufacturer of the carpet that was in her room and elsewhere in the hotel. The carpet caused the fire to spread rapidly due to its easy flammability. Evidence proved that the manufacturer knew of the product's flammability and that it would be used in buildings lacking proper safety measures. The manufacturer argued that the hotel's negligence and the criminal act of the arsonist were both superseding causes, thus abrogating the manufacturer's liability as a matter of law. How did the trial court most likely rule on that issue?\n\nA. The intervening causes relieved the manufacturer of liability.\nB. The intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability.\nC. The intervening causes were irrelevant due to the strict liability of the manufacturer.\nD. By not suing the arsonist first, the guest waived her right to sue the manufacturer.\n"

The intervening causes did not relieve the manufacturer of liability.\n\nThe trial court is more likely to rule that the intervening causes do not relieve the manufacturer of liability because the guest's lawsuit against the manufacturer is based on the manufacturer's knowledge of the carpet's flammability and the fact that it was used in a building without adequate safety measures. Therefore, even if the arsonist caused the fire, the manufacturer's liability for the carpet remains intact since they were aware of the risks and should have taken steps to prevent harm from spreading."
