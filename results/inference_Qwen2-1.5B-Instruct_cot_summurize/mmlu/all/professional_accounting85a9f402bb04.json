This allows the auditor to identify any changes in accounting estimates, transactions, or other significant events that occurred between the dates of the interim financial statements and the date of the audit report.\n\nInspection of inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end, testing internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate, reviewing client cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end, and comparing interim financial statements with the audit period-end financial statements are all relevant procedures in their own right, but they do not directly relate to subsequent events as defined by GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)."
