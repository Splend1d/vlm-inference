This is because in order to achieve a better outcome, we may need to take actions that are unpopular or even harmful in the short term, but these actions can lead to positive outcomes in the long term. For example, if we invest in education and healthcare, we may see an increase in productivity and economic growth in the long term, which can offset any initial costs. Therefore, while it is important to consider the costs and benefits of any policy decisions, it is also necessary to prioritize achieving long-term goals over immediate convenience or popularity."
