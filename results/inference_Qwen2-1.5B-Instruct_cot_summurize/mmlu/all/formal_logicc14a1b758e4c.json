H \u2261 (I \u00b7 ~J)\n2. K \u2261 ~H\n3. ~(K \u2283 J) / I \u2261 J\n\nLet's start with the first statement:\nH \u2261 (I \u00b7 ~J)\n\nTruth Table 1: \n| H | I | J |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | F |\n| T | F | T |\n| F | T | F |\n| F | F | T |\n\nFrom the above table, we can see that H is equivalent to (I \u00b7 ~J), which means that if both I and J are true, then H is also true.\n\nNow let's move on to the second statement:\nK \u2261 ~H\n\nSince we know from the first statement that H \u2261 (I \u00b7 ~J), it follows that K \u2261 (~I \u00b7 J). This means that if either I or J is true, then K must also be true. Therefore, K cannot be false, so the second statement is always true.\n\nNext, let's look at the third statement:\n~(K \u2283 J) / I \u2261 J\n\nThe negation of (K \u2283 J) is K \u2283 ~J, which is equivalent to ~(~K \u2228 J). However, since we know that K is always true, ~K is always false, and thus, ~K \u2228 J is always false. Therefore, the third statement is always false, making it redundant.\n\nPutting all these statements together, we have:\nH \u2261 (I \u00b7 ~J) \u2227 K \u2261 (~I \u00b7 J) \u2227 ~(K \u2283 J) / I \u2261 J\n\nThis shows that the argument is valid because all three statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Valid."
