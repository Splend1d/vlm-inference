However, it's important to note that the child may not be able to safely use scissors or clippers due to their age or developmental stage. In this case, the main character did not do anything explicitly morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, when the main character's mother cut herself while washing dishes, they should have immediately called emergency services or taken her to the hospital instead of screaming at her. This action was clearly morally wrong because it showed a lack of concern for the safety and well-being of others, especially one's family members. The main character's reaction was inappropriate and could have caused unnecessary harm to their mother. Therefore, option B is correct."
