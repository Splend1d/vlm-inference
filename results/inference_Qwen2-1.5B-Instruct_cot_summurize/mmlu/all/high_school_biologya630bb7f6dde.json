Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. Which of the following statement best explains this phenomenon?\n\nA. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.\nB. The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.\nC. In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.\nD. The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.\n\nIncomplete dominance occurs when two alleles (genes) for a particular trait combine differently in an individual's phenotype, leading to a blend or intermediate form between the two dominant alleles. This means that while some individuals may express only one allele and appear as if it is dominant, others will express both alleles and appear with a mixed phenotype, such as blue and pink petals in hydrangeas."
