The Minoans were known for their impressive architecture and art, but they did not have an established written language or record of their history. Therefore, option A (trade) is likely the correct answer based on the information provided. Option B (warfare) could be true if we consider that the Minoans had a strong navy and engaged in maritime trade, but this is not always the case with other ancient civilizations. Option C (the development of a common religion) is also possible given the fact that the Minoans had a complex religious system that included multiple gods and goddesses, but again, this is not necessarily unique to Minoan culture. Finally, option D (conspicuous consumption by elites) is more difficult to determine without additional information about the Minoans' social structure and economic practices."
