The personal character of duty.\n\nRoss argues that utilitarianism requires individuals to act in ways that maximize overall happiness, but this can lead to situations where an individual's actions may conflict with their own values or beliefs about what is right and just. This is because the ultimate goal of maximizing happiness is not necessarily aligned with the intrinsic value of certain actions or behaviors. As a result, Ross suggests that utilitarianism should take into account the personal character of duties and the importance of aligning one's actions with one's own values and principles."
