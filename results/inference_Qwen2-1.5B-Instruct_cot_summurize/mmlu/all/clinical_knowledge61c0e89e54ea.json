It is a recognized cause of hypertension\n\nAddison's disease, also known as adrenocortical insufficiency (ACI), is a condition that occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones, including cortisol and aldosterone. This can lead to a range of symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, muscle weakness, and low blood pressure.\n\nIn terms of hypertension, Addison's disease has been linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. However, it is important to note that not everyone with Addison's disease will develop hypertension, and the severity and duration of the condition can vary greatly from person to person. Therefore, if you have Addison's disease, it is important to work closely with your healthcare provider to manage any potential risks associated with hypertension."
