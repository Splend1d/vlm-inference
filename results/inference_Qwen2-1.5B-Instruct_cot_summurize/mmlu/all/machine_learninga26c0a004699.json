It depends on the specific distribution and the values it takes. In some cases, such as normal distributions or uniform distributions, the probability mass function (PMF) will indeed be equal to the density function at all points where the PMF is non-zero. But this is not always the case for other types of distributions. Therefore, the second statement is false in general.\n\nSo, based on these considerations, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
