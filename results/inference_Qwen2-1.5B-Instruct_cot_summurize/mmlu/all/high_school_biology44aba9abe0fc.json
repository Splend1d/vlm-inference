Bats have wings for flight, while humans have arms for movement and manipulation. C, on the other hand, involves mitochondria from plants and animals, which are involved in energy production and respiration, respectively. D, with wings of a bird and insects, represents more similarity due to their shared role as flying mammals, but there are still differences in structure between birds and insects.\n\nTherefore, option A is the least likely pair of structures to represent homology."
