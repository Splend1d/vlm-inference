Such tests can detect only very large risks because of the fact that only small numbers of animals can be used.\n\nAnimal toxicity studies are conducted with doses that are much higher than those that would be encountered in humans. This is done for several reasons:\n\n1. Safety: Animal testing is often used as a preliminary step before human clinical trials, to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug or chemical. By using high doses, researchers can determine if there are any potential adverse effects on the animal model that might not be apparent at lower doses.\n2. Reproducibility: Using high doses allows researchers to replicate their findings across different experiments and laboratories, increasing the reliability and validity of the data.\n3. Efficiency: High doses allow researchers to quickly identify which substances cause harm in animals without having to conduct extensive long-term exposure studies on larger populations.\n4. Cost-effectiveness: High doses also reduce the overall cost of conducting animal testing compared to low-dose studies, which typically require more animals and longer periods of observation.\n5. Regulatory requirements: In many countries, animal testing is required for certain products before they can be approved for human use. By using high doses, researchers can demonstrate that the substance is safe before it enters the human market.\n\nIn summary, the main reason why doses used in animal toxicity studies are often much higher than those experienced by people is to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the substance being tested."
