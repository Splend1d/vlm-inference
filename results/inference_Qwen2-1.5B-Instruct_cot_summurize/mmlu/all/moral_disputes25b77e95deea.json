However, he specifically mentions that Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies, which is a significant difference from the behavior of meat-eaters who consume animals that have been raised on factory farms. Norcross argues that this difference highlights the moral responsibility of those who choose to eat meat over those who do not. Therefore, option A is incorrect as it does not capture the full extent of the moral difference between Fred's behavior and the behavior of meat-eaters."
