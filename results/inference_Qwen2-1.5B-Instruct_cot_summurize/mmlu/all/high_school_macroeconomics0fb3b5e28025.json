This is because these individuals are not included in the labor force, which means they are not counted towards the total number of people working or seeking employment.\n\nHowever, if the government collects data from all individuals regardless of whether they are employed or unemployed, then the number of discouraged workers will not affect the unemployment rate. In this case, the unemployment rate would reflect the true level of joblessness among those who are actively looking for work.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Discouraged workers are counted as \"out of the labor force\" thus the unemployment rate is understated making the economy look weaker than it is."
