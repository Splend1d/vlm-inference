Warner's study of the city of Natchez in the American Deep South found that there was a strong racial divide between blacks and whites, with many whites viewing blacks as inferior and deserving of segregation and discrimination. This belief in white superiority was deeply ingrained in southern society and played a major role in shaping the social and economic structure of the region. The \"colour line\" in this context refers to the physical boundary that separated blacks from whites, which was often enforced through laws and policies that discriminated against blacks and provided them with fewer rights and opportunities than whites."
