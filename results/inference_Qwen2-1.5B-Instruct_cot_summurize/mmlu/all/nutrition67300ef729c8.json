While BMI can be used to estimate general health risk, it may not accurately reflect individual differences in body composition or metabolic rate. Additionally, BMI is calculated based on height and weight, which may not accurately reflect actual body fat levels due to factors such as muscle mass and bone density. Therefore, BMI should only be used as a guide and additional information about body composition and metabolism may be necessary for a more accurate assessment."
