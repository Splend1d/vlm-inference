So, we have $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} \\leq \\pi$.\n\nAdding $\\frac{1}{4}$ to both sides gives us $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\leq \\pi + \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nMultiplying through by 4 gives us $3\\sqrt{3} \\leq 4\\pi + 1$.\n\nSubtracting $4\\pi$ from both sides gives us $3\\sqrt{3} - 4\\pi - 1 \\geq 0$.\n\nThis inequality represents the condition for the area of the largest possible triangle to be less than or equal to $\\pi$.\n\nSince $\\pi < \\sqrt{3}$, the only solution to this inequality is when $\\pi = \\sqrt{3}$, but since $\\pi$ is not greater than $\\sqrt{3}$, there is no solution to this inequality.\n\nHowever, we made an error in our reasoning. We should have considered the constraint that the sum of the areas of the two small triangles (formed by the intersection of the circles) must be less than or equal to the area of the large triangle.\n\nLet's correct this:\n\nThe area of the large triangle is $\\pi$.\nThe area of each small triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}r^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSo, the total area of the two small triangles is $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1$.\nTherefore, the constraint becomes $1 \\leq \\pi$.\n\nThis inequality represents the condition for the sum of the areas of the two small triangles to be less than or equal to the area of the large triangle.\n\nSince $\\pi > 1$, there is a solution to this inequality.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible area of a triangular region with one vertex at the center of a circle of radius 1 and the other two vertices on the circle is $\\boxed{\\pi}$, which corresponds to option D."
