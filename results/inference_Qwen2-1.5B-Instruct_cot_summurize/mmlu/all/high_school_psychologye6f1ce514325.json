Experiments isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables.\n\nExperiments allow researchers to control for confounding factors and isolate the effects of independent variables on dependent variables. This makes it possible to establish causal relationships between variables that may not be apparent through other research methods such as surveys or observational studies. By manipulating one variable while keeping others constant, researchers can determine whether changes in the manipulated variable cause changes in the dependent variable. Other research methods may also help identify potential confounders or moderating variables that could influence the relationship between independent and dependent variables. However, experiments remain the most direct way to establish causality because they directly manipulate variables and observe their effects without the influence of other variables."
