Inferential statistics are used to draw conclusions about an entire population based on sample data, which can help determine if the results of a study are due to chance or have generalizability beyond the sample. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset, while standard deviation measures the spread of data around its mean. Extraneous variables refer to factors that are not relevant to the research question but may still affect the outcome of the experiment."
