It was located in what is now southern Egypt, along the Nile River delta. The Nubians developed their own unique culture, art, and religion that differed significantly from the Egyptian culture they were influenced by. They also played an important role in shaping the development of ancient Egyptian civilization, as they were able to establish trade routes between Egypt and other regions, which helped to spread knowledge and technology throughout the region. Additionally, the Nubian people themselves contributed to the growth and prosperity of ancient Egypt, as they served as soldiers, administrators, and traders for the pharaohs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Nubian civilization predated and spurred the rise of Egyptian culture."
