(i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nMaximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is indeed used for estimating parameters in GARCH models, as opposed to ordinary least squares (OLS). However, it's important to note that MLE is typically more computationally intensive and may not always converge to the true parameter values.\n\nFor the standard linear model with no GARCH, both OLS and MLE estimators yield the same estimates for the slope and intercept parameters. The difference lies in the way the variance of the disturbances is estimated, which is slightly different between the two methods. OLS uses the sample variance, while MLE uses an estimate of the conditional variance based on the fitted model.\n\nRegarding most computer packages using numerical procedures to estimate GARCH models rather than analytical formulas, this statement is generally accurate. However, some software packages do provide analytical solutions for certain cases or specific types of GARCH models."
