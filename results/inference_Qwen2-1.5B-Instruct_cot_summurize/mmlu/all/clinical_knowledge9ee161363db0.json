This is because endurance athletes often engage in activities that require more energy than they expend during rest, so their bodies must be able to store and utilize fat as fuel when needed. Endurance training can also help improve cardiovascular fitness, which is essential for delivering oxygen to muscles and ensuring efficient energy production."
