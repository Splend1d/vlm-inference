Combination of the killed and live vaccines.\n\nThe combination of the killed and live vaccines is the most effective way to eradicate polio, as it provides both protection against wild poliovirus transmission and immunity against the weakened form of the virus that causes paralysis in children who receive the live vaccine. The killed polio vaccine contains weakened but non-infectious poliovirus particles that are killed during production, while the live vaccine contains weakened or attenuated strains of the virus that are designed to stimulate an immune response without causing disease in healthy individuals. Together, these two vaccines provide a strong barrier to poliovirus spread and help prevent new outbreaks of the disease."
