                    "text": "The gravitational force on an object depends on its mass and the strength of gravity at that location. The formula for gravitational force is F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where F is the force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\nIn this case, we know that the Space Shuttle's orbit height is 300 km above Earth's surface, which means it is 300 km from the center of Earth. We also know that Earth's radius is 6,400 km.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives us:\n\nF = G * (m1 * m2) / (r + h)^2\n\nwhere r is the distance from the center of the Earth to the Space Shuttle (6,400 km), h is the height of the Space Shuttle above the Earth's surface (300 km), and m1 and m2 are the masses of the Space Shuttle and Earth, respectively.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by recognizing that the distance from the center of Earth to the Space Shuttle is equal to the distance from the center of Earth to the Space Shuttle plus the height of the Space Shuttle above the Earth's surface. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nF = G * (m1 * m2) / ((r + h) + h)^2\n\nSimplifying further gives us:\n\nF = G * (m1 * m2) / (r + 2h)^2\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values of G and the mass of Earth (5.97 x 10^24 kg) into the equation:\n\nF = (6.67 x 10^-11 * 5.97 x 10^24) / ((6,400 + 2*300) * 10^3)^2\n\nSolving this equation gives us:\n\nF \u2248 4.9 m/s^2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 4.9 m/s^2."
