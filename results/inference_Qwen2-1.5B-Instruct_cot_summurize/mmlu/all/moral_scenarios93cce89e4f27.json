This action is neither good nor bad and can be considered neutral.\nIn scenario 2, removing the batteries from the smoke alarms is clearly morally wrong. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, tampering with safety devices such as smoke alarms is illegal and can result in serious harm or death. Removing the batteries can cause the smoke alarms to stop working properly, increasing the risk of fire or other accidents. Therefore, this action is considered morally wrong."
