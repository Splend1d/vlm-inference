In the Toulmin model, the argument is broken down into three main parts: the major premise, the minor premise, and the conclusion. The minor premise is the part of the argument that provides support for one side of the argument by either affirming the antecedent or denying the consequent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
