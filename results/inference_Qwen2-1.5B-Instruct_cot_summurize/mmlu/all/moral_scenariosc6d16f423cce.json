Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves calling the police on a teacher who is late, which goes against the law and can be seen as morally wrong due to the potential harm it may cause to the teacher and their students. On the other hand, Scenario 2 involves taking a customer's checkbook and going shopping, which is generally considered unethical but not necessarily morally wrong if the action is justified by the customer or if there is no harm done to anyone else. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
