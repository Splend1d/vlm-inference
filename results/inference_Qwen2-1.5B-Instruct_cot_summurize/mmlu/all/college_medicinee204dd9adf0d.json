The first scientist contends that organisms evolved via the increase of organs that were used the most during their time. They would then pass these on to subsequent generations. The second scientist, however, believed that advantages each organism possessed were absent for a long time, randomly occurred, and when they were beneficial, that organism would rapidly populate the population over a short period of time, evolutionarily speaking. Which of the following statements would strengthen the second scientist\u2019s argument?\n\nA. A study that shows that bodybuilders who train more have larger children.\nB. A taxonomy study that shows long periods of stagnant growth followed by short burst of massive evolution.\nC. A study that showed a species who were more successful due to the things they learned over their lifetime that they passed on to their children.\nD. A study that showed a consistent amount of time between the emergence of each new species.\n"

A taxonomy study that shows long periods of stagnant growth followed by short bursts of rapid evolution.\n\nThis type of study would support the idea that organisms with traits that are advantageous in the current environment may become dominant over time through natural selection, leading to the rapid expansion of those traits within the population. Over time, this can result in significant changes in the genetic makeup of the population, which can be seen as \"evolutionary leap\" or \"evolutionary explosion.\" \n\nOn the other hand, the first scientist's theory relies on the accumulation of advantageous traits over generations, while the second scientist suggests that sudden and large-scale changes occur due to environmental pressures or selective pressures acting upon the organism's traits."
