However, the most common factor that influences media coverage is the timing of the story. The more timely the news, the more likely it will be covered by the media. Additionally, the quality of the source and the relevance of the story to the audience also play important roles in determining whether a story will be covered or not. Human interest angles can also attract attention from the media if they provide newsworthy information or unique perspectives on the story. Finally, the political slant of the story can also impact its coverage, as certain stories may be given more prominence due to their perceived importance or significance within a particular political context."
