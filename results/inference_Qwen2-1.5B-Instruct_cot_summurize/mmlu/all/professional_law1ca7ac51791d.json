In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, the chef entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the chef a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notifying the neighbor, the chef proceeded to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the chef sold his lakefront property to his assistant. Shortly after the assistant took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the assistant's property. The assistant's strongest argument in an action against the neighbor for removal of the barriers, which are obstructing his access to the property, would be that\n\nA. an easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege.\nB. the assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded.\nC. because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement.\nD. the chef and the assistant, being in privity of estate, could \"tack on\" their successive use periods.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is A. An easement appurtenant is alienable in that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege.\n\nAn easement appurtenant is a type of fee simple determinable that gives the holder of the easement the right to use the servient tenement during the life of the holder or until the death of the holder. It can only be transferred with the consent of the holder of the dominant tenement, but once the dominant tenement has been conveyed, the easement automatically passes to the new owner of the dominant tenement. Therefore, if the dominant tenement is conveyed to someone other than the original holder of the easement, the easement will also pass to the new owner.\n\nIn this case, the chef sold his lakefront property to his assistant, who then acquired the right of way over the strip of land and the quarter-mile-long stretch of land. Since the dominant tenement (the property on which the roadbed is located) was not conveyed separately, the easement will also pass to the new owner of the dominant tenement. This means that the assistant is now entitled to remove the barriers without the neighbor's permission, since he is now the legal owner of the property."
