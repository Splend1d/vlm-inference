Now, Congress, under intense lobbying pressure from the press, proposes to enact legislation forbidding any state from requiring journalists to reveal the sources of their news articles in civil suits. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument in support of this proposed law?\n\nA. Congress has the authority under the commerce clause to regulate the flow of news.\nB. Acts of Congress are the supreme law of the land and take precedence over any conflicting state laws.\nC. Congress is essentially reaffirming the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nD. Under Article I, Section 8, Congress has the authority to secure to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\n"

This is because the First Amendment to the Constitution protects freedom of the press and the right to privacy, while the Fourteenth Amendment extends these protections to all citizens, including journalists. The proposed law would prevent states from compelling journalists to reveal their sources, which could potentially infringe on their free speech rights and the ability to protect confidential information. Therefore, it is argued that Congress should have the authority to prohibit such laws, as they may conflict with these constitutional provisions."
