The money supply will increase.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve (FED) buys bonds in the secondary market, it is essentially injecting liquidity into the economy by purchasing securities from financial institutions and other entities. This action increases the amount of money available for circulation in the economy, which can lead to an increase in the overall money supply. As a result, prices of goods and services tend to rise as well, leading to inflation if the central bank does not adjust interest rates accordingly. Therefore, option A is correct. Options B, C, and D do not apply in this scenario."
