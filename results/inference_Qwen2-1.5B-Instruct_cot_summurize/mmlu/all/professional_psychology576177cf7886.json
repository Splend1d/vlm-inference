In academic publishing, the authorship order typically follows a hierarchical system where the lead author (the primary contributor) is listed first, followed by co-authors in alphabetical order. The advisor would be considered a co-author under this system. However, if there are multiple advisors involved in the research process, they may be included as co-authors or even named as senior authors to acknowledge their contributions more formally. It's important to note that in most cases, only the primary researcher will be given credit for original work, while all other contributors, including advisors, will receive recognition based on their roles and responsibilities during the research process."
