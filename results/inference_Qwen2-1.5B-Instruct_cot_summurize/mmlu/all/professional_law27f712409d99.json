When the boy's mother inquired about the lipstick stains, the boy said that his teacher had kissed him. The mother then contacted the police, who subsequently conducted an investigation and arrested the teacher, charging her with two felony counts of child molestation. In accord with state law, a preliminary hearing was scheduled. After the boy was subpoenaed to testify at the preliminary hearing, the prosecution filed a motion to exclude the teacher from the courtroom during the boy's appearance. The motion, with supporting affidavits from a child psychologist, claimed that having the boy and the teacher in the same room would cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm to the alleged victim. The judge should\n\nA. deny the motion, because a pretrial proceeding is an early stage of trial, and a defendant has a constitutional right of confrontation at every stage of the trial.\nB. deny the motion, because the teacher's exclusion from the courtroom would have prejudicial impact on receiving effective assistance of counsel.\nC. grant the motion, because the teacher's attorney still has an opportunity to cross-examine the witness despite the teacher's absence from the courtroom.\nD. grant the motion, because cross-examination at a preliminary hearing is not required by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.\n"

This means that the defendant can question any witnesses against them and cross-examine them. However, if the court deems it necessary to prevent prejudice or ensure the fairness of the trial, it may exclude certain witnesses or evidence. In this case, the judge denied the motion to exclude the teacher from the courtroom during the boy's appearance, based on concerns that the presence of both the teacher and the boy could cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm to the alleged victim. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
