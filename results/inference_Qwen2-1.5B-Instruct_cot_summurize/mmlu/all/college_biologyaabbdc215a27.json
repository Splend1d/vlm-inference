Proliferate to the same cell density.\n\nWhen cancer cells and normal cells are grown in culture, they both undergo continuous cell division, which leads to their growth and spread. However, there are some differences between the two types of cells:\n\n1. Cancer cells can divide an indefinite number of times, while normal cells typically stop dividing once they reach a certain size or when they no longer have the capacity to divide.\n2. Cancer cells often display contact inhibition, which means they cannot attach to each other and continue to divide if they come into contact with another cell.\n3. Cancer cells require specific nutrients and growth factors to survive and grow, while normal cells obtain these resources from the surrounding environment.\n4. Cancer cells may also be more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs than normal cells because they have a higher rate of DNA damage repair mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Proliferate to the same cell density."
