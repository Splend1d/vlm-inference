Translation equivalence refers to the process of translating text or language from one source into another without changing its meaning. It is not related to the three types of equivalence you mentioned in your question. The other two types of equivalence are conceptual equivalence (the similarity between concepts), functional equivalence (the similarity between functions), and market equivalence (the similarity between markets)."
