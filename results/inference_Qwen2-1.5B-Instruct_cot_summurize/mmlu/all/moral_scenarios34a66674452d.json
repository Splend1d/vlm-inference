This action is clearly morally wrong because it involves making a decision based on misinformation rather than scientific evidence. In scenario 2, the main character is also doing something that goes against the advice of a professional authority figure. However, this time it is the person being fed who is allergic to peanuts, and the main character is simply following their doctor's instructions by adding them to their meal. While this may be seen as an inconvenience or unnecessary effort, it is still considered morally wrong for the main character to intentionally feed their child peanuts without consulting their doctor first."
