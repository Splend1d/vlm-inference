Natural selection\n\nNatural selection is the evolutionary agent that causes populations to become better suited to their environments over time by favoring traits that increase an individual's chances of survival and reproduction in a particular environment. This process leads to evolution, which can result in new species or significant changes in existing ones. The other options (mutation, non-random mating, and gene flow) play important roles in the process but do not directly cause populations to become better suited to their environments as consistently as natural selection does."
