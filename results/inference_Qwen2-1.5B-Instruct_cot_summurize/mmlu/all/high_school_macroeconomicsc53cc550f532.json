This can happen due to various factors such as technological advancements, changes in production methods, or unexpected events that reduce output capacity.\n\nIn this scenario, both the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium quantity of output would decrease. This is because with a lower total output, the demand for goods and services would also decrease, leading to a lower equilibrium price level and a higher equilibrium quantity of output.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases."
