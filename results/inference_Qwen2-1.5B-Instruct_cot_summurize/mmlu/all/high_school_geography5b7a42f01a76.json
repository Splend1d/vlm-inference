Beltways are large, wide roads that run through the center of a city, connecting different parts of the city with a series of boulevards or streets. These systems were designed to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality by reducing the number of cars on the road. The beltway system was first implemented in Europe in the 1950s and has since been adopted in many major American cities such as Washington D.C., Chicago, and New York City."
