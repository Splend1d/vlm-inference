Toward the end of the seventh year of the term, a violent storm blew off several of the roof shingles. The tenant noticed a leak through the roof where the shingles had blown off, but didn't make any repairs. A month later, a severe rain storm occurred, and water leaked through the roof, causing damage to the valuable parquet floors in the two rooms below. Before the term of his lease ended, the tenant discovered that the landlord had not paid his taxes on the property, so he purchased the property through a sheriff's sale. The tenant refuses to make any further rental payments on the property. If the landlord brings suit against the tenant for payment of rent in arrears, he would most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the tenant is estopped to deny the landlord's title.\nB. succeed, because of his security interest in the property.\nC. fail, because the purchase by the tenant vitiated any further contractual obligations.\nD. fail, because the landlord was under a duty to keep the demised premises in reasonably good repair.\n"

This principle applies even when the tenant has failed to make any repairs themselves, as long as they were aware of the condition and did nothing about it.\n\nIn this case, the tenant should have taken action to address the leaks and prevent further damage from occurring, especially considering the severity of the storm and the potential impact on the valuable parquet floors. By failing to do so, the tenant has waived their defense based on lack of knowledge or carelessness, and therefore cannot claim that the landlord's failure to maintain the premises constitutes an actionable breach of warranty.\n\nTherefore, the tenant would most likely fail to succeed in recovering rent in arrears from the landlord, unless there is evidence of actual fraud or mistake on the part of the landlord regarding the state of the property."
