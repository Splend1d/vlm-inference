Bentham believed that the state of nature can be described as a struggle for survival, in which individuals seek to maximize their own pleasure and minimize pain. He argued that this struggle could be resolved by instituting an \"anarchic\" society governed by laws of natural justice and morality, in which individuals would act according to what they believe is right or wrong based on objective criteria such as duty and virtue. Bentham's concept of \"improvising the happiness of the greatest number\" meant that he advocated for policies that would promote the well-being of the majority, while minimizing harm to minorities or the vulnerable."
