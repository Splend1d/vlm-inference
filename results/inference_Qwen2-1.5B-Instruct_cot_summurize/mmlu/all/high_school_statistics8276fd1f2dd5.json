The formula for the confidence interval is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = \\bar{x} \u00b1 z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \u03c3 \\]\n\nwhere \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) is the z-score corresponding to the confidence level of \\(\\alpha/2\\) (in this case, 0.05), and \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean.\n\nLet's first find \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\):\n\n\\[ z_{\\alpha/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.05}{2}} = \\sqrt{0.025} = 0.1581 \\]\n\nNow, let's plug in the known values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = 83 \u00b1 0.1581 \\cdot \\sqrt{386} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = 83 \u00b1 0.1581 \\cdot 17.8 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Confidence Interval} = 83 \u00b1 2.866 \\]\n\nSo, the confidence interval is approximately 80.84 - 93.16 days. This means there is about a 17.8% chance that the true average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days based on the given data and confidence level. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 17.8%.**"
