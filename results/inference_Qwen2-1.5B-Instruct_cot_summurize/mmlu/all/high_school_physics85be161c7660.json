Any 2 of the above values\n\nIn order to determine the mass of the second object, we need at least two pieces of information:\n\n- The final speed of object 1 (v1f)\n- The final speed of object 2 (vf)\n\nThese two velocities will allow us to calculate the change in momentum for both objects before and after the collision. We can use the law of conservation of momentum to relate these velocities to the masses of the objects.\n\nSo, knowing v1f and vf allows us to determine the mass of object 2 based on the following equation:\n\nm2 = (mv1f - mv2) / (m1 + m2)\n\nwhere m1 is the mass of object 1, m2 is the mass of object 2, and m1+m2 is the total mass of both objects."
