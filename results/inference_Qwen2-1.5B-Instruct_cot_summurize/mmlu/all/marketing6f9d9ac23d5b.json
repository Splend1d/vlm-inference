Stratified sample.\n\nA stratified sample is a type of sampling where individuals or items from each stratum (or subgroup) are independently and randomly sampled, while the remaining members of the population remain unselected. This ensures that all subgroups within the population are adequately represented in the sample. \n\nConvenience samples and quota samples involve selecting individuals based on certain characteristics or proportions without regard to their distribution within the population, whereas cluster samples involve dividing the population into clusters and then selecting one member from each cluster. These types of samples do not necessarily ensure equal representation of all subgroups within the population."
