Incontinence refers to an inability or unwillingness to restrain oneself from doing something that one should not do, even though one understands its wrongness. This can happen due to ignorance of the morality of the action, or simply because one is acting out of habit or desire rather than moral consideration. It is a common human tendency to act contrary to our own ethical principles at times."
