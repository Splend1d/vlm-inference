Descent of the tongue: The tongue descends during pregnancy, which increases the space available for the growth of the palate and palatine shelves.\n2. Changes in flexure of the developing brain: During development, the brain's flexible nature allows it to bend and fold, creating the space needed for the development of the palate and palatine shelves.\n3. Hydrophilic molecules increasing turgor pressure in the palatine shelves: Hydrophilic molecules such as water increase the turgor pressure within the palatine shelves, providing additional support for their growth and development."
