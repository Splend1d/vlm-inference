When a preliminary injunction hearing could not be scheduled within the original 14-day period, the court extended the TRO for another 30 days. The lender appealed the court's order extending the TRO. The homeowner has moved to dismiss the appeal. Is the appellate court likely to dismiss the appeal?\n\nA. No, because a TRO is immediately appealable.\nB. No, because the 30-day extension makes the TRO equivalent to a preliminary injunction and therefore appealable.\nC. Yes, because a TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute.\nD. Yes, because there is no final judgment from which an appeal may be taken.\n"

Yes, because a TRO is not appealable under the interlocutory appeals statute.\n\nUnder the interlocutory appeals statute, a court's decision on an application for a preliminary injunction is appealable only if it is \"final\" in nature. In this case, the initial decision of the court granting the TRO was made before the preliminary injunction hearing could be held. Therefore, the TRO was not considered final by the time the court extended the TRO for another 30 days. As a result, the homeowner cannot appeal the court's order extending the TRO."
