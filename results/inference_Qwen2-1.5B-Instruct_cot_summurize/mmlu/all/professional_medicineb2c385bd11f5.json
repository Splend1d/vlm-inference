Her daughter had moved away from the area, and nursing home placement was necessary because the patient could no longer function independently. Her present medications include furosemide and digoxin. Physical examination is normal except for a weight loss of 3.5 kg (7 lb) during the past 3 months. In your conversation with the patient, she says, \"No, I'm not depressed, I just don't have an appetite anymore. Nothing tastes good to me. I have a little bit of nausea most of the time.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study?\n\nA. Chest x-ray\nB. Complete blood count\nC. Determination of serum albumin concentration\nD. Determination of serum digoxin level\n"

A low serum albumin level may indicate malnutrition or dehydration, which could contribute to poor appetite and taste preferences.\n\nThe other options are less relevant to this clinical scenario:\n\n- Chest x-ray: This would help identify potential causes such as lung diseases or infections.\n- Complete blood count: This can help assess general health but does not specifically address changes in appetite or taste.\n- Determination of serum digoxin level: This would only be useful if the patient's symptoms were related to a condition affecting her heart muscle, not directly impacting her appetite."
