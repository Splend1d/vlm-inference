The defendant intended to kill another man, but the victim unknowingly stepped in front of the other man and was struck and killed by the bullet.\n\nThis situation would most likely result in the defendant's acquittal of the first-degree murder charge because it does not meet the definition of \"knowingly or willfully\" causing the death of another human being. The defendant did not intentionally harm the victim, and there is no evidence that he had any malice aforethought towards the victim. Additionally, the fact that the victim was unintentionally killed by the defendant's own actions suggests that the defendant acted without premeditation or deliberation. Therefore, the jury may be less likely to find the defendant guilty of first-degree murder based on these circumstances."
