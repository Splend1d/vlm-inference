As a wedding present to the inventor's brother, the inventor wrote on a wedding card she gave to her brother:\"I hereby assign to you 20 percent of the net profits realized from the production and distribution of my automobile engine within the first year of production. \"The inventor then borrowed money from creditors and began to promote her automobile engine. She was contacted by a major automobile manufacturer about the possibility of using the engine in a new line of cars the manufacturer intended to release during the next calendar year. While on her way to meet with the representatives of the manufacturer, the inventor was killed in an automobile collision. The manufacturer then contracted with the executor of the inventor's estate to license the use of the automobile engine design for a 10-year period for $500,000, payable to the estate. The creditors from whom the inventor borrowed the money to promote her automobile engine have now attached the proceeds from the licensing agreement, which have so far been paid into the estate. The brother also asserts his assigned rights to a share of the proceeds. In subsequent actions by the creditors and the brother, the court will most probably hold in favor of\n\nA. the brother, because the rights of an assignee are superior to a lien against the assignor subsequently obtained by legallequitable proceedings.\nB. the brother, because any proceeds of the assigned right received by the assignor thereafter are held in constructive trust for the assignee.\nC. the creditors, because the inventor's assignment to the brother was unenforceable as a defective assignment.\nD. the creditors, because the rights of creditors/lienors are superior to those of a donee beneficiary.\n"

The creditors' rights are superior to those of a donee beneficiary.\n\nWhen an assignee receives proceeds from an assigned right, they must be held in trust for the original assignor. This is known as constructive trust. If the assignee later assigns their rights back to the assignor, the creditor can challenge the assignment as invalid under the principles of fraudulent conveyance or unjust enrichment.\n\nIn this case, the brother was the original assignee, but he later assigned his rights back to the estate, making him a donee beneficiary rather than a creditor. Therefore, the creditors would not have a claim over the proceeds of the license agreement.\n\nIt is worth noting that the principle of constructive trust applies only if the assignee has no other legal interest in the proceeds, such as a prior lien or pledge. In this case, there is no evidence of any such prior claims, so the principle of constructive trust does not apply."
