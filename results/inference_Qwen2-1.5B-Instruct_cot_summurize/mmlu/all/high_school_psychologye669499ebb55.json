By controlling the consequences of an individual's actions, therapists can influence their behavior in a positive way. This may involve providing rewards for desired behaviors or limiting negative behaviors, such as using negative feedback to discourage unwanted actions. The goal is to help individuals learn new, more appropriate behaviors that will lead to better outcomes in their lives."
