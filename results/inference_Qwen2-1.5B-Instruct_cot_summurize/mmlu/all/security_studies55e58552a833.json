This is because humanitarian intervention is often used as a pretext for regime change or the promotion of certain political ideologies. Critics argue that this could lead to unintended consequences, such as civil unrest, economic instability, and the displacement of innocent civilians.\n\nAnother concern is the potential for a depletion of military resources pursuing wars on ethical grounds, leading to a loss of military security. Critics argue that if states become overly reliant on humanitarian intervention as a means of addressing global issues, they may neglect more pressing security threats, such as terrorism or cyber attacks.\n\nFinally, some critics worry that while some states have proven their ability to conduct \"just\" wars in order to protect sound values of democracy and neoliberalism, not all states would use force to pursue such globally beneficial ends. This could lead to a lack of implementation of these rights by state actors, leading to a failure to address human rights abuses."
