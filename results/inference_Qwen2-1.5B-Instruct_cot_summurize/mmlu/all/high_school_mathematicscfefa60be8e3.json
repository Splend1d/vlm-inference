                    "text": " Let's denote the terms of the arithmetic progression as $a$, $b$, and $c$. The common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression is denoted by $d$.\n\nSince the sequence starts with 9, we have $a = 9$.\n\nThe second term can be expressed as $b = a + d = 9 + d$.\nThe third term can be expressed as $c = b + d = (9 + d) + d = 9 + 2d$.\n\nWhen we add 2 to the second term and 20 to the third term, we get the new terms as $b' = b + 2 = (9 + d) + 2 = 11 + d$ and $c' = c + 20 = (9 + 2d) + 20 = 39 + 2d$.\n\nThese two new terms form a geometric progression if and only if their ratio is constant. Thus, we have $\\frac{c'}{b'} = \\frac{c}{b}$.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $c'$ and $b'$ into this equation gives us $\\frac{39 + 2d}{11 + d} = \\frac{9 + 2d}{9 + d}$.\n\nCross-multiplying gives us $(39 + 2d)(9 + d) = (11 + d)(9 + 2d)$.\n\nExpanding both sides gives us $354 + 57d + 2d^2 = 99 + 22d + d^2$.\n\nRearranging terms gives us $2d^2 - 35d + 85 = 0$.\n\nThis quadratic equation factors as $(d-5)(2d-17) = 0$.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us $d = 5$ or $d = \\frac{17}{2}$.\n\nHowever, since $d$ represents a term in an arithmetic progression, it must be a positive integer. Therefore, $d = 5$.\n\nSubstituting $d = 5$ back into any expression involving $d$ gives us $b = 11 + 5 = 16$ and $c = 9 + 2(5) = 19$.\n\nThus, the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is $\\boxed{19}$, which corresponds to option C."
