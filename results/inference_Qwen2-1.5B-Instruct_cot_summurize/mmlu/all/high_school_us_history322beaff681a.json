They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive. . . . Great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events. . . . I am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\"\n\u2014President Harry S.

Truman was concerned about the rise of totalitarian regimes, which he believed were fueled by misery and poverty. He argued that the hope for a better future had died, which made it difficult to counteract the spread of totalitarianism. Therefore, his rationale for supporting the policy of containment was to prevent the rise of such regimes and protect democratic values."
