Ninety-five percent of the oranges of this variety weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.\n\nThis statement reflects the definition of a 95% confidence interval: It indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true population mean lies within the range of values defined by the interval.\n\nOption B states that 95% of the intervals constructed will contain the sampled mean weight of the oranges. This is not necessarily true; it only guarantees that a certain percentage of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges, but does not guarantee that all of them will do so. \n\nOption C is incorrect because it claims that \"ninety-five percent of the oranges in this sample weigh between 7.58 and 8.72 ounces.\" The confidence interval itself shows the range of possible means, not individual sample weights or percentages of oranges in the sample. \n\nOption A is also incorrect because it suggests that 95% of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety. While this would be true if the interval was calculated correctly based on the sample data alone, the actual question asks about the confidence level for the entire distribution of orange weights, not just the sample."
