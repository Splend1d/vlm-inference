In this case, the cream-colored land snails have evolved due to being favored by their environment (in this case, light), which is why they are more likely to be found on the beach where there is less shade and therefore more sunlight exposure. The brown land snails have not adapted to the same degree but instead are still present because they can survive in the shade of trees or other coverings."
