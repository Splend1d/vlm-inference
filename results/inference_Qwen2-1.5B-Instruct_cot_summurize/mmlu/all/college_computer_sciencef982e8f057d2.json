II and III only\n\nThe key to sharing a single copy of a program among multiple users in a multiprogrammed system lies in the properties of the program itself, not its structure or implementation details. \n\n- If the program is a macro (a small piece of code that performs a task), then each user could define their own version of this macro and share it with others. This would allow them to perform the same operation using different implementations without interfering with each other's work.\n- Similarly, if the program is recursive or reentrant, it means that it allows for nested calls to itself, which can be useful for certain tasks like parsing and manipulating strings. These properties make it possible for multiple users to execute similar parts of the program concurrently, potentially improving performance and reducing wait times on the system.\n\nHowever, note that these properties alone do not guarantee that a single copy of a program can be shared by multiple users without interference. Other factors such as memory management, resource allocation, and synchronization mechanisms also play important roles in ensuring successful sharing."
