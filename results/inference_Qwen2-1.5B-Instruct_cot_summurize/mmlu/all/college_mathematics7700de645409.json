To find its components, we can substitute the values of t from 0 to 1:\n\ns_x = \u222b(t dt) = t^2 |_0^1 = 1\ns_y = \u222b(t^2 dt) = (t^3)/3 |_0^1 = 1/3\ns_z = \u222b(t^3 dt) = (t^4)/(4)|_0^1 = 1/2\n\nSo, the displacement vector s is (1, 1/3, 1/2).\n\nNow, we need to find the dot product of F with s:\n\nF\u00b7s = F\u00b7(1i + (1/3)j + (1/2)k)\n\nSince F is a constant unit force in the direction of (-1, 0, 1), we have F = (-1, 0, 1). So,\n\nF\u00b7s = (-1)i + 0j + 1k\n\nThe work done by F on the particle is then:\n\nW = \u222b(-1)i + 0j + 1k ds = (-1)(1) + 0(1/3) + 1(1/2) = -1 + 1/2 = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. -1/(4\u221a2)."
