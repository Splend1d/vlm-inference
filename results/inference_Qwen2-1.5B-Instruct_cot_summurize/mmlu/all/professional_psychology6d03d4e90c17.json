This method ensures that all participants have an equal opportunity to be included in the study and reduces the potential for bias or confounding variables that could affect the results.\n\nOn the other hand, random selection involves selecting participants based on some characteristic or variable that is not related to the study's hypothesis. For example, if the goal is to compare two treatments, one may randomly select participants based on their age, gender, or socioeconomic status rather than randomly assigning them to receive either treatment.\n\nIn summary, random assignment involves choosing participants from a pool that is representative of the population being studied, while random selection involves selecting participants based on a characteristic or variable that is unrelated to the study's hypothesis. Random assignment increases internal validity by minimizing confounding variables and improving the generalizability of the results."
