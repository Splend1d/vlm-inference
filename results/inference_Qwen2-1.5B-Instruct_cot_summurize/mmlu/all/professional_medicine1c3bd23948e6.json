CT scan of the abdomen with contrast\n\nThe patient's symptoms of abdominal cramping, fever, and constipation suggest a possibility of an inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A CT scan can help diagnose these conditions by providing detailed images of the gastrointestinal tract. It can also rule out other potential causes of\u8179\u75db, such as gallstones or ovarian tumors, which may have similar symptoms. However, it is important to note that CT scans should be done only after ruling out other possible diagnoses and before starting any new medications or procedures that could potentially worsen the condition."
