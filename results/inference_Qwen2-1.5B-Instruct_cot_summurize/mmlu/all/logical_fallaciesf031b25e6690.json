A slippery-slope pattern of argument is fallacious when it leads to the conclusion that a small step can result in a chain reaction of negative consequences, without any clear or justifiable justification for such an assumption.\n\nFor example, if someone argues that allowing smoking in public places will inevitably lead to increased health problems and deaths, but does not provide evidence or reasoning for this assumption, they have committed the slippery-slope fallacy. Similarly, if someone argues that allowing same-sex marriage will inevitably lead to increased sexual behavior and social unrest, but does not provide evidence or reasoning for this assumption, they have also committed the slippery-slope fallacy.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone argues that allowing smoking in public places would be morally wrong because it promotes harm to others, even though there may be some negative consequences from smoking, they are not committing the slippery-slope fallacy. In this case, they are making a moral judgment based on their belief that smoking harms others, rather than predicting future events based on past actions."
