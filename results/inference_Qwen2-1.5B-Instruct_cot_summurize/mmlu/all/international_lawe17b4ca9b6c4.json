Heads of States, heads of governments, ministers of foreign affairs, and heads of diplomatic missions are presumed to have the authority to conclude treaties on behalf of their respective countries. However, it is important to note that the actual signing and ratification of treaties can be carried out by individuals who do not hold full powers, as long as they have the necessary authority and represent their country in the negotiations and discussions leading up to the conclusion of the treaty."
