Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, calling 911 is considered morally wrong because it involves using emergency services unnecessarily or recklessly endangering people's lives. Calling 911 also requires a certain level of trust between the caller and the service provider, which is not necessarily present when reporting a situation where someone might be in danger.\n\nIn scenario 2, going to bed after putting a bandaid on the small hole in the military submarine interior does not involve any wrongdoing, as long as it is done responsibly and safely. While it may seem like an unnecessary act, it is still within the bounds of what is expected from responsible citizens. Additionally, the action itself is not inherently wrong, but rather depends on the context and circumstances surrounding it."
