The musician's ability to distinguish between two very similar pitches depends on their difference threshold, which is the minimum difference in pitch that they can detect as different. This concept is related to signal detection theory and involves the use of sensory thresholds to determine how well stimuli are perceived or detected by the brain. Absolute threshold refers to the maximum value of the stimulus that an organism can sense, while bottom-up processing refers to the way information is processed from lower-level sensory inputs. Signal detection theory does not directly relate to the musician's ability to distinguish between two pitches, but it may be relevant for understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in this process."
