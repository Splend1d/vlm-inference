Two years after the tenant entered into the leasehold agreement with the landlord, he subleases the house to his cousin. Thereafter, the cousin defaults on the rental payments. If the landlord brings an action to recover the past rent due from the cousin, the landlord will:\n\nA. recover, because pnvity of estate exists between a landlord and sublessee.\nB. recover, because there is privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.\nC. recover, because there is both privity of estate and privity of contract between a landlord and sublessee.\nD. not recover, because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and sublessee.\n"

Not recover, because privity of estate does not exist between the landlord and sublessee.\n\nPrivity of estate means that a landlord has a direct legal interest in the property being rented out by the subtenant, whereas privity of contract refers to the existence of a contract between the landlord and the subtenant. In this case, the landlord is not a party to the original lease between the tenant and the subtenant, so they do not have a direct legal interest in the property being rented out by the subtenant. Therefore, the landlord cannot recover past rent due from the subtenant."
