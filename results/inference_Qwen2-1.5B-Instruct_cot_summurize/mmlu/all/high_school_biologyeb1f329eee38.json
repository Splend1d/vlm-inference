Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.\nB. Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\nC. DDT is generally a very effective insecticide. One can only conclude that it was manufactured improperly.\nD. Although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it is not effective against mosquitoes.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A: Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.\n\nDDT is a widely used insecticide that targets certain types of insects, including mosquitoes. When it comes into contact with an insect, it disrupts its metabolism and causes it to die. However, some mosquitoes have developed resistance to DDT over time, which means they are less likely to be killed by the chemical. This resistance arises through mutations in the genes responsible for the insect's ability to metabolize DDT.\n\nWhen a mosquito population becomes resistant to DDT, it may continue to thrive without the pesticide, allowing its population to grow unchecked. As a result, there may be fewer susceptible mosquitoes available to compete with the resistant ones, leading to an increase in the latter's population. This phenomenon is known as \"survival of the fittest,\" where the most fit individuals (in this case, the resistant mosquitoes) are more likely to survive and reproduce, while the less fit (the susceptible mosquitoes) become extinct or are outcompeted.\n\nIn summary, the resistance to DDT among mosquitoes is due to genetic mutations that allow some mosquitoes to survive exposure to the pesticide and reproduce at higher rates than other mosquitoes. The resulting population explosion makes it difficult for susceptible mosquitoes to compete effectively and leads to the spread of resistance."
