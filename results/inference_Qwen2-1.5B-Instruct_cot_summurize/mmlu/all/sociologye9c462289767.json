Debt repayments with interest can be greater than the amount of money received\n\nEconomic aid has often been used as a tool for international development and cooperation, but it is not always effective or appropriate. In some cases, the recipient country may receive more aid than they can afford to pay back, resulting in increased debt\u8d1f\u62c5.\n\nThis issue is particularly problematic in developing countries, where the government may lack the resources to manage its own finances effectively. Additionally, the recipient country may have other pressing needs that require more immediate attention, such as healthcare or education. In these cases, economic aid may not be the most effective way to address the underlying issues.\n\nOverall, while economic aid can be an important tool for promoting modernization and development in developing countries, it must be carefully managed and targeted to ensure that it achieves its intended goals."
