                    "text": "The correct answer is B: The water potential of the pure water is positive.\n\nWhen a potato is dropped into a beaker of pure water, the water potential (or osmotic pressure) of the water around the potato increases due to the concentration gradient created by the potato's presence. This increase in water potential leads to the potato being pulled towards the higher water potential, which is the water in the beaker. As a result, the potato will sink down towards the bottom of the beaker.\n\nTherefore, the initial condition when the potato enters the water is that the water potential of the pure water is positive."
