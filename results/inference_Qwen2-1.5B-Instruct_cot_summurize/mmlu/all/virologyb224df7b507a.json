This discovery led to the identification of a virus that was able to infect and replicate within these cells, leading to the development of the term \"retrovirus\" for this type of virus.\nIn 1971, scientists studying HTLV-1 (human T-cell leukemia virus type 1) in Japan discovered that it could also cause tumors in mice. This led to the identification of another type of retrovirus, which is now known as HTLV-1 or LAV (Latent T-Cell Virus Type 1). The discovery of HTLV-1 and its ability to cause cancer in mice provided further evidence that retroviruses can cause tumors.\nThe discovery of retroviruses in cats causing leukaemia in mice was made possible through genetic research and molecular biology techniques used to study the immune system of mice. These studies revealed that certain retroviruses were capable of infecting and replicating within the cells of the immune system, leading to the development of a new class of retroviruses called oncogenic retroviruses."
