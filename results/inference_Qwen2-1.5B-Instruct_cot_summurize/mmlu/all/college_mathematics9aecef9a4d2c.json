                    "text": "The statement that is FALSE is D. (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.\n\nExplanation:\n- Option A: The set S is closed under addition modulo 10 because it contains all multiples of 5 in the set Z_10 (since adding any multiple of 5 to 0 results in another multiple of 5). This makes sense since 5 is a unit for addition modulo 10, meaning any integer can be divided by 5 without leaving a remainder.\n- Option B: The set S is also closed under multiplication modulo 10 because it contains all multiples of 2, which are clearly congruent to 0 modulo 10. Multiplication by 2 does not change the value of any element in the set S.\n- Option C: Since S includes elements like 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8, it has an identity element under addition modulo 10. For example, if we add 0 to any element in S, we get back that same element. So option C is true.\n- Option D: However, the set S is not closed under multiplication modulo 10. Consider multiplying any element in S by 3. The result will be either 0 or 6, depending on whether you multiply by 3 mod 10 or 15 mod 10 respectively. Therefore, option D is false."
