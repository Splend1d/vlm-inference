It is caused by a prion, which is a protein that can misfold and spread from one cell to another, leading to the formation of abnormal prion proteins in affected cells.\n\nVascular dementia, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Huntington's disease are all caused by other factors such as age, genetics, or environmental toxins."
