The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides\nB. Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum\nC. Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion\nD. The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters\n"

The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides.\n\nThis is because after protein digestion in the stomach, the small peptides are then absorbed into the bloodstream through the intestinal lining, where they can be transported to other parts of the body for use. However, it's important to note that not all amino acids are directly absorbed; some must be converted back into their amino acid form before being able to cross the intestinal barrier."
