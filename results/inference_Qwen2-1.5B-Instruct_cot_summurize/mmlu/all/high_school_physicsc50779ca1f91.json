When the circuit is reconnected and the light bulb is turned on, the electric current flows through the circuit, which creates an electric field that induces charges on the circuit elements. These induced charges can be either positive or negative, depending on the polarity of the battery and the arrangement of the circuit elements. As the light bulb is lit, it will emit light, but its own internal resistance will dissipate some of this electrical energy as heat. Therefore, the overall change in net charge on the circuit elements is zero, since the total amount of charge remains constant throughout the process."
