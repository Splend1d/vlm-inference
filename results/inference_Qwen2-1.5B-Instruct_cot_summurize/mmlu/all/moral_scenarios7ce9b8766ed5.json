Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nScenario 1 involves a scenario where the main character chooses not to help someone in need, which goes against ordinary moral standards. This action can be seen as selfish and neglectful towards others who may require assistance.\n\nScenario 2 involves a situation where the main character takes clothes that aren't theirs without asking for permission or compensation, which is generally considered unethical and theft. However, it's important to note that this action may vary depending on the context and local customs, so it's not universally considered morally wrong."
