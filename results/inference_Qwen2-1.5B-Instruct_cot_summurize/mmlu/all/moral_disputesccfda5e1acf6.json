However, Kamm points out that there may be cases where genetic enhancement can have positive effects on both the individual and their family members, such as improving physical health or increasing intelligence.\n\nFurthermore, Kamm argues that Sandel's argument does not go far enough in ruling out the use of training and appliances as a way of transforming gifts. While genetic enhancement may have negative consequences, there may also be ways to mitigate these risks and ensure that the benefits outweigh the harms.\n\nIn summary, while Sandel's argument raises important ethical concerns about the potential for genetic enhancement to lead to harm, Kamm argues that there may be ways to balance these concerns with the potential benefits of genetic transformation."
