This is because the process of evolution, which includes genetic drift, natural selection, and gene flow, allows for the exchange of genetic material between species. As such, if two species have similar DNA sequences, it suggests that they have a recent common ancestor with similar genetic makeup. Therefore, option A (humans and chimpanzees share a relatively recent common ancestor) is the correct answer."
