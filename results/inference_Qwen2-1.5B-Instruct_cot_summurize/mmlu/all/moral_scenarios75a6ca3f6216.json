This behavior can be seen as disrespectful and disruptive to others around you. Therefore, Option A is the correct answer. \n\nScenario 2: \"I complimented Kelly's transition\" is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Complimenting someone on their appearance or gender identity is generally considered respectful and positive. It shows empathy and understanding towards the person being complimented. Therefore, Option B is the correct answer."
