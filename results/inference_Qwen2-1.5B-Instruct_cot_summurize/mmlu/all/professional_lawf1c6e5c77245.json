Not recover, unless the theater failed to make a reasonable inspection of the seats for the safety of its customers.\n\nUnder common law principles, a business has an \"absolute duty\" to ensure that their premises are safe for customers to use. This means that the business has a legal obligation to take all necessary steps to protect customers from harm caused by any known or reasonably foreseeable dangers on their property. However, this duty is limited by the principle of comparative fault, which allows a plaintiff to share liability with others who contributed to the harm.\n\nIn this case, the theater has a duty to inspect the seats for any hazards that could cause injury to customers. If the theater failed to perform a reasonable inspection and did not discover the defective seat, then it may be held liable for the customer's injuries. However, if the theater knew about the defect but took no action to address it, then it would be subject to strict liability, potentially resulting in even greater damages.\n\nTherefore, while the theater may have a duty to inspect the seats for safety, they must also prove that they acted reasonably in doing so. If they fail to do so, they may be held responsible for the customer's injuries."
