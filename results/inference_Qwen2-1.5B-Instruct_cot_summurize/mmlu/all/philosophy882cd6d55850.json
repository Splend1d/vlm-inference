Therefore, option A (fanatics) seems like it could fit.\n\nOption B (amoralists) suggests that these people prioritize moral principles over personal gain or interest, which is also possible. However, it's less clear how this would apply specifically to endorsing idealism without concern for personal interests.\n\nOption C (immoralists) and D (maniacs) do not seem applicable based on the given information. \n\nSo, without additional context, my answer is most likely A (fanatics)."
