This may involve economic sanctions and withholding weaponry deals, which undermines the state's ability to pay or supply the army which increases the risk of army disaffection and possible coups.\nB. Weak states are threatened by the proliferation of small arms which can be used in a challenge to the authority of the state. Small and light weapons are purchasable through legal and illegal channels and are prevalent in regions with warlords, criminals and private militias.\nC. Weak states cannot remain isolated from processes of globalization. Increasingly porous borders lead to migration and immigration. In order to compete in a globalized market weak states look to secure financial-credit assistance or aid from international institutions. However, these processes undermine the hegemonic idea of the state and societal identity is blurred which makes it difficult for the state to sustain its ideological appeal.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Powerful states may use diplomatic pressures to ensure compliance with international norms, such as economic sanctions and withholding of weaponry deals, which can weaken the state's economy and military capabilities, increasing the risk of coup attempts.\n\n2. The proliferation of small arms poses a threat to the authority of the state. Small and lightweight weapons can easily be acquired through legal and illegal means, making them accessible to individuals who may seek to challenge the state's power.\n\n3. Weak states often find themselves at odds with processes of globalization, leading to increased migration and immigration. While this can provide opportunities for the state to gain financial credit assistance or aid from international institutions, it also challenges the idea of sovereignty and societal identity, making it difficult for the state to maintain its ideological appeal.\n\n4. Additionally, porous borders increase the likelihood of smuggling, which can undermine the security of a state and make it vulnerable to external threats. Furthermore, globalization has led to an interconnected world where any act of aggression against one nation could have consequences far beyond its borders. \n\nTherefore, all of these factors contribute to the challenge that weak states face externally."
