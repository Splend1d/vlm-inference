Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. In 2010, the farmer wanted to move back to the tract because he desired to return to the country. Finding the man in possession, the farmer initiated a suit in ejectment against the man. The most probable judicial determination would be\n\nA. the farmer would lose, because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous.\nB. the farmer would lose, because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.\nC. the farmer would win, because the man's possession was not continuous.\nD. the farmer would win, because he is the titleholder of record.\n"

If the possessor has fulfilled these requirements, they will prevail in court even if they did not have the legal right to occupy the property at the time they began occupying it (i.e., if they acquired the property by inheritance or gift, rather than by adverse possession). \n\nIn this scenario, since the man's possession of the property was open, hostile, and continuous, he has satisfied the statutory requirements for adverse possession. Therefore, the judge is more likely to rule in favor of the farmer in 2010 when the farmer seeks to reclaim the property."
