Intrinsic motivation is the most effective for encouraging positive behaviors to persist over long periods of time. \n\nIntrinsic motivation comes from internal sources, such as personal interests and values, rather than external rewards or punishments. When individuals engage in activities that they find interesting and fulfilling, they are more likely to maintain those behaviors over time.\n\nSecondary drives refer to external factors that motivate behavior, such as competition or fear of failure. While these can be motivating at times, they do not provide sustained motivation over the long term.\n\nPrimary drives are also important for motivation, but they tend to fade quickly once an individual achieves their goals. Achievement motivation is another type of drive that can motivate people to continue performing well, but it does not sustain motivation over the long term.\n\nOverall, intrinsic motivation is the strongest motivator for long-term behavior change."
