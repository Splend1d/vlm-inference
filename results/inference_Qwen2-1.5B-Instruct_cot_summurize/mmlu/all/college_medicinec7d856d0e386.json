Based on the given information, we can infer that the amino acid with the highest frequency (tyrosine) would be located closer to the hydrophobic core of the membrane, while the amino acid with the lowest frequency (isoleucine) would be farther away from the hydrophobic core.\n\nTherefore, the amino acid that is most likely to be inside the transmembrane domain is:\n\nB. Tyrosine\n\nThis is because tyrosine is more likely to be located near the hydrophobic core of the membrane compared to glycine, arginine, or isoleucine."
