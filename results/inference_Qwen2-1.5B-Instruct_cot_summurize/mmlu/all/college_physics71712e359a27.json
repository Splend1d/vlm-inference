The potential energy at the top of the incline is equal to its height times the gravitational acceleration (assuming the incline makes an angle \\(\\theta\\) with respect to the horizontal):\n\n\\[ PE_{top} = mgh = mgR\\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\nTherefore, the final kinetic energy (\\(KE_f\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ KE_f = \\frac{1}{2} I\\omega^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} MR^2 \\cdot \\omega^2 = \\frac{1}{8} mR^2 \\cdot gR\\sin(\\theta)^2 = \\frac{1}{8} mR^4g\\sin^2(\\theta) \\]\n\nTo find the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy, we divide the final kinetic energy by the total kinetic energy:\n\n\\[ \\text{Fraction Rotational Kinetic Energy} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8} mR^4g\\sin^2(\\theta)}{mR^2g\\sin(\\theta)^2 + \\frac{1}{8} mR^4g\\sin^2(\\theta)} = \\frac{1}{9} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. 1/3**."
