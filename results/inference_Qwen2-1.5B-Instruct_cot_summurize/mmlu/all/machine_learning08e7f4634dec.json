The concept of information gain in machine learning refers more specifically to measures used to quantify how much information about the data is gained from splitting a node into smaller subnodes during the process of building a decision tree.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, the answer would be:\n\nB. False, False\n\nThis means both statements are false."
