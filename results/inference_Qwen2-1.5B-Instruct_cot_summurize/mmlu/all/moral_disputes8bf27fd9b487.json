While some may argue that rape can contribute to reinforcing certain social norms or behaviors, it is also possible for individuals to engage in acts of violence without necessarily expressing a specific view on gender roles or the democratic system. Additionally, while rape can certainly be seen as a form of violence against individuals, it is important to recognize that there are many different forms of violence and that not all instances of violence necessarily have a clear or direct impact on societal structures or beliefs.\n\nTherefore, it would be more accurate to say that rape can have a range of impacts depending on various factors such as the context, the circumstances surrounding the act, and the motivations of the perpetrator. It is not fair or accurate to make blanket statements about any single option as being \"the only\" way in which rape can affect society."
