                    "text": "To determine which measure of spread remains unchanged when the tallest student's height is corrected, let's first analyze each option:\n\nA. Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) - The MAD measures the average distance from the mean of a set of data points. When correcting the height of the tallest student, the distances would not change, because they represent the absolute differences between each data point and the mean.\n\nB. Standard Deviation (SD) - The standard deviation measures how far away each data point is from the mean. Correcting the tallest student's height does not affect this measure, as the height of that student has already been accounted for in calculating the SD.\n\nC. Variance - The variance measures how much the data points vary around the mean. Correcting the tallest student's height does not change the variance, as the variance reflects the variation within the data itself, regardless of whether any one value is added or subtracted from the mean.\n\nD. Interquartile Range (IQR) - The IQR is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). It provides information about the dispersion of the middle half of the data. Since the tallest student was mistakenly included at the highest end, their height would be excluded from Q3 calculations. However, including them back in the calculation will not change the IQR since it includes all values equally.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis above, none of the measures of spread (Mean Absolute Deviation, Standard Deviation, Variance, or Interquartile Range) will be affected by correcting the tallest student's height. Each measure represents the spread of the data without regard to individual outliers like the tallest student."
