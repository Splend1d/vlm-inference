This type of behavior goes against the principles of fairness and equality that are considered standard in the United States. \n\nIn scenario 2, throwing knives at another boxer during a fight is a violent and dangerous act that violates the laws of the state where the fight takes place and could result in serious harm to others. This type of behavior is also against the principles of respect for human life and the law, which are considered standard in the United States. Therefore, both actions would be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
