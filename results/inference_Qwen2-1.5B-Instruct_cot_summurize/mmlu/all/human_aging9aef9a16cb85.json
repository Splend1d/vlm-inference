Suppression of the immune system\n\nStress can lead to an overactive immune response, where the body's defenses become too strong and attack healthy cells instead of harmful ones. This can lead to inflammation, infections, and other health problems. Chronic stress can also weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to illness and disease. Therefore, continued stress is damaging to health and longevity by suppressing the immune system."
