All of the above\n\nInternational institutions have been designed to address several key problems that arise from anarchy in international relations, including:\n\n  * War: International institutions such as the United Nations (UN) and other multilateral organizations aim to prevent conflicts and promote peace by mediating disputes, providing humanitarian aid, and promoting disarmament.\n  * Anarchy: International institutions also work to ensure that states act in accordance with agreed-upon rules and norms, which helps to reduce conflict and promote stability.\n  * Collective action and coordination problems: These refer to situations where individuals or groups do not have sufficient incentive to act together due to the presence of external threats or other factors. International institutions provide mechanisms for collective action and coordination, such as trade agreements and sanctions, to help overcome these challenges.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and D are all correct."
