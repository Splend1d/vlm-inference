The orbits would remain unchanged.\n\nThe gravitational force acting on a planet due to the Sun's mass is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of mass (the point at which the gravitational field strength is greatest). If we replace the Sun with a black hole of the same mass, the orbit of each planet will be slightly elongated but not significantly affected. This is because the black hole's gravity still acts through its entire mass, and the planet's orbit around the black hole will be similar to that of a planet orbiting a star of the same mass. Therefore, the planets' orbits would remain mostly circular or slightly elliptical, depending on their initial positions relative to the black hole."
