In this case, we know that the speed of light in water is given by:\n\nv = c/n\n\nwhere v is the speed of light in the water, c is the speed of light in vacuum (which is approximately 299,792 km/s), and n is the index of refraction of the water.\n\nWe also know that the speed of light in water is half the speed of light in air, since the speed of light in water is greater than the speed of light in air but less than the speed of light in water. Therefore, we can write:\n\nc = 2v\n\nSubstituting this into our equation for the speed of light in water gives us:\n\nv = c/(2n) = (299,792 km/s)/(2*4/3) = 299,792 km/s / (8/3) = 299,792 km/s * (3/8) = 109,918 km/s\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is 109,918 km/s, which corresponds to option D."
