International society consists of a constellation of sovereign States and other international organizations, which are dispersed in a rather horizontal order of authority.\n\nThe structure of the international society is not determined by any single factor or system, but rather by a complex interplay of factors such as geography, history, culture, ideology, economic interests, and power dynamics. This makes it difficult to establish a clear and uniform structure for the international society.\n\nHowever, some general patterns and principles can be identified:\n\n1. Sovereignty: Each state has its own government and laws, and is responsible for its own affairs. This gives each state an important role in the international society.\n2. Independence: While states have their own sovereignty, they also have certain obligations to cooperate with others and to respect international law.\n3. Interdependence: The international society is not completely independent of one another; many issues and problems require cooperation and coordination among states.\n4. Divergence: There is a wide range of political systems, ideologies, and values among states, leading to significant differences in how they approach international relations and interact with one another.\n5. Complexity: The international society is made up of many different actors, including states, non-state actors (such as multinational corporations and international organizations), and individuals. This adds complexity to the structure and dynamics of the society."
