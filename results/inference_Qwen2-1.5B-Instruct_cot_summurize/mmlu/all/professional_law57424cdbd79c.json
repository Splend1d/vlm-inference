Midway through the flight, the woman excused herself and went to the restroom. While she was gone, the man rummaged through the woman's purse and stole $100 in cash. Unknown to the man, a flight attendant saw him steal the money. As is customary in such situations, the flight attendant radioed ahead, and police officers arrested the man when the plane landed. The man was subsequently charged with violating an applicable federal larceny statute. During the trial, the prosecuting attorney called the man's wife as a willing witness against her husband. She proposed to testify that the man confided to her that he did steal the woman's money during the flight. The man's attorney objected on the grounds of hearsay and privilege. The wife's proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.\nB. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, though it is not privileged.\nC. inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.\nD. inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

In this case, the wife's proposed testimony would qualify as hearsay if it could be considered relevant to the case and falls within one of the recognized exceptions for admitting hearsay evidence. However, since the wife's testimony does not fall into any of these categories (it does not relate to a statement made by or about a living person, it does not concern the declarant's own personal thoughts or feelings, it does not involve the government or its agents, and it does not come from the witness who observed the event), it cannot be admitted as hearsay evidence. Therefore, the only option left is D: inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception."
