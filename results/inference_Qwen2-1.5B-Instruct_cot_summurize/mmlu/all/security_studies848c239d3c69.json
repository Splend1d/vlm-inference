The securitization of environmental security concerns has raised the profile of environmental security issues among both foreign and domestic security policymakers and agencies. It is now uniformly recognized that environmental change can be considered as an issue of high security politics.\nB. Environmental security has led to a 'trading off' of military security for environmental security with the allocation of resources committed to solving environmental problems. A particular emphasis has been placed on environmental change as the cause of violent conflict and addressing environmental threats from other factors than domestic causes.\nC. The environment has been 'securitized' in the sense that environmental security has been used to make them matters of 'high politics'. This has to some degree raised the profile of critical issues among policymakers and agencies so that the environment can be considered an issue of security. But whilst the issue has been broadened there has been little change in policy and action in terms of the referent object of environmental security.\nD. The national security perspective on environmental issues has undermined the utility of the concept of environmental security. The militarization of environmental problems has decreased the ability of policymakers to 'capture' the critical nature of environmental problems and the environmental dimensions to social vulnerability. The reconciliation of environmental security with national security, and global levels of international change cannot be made without trading in the security interests of the state.\n"

Option A suggests that the securitization of environmental security concerns has raised the profile of environmental security issues among foreign and domestic security policymakers and agencies. It also implies that environmental security is now recognized as an issue of high security politics.\n\nOption B argues that environmental security has led to a \"trading off\" of military security for environmental security, with resources being allocated to solve environmental problems instead of addressing domestic causes of violence.\n\nOption C suggests that the environment has been \"securitized,\" meaning that environmental security has become a matter of \"high politics.\" However, it does not suggest that this has had any impact on policy or action regarding environmental security.\n\nOption D states that the national security perspective on environmental issues has undermined the usefulness of the concept of environmental security, as militarized environmental problems have reduced the ability of policymakers to capture the critical nature of environmental problems and their implications for social vulnerability.\n\nOverall, it seems that the options presented all address different aspects of how the environment has been securitized. None of these options fully capture the complexity and multifaceted nature of the relationship between the environment and security, but they do provide useful insights into different perspectives on the topic."
