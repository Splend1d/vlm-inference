As a result, PACs have lost their ability to influence election outcomes by providing unlimited funds to candidates or campaigns.\n\nIn contrast, direct primary elections allow voters to choose candidates directly, without having to rely on party endorsements or other forms of party influence. Soft-money campaign contributions also limit the influence of wealthy individuals and special interests on election outcomes, as they cannot donate unlimited amounts of money to political campaigns.\n\nVoter registration requirements can also reduce the power of political parties by making it more difficult for them to recruit and mobilize supporters. However, this is not necessarily related to the reduction of political party power, as it is a separate issue that affects all voters equally."
