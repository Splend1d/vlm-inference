The process involves the breakdown of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound), which then enter the Krebs cycle (also called the citric acid cycle) for further energy production. This process can also result in the production of acetyl-CoA, a molecule that enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). \n\nIn summary, glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate or acetyl CoA, which are then used in the TCA cycle for energy production."
