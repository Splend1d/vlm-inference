The defendant's attorney objects.

This exception allows statements made before a declarant could identify himself or herself, the place where he or she was when making the statement, or any other matters within the declarant's personal knowledge to be admitted into evidence without the requirement of authentication or corroboration. In this case, the letter meets the requirements of being made before the defendant and identifying him or herself, so it can be admitted into evidence without the need for authentication or corrobation. However, the defense has the burden of showing that the handwriting matches that of the defendant, which they have not done in this scenario."
