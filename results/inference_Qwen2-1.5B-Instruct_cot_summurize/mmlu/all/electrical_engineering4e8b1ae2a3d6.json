According to Gauss's law, the net outward electric field due to all charges within a closed surface is zero. Therefore, the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube must also be zero.\n\nHowever, you mentioned that the surface charge density is 20 coulombs/m^2, which means that there are 20 Coulombs per square meter on each face of the cube. Since the cube has 6 faces, the total charge enclosed by the cube would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) Coulombs.\n\nTo find the outward electric displacement, we need to know the magnitude of the electric field produced by this charge distribution. However, without knowing the shape or orientation of the cube (i.e., its dimensions), it's not possible to calculate the exact magnitude of the electric field directly from the given information. \n\nGauss's law does not provide enough information to determine the exact outward electric displacement at the surface of the cube. Therefore, option D (none of these) is correct."
