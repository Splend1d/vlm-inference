The allowed transitions between different energy levels are determined by the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator, which for hydrogen is given by:\n\n\\( H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{|r|} \\)\n\nwhere \\( m_e \\) is the mass of an electron, \\( e \\) is the charge of an electron, \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck constant, and \\( \\epsilon_0 \\) is the electric constant.\n\nFor the transition from n = 4 to n = 3, we have:\n\n\\( \\Delta E = E_4 - E_3 = \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{|r|} \\right) |_{n=4} - \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e} \\nabla^2 + \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{|r|} \\right) |_{n=3} \\)\n\nUsing the values of \\( m_e \\), \\( e \\), and \\( \\epsilon_0 \\), we find:\n\n\\( \\Delta E = \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m_e} (\\nabla^2 - \\nabla^2) |_{n=4} \\)\n\nSince \\( \\nabla^2 \\) is zero for any value of \\( n \\), the difference in energies is also zero, meaning there is no allowed transition from n = 4 to n = 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. n = 3, l = 1."
