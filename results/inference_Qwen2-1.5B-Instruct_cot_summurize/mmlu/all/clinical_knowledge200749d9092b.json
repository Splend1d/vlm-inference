Variations in the rate of chest compressions may vary depending on the individual and their specific needs.\n\nHowever, it is generally recommended to deliver chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute for adults, although this can also vary based on factors such as age, weight, and medical condition. It is important to maintain a steady rhythm during CPR and avoid rapid or shallow breathing that could lead to inadequate oxygenation of the brain. Additionally, it is crucial to use proper techniques and ensure that the person being rescued is not suffocating or choking while being attended to by first responders."
