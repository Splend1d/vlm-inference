Glycolysis is being used as a major means of resynthesizing ATP.\n\nGlycolysis is the first step in the process of cellular respiration, and it produces two molecules of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from one molecule of glucose. This process is known as aerobic respiration, which occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. In the absence of oxygen, this process can be continued anaerobically, but only at a much slower rate. \n\nWhen there is an excess of hydrogen ions (protons), they can bind to the electron transport chain within the mitochondria, which then generates ATP through the process of oxidative phosphorylation. This process requires the use of oxygen, so when oxygen levels are low or absent, such as during exercise or in certain diseases like diabetes, the body may rely more heavily on anaerobic glycolysis, leading to the production of even more hydrogen ions and increased ATP production."
