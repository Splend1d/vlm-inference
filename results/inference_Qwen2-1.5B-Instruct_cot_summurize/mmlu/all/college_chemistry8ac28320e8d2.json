This is because sulfur is an element that forms covalent bonds with other elements, and therefore does not readily form Lewis acids.\n\nAmong the others:\n\n- BeCl2: Be is a metalloid, so it can act as a Lewis base.\n- MgCl2: Mg is a transition metal, so it can act as a Lewis base.\n- ZnCl2: Zn is a metal, so it can act as a Lewis base.\n  \nSo the answer is D. SCl2."
