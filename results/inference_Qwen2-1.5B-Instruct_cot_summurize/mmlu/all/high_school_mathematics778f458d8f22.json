We want to find the remainder when the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by $4$.\n\nWe start with the first few terms of the sequence:\n\n- $F_1 = 1$\n- $F_2 = 1$\n- $F_3 = 2$\n- $F_4 = 3$\n- $F_5 = 5$\n- $F_6 = 8$\n\nAt this point, we see that the sequence starts repeating every $6$ terms: $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8$. This means that the remainder when the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term is divided by $4$ will also be the same as the remainder when the $6^{\\text{th}}$ term is divided by $4$.\n\nSo, we need to find the remainder when $F_{100}$ is divided by $4$. Since the sequence repeats every $6$ terms, we only need to consider the remainder when $F_{100}$ is divided by $6$.\n\nFrom our table, we can see that $F_6 = 8$, so the remainder when $F_{100}$ is divided by $6$ is $4$.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is divided by $4$ is $\\boxed{4}$."
