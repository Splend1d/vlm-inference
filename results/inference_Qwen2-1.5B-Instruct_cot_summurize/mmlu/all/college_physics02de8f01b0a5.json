In other words, it measures how much electric charge flows through a particular cross-sectional area over time.\n\nWhen we talk about the magnetic flux through a surface, we refer to the total number of magnetic field lines passing through that surface. Magnetic flux is typically measured in units of Weber (Wb), which is the same as tesla squared (T\u00b2).\n\nAccording to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, the rate of change of magnetic flux through a surface is directly proportional to the electric displacement current flowing through that surface. This means that if the magnetic flux changes at a certain rate, so does the electric displacement current flowing through the surface."
