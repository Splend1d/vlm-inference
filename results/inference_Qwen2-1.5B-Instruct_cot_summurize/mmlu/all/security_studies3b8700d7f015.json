State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\nB. With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\nC. The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\nD. The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.\n"

However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was a significant increase in transnational crime such as drug trafficking and human smuggling. Governments responded by creating new institutions and policies to combat these crimes, including international agreements like the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNCOT). These institutions aimed to create a global framework for combating transnational crime, but they were often criticized for being too weak or ineffective. As a result, many governments began to adopt a more aggressive stance towards tackling transnational crime, both domestically and internationally. This led to the militarization of law enforcement and the use of military technology and intelligence to address the problem."
