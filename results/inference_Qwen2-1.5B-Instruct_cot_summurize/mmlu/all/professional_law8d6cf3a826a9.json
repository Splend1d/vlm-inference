The grandfather regularly visited his son's home and was aware that the grandson routinely left toys scattered about the house. The son had never warned the grandfather to look out for toys. The grandfather brought an action against his son to recover for his injuries. At trial, after the close of evidence, both the grandfather and the son have moved for judgment as a matter of law as to liability. The jurisdiction has abolished intra-family immunity and applies the traditional rules of landowner liability. What action should the court take?\n\nA. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on negligence.\nB. Deny both motions and submit the case to the jury based on strict liability.\nC. Grant the grandfather's motion, because the son is liable as a matter of law for failing to warn about the risk of toys being left on the floor.\nD. Grant the son's motion, because the son had no duty to warn that the grandson might leave toys on the floor.\n"

This is because the son had a duty to exercise reasonable care in ensuring that the environment was safe for visitors, including the grandfather, and he breached this duty by leaving toys on the floor without warning. Strict liability may apply if there is a legal duty to warn or prevent harm, but in this case, the grandfather did not need to prove any specific act or omission to establish liability. Therefore, the court should deny the son's motion for judgment as a matter of law."
