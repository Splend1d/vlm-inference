The resident hated the idea of the lawyer's office being close to her home. She felt that it meant dangerous criminals were coming and going in her neighborhood. The resident spent a lot of time looking out her window, trying to figure out which people going in and out of the office building were criminals, and imagining what sorts of crimes they had committed. The resident eventually decided that she needed to drive the lawyer out of the neighborhood. She made a telephone call to the lawyer and said, \"You are scum, and so are all of your clients. I know that you're conspiring to commit crimes with all those bad people you represent. The police should arrest you and put you in jail with your clients. \" The lawyer was very upset by what he heard. If the lawyer asserts a claim for defamation against the resident based on the telephone call, he will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the resident's remarks constituted slander per Se.\nB. succeed, because the lawyer found the remarks to be upsetting.\nC. not succeed, because the resident's remarks were a matter of personal opinion rather than statements of fact.\nD. not succeed, because the resident's remarks were not published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff.\n"

Not succeed, because the resident's remarks were a matter of personal opinion rather than statements of fact.\n\nSlander per se occurs when someone makes false statements about another person's character or reputation, causing them to suffer emotional distress. In this case, the resident's comments about the lawyer's activities and the potential harm they pose to her neighborhood do not constitute slander per se because they are not defamatory statements of fact. Instead, they are opinions about the lawyer's professional conduct, which cannot form the basis of a defamation lawsuit unless they are proven to have caused actual harm to the plaintiff.\n\nTherefore, the lawyer would not be able to successfully assert a claim for defamation against the resident based on her phone call."
