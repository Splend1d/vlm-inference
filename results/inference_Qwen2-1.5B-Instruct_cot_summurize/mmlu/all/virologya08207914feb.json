They infect a wide range of domestic animals and so contaminate meat.\n\nPrior to the 21st century, most enteric viruses were thought to be transmitted exclusively through the fecal-oral route, meaning that they could only cause disease in humans and other warm-blooded animals. However, in recent years, scientists have discovered that some enteric viruses can also be transmitted between animals and humans via contaminated food or water. This discovery has led to the recognition of the importance of these viruses as significant pathogens for humans, and has prompted researchers to study them more closely.\n\nOne example of this is the astrovirus family, which includes several strains that can cause gastroenteritis in humans and other mammals. While the astroviruses were previously thought to be confined to animals, recent research has shown that they can also be transmitted from person-to-person via contaminated food and water. This means that the infection risk associated with eating undercooked meat or consuming contaminated water is elevated, especially for those who live or work in areas where there is high transmission of the virus. \n\nTherefore, the discovery of the astrovirus family and its ability to spread between animals and humans has made it clear that these viruses should not be overlooked as potential sources of human illness."
