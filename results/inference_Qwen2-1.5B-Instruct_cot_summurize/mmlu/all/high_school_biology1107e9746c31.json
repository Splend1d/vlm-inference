Characteristics acquired during an organism's life are generally not passed on through genes.\nB. Spontaneous mutations can result in the appearance of new traits.\nC. Only favorable adaptations have survival value.\nD. Disuse of an organ may lead to its eventual disappearance.\n"

Spontaneous mutations can result in the appearance of new traits.\n\nThis statement addresses the idea that organisms do not pass on all characteristics they acquire during their lifetime because some of these characteristics may arise spontaneously due to genetic mutations. This means that some traits might be present in the offspring but not necessarily inherited from the parent, which could explain why the student observed the giraffe's offspring having longer necks."
