The constitutionality of the line-item veto depends on the interpretation of the specific provision at issue.\n\nIf the line-item veto is interpreted as giving the president power to veto only those parts of a bill that conflict with his constitutional duties or actions, then the provision may be considered constitutional under certain circumstances. However, if the line-item veto is interpreted as giving the president power to veto any part of a bill, regardless of whether it conflicts with his constitutional duties or actions, then the provision may be considered unconstitutional.\n\nIn general, the Constitution grants the president broad powers, including the ability to veto bills, but these powers are subject to constitutional limitations. Therefore, it is possible for the line-item veto to be deemed unconstitutional based on its interpretation and scope."
