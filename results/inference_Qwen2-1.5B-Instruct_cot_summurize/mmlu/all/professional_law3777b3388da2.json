As a condition of the loan, a majority shareholder in the company agreed in writing to personally guarantee the loan. Thereafter, the company defaulted on the loan and entered into a repayment agreement with the bank. This agreement provided that the bank would \"use maximum efforts in selling the company's assets at the highest possible price. \" The bank proceeded to sell the company's assets, discharging the indebtedness of the widget company. Later, it was ascertained that the bank did not realize the \"highest possible price\" in administering the sale of the company's assets. Consequently, the shareholder was forced into bankruptcy and lost her entire investment in the company. The shareholder brings an appropriate action against the bank to recover her investment in the company.

The shareholder will most likely prevail because the bank did not realize the highest possible price from the sale of the company's assets, which constitutes a breach of its fiduciary duty to the shareholder under the terms of the contract between the bank and the company.\n\nIn general, when a borrower defaults on a loan, the lender has several options:\n\n1. Repurchase the collateral: If the lender believes that the borrower can pay back the loan, they may offer to buy back the collateral. In this case, the lender would have the right to purchase the collateral and retain ownership of it.\n\n2. Foreclose: If the lender cannot agree to repurchase the collateral or if the borrower does not have the ability to repay the loan, the lender may file for foreclosure. During the foreclosure process, the lender would have the right to take possession of the collateral and sell it at public auction.\n\n3. Sell the collateral directly: If the lender chooses not to pursue either option (repurchase or foreclosure), they may choose to sell the collateral themselves. In this case, the lender would be acting as a buyer-seller, rather than a lender-creditor.\n\nIn this case, the bank sold the company's assets without realizing the highest possible price, which constitutes a breach of its fiduciary duty to the shareholder under the terms of the contract between the bank and the company. Therefore, the shareholder has the right to sue the bank for damages resulting from the breach of the fiduciary duty."
