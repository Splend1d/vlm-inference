Knotweed is not an important component of Hopewell subsistence, but rather a plant that can be found in many parts of the world and has various uses such as food, medicine, and construction materials. The Hopewell people were known for their agricultural practices and domestication of plants like corn (maize), beans, and squash, which were all staples of their diet. Sunflowers were also cultivated by the Hopewell people for their seeds, which were used to make oil and flour."
