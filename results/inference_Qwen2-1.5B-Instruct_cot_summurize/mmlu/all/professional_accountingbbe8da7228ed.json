                    "text": "To calculate Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate Greene's share of the ordinary loss: The ordinary loss reported by Seagull is $5,000. Since Greene is the sole shareholder, he will also be responsible for this loss.\n2. Determine the amount of capital loss that can be carried forward: To determine how much capital loss can be carried forward, we subtract the amount of ordinary losses from the total capital loss carryforward limit. The capital loss carryforward limit is $35,000 ($25,000 - $10,000).\n3. Calculate Greene's share of the municipal bond interest: The municipal bond interest reported by Seagull is $2,000. This is not related to Greene's basis in Seagull, so it does not affect his calculation.\n4. Calculate Greene's share of the distributions: On November 1, Seagull distributed cash of $6,000 to Greene. This distribution is considered taxable income for Greene, as it represents the receipt of cash from Seagull.\n\nLet's calculate Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year based on these calculations:\n\n1. Ordinary Loss:\n   $5,000 (ordinary loss) + $2,000 (municipal bond interest) = $7,000\n\n2. Capital Loss Carryforward Limit:\n   $35,000 (total capital loss carryforward limit) - $7,000 (ordinary loss) = $28,000\n\n3. Distribution:\n   $6,000 (distribution) * 1/2 (since it's divided equally between the two shareholders)\n\nThe distribution is considered taxable income for Greene, but since it is only one half of the distribution, we'll multiply it by 1/2 instead of 1 to account for the fact that he only received half of the cash distribution.\n\n$6,000 * 1/2 = $3,000\n\nNow, let's add up all the amounts:\n\n$7,000 (ordinary loss) + $28,000 (capital loss carryforward limit) + $3,000 (distributions) = $38,000\n\nSince the basis in Seagull at the beginning of the year was $15,000, and the total value of Seagull at the end of the year is $38,000, Greene's basis in Seagull at the end of the year would be:\n\n$38,000 (end-of-the-year value) - $15,000 (beginning-of-the-year value) = $23,000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. $14,000**."
