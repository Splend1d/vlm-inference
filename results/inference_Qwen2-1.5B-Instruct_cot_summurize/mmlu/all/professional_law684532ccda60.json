In a dark alley, a defendant approached the victim and said, \"Give me the gold ring on your finger or I'll shoot you with this gun. \" The victim gave him the ring. However, the ring really belonged to someone else, as the victim was just borrowing it for the evening to impress his girlfriend. In addition, the gun that the defendant had in his possession was really a water pistol.\nB. A defendant broke into a house and took a stereo system. After he had placed the system in his car and was about to leave, the homeowner came home and saw him. She raced to the car and started to hit the defendant through the open window in an attempt to get her stereo back. The defendant punched her in the nose and drove away with the system.\nC. A defendant was walking behind a shopper in a mall when he suddenly reached for her gold chain, pulled it from her neck, and ran away into the crowd. The shopper suffered a slight cut on her neck where the chain broke.\nD. A defendant picked the lock on an apartment door. The noise startled the tenant, who had been sleeping. The defendant overpowered the tenant, tied him up, and forced him to disclose where he kept his money. The tenant told the defendant to look in the kitchen cabinet, which he did. The defendant found $120 in cash, took the money, and left the apartment.\n"

This does not meet the requirement of force being used against the person to obtain property.\n\nFor situation B, the defendant's actions were justified since the owner had no legal right to the stereo system. The defendant's use of force was necessary to prevent the theft of the property.\n\nFor situation C, there is no evidence of force or threat involved in the incident. The defendant's actions were entirely voluntary and non-coercive.\n\nFor situation D, the defendant's actions were also justified since the tenant had no right to the money found in the kitchen cabinet. The defendant's use of force was necessary to protect himself and his property."
