A relative date refers to a year or a range of years, while an absolute date indicates a chronological order.\n\nAn absolute date refers to a specific point in time that cannot be changed, such as a birthdate or death date. It is based on historical records, scientific evidence, or other reliable sources. Examples of absolute dates include birthdates, death dates, and anniversaries.\n\nOn the other hand, a relative date is used to indicate a specific period of time within a larger timeline. It can range from 100 years to several thousand years, depending on the context. Examples of relative dates include the age of a building, the duration of a war, or the number of generations passed since a particular event.\n\nIn summary, an absolute date provides a fixed reference point in time, whereas a relative date indicates a range of time within a broader context."
