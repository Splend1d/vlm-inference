This means that we can still see the same object, regardless of how it is moving or changing its position.\n\nIn this scenario, as you walk around the statue and examine it from different angles, your retinas (the light-sensitive layers of cells in your eye) will not change. However, since you are perceiving multiple viewpoints at once, your brain processes these different perspectives and combines them into a single image. This process allows you to perceive the statue as a whole, rather than individual parts, which is why you do not perceive any changes in the statue's appearance."
