The shape is approximately normal with a mean of 210 and a standard deviation of 3.75.\n\nThis is because the given information about the mean (210 mg/dL) and standard deviation (15 mg/dL) indicates that the data are normally distributed. When drawing samples from this population, the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal as well, with a mean equal to the population mean (210 mg/dL) and a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (in this case, 16). This gives us a standard deviation of approximately 3.75 mg/dL."
