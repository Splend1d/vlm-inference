The wife obtained a divorce from the husband after learnitg that he was engaging in an extramarital love affair with one of his co-workers. Following the divorce, the husband was arrested and charged with embezzling funds from his employer during a two- year period. In preparing for trial, the prosecuting attorney interviewed the wife, who stated that during their marriage, the husband admitted committing the embezzlement. This jurisdiction has adopted both the common-law marital and spousal privileges. At the husband's trial, the wife is called to testify regarding statements the husband made to her during the marriage regarding commission of the crime. Upon objection by the husband's attorney, the wife's testimony will be\n\nA. admissible, under both the marital and spousal privileges.\nB. admissible, under the spousal privilege but not admitted under the marital privilege.\nC. admissible, under the marital privilege but not admitted under the spousal privilege.\nD. inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges.\n"

However, this privilege does not apply to communications between spouses about personal matters like extramarital affairs.\n\nIn contrast, the spousal privilege allows communications between spouses about personal matters to be protected from disclosure if the communication was made during a marriage. If the communication was made outside of the marriage, it would be admissible against the spouse making the statement.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, since the statements were made during the marriage, they fall within the scope of the spousal privilege and are admissible. But since the statements were also made about the crime of embezzlement, which falls outside the scope of the spousal privilege, they cannot be used against the wife at her trial."
