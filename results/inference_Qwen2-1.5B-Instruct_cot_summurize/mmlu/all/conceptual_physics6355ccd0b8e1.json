This causes the time dilation effect, where the perceived duration of an event changes based on the velocity and the observer's motion relative to that event.\n\nFor example, if the spaceship were traveling at 0.8 times the speed of light (which would be quite close to the speed of light), it would take approximately 13 hours for a clock on the spaceship to tick through one rotation. For someone on Earth looking out their window, this would seem to happen over a much shorter period, perhaps only a few minutes.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Inside the spaceship. The clocks there would indeed appear to move slower than those on Earth."
