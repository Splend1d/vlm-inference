Priority queuing. \n\nPriority queuing ensures that jobs with higher priority receive more immediate attention, which prevents starvation from occurring in any given queue. This approach does not guarantee that no job will wait indefinitely for service, but it can help reduce the likelihood of such situations occurring. The other options (Round-robin, Shortest Job First, and Youngest Job First) do not have this property."
