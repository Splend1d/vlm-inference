Elongated states\n\nElongated states, such as the United States or China, have longer borders that allow for more varied climates and resources to be found within their territory. This is because they span multiple time zones and have different elevations and topography, which can affect the types of plants and animals that live in each region. Additionally, elongated states often have access to natural resources like oil, minerals, and waterways that may not be available in smaller states."
