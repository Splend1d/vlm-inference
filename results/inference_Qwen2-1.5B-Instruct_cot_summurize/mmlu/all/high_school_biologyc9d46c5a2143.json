The number of chromosomes is reduced.\n\nMeiosis is the process by which sex cells (sperm or egg) are produced from haploid (having one set of chromosomes) somatic cells. During meiosis, each homologous chromosome pairs up with its corresponding partner and separates into different daughter cells. This results in half the number of chromosomes in each gamete compared to the parent cell. Therefore, the number of chromosomes is indeed reduced during meiosis. \n\nOption A is incorrect because daughter cells are not genetically identical to the parent cells. \n\nOption B is partially correct but not entirely accurate. While homologous chromosomes do pair up during prophase II, this does not mean that they will be separated during metaphase II or anaphase II. \n\nOption C is also incorrect because DNA replication occurs both before and after meiosis I and meiosis II. DNA replication starts immediately after cell division and continues until it reaches the end of the cell cycle. After meiosis, DNA replication resumes, allowing for further cell division."
