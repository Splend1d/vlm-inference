The body uses up stored glycogen for energy and this process can be slowed down by a high-fat diet. This means that the body has less glycogen available for use when it needs to run longer distances, leading to a decline in power output as the glycogen stores get depleted.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct. The other options do not accurately describe the relationship between maximum sustainable power and factors like diet, distance of the race, or muscle glycogen content."
