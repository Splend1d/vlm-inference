He was subsequently convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute narcotics. Following his conviction, the drug dealer was sentenced to a prison term of 10 years. After being sentenced, the drug dealer's attorney appealed the conviction, citing jury misconduct. While his appeal was pending, the drug dealer was then indicted by both a federal and a state grand jury for conspiracy to distribute the same cocaine. The drug dealer's attorney filed motions to dismiss each of the new indictments on the grounds that they violate double jeopardy. In all likelihood, double jeopardy requires the dismissal of\n\nA. both indictments.\nB. the state indictment, but not the federal indictment.\nC. the federal indictment, but not the state indictment.\nD. neither of the indictments.\n"

Both indictments must be dismissed.\n\nUnder the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, no person may be twice put upon trial for the same offense. This clause prevents a defendant from being retried for the same crime by two different courts or tribunals within the same jurisdiction. In this case, the drug dealer was already convicted in state court of possession with intent to distribute narcotics and sentenced to a prison term of 10 years. Therefore, he cannot be tried again for the same offense in either state or federal court. If the prosecutor were to try him again, it would be considered an attempt to violate the Double Jeopardy Clause."
