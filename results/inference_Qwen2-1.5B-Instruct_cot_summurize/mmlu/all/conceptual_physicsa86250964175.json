The sine of an angle is equal to the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse, so in this case, the sine of 45 degrees (which is half of \u03c0/4 radians) is equal to the ratio of the vertical component (force) to the magnitude of the force.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nsin(45\u00b0) = Force / Magnitude of Force\n\nPlugging in the values given for the force and the angle:\n\nsin(45\u00b0) = 10N / Magnitude of Force\n\nSince sin(45\u00b0) = 1/sqrt(2), we can solve for the magnitude of the force as follows:\n\nForce = 10N * sqrt(2)\n\nSimplifying further:\n\nForce \u2248 10N * 1.414\nForce \u2248 14.14N\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided. However, if you were asked which option best approximates the magnitude of the force, the closest would be C. 10 N. \n\nIf you meant what I think you meant, then the correct answer would be B. 5 N. Since the horizontal component of the force is simply the cosine of the angle times the magnitude of the force, it would be 1/sqrt(2) * 10N = 5N."
