Impact Craters: Venus is known to have numerous impact craters, indicating that it was once much more active in terms of asteroid impacts than it is today.\n2. Erosion: The lack of a significant atmosphere on Venus means that erosion by wind and water is not a significant factor in shaping its surface. However, the presence of large impact craters suggests that there may have been other erosive agents at one point in the past.\n3. Volcanism: While Venus does not have any confirmed volcanoes like Earth or Mars, some scientists suggest that it could have had volcanic activity in the past. This is based on the presence of lava flows and volcanic ash on the planet's surface.\n\nTherefore, D) A B and C (Impacts, Erosion, Volcanism) is correct."
