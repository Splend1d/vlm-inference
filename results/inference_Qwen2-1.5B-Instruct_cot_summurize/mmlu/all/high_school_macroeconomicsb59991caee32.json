Decrease the interest rate, increase private investment, increase aggregate demand, and increase domestic output.\n\nThis type of monetary policy is known as expansionary monetary policy, which aims to stimulate economic growth by lowering interest rates and encouraging borrowing and spending. This can be done through various means such as increasing reserve requirements for banks or buying government securities in the open market to lower short-term interest rates. This policy has been used historically during recessions to boost economic activity and create jobs."
