By observing these small shifts in the star's spectrum, astronomers can detect the presence of exoplanets and estimate their masses and distances from their parent stars. This technique has been incredibly successful in discovering numerous exoplanets orbiting within the habitable zones of their parent stars, where conditions may be suitable for life."
