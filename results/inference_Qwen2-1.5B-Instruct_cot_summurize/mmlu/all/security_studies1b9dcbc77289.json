A process of securitization is when an issue not included in the political sphere becomes politicized and is managed within the political system. A securitized issue is part of public policy requiring governmental action; decision-making, resource allocation and even communal governance.\nB. A securitizing actor can argue for an issue to be securitised when it is outside of the political domain. An existential threat can be made a matter for state attention even when it is not included within public debate. Securitization refers to the recognition of the threat prior to its emergence in the political process.\nC. Securitization refers to the move of issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain of decision-making activities. Once placed above the political sphere it cannot be returned to the public sphere, having been translated into a state interest above normal proceedings.\nD. An issue can be securitized, that is framed as a security question, when it is moved from the politicized to the securitized sphere. During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.\n"

During the securitization process, the securitizing actor(s) use discourse to persuade an audience that the issue at hand is one of urgency and priority, and that it presents an existential threat to some referent object.\n\nSecuritization involves recognizing an issue as a matter of national security or public safety, which allows the government to take actions that would otherwise be considered unconstitutional or against democratic norms. This process can involve framing the issue in terms of threats to national security, public order, or social stability, and using this framing to gain support for policy changes or military interventions.\n\nSecuritization can also involve the creation of new institutions or agencies to manage the issue, such as the National Security Council or the Department of Homeland Security. These institutions may have their own rules and procedures, and they can become central to the way the issue is managed and debated.\n\nOverall, securitization is a complex and controversial process that can involve many different actors and stakeholders, and it often involves a balance between the need to address urgent issues and the constraints imposed by democratic principles and legal norms."
