In other words, if \\(p(x)\\) is an irreducible polynomial, then for every integer \\(a\\), there exists no integer polynomial \\(q(x)\\) such that \\(p(x) = q(x) \\cdot r(x)\\), where \\(r(x)\\) is also an integer polynomial.\n\nFor the polynomial \\(4x - 2\\), it's easy to see that it has at least two divisors:\n\n- It divides \\(0\\): \\(4x - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 1/2\\)\n- It divides \\(2\\): \\(4x - 2 = 2 \\Rightarrow x = 1/2 + 1 = 3/2\\)\n\nThus, \\(4x - 2\\) can be factored as a linear polynomial, not just as a constant multiple of another polynomial. Therefore, statement 1 is false.\n\n### Statement 2: \\(4x - 2\\) is irreducible over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)\n\nThe rational numbers (\\(Q\\)) form a field, which means that any non-zero element can be expressed as a ratio of integers. If \\(p(x)\\) is an irreducible polynomial over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), then it must be a factorization of some integer. However, this implies that \\(4x - 2\\) could be factored as a linear polynomial, contradicting our previous conclusion.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is also false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth statements are false. The correct answer is **D. False, True**."
