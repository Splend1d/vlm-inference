One gram of glucose: Glucose (also known as glycogen) is a type of carbohydrate that is stored in the liver and muscles as a form of energy. When consumed or broken down, glucose produces energy through a process called glycolysis.\n- B. One gram of palmitic acid: Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid that is found in animal fats and oils. When palmitic acid is consumed or metabolized by the body, it does not produce significant amounts of energy because it is not easily converted into usable forms of energy.\n- C. One gram of leucine: Leucine is an amino acid that is used for protein synthesis and muscle repair. It is not a primary source of energy but can be used as fuel during exercise.\n- D. One gram of alcohol: Alcohol (also known as ethanol) is a type of organic compound that contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. When alcohol is consumed or metabolized by the body, it is broken down into acetaldehyde and water, which then undergoes a series of chemical reactions to produce more acetaldehyde and eventually water. The production of acetaldehyde is what gives alcohol its intoxicating effects, but it does not directly provide energy.\n\nTherefore, the option that releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body is A. One gram of glucose."
