Most trainees have improved, but relative standing is generally maintained.\n\nThis option reflects that while some individuals might have shown improvement in their skills or knowledge during the training program, others may not have progressed as much. Therefore, there would still be a variation in performance levels among the trainees, which would be expected given the diverse backgrounds and starting points of the participants. The management team should aim for maintaining the overall quality and effectiveness of the training program by focusing on providing continuous support and opportunities for professional development rather than expecting everyone to perform at the same level."
