A random sample of 20 employees was taken and their salaries recorded. A 95 percent t-confidence interval for the mean salary of the county school system employees is ($15,360, $32,470). The t-confidence interval is not appropriate in this situation because\n\nA. the sample size is too small compared to the number of employees in the system to give a fair representation\nB. the skewed salary distribution tells us that assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied\nC. the population standard deviation of the salaries of employees of this county school system is not known\nD. the teacher salaries are not negotiable, but the superintendent\u2019s salary is negotiable, so the superintendent\u2019s salary should be excluded from the population sampled\n"

This can lead to inaccurate confidence intervals when using normal distribution assumptions. Therefore, it is important to use alternative methods such as bootstrapping or non-parametric tests when dealing with skewed distributions."
