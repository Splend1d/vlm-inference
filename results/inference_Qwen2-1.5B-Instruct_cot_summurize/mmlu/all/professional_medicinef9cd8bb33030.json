The headaches are moderately severe, are present when he awakens in the morning, and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. He tells you he was promoted to an upper-level managerial position in his accounting firm about 8 months ago, which necessitated relocating. Physical examination now discloses no abnormalities except for blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Begin a trial of a \u03b2-blocking medication\nB. Order CT scan of the head\nC. Order EEG\nD. Refer him for consultation with a neurologist\n"

Refer him for consultation with a neurologist\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of tension-type headache, which is commonly associated with stress and work-related factors. A referral to a neurologist would be appropriate as they have expertise in diagnosing and treating neurological conditions. An EEG (Electroencephalogram) may also be ordered if there is suspicion of any underlying brain disorders such as epilepsy or migraine. However, without further evaluation, starting a trial of a beta-blocker would not be indicated at this stage."
