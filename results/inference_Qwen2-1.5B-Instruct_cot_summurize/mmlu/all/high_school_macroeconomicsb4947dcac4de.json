Overestimate the inflation rate.\n\nWhen products improve in quality, it typically leads to an increase in the overall price level of goods and services, which would cause the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to rise. This rise in the CPI would be reflected in the overestimation of the inflation rate by the government's official measure of inflation, such as the Producer Price Index (PPI). However, this does not necessarily mean that the CPI will automatically increase or become negative; rather, it depends on how much the prices of goods and services have increased relative to each other. If the price increases for certain types of goods and services are smaller than those for others, then the CPI may actually decrease instead of increasing."
