Globalisation\n\nGlobalization refers to the increasing integration of global markets, economies, and societies through processes such as international trade, capital flows, and technology transfer. It involves the movement of goods, services, people, information, and ideas across national borders, often facilitated by advances in transportation, communication, and information technology.\n\nIn terms of international trade, it can be said that there is a degree of competition between countries due to the need for businesses to compete with each other on a global scale. This competition can lead to increased prices or lower quality standards in certain industries, as companies strive to gain an advantage over their competitors. However, globalization also includes cooperation and collaboration among nations, as well as the sharing of resources and knowledge, which can help to reduce barriers to trade and economic growth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Globalisation."
