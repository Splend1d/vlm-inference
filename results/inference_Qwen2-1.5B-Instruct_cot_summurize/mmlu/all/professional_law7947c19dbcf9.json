On cross- examination of the pedestrian's physician, the defendant's attorney asked him whether or not the pedestrian had told him that the leg that she claimed was injured had been permanently stiff as a result of a former field hockey injury the pedestrian suffered in high school. Upon objection by the pedestrian's attorney, the trial judge should\n\nA. sustain the objection, as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nB. sustain the objection, as violative of the physician-patient privilege.\nC. overrule the objection, as a statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\nD. overrule the objection, as a statement against interest.\n"

Overrule the objection, as a statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.\n\nThis is because the statement made by the physician was made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment, and therefore falls under the category of a statement made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment, which is protected by the physician-patient privilege. The exception to this rule is if the statement is made without the patient's consent, but in this case, it appears that the statement was made with the patient's consent.\n\nAdditionally, the statement was made during the course of the patient's medical care, which further supports the protection of the physician-patient privilege. Finally, the statement was made in connection with the diagnosis or treatment of the patient's condition, which again supports the protection of the physician-patient privilege.\n\nTherefore, the trial judge should overrule the objection and allow the statement to be presented in court."
