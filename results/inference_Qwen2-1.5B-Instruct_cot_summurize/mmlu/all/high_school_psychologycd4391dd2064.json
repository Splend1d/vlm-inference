Hierarchy of needs\n\nThe hierarchy of needs is an approach proposed by Abraham Maslow, which suggests that certain basic human needs must be satisfied before higher-level needs can be addressed. These five levels include:\n\n1. Physiological needs (food, water, shelter)\n2. Safety needs (security, protection from harm)\n3. Love and belonging needs (social connection with others)\n4. Esteem needs (self-respect and recognition)\n5. Self-actualization needs (personal growth and fulfillment)\n\nMaslow believed that these needs are prioritized differently for different individuals based on their unique life experiences and circumstances, but they all play a crucial role in our overall well-being."
