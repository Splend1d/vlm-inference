I and III only. \n\nSymbolic culture refers to the use of symbols, such as language, art, music, dance, religion, etc., to transmit knowledge and ideas across generations. In I, a macaque monkey learns how to rinse off food by observing its mother, who has already done this. This is an example of learning through imitation, which is part of the symbolic culture of animals. In II, a child learns the rules of baseball from their parents or other adults, which helps them develop skills and knowledge about the game. This is also an example of learning through imitation, but it does not involve symbolic culture. In III, a group of inductees in a military organization experiences hazing rituals from older students, which they later carry out on new recruits. This is an example of learning through imitation, but it involves a more direct form of cultural transmission rather than symbolic culture. Therefore, only I and III do not involve the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture."
