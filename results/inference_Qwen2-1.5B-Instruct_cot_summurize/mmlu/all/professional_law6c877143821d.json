No, because it is substantially more prejudicial than probative.\n\nThe jail employee's testimony may be considered to be circumstantial evidence that the defendant was one of the kidnappers, but it is also highly prejudicial. If the jury believes the testimony of the jail employee and the victim, they may conclude that the defendant kidnapped the victim based solely on their relationship with the jail employee, without considering any other evidence or eyewitness accounts. This could lead to an unfair trial and result in a conviction that may later be overturned on appeal. Therefore, the testimony should not be admitted."
