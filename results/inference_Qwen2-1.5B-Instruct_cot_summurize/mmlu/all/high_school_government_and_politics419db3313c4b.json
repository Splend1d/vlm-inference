A pocket veto\n\nIf Congress passes legislation and declares a recess, but the president takes no action on the bill within ten days of its passage, this situation is known as a \"pocket veto.\" The president's failure to act within the given time frame results in the bill being automatically vetoed by the president. This means that the legislation cannot be signed into law unless the president acts on it within the required timeframe or until Congress reconvenes.\n\nIn contrast, other options such as a line-item veto (where the president can veto specific parts of a bill), an adjournment (a temporary suspension of legislative activity), and a writ of certiorari (an order from the Supreme Court directing a lower court to take a case) do not apply in this scenario because they involve actions taken after the initial legislation has already been passed and declared recessed."
