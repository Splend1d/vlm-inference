Let G be an abelian group of order 72 = 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nBy the Sylow Theorems:\n\n1. There exists a Sylow 3-subgroup P of order 3^2 = 9.\n2. There exists a Sylow 2-subgroup Q of order 2^3 = 8.\n\nThe number of Sylow subgroups is congruent to 1 mod p for each prime factor p of |G| and divides |G|. In this case, there must be at least one Sylow 3-subgroup and one Sylow 2-subgroup. Therefore, the number of Sylow subgroups is either 1 (if both exist) or 2 (if one exists).\n\nIf there's only one Sylow 3-subgroup, then it is normal in G. If there's two Sylow 3-subgroups, they cannot be conjugate because their orders are relatively prime (since their orders are 9 and 8). This means that G has a unique structure as a direct product of its Sylow subgroups: P x Q.\n\nSo, there are 2 possibilities:\n\n- One Sylow 3-subgroup and one Sylow 2-subgroup:\nIn this case, G would have 2 structures: P x Q and P x Q' (where Q' is another Sylow 2-subgroup).\n- Two Sylow 3-subgroups:\nThis gives us a total of 4 possible structures: P x Q, P x Q', P x Q'' (where Q'' is another Sylow 2-subgroup), and P x Q''' (where Q''' is yet another Sylow 2-subgroup).\n\nTherefore, there are 4 structurally distinct Abelian groups with order 72. \n\nHence, the correct answer is A. 4."
