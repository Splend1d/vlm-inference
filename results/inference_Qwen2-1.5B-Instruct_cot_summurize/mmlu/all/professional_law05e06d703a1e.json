Two months after completion of the work, the company sued the city for its failure to pay under the terms of the contract. At trial, the company's construction supervisor who personally oversaw all the repair work was called to testify. He sought to testify about the amount of sewer pipe used, the number of hours required to complete the job, and the number of workers employed by the company during the construction repair work. The defendant's attorney objected on the grounds that the company routinely recorded such factual information in their log books, which were in the company's possession. As a consequence, the supervisor's testimony should be ruled\n\nA. admissible, because it is based on firsthand knowledge.\nB. admissible, because it is a report of regularly conducted business activities.\nC. inadmissible, because such testimony would be violative of the best evidence rule.\nD. inadmissible, because no evidence was introduced to show that the original log records are not available for examination.\n"

Inadmissible, because no evidence was introduced to show that the original log records are not available for examination.\n\nThe fact that the company has access to its own log books does not mean that the supervisor's testimony regarding the amount of sewer pipe used, the number of hours required to complete the job, and the number of workers employed is admissible. Admissibility depends on whether there is competent evidence presented at trial showing that the witness can recall or identify the facts they claim to have observed or heard. In this case, the only evidence offered by the witness is his personal recollection of events that occurred during the construction repair work, but there is no evidence that the supervisor has any way of knowing whether these facts are accurate or reliable. Therefore, the supervisor's testimony is not admissible as it is based solely on the witness's subjective memory and there is no independent verification of the facts he claims to have observed or heard."
