Marfan syndrome can increase the risk of aortic dissection due to its effects on the body's ability to repair blood vessels. Aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation can also contribute to increased risk of aortic dissection. The chest pain described by the patient could be caused by the tearing and radiating nature of the pain, which suggests that the aorta may have been injured during the event. It is important to note that this diagnosis should only be made after thorough evaluation and further testing such as angiography or CT scan."
