                    "text": "The answer is D: because Mars' axis is more tilted than the Earth's.\n\nMars orbits around the Sun with an average period of about 687 Earth days (or 24 hours x 3155/24 = 687), which is slightly longer than that of the Earth, but it is still on a relatively short orbit compared to other planets in our solar system.\n\nMars also has a much smaller axial tilt relative to the Earth than the Earth does, at only about 19 degrees compared to the Earth's 23.5 degrees. This means that Mars experiences significant seasonal changes throughout the year, with each hemisphere experiencing a different set of seasons due to the planet's axial tilt.\n\nAs a result, the northern and southern hemispheres of Mars experience very different climates, with the northern hemisphere being much colder and drier during the winter months and warmer and wetter during the summer months, while the southern hemisphere experiences similar climate conditions throughout the year.\n\nThis is why the seasons in Mars' southern hemisphere are so extreme, with the temperatures ranging from freezing cold in the winter to scorching hot in the summer. The differences between the two hemispheres can be as large as 100 degrees Fahrenheit or more."
