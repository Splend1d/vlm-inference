In general, it is recommended to flush a cannula every 8-12 hours as needed by healthcare professionals.\n\nIt is important to note that flushing a cannula may not always be necessary or appropriate in all cases, and other measures such as sterile technique and proper patient monitoring should be followed. Additionally, if a cannula is used for an extended period of time or has been left in place for an extended period without flushing, it may become clogged with blood clots or bacteria, which can cause serious complications. Therefore, regular flushing of a cannula is crucial to maintain its effectiveness and prevent infections."
