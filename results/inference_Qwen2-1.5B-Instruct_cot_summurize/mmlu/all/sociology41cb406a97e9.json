In the scenario you described, as more people saw the man stop their cars and help, they were likely influenced by this behavior and stopped as well, spreading the same attitude or behavior to others around them. This is an example of contagion. \n\nConvergence, Emergent-norm, and Value-added do not fit the scenario described in your question because:\n\n- Convergence refers to the convergence of ideas or concepts between different groups.\n- Emergent-norm describes the emergence of new norms within a group based on shared experiences or values.\n- Value-added suggests that people add value to something by improving it or adding something to it, which is not applicable here since the behavior being observed is helping rather than adding anything to something.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Contagion."
