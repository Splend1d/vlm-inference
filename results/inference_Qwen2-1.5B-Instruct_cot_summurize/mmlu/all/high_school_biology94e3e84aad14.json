Genetic drift\n\nGenetic drift is a natural process that occurs when individuals die and their genes are lost from the population, resulting in a loss of genetic variation. This can lead to changes in the frequency of alleles over time, even if there is no random mating or mutation occurring within the population. However, genetic drift is more likely to occur in small populations where the effects of natural selection are less pronounced, making it easier for environmental factors to cause changes in allele frequencies."
