However, there are some exceptions for certain medical reasons and under specific circumstances.\n\nIn general, the Church teaches that sexual behavior should be reserved only for married couples within the context of their own union. The Church also emphasizes the importance of abstinence until marriage, unless necessary due to health or other reasons.\n\nIt's important to note that the teachings of the Catholic Church may vary depending on the individual's personal beliefs and interpretations of scripture. It's always best to consult with a priest or religious leader for guidance."
