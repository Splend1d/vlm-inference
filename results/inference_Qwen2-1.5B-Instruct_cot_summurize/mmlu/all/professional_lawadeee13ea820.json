The contractor, in turn, hired a subcontractor to dig the hole and plaster the pooi area. After the subcontractor completed his job, the contractor then hired an electrician to install the heater and wiring for the pool. While the electrician was performing his work, the wiring became disjointed and had to be replaced at a substantial expense to the homeowner. If the homeowner sues the electrician in tort to recover the damages she suffered because of this occurrence, will the homeowner prevail?\n\nA. Yes, if the wiring became disjointed because the electrician's plans departed from established standards in the electrical industry.\nB. No, unless the electrical wiring that became disjointed was defective.\nC. No, if the electrician used his best professional judgment in performing the electrical work.\nD. No, unless the homeowner knew that the contractor had hired the electrician to perform the electrical work.\n"

A defective electrical wire could have caused the injury or damage that the homeowner suffered, which would make the electrician liable for damages under the doctrine of negligence.\n\nHowever, if the homeowner did not know that the contractor had hired the electrician to perform the electrical work, she may still be able to sue the electrician for damages if the wiring was defective but she was unaware of the defect until after the incident occurred. In such cases, the homeowner would need to prove that the electrician was negligent in failing to discover and correct the defect before completing the electrical work."
