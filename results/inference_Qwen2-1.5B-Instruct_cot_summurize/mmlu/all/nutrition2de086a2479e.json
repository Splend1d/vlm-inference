The glycemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly and how much sugar enters the bloodstream after eating a particular type of food. Foods with a high GI will cause a rapid rise in blood sugar levels, while foods with a low GI will cause a slower rise in blood sugar levels. White bread has a GI of around 70, which means it causes a rapid rise in blood sugar levels, while fruits have a lower GI, meaning they cause a slower rise in blood sugar levels."
