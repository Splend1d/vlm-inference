The value of the dollar will tend to appreciate.\n\nWhen the demand for our exports rises, it means that more people are willing to buy our products. This increase in demand can lead to an appreciation of the dollar as it becomes more valuable against other currencies. \n\nOn the other hand, if our tastes for foreign goods fall off, this could indicate a decrease in demand for imported goods. In this case, there may be less demand for dollars as they become less valuable compared to other currencies. As a result, the value of the dollar could potentially depreciate.\n\nTherefore, the exchange rate between the dollar and other currencies would likely be affected by changes in demand for our exports and imports, but the value of the dollar itself (as measured by its buying power) would not necessarily change."
