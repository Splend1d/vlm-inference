This involves determining who has access to what resources (e.g., food, housing, healthcare) and how those resources are allocated among individuals and groups.\n\nOption B: \"Who should pay taxes?\" refers to questions about taxation and its impact on individual and collective well-being. It includes debates about the fairness of tax systems, the effectiveness of tax policies, and the role of government in redistributing wealth.\n\nOption C: \"Who will work?\" refers to questions related to labor market dynamics and employment opportunities. It involves considering factors such as education levels, skill sets, and the availability of jobs in different sectors.\n\nOption D: \"Who will make the economic decisions?\" refers to questions about policy-making and decision-making processes in an economy. It includes discussions about the role of government in regulating markets, setting prices, and promoting economic growth.\n\nIn summary, all of the options listed above are important questions for understanding and managing economies effectively. However, the specific answers to these questions may vary based on the political, social, and cultural contexts of different societies and economies."
