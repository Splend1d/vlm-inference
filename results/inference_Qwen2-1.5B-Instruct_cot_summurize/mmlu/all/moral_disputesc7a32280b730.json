Additionally, refusing to engage in sex with her partner could lead to negative consequences such as him becoming upset or aggressive. Finally, a violent outburst from her partner due to his frustration or anger could also cause harm to her. Therefore, all of these reasons can contribute to a woman potentially harming herself by engaging in sex with her male partner."
