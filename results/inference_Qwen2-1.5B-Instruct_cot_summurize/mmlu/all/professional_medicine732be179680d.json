Treat the symptoms\n\nUrticaria can be managed with over-the-counter antihistamines or topical corticosteroids, which will help reduce the severity and duration of the rash. In some cases, other medications may be necessary, such as oral corticosteroids or leukotriene receptor antagonists, depending on the underlying cause of the urticaria. However, it is important to note that treatment should only be initiated after a thorough evaluation by a healthcare provider to ensure that the patient's symptoms are not related to a more serious condition."
