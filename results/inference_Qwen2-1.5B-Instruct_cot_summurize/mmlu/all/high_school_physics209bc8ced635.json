                    "text": "We can analyze each statement individually:\n\nI. The ball's speed is zero at the highest point. This is not necessarily true. Even though the ball may momentarily stop momentarily due to air resistance, it still has some velocity before and after reaching its peak height. The force of gravity (due to being pulled down by Earth) continues to act on the ball, which causes it to accelerate downwards even if momentarily stopped by air resistance. Therefore, the ball's speed is not necessarily zero at the highest point.\n\nII. The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point. Again, this is not necessarily true. Since there is no net external force acting on the ball (the force of gravity is balanced by air resistance), the ball's acceleration would be zero when it is at its highest point. However, it doesn't mean that the ball is not accelerating - rather, the acceleration would be towards the ground, not upwards. \n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down. This statement is also not always true. When the ball reaches its maximum height, it momentarily comes to a halt due to air resistance. After this momentary halt, the forces causing the ball to move continue to work against the ball, resulting in an acceleration towards the ground. As a result, the ball will take longer to reach its maximum height again compared to falling from its maximum height back down.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. I & III only**, as statements I and III are both true."
