In order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P, Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked, specifically the idea that intervention is required to assure international security. \n\nWestphalian notions of sovereignty do not directly relate to the concept of Responsibility to Protect (R2P). R2P is a principle that requires states to take action when there is a risk of mass atrocities or genocide occurring in another country, even if they are not directly involved. This does not necessarily require an immediate threat to the sovereignty of neighboring countries.\n\nWhile R2P may sometimes involve measures that could be seen as \"interference\" with a state's sovereignty, it is ultimately focused on preventing mass atrocities rather than on protecting individual citizens from internal threats. Therefore, invoking Westphalian notions of sovereignty is not appropriate for justifying R2P actions.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because R2P itself does not seek to redefine the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty but rather seeks to clarify the responsibilities of states towards their citizens and the international community.\n\nOption C is partially correct in suggesting that R2P redefines the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty. However, the term \"redefine\" implies a more radical shift away from the original concept than is actually necessary. The essence of R2P is to recognize that states have a responsibility to protect their populations from mass atrocities, regardless of whether these atrocities occur within their own borders or elsewhere. This recognition does not fundamentally change the nature of sovereignty, but rather clarifies its role in relation to human rights and international law.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because while R2P does indeed place a duty on states to protect their citizens from mass atrocities, it does not inherently link this duty with the concept of sovereignty. Rather, it recognizes that states must act in accordance with international law and human rights principles, including the protection of vulnerable groups such as refugees, internally displaced persons, and other marginalized communities."
