The PICA can become blocked by a tumor or other abnormal growth, leading to the symptoms described above. The loss of taste is usually temporary and resolves within several weeks to months, while the other symptoms persist indefinitely. Paralysis of the facial muscles and loss of taste occur because the facial nerve controls the muscles that control the movement of the mouth and tongue, as well as taste sensation. Lacrimation refers to the production of tears, and decreased salivation may also occur due to the damage to the facial nerve."
