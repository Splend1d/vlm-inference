To simplify further, let's express \\(f[x]\\) as a linear combination of its arguments:\n\n\\[f(x) = ax + b\\]\n\nwhere \\(a\\) is the coefficient of \\(x\\) in the first term and \\(b\\) is the constant term.\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 2n\\) into the equation gives us:\n\n\\[f(2n) = 2an + b\\]\n\nSince \\(f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n - 1)]\\), we can see that \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 0\\). Thus, our function simplifies to:\n\n\\[f(x) = x\\]\n\nSo, \\(f(8) = 8\\), which corresponds to option C."
