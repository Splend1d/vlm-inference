When an enzyme binds to a substrate, it lowers the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. This means that the reaction can proceed at a faster rate than it would without the presence of the enzyme.\n\nOther options do not explain how enzymes work:\n\nA. Enzymes do not change the temperature of the reaction mixture, so this option does not make sense.\n\nB. Altering the equilibrium constant (K_eq) has no effect on the rate of a chemical reaction, only its direction.\n\nC. The maximal rate of the chemical reaction (V_max) is determined by the concentration of the reactants and their activation energies, not by the presence or absence of an enzyme. Therefore, this option is incorrect."
