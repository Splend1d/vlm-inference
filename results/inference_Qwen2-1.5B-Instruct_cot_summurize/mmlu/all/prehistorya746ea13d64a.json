These were developed to support the growing population in the Valley of Mexico during the pre-Hispanic period. The chinampas allowed for the cultivation of large quantities of food, which could then be transported over long distances through the network of roads and canals that connected the valley with other regions of Mesoamerica. This helped to ensure the survival of the population as they faced environmental challenges such as droughts and floods."
