The defendant's attorney's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will likely be denied because the evidence presented at trial supported the jury's finding that the defendant was responsible for the death of the homeowner's daughter through his actions in setting fire to the occupied house. The fact that the jury returned a not guilty verdict on the second count does not necessarily mean that the defendant's guilt cannot be established beyond a reasonable doubt based solely on the evidence presented during the trial. Therefore, the defendant's attorney may need to present additional evidence or arguments to establish the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, which would require a new trial or appeal."
