                    "text": "The answer is D. Decrease her consumption of chips and increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\nThis means that Mrs. Johnson should first increase her consumption of dip to maximize her total utility. Her initial total utility can be calculated as follows:\n\nTotal Utility = (Chips) * (Marginal Utility of Chips) + (Dip) * (Marginal Utility of Dip)\n= (x) * 12 + (y) * 30\n\nWhere x is the number of chips she eats and y is the number of dips she eats.\n\nThen, we need to find the optimal values of x and y that maximize this total utility function. We know that the marginal utilities are given by:\n\nMarginal Utility of Chips = Marginal Utility per Dollar of Chips / Price of Chips = 12 / $1 = 12\nMarginal Utility of Dip = Marginal Utility per Dollar of Dip / Price of Dip = 30 / $2 = 15\n\nSo, the total utility function becomes:\n\nT(U) = 12x + 15y\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use calculus or simply graph it. The maximum point will occur where T'(U) = 0:\n\nT'(U) = d(T(U))/dx = 12 - 15y = 0\n15y = 12\ny = 8/5\n\nSubstituting this value back into the original equation gives us:\n\nT(U) = 12x + 15(8/5) = 12x + 24\ndT/dx = 12\n\nSince the slope of T' is positive, there is only one solution: x = 0 when y = 8/5.\n\nTherefore, the optimal choice for Mrs. Johnson would be to consume zero chips and 8/5 dips in order to maximize her total utility. This means she should decrease her consumption of chips and increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods."
