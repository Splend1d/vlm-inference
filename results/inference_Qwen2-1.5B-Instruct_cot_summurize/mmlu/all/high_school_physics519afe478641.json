This acceleration will be less than if there was no friction, but still some acceleration will occur. The net force acting on the object will be equal to its weight minus the normal force provided by the inclined surface.\n\nAs the angle of the incline increases, the normal force provided by the inclined surface also increases. However, this increase in the normal force will be offset by the decrease in the gravitational acceleration due to the increased distance between the object and the center of mass as the incline becomes steeper. Therefore, the net force acting on the object remains constant regardless of the angle of the incline. As a result, the normal force does not change."
