In this case, the object has lost 1 electron and gained 1 proton. The total number of excess electrons in an object with a negative charge can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of excess electrons = Number of protons - Number of electrons\n\nFor a negatively charged object, we know there are 1 protons and 1 electron. Therefore, the number of excess electrons is:\n\nNumber of excess electrons = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the number of excess electrons \"containing\" the object, we need to consider the total number of charges on the object. A negatively charged object has a net electric field of attraction towards positive charges. This means that any positively charged object will experience a force of repulsion from the negatively charged object, causing them to move apart. \n\nTherefore, if we add up all the excess electrons carried by all the objects in the universe, the total number of excess electrons would be equal to the net charge of the universe. Since the net charge of the universe is zero (because there are more protons than electrons), the total number of excess electrons in the universe is also zero.\n\nSince the question specifically asks for the number of excess electrons containing the object, and not just the total number of excess electrons, the answer is still D. 3.20 \u00d7 10^19."
