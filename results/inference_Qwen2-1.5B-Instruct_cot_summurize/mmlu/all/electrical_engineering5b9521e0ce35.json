This condition is known as the \"zero-input response\" or the \"dead time.\"\n\nFor a linear time-invariant system like an RLC circuit, the lowest critical frequency corresponds to the resonant frequency of the circuit, which is given by:\n\nf_c = 1/(2\u03c0\u221a(L/C))\n\nwhere L is the inductance and C is the capacitance.\n\nSo the correct answer would be B.
