A kilometer is not a standard unit of measurement for measuring distances, so it is not appropriate to use it in this context. Additionally, a swimming pool is typically much shorter than a kilometer in length, so using that as an estimate would not be accurate. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 25 meters."
