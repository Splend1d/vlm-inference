Lower reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n\nThis list includes actions that would increase the money supply by allowing banks to create more loans and investments, which in turn increases the total amount of money in circulation. This can be achieved through lowering reserve requirements, which allow banks to hold less cash as reserves, and lowering the discount rate, which makes it cheaper for banks to borrow funds from the Federal Reserve. Buying bonds also increases the money supply by adding new debt instruments to the system."
