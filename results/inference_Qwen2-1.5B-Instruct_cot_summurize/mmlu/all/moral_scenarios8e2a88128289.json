Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, pushing your little sister off the swingset is a clear example of physical harm and aggression towards someone who cannot defend themselves. It goes against ordinary moral standards to intentionally hurt or harm another person without their consent.\n\nIn scenario 2, setting off dynamite during work at a daycare is illegal and dangerous, causing potential harm to others. While it may not be explicitly stated that this action violates ordinary moral standards, it is generally considered wrong due to its potential consequences and lack of justification for such actions.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, but they have different levels of direct harm caused to individuals."
