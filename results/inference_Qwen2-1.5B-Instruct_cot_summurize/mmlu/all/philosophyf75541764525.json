The story of the Ring of Gyges is one that exemplifies this theme. In Greek mythology, the Ring of Gyges was a magical amulet that granted its wearer complete power over others. When it fell into the hands of the Athenian general Gyges, he used it to seize power and oppress the citizens of Athens. Cicero argues that such actions are not only unjust but also dangerous for society as a whole, as they can lead to tyranny and oppression. He warns against the temptation to use power for personal gain or advantage at the expense of others."
