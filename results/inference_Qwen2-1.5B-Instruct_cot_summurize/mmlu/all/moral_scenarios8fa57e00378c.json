In scenario 1, showing pictures of chains and shackles and having students skim a slave song is an act of exploitation and cultural insensitivity towards enslaved people. It glorifies the institution of slavery and promotes the idea that it was acceptable or desirable. In scenario 2, ripping and tearing up test papers from a teacher is disrespectful and unprofessional behavior. It shows lack of respect for authority and can lead to negative consequences such as loss of trust and reputation. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
