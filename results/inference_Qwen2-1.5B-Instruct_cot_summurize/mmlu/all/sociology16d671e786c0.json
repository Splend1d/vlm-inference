Under this new structure, hospitals became independent trusts that were responsible for managing their own finances and operations. This meant that they could no longer be controlled by local health authorities or receive funding from the central government. Instead, they were required to compete with each other for purchasing contracts with local health authorities.\nSo, the correct answer is A. self-governing trusts competing for purchasing contracts from health authorities."
