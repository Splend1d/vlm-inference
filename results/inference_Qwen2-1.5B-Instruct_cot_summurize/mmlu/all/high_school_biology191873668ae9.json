This process occurs during growth and development in all living organisms, including plants and animals.\n\nIn contrast, the other options listed do not involve mitotic cell division:\n\n- A: Cross sections of muscle tissue typically show cells undergoing various types of cell division, but it's unclear what specific type of cell division is being referred to here.\n- B: An anther is a structure found in flowering plants that contains male gametophytes, such as sperm cells. It does not involve mitotic cell division.\n- D: Cross sections of leaves are often used for identifying plant species based on their characteristics, but they do not specifically refer to mitotic cell division."
