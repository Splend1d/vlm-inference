This means that all participants are measured at the same time and under the same conditions, regardless of their age or other characteristics. \n\nFor example, if you were studying the impact of a new educational program on student performance, you might use a cross-sectional design where all students in a particular grade level participate in the program and have their test scores recorded before and after the program. \n\nThis type of design allows researchers to compare groups based on common characteristics such as age, gender, race, etc., but it does not allow for the measurement of changes over time. If you wanted to measure changes in student performance over time, you would need to use a longitudinal design instead."
