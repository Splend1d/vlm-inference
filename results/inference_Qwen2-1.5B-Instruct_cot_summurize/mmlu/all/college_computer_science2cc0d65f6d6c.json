Interrupt handlers, on the other hand, allow the CPU to continue executing other tasks while waiting for an asynchronous event to occur, which can result in faster execution times.\n\nAdditionally, busy-waiting can lead to deadlocks if the event being waited for occurs at the same time as another event that is already blocked by the busy-waiting thread. Interrupts, on the other hand, do not cause these problems.\n\nTherefore, while a busy-wait loop may be simpler to code, it is not necessarily the best choice for all cases, especially when dealing with time-sharing systems where there may be other important tasks that need to be executed concurrently."
