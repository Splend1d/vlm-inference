Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages.\n\nEthernet is an asynchronous media access control (MAC) protocol, which means that it uses a packet-switched network architecture instead of circuit-switching. Therefore, option A is incorrect. \n\nEthernet also uses a master-slave bus model for data transfer and employs a collision detection mechanism called CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) to prevent collisions between devices on the same network segment. This ensures that messages are transmitted properly without any errors or dropped packets.\n\nOption B, C, and D are all correct statements about Ethernet networks. Option C specifically mentions Ethernet protocols using a collision detection method to ensure proper transmission, while options B and D focus on the architecture and limitations of Ethernet networks."
