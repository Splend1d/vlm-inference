At trial, the insurer called as an expert witness an engineer, who testified that the pipe had burst because of age rather than freezing. On cross-examination, the engineer admitted that five years earlier, he had been convicted of tax fraud, even though he had asserted that it was his accountant's error. In response, the insurer calls a witness, who is well acquainted with the engineer and his reputation, to testify that (1) in the witness's opinion, the engineer is a truthful person, and (2) the engineer's neighbors all describe him as a truthful person. How much, if any, of the witness's testimony is admissible?\n\nA. All of the testimony is admissible to support the engineer's credibility.\nB. Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.\nC. Only the portion concerning the witness's opinion of the engineer's character, because the witness's reporting of the neighbors' comments is hearsay.\nD. None of the testimony is admissible, because it is collateral, having no bearing on the engineer's qualifications as an expert.\n"

Only the portion concerning the engineer's reputation is admissible, because where both opinion and reputation evidence are available, only the latter is admissible under a rule of preference.\n\nIn this case, the insurance company called an engineer as an expert witness to testify about the cause of the water damage. The engineer testified that the pipe burst due to age rather than freezing, which contradicted the plaintiff's claim that the water damage was caused by a frozen plastic pipe. \n\nDuring cross-examination, the engineer admitted that he had been convicted of tax fraud five years earlier, even though he had previously claimed that it was an accountant's error. This admission by the engineer undermined his credibility as an expert witness and raised questions about the reliability of his testimony.\n\nTo address these concerns, the insurance company then called a witness who is familiar with the engineer and his reputation. This witness testified that the engineer is a truthful person and has a good reputation among his neighbors. This testimony may be relevant to the issue of whether the engineer's opinion is credible, but it is not admissible to prove the truthfulness or lack thereof of the engineer himself.\n\nTherefore, the only portion of the witness's testimony that is admissible is the part concerning the engineer's reputation, which would be relevant to assessing the credibility of the engineer's opinion. The other parts of the witness's testimony, such as their opinions about the engineer's character, would be considered hearsay and therefore inadmissible."
