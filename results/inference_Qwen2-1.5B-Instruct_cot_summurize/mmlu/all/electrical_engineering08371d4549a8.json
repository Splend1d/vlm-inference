Therefore, the electric field inside the conductor will also be zero due to the absence of any charge distribution within it.\n\nSince the conductor is parallel to the ground, there is no potential difference between the conductor and the ground. This means that the electric field between the conductor and the ground is equal and opposite to each other, resulting in no net force acting on the conductor.\n\nTherefore, the maximum electric stress occurs at the ground surface. \n\nSo the correct answer is C. the ground surface."
