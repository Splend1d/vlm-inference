It may also be helpful for Mrs. Wang to consider seeking the assistance of other professionals who have more experience working with adolescents and providing crisis intervention services.\n\nIt is important to note that as an ethical psychologist, you should always strive to provide the highest quality care possible while prioritizing the safety and well-being of those in need."
