Without proper management, diabetes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and nerve damage.\n\nIn terms of bleeding, people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing conditions like diabetic retinopathy, which can cause eye damage that increases the risk of bleeding into the eye. In addition, people with diabetes may also have an increased risk of bleeding from ulcers or other injuries due to changes in blood flow caused by the condition.\n\nIn terms of urinary tract infections (UTIs), people with diabetes are at higher risk because of the increased risk of bacteria growing in the urinary tract. This can lead to symptoms such as pain, fever, and cloudy urine. Proper management of diabetes, including regular monitoring of blood sugar levels and taking medications as prescribed, can help reduce the risk of UTIs.\n\nFinally, catheter encrustation is not related to diabetes per se, but it is still important to manage any potential complications associated with catheters, such as infection or blockage. However, in general, people with diabetes should take extra precautions when using catheters to prevent infection and protect against any possible complications."
