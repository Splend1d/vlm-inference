The principles of natural law are discoverable by reason.\n\nCicero believed that natural law is based on reason and that it applies to everyone, regardless of culture or society. He argued that people have innate knowledge about what is right and wrong, and this knowledge comes from reason. Therefore, natural law is discoverable through reason rather than being discovered by divine revelation or tradition. This is in contrast to the concept of divine law, which Cicero saw as arbitrary and unexplainable."
