The independent variable is a variable that is manipulated by the researcher to observe its effect on other variables in the study. In this case, the researcher is asking participants about their eating habits and whether they typically eat breakfast. Eating breakfast is an action that can be influenced by various factors such as personal preference, cultural background, and health concerns. Therefore, it is considered an independent variable because it is being manipulated by the researcher to see how it affects the other variables in the study."
