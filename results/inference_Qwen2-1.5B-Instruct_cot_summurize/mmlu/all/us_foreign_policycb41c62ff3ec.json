Embrace multi-polarity, show greater restraint internationally and require other states to meet their own security burdens.\n\nOffshore balancing is a policy that involves maintaining a balance between the United States and other countries, while also investing equally in domestic and international security. This means that the United States will not become overly involved in foreign affairs or form alliances with other countries, but instead will focus on maintaining its own security and interests. Additionally, the United States will require other countries to meet their own security burdens, which means that they will not be willing to shoulder all of the burden of protecting the United States' interests abroad.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the United States should maintain a balance between itself and other countries by forming alliances, which is not part of the Offshore Balancing policy.\n\nOption B is partially correct because it mentions investing equally in domestic and international security, but it does not fully address the concept of Offshore Balancing. The United States will still prioritize its own security and interests, but it may also invest in international security as well.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that the United States should isolate itself from the international system and not seek global power, which goes against the core principles of Offshore Balancing. The United States will still engage in international affairs and work towards maintaining a balance of power in the world."
