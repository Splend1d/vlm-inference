The sudden demise of the dinosaurs and various other groups, caused by the impact of a large extraterrestrial body with Earth. Catastrophism refers to the theory that Earth's history was marked by sudden, catastrophic events such as asteroid impacts, volcanic eruptions, and floods. Events like these can cause significant changes in the planet's environment and may lead to mass extinctions. The other options describe gradual processes, not catastrophic ones."
