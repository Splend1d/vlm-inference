Before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, he received an offer of his full asking price of $120,000 from another party. The seller called the purchaser and called the deal off. The purchaser sued for specific performance on the basis that the oral understanding, along with the written offer and the check, constituted an enforceable agreement. Will the purchaser likely prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check for the down payment was evidence of consideration being paid.\nB. No, because the offer was not accepted \u0080\u0094 prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.\nC. Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.\nD. No, because specific performance does not apply in a residential real estate transaction.\n"

Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.\n\nSpecific performance requires a clear and present intention to perform a contract. In this case, the buyer and seller clearly expressed their intent through the oral agreement, the check, and the written offer. Additionally, the check served as evidence of consideration being paid, which is necessary for a valid contract. Therefore, the court would likely find that the parties had a binding contract based on these factors."
