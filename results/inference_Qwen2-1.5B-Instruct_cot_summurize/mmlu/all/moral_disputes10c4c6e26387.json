All of the above.\n\nEmigration is often associated with significant costs, including financial and emotional expenses such as relocation costs, job search expenses, and loss of social support networks. Therefore, it makes sense that those who are willing or forced to leave a state may have substantial interests in living in another state, which could lead to increased economic opportunities and personal growth. Additionally, preventing potential immigrants from settling in a different state can be detrimental to their well-being, as they may not have access to necessary resources or services. Finally, closing borders can also have significant costs to potential immigrants, as they may face difficulties in obtaining visas or finding work."
