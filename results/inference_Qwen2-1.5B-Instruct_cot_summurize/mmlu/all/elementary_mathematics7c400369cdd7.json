                    "text": "To find when both buses leave the station at the same time, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the times it takes each bus to leave the station.\n\n- Bus A's interval = 75 minutes\n- Bus B's interval = 15 minutes\n\nFirst, convert all times into minutes since the question specifies that the schedules are based on minutes.\n\n- 6:00 a.m. in minutes = 6 * 60 = 360 minutes\n\nNow, let's find the LCM of 75 and 15:\n\n- Prime factorization of 75 = $3^1 \\times 5^2$\n- Prime factorization of 15 = $3 \\times 5$\n\nThe LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number present in either factorization:\n\n- LCM = $3^1 \\times 5^2$ = $3 \\times 25$ = 75\n\nThis means that both buses leave the station every 75 minutes after they have left the station last. To find out when this happens, we add multiples of 75 to 360 until we reach a point where one bus has already left the station and the other bus will be leaving shortly.\n\nStarting from 360 minutes and adding 75 minute intervals:\n\n- 360 + 75 = 435 minutes\n- 435 + 75 = 510 minutes\n- 510 + 75 = 585 minutes\n- 585 + 75 = 660 minutes\n\nSo, the first instance when both buses leave the station at the same time is at 6:00 a.m., which corresponds to 6:00 + 75 minutes = 6:75 p.m.\n\nHowever, the options provided are in AM/PM format, so we need to adjust our calculation accordingly. Since 7:00 a.m. would normally correspond to 7:00 a.m., but with the correct conversion from minutes to hours, we need to subtract 75 minutes to get the correct time.\n\nThus, the next time Bus A and BusB will leave the bus station at the same time is 6:00 a.m. - 75 minutes = 6:25 a.m., which matches option C."
