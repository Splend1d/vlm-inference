In this model, there are three key variables that influence an individual's effectiveness as a leader: LPC (leader-perspective characteristic), LPT (leader-people orientation), and LPC/LPT ratio.\n\nBased on this model, high LPC leaders are those who have a strong belief in their own abilities and capabilities, while also showing concern for the well-being of their followers. They tend to be confident and assertive, which can lead to better decision-making and problem-solving skills. High LPC leaders may also exhibit greater empathy towards their followers and show a willingness to adapt their behavior based on feedback from their subordinates.\n\nIn contrast, low LPC leaders may not have as strong of beliefs about their own abilities and capabilities, but they may still be effective if they can maintain a positive relationship with their followers. Low LPC leaders may be more open to feedback and willing to adjust their behavior based on what their followers want.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question would be B - high LPC leaders are more effective than low LPC leaders in moderately favorable situations."
