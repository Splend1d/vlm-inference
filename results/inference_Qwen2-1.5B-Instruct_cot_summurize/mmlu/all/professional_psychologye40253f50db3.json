Vicarious liability occurs when a person who has not directly caused harm to another person may still be held responsible for that harm if they have supervised or otherwise influenced someone else who did cause the harm. In the context of a therapist, this could include situations where the therapist acts as a supervisor, mentor, or other type of authority figure with responsibility for the mental health and well-being of their clients. Therefore, vicarious liability is most likely to be an issue when a psychologist is acting in the capacity of a therapist."
