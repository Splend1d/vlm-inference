Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the outcomes listed below followed the delivery of Lin Zexu's letter?\n\nA. Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West\nB. A successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories\nC. Violent uprisings on the part of China's pro-British Muslim minority\nD. The expulsion of all foreigners from Chinese territory\n"

However, based on the historical context of the time period, it is possible that Lin Zexu's letter played a role in the eventual banning of the opium trade in China by the British government. It is also possible that his letter contributed to tensions between China and the West, leading to violent uprisings among China's pro-British Muslim minority. Therefore, none of the options listed (A, B, C, D) can be definitively determined without additional information."
