                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Methylation of IGF2 is increased.\n\nFolic acid plays an important role in the methylation of DNA, which is crucial for the proper functioning of many genes including those involved in embryonic development. In particular, it has been shown that folate deficiency can lead to impaired DNA methylation, which may contribute to various birth defects.\n\nResearch has also suggested that prenatal exposure to folic acid can help prevent the formation of certain chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome. However, there is limited information available on how this affects methylation of specific genes like IGF2.\n\nIn summary, while folic acid supplementation can be beneficial for overall health, its effects on methylation of specific genes like IGF2 during pregnancy are not well studied. Therefore, the impact on methylation of IGF2 in offspring is difficult to predict with certainty based solely on dietary recommendations."
