This can lead to a decrease in the value of the dollar relative to other currencies because there is less supply of dollars available to be bought with each unit of foreign currency. However, if the supply of dollars also increases, then this could lead to an increase in the value of the dollar against other currencies as the demand for dollars increases. Therefore, option D is the correct interpretation of what happens when the United States exports more goods and services."
