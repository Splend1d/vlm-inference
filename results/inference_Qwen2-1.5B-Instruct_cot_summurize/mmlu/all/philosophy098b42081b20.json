Therefore, option A might be incorrect.\n\nOption B is also incorrect, as philosophers often ask such questions that require justification rather than asking for a simple yes or no answer.\n\nOption D is irrelevant, as the question being asked here pertains to moral and ethical considerations rather than religious beliefs."
