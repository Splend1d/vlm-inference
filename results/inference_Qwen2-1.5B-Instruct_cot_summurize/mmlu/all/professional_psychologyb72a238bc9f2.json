A colleague suggests that the results of your study might be confounded by the fact that older participants may have less experience using a computer than do younger participants. This potential source of error is best described as a:\n\nA. Rosenthal effect.\nB. Hawthorne effect.\nC. carryover effect.\nD. cohort effect.\n"

In other words, the age of an individual affects their performance more because they were born at a particular time period rather than because they possess unique abilities or traits.\n\nIn this scenario, the cohort effect could explain why older participants might perform better on the task compared to younger participants, even if there is no actual difference in their ability to react quickly to visual stimuli. The presence of the cohort effect means that the observed differences in reaction time cannot be attributed solely to age but also to the specific cohort of individuals being studied."
