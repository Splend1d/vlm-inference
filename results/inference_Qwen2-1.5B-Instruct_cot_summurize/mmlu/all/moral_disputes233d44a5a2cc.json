Additionally, while the growth of an embryo may be influenced by the environment in which it grows, it still has the potential to survive and develop into a healthy adult if given proper care and attention. Therefore, embryonic development represents a significant stage in the process of becoming a fully developed human being, and thus can be considered a complete organism."
