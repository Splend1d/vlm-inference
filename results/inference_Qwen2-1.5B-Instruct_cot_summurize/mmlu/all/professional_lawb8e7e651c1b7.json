The boat owner was navigating his craft toward shore when heavy rain and wind gusts began to rock the boat. Unable to reach his own slip, the boat owner docked his boat on a pier owned by a resident who lived in a nearby house. The resident objected to the boat owner's entry onto his private property. The boat owner explained that due to the storm it would be highly dangerous to be at sea. He requested permission to temporarily dock his boat until the storm subsided. The resident refused and cut the rope tying the boat to the dock. As a result, the boat drifted out to sea. The boat was battered by the rocky waves and high winds. Trying to prevent the boat from capsizing, the boat owner fell and broke his leg. The boat was extensively damaged in the storm, as well. The boat owner has sued the resident, seeking to recover damages for his personal injury, as well as damage to the boat. The boat owner should\n\nA. recover for the damage to the boat, but not recover for his personal injury.\nB. recover for his personal injury, but not recover for the damage to the boat.\nC. recover both for damage to the boat and for his personal injury.\nD. not recover for either damage to the boat or his personal injury.\n"

In this case, the boat owner's personal injury is clearly a separate issue from the damage to his boat. However, if the storm had been severe enough to warrant abandoning the boat and leaving it in the open ocean, then he may have a claim for loss of use of the boat while it was out of commission due to the storm."
