                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Decreasing impact of uncompetitive inhibitor and increasing impact of noncompetitive inhibitor.\n\nNoncompetitive inhibitors bind to an allosteric site on the enzyme, preventing it from catalyzing a reaction by binding directly to the active site or blocking access to the active site. Uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate complex, preventing the enzyme from being able to bind its substrate. Therefore, as the substrate concentration increases, the amount of enzyme available to bind the substrate decreases, leading to a decrease in the impact of uncompetitive inhibitors and an increase in the impact of noncompetitive inhibitors. This is because noncompetitive inhibitors do not compete with each other for the same binding sites, so their effect can be amplified when the substrate concentration increases."
