When conflicts arise between duties, it is important to consider which one is more important or beneficial for society as a whole. Moral judgment involves weighing the consequences of different actions and making a decision that promotes the greatest good for the greatest number of people. It is not appropriate to ignore one's duties altogether or to rely solely on external authority to make decisions about what to do in these situations."
