The bill imposes a 15% tax upon the gross annual receipts from the sales of all birth control devices. The bill has the strong support of conservative and pro-life organizations. The stated purpose of the proposed measure is to raise revenue and spur population growth across the country. In your learned opinion, the proposed tax is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because the fact that the tax applies to all sales of every type of birth control device invalidates any possible objection to the tax on the grounds that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. constitutional, because the fact that controversial policy motives may have induced the enactment of an otherwise reasonable measure calculated to raise revenue does not ipso facto invalidate the tax.\nC. unconstitutional, because in inseverable aggregates, the domestic purchases and sales of birth control devices affect interstate and foreign commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, because the tax burdens the fundamental right to privacy of users of birth control devices without establishing a compelling national interest for doing so.\n"

This could potentially violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n2) The bill's stated purpose is to \"raise revenue and spur population growth.\" However, this purpose conflicts with the constitutional rights of individuals who use birth control devices, as the tax would burden their fundamental right to privacy by intruding into their personal decisions about contraception.\n\n3) The tax also affects interstate and foreign commerce, as it involves transactions between states and other countries. It could be argued that such taxes impede legitimate economic activities and are therefore unconstitutional.\n\nTherefore, based on these arguments, the tax is most likely unconstitutional."
