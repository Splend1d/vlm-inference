A combination of the normal force and the friction force.\n\nCentripetal force is defined as the inward force that causes an object to follow a curved path. In the case of a car rounding a banked curve, the centripetal force is provided by a combination of two forces:\n\n1. The normal force from the road: This force acts perpendicular to the direction of motion and opposes the car's forward motion.\n2. The friction force between the tires and the road: This force also acts perpendicular to the direction of motion but acts inwards towards the center of the circle.\n\nTogether, these two forces provide the necessary centripetal force to keep the car moving in a circular path."
