                    "text": "The maternal deprivation thesis, also known as Bowlby's \"attachment theory,\" suggests that early experiences with parents can have long-lasting effects on child development. Specifically, it posits that a child's ability to form secure attachments with their mother during infancy is crucial for their emotional well-being and subsequent social and cognitive development.\n\nWhile Bowlby's work has been influential, his thesis does not explicitly state that mothers who live in poverty cannot afford to provide their children with the resources that other children enjoy. The concept of \"maternal deprivation\" refers more broadly to the lack of nurturing care and affection from a primary caregiver, which can lead to difficulties in developing healthy relationships and coping mechanisms.\n\nHowever, Bowlby did suggest that children who experience neglect or severe stressors during their earliest years may be at risk of developing mental health problems later in life, including anxiety, depression, and behavioral issues. This aspect of his theory is consistent with the idea that early experiences shape how individuals approach challenges and form relationships throughout their lives.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement among the options you provided would be:\n\nB. children deprived of an early, secure attachment to their mother are prone to suffering physically, intellectually and socially in later life\n\nThis statement aligns with Bowlby's view that a lack of a secure base during early childhood can impact a child's emotional stability and social interactions, leading to potential developmental difficulties later in life."
