The habitable zone around a star is defined as the region where liquid water can potentially exist on a planet's surface due to the presence of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere, which trap heat and allow for liquid water to exist at lower temperatures. This region is typically located between the star and the gas giant planets in a star's system."
