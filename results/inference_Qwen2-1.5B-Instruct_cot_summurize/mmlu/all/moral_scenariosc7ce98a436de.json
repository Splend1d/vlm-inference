However, in the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, kissing someone's spouse without their consent would generally be considered unethical and potentially illegal depending on the circumstances. Keeping boxes of candy in one's vehicle for drawing children might be seen as inappropriate or even harmful if it leads to unwanted attention or harassment from children. Therefore, scenario 2 has elements that could be seen as morally wrong, while scenario 1 is more ambiguous due to the lack of clear information about the situation."
