Social enterprises are organizations that use profit as a means of achieving their social mission, rather than solely for profit. They focus on creating value and addressing social problems while generating profits. While some may argue that social enterprises should prioritize maximizing market share or running a business for the sake of profit, this approach can be seen as short-sighted and ultimately detrimental to society. Instead, social enterprises should strive to achieve a balance between profit and social impact, using profits to fund their missions and ensure sustainability over the long term."
