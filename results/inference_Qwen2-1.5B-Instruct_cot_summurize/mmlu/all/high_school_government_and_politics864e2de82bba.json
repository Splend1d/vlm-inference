The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. In Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the Supreme Court declared that separate educational facilities were inherently unequal and therefore unconstitutional, thus violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Fourteenth Amendment."
