The nominal interest rate minus anticipated inflation.\n\nThe real interest rate is the actual return an investor receives after adjusting for inflation. It can be calculated as:\n\nReal interest rate = Nominal interest rate - Inflation rate\n\nTherefore, if we want to calculate the real interest rate, we need to subtract the expected inflation rate from the nominal interest rate. This gives us the correct option in this case."
