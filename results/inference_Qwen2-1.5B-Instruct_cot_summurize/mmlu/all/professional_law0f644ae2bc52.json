The newborn calves need constant attention and care. One day one of the employees inadvertently leaves the fence door open and a newly-born calf breaks free and goes to his neighbor's land. The breeder went to the neighbor's land to retrieve the calf for its safety and to make sure it was unharmed. However, he was arrested on a trespass charge after entering the land. The breeder appealed. Will the court dismiss the charge?\n\nA. Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\nB. Yes, because the tender pet doctrine allows temporary entry to retrieve baby animals.\nC. No, because the neighbor had a right to keep any living chattels that crossed onto his land.\nD. No, because his status as a breeder made him unqualified for a limited license.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is A. Yes, because he had a limited privilege to enter the land to prevent harm to his chattel.\n\nThe law generally recognizes certain individuals or entities as having \"limited privileges\" to enter property without permission, such as those engaged in activities like farming, ranching, or animal breeding. These individuals may have a limited right to use the property, but they do not have a general right of access unless there is a specific agreement or written authorization for such access.\n\nIn this case, the breeder had a limited privilege to enter the neighbor's land to prevent harm to his own livestock. While he did enter the neighbor's land, his purpose was to retrieve the calf to ensure its safety and well-being, which falls within the scope of his limited privilege. Therefore, the court would likely dismiss the trespass charge against the breeder based on the limited privilege doctrine."
