Multiple micronutrient deficiencies are widespread in older people in high-income countries.\n\nOlder people may be at risk for multiple micronutrient deficiencies, such as vitamin B12 deficiency and folate deficiency, which can affect their overall health and well-being. Additionally, older people may have reduced digestive function and absorption of certain nutrients, leading to increased risk of nutrient deficiencies. It's important to address these issues through appropriate nutrition counseling and supplementation if necessary."
