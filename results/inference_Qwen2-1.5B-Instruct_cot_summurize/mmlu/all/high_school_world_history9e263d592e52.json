Labor unions\n\nThe passage mentions that Joshua Drake's testimony is from before the establishment of labor unions, which suggests that he is referring to the Industrial Revolution-era in Britain, where labor unions were just beginning to form. These unions played a significant role in advocating for better working conditions and improved wages for their members."
