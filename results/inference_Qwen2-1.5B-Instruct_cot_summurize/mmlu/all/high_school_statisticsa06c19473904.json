HA: \u03bc1\u2212 \u03bc2< 0.\n\nThis is because the psychologist believes that positive rewards lead to better behavior, while punishment leads to worse behavior. Therefore, if we want to test whether positive rewards have a greater effect on behavior compared to punishment, we should be looking at the difference between the two groups (\u03bc1 - \u03bc2). The hypothesis states that this difference is not zero, meaning that positive rewards do have a greater effect on behavior than punishment."
