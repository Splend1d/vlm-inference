The liver stores and breaks down glucose, producing energy that can be used by other tissues to fuel cellular processes. This process of converting glucose into ATP is called gluconeogenesis.\n\nMuscle glycogen, intramuscular lipids, and adipose tissue also contribute to ATP production through different pathways, but they do not have the same capacity as the liver to store and utilize large amounts of glucose. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Liver glycogen"
