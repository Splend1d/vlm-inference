Iron.\n\nPhytic acid, found in many grains, legumes, and seeds, can bind to iron and other minerals in the gut, making them less available for absorption. However, this effect is not significant enough to significantly affect the overall amount of iron or other minerals absorbed from these foods. Therefore, the intake of iron is not directly affected by high intakes of foods containing phytic acid."
