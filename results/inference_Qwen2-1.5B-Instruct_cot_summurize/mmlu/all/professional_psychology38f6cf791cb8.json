Write a letter to the psychologist, indicating the relevant ethical standards and offering to discuss the matter with him.\n\nIt is important for psychologists to uphold ethical standards when conducting research, including respecting participant autonomy and avoiding coercion. If you believe that the psychologist's actions may be violating these standards, it is important to address the issue directly rather than simply refusing to assist with the research project or filing a complaint without attempting to resolve the situation ethically. By discussing the matter with the psychologist, you can work together to ensure that the research is conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines and respects the rights and well-being of all participants."
