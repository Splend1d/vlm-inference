Right lateral pterygoid muscle\n\nThe right lateral pterygoid muscle is one of the two muscles that innervated by the right facial nerve (CN IV) plays a key role in controlling movement of the jaw, including movements such as right lateral excursions and right elevations of the mandible. This muscle is also involved in the movement of the teeth and the muscles of mastication. The other muscle involved in these movements is the left lateral pterygoid muscle."
