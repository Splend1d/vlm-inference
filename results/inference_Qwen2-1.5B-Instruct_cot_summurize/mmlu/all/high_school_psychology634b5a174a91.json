A combination of psychological changes and our cognitive interpretations combine to produce our emotional experiences.\n\nStanley Schacter proposed that emotions can be divided into two factors: arousal (or intensity) and valence (or positive or negative). The first factor, arousal, refers to the physical sensations we feel when we encounter an external event. For example, seeing someone you love may cause your heart rate to increase and your breathing to become more rapid. The second factor, valence, refers to the emotional state we experience as a result of the arousal caused by the external event. For example, if the event was something scary, such as being chased by a dog, you might feel fear or anxiety.\n\nTogether, these two factors form the basis for our emotional experiences. For example, if I see my friend crying because they just lost their job, my body would respond with increased heart rate and breathing, which could lead to feelings of concern and worry. My cognitive interpretation of this situation, however, could also contribute to my emotional experience, such as feeling sorry for them or trying to help them find new employment."
