It involves using lines to represent the distance between objects, making them appear three-dimensional on the canvas or page. This can be achieved through the use of shading, cross-hatching, and other techniques that create the illusion of depth. Other options listed do not necessarily involve adding depth to a drawing, but rather may be used for different purposes such as retinal disparity (which refers to differences in visual perception due to differences in how light is perceived) and closure (which refers to the idea of wrapping up or completing something)."
