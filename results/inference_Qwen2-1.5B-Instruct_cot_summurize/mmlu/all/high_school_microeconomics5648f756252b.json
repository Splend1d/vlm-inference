This allows them to set higher prices than they would in a perfectly competitive market, but they also face lower marginal costs than in a perfectly competitive market because they do not need to share profits with competitors.\n\nThe marginal revenue curve for a monopolist is always horizontal (MP = MR), as there is no competition to sell any additional units at the current price. The vertical axis of the marginal revenue curve represents the change in revenue per unit sold, which is constant across all levels of output. This means that even if the price increases, the marginal revenue remains unchanged, allowing the firm to maximize its profits by producing at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost."
