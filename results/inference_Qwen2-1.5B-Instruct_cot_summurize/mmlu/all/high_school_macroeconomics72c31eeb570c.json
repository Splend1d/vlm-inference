                    "text": "The correct answer is A: the investment demand curve is relatively elastic. \n\nKeynesian economics posits that in an economy experiencing low aggregate demand, government spending and taxes must be increased to stimulate economic growth. This is because when there is too much money chasing too few goods, prices tend to fall (deflation) or rise (inflation), which makes it difficult for businesses to sell their products at a profit.\n\nWhen government increases spending on infrastructure, defense, education, and other public services, it can boost aggregate demand and lead to higher employment and wages, which can then lead to higher output and profits. Additionally, by providing a safety net through social welfare programs, governments can reduce inequality and prevent people from becoming destitute due to job loss.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that the economy is inherently stable. In fact, as Keynes himself argued, \"the tendency of an economy to fluctuate between high and low levels of activity is not necessarily an inherent characteristic of any particular type of economy.\" Rather, it's a result of factors such as technological change, natural disasters, and global events.\n\nRegarding B: while fiscal policy can have some effectiveness, monetary policy is generally considered more effective for stabilizing the economy during periods of high inflation or deflation. Monetary policy involves controlling the supply of money in the economy, which can help control inflation or decrease it in times of deflation.\n\nRegarding C: Keynesian economics does not claim that the economy is inherently stable. It argues that fluctuations in the economy are caused by external shocks or changes in technology, rather than being a constant feature of the economy.\n\nFinally, regarding D: inadequate supply is often cited as a reason for periods of stagnation. However, Keynesian economics also recognizes that there may be other reasons for stagnant economies, such as excessive debt, lack of innovation, or a lack of skilled labor. Therefore, while inadequate supply can contribute to economic stagnation, it's not the only factor involved."
