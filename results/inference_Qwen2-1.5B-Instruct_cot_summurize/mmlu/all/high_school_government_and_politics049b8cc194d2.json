Executive orders have the same effect as laws passed by Congress.\n\nExecutive orders, like any other law, can be overturned or amended by future administrations if they take office and decide to do so. However, this does not mean that executive orders have the same legal standing as laws passed by Congress. While executive orders may carry weight in terms of policy implementation, they are not considered equal to federal statutes. Therefore, option B is incorrect."
