This is because Baron cited Ali Soufan's Senate testimony which discussed the use of torture and how it can lead to false confessions, but also acknowledged that there are cases where torture is used effectively. Therefore, if one endorses the use of torture for any reason, they must also endorse its continued use for all purposes."
