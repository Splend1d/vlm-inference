                    "text": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand what prime and composite numbers are. Prime numbers are those greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Composite numbers, on the other hand, have more than two factors.\n\nThe six 6-sided dice can roll any number from 1 to 6, which means there are 6^6 possible outcomes when rolling six dice.\n\nNow, let's break down how many ways each die can land:\n- Three dice showing prime numbers: There are 3 primes (2, 3, 5) out of 6 faces for each die. So, for one die, there are \\(3/6\\) or \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) chance of getting a prime number. For all six dice, it would be \\((\\frac{1}{2})^6 = \\frac{1}{64}\\).\n\n- The remaining three dice showing composite numbers: Since all the dice except one must show a composite number, and there are 5 composites in total (4, 6), there are \\(5/6\\) chances for each die to show a composite number. Thus, for all six dice, it would be \\((5/6)^3 = \\frac{125}{216}\\).\n\nAdding these probabilities together gives us the total probability:\n\n\\[P(\\text{prime on three dice} \\times \\text{composite on three dice}) = P(\\text{prime on three dice}) \\times P(\\text{composite on three dice})\\]\n\n\\[= \\left( \\frac{1}{64} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{125}{216} \\right)\\]\n\n\\[= \\frac{125}{2916}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \\(\\frac{125}{2916}\\)."
