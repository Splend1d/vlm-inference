I/O ports are placed at addresses on the bus and are accessed just like other memory locations.\n\nMemory-mapped I/O allows the computer to access hardware directly without having to use memory locations as intermediaries. Instead of using memory locations to access I/O devices, memory-mapped I/O uses the system bus to communicate with the device. This allows the computer to interact with the device more efficiently and reduces the amount of processing required to transfer data between the CPU and the device. Memory-mapped I/O can be implemented using various techniques, such as direct addressing or indirect addressing, but the key characteristic is that I/O ports are accessed directly through the system bus instead of being mapped to specific memory locations."
