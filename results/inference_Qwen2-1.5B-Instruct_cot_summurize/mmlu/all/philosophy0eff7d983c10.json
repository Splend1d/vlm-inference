Augustine was a Christian philosopher and theologian who lived from 354 to 430 AD, but he did not make any specific statements about human error or the possibility of making mistakes. Therefore, there is no evidence to support the claim that Augustine believed we cannot ever make errors.\n\nIt's important to note that even if we were to accept the idea that humans cannot make mistakes, it would still be an extremely difficult concept to grasp and understand. The concept of error is deeply rooted in our understanding of ourselves as imperfect beings, and it is something that many people struggle with throughout their lives. It's also worth noting that the concept of error is not limited to humans; animals, plants, and other forms of life also experience error and make mistakes. So while we may not always know what we're doing, it's not accurate to say that we cannot make mistakes."
