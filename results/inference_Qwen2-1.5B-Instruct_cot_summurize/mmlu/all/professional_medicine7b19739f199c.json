He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative. In addition to analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Bed rest\nB. Regular activity\nC. X-rays of the spine\nD. MRI of the spine\n"

X-rays of the spine\n\nWhile analgesics may help manage the pain initially, further evaluation and treatment should be directed towards identifying the underlying cause of the pain. X-rays can provide information about bone density, alignment, and other structural issues that could be contributing to the pain. This information is important for understanding the extent of the problem and determining the best course of action moving forward. However, it's essential to note that this is only an initial assessment and additional tests like MRI might also be recommended based on the results from x-rays. Therefore, bed rest or regular activity are unlikely to be the primary next steps without further evidence of underlying pathology."
