However, this doesn't give us the actual mean longevity directly. Instead, we can use the information about the standard deviation to find the mean by considering the negative and positive deviations equally.\n\nSince 30% of the people live longer than 75 years, we have:\n\n\\[ 30\\% = 0.30 \\]\n\nThis means half the population lives less than 75 years, and the other half lives more than 75 years.\n\nLet's denote the mean as \\( \u03bc \\). We know that the standard deviation is 14 years, so the range from which the mean falls depends on whether it's above or below the mean. \n\nIf \\( \u03bc > 75 \\), then all the people who live longer than 75 years would be considered part of the \"above\" group, contributing to an average higher than 75. If \\( \u03bc < 75 \\), then all the people who live less than 75 years would be considered part of the \"below\" group, contributing to an average lower than 75.\n\nAssuming \\( \u03bc > 75 \\), we calculate the mean as follows:\n\n\\[ \u03bc = 75 + 0.30(14) \\]\n\\[ \u03bc = 75 + 4.2 \\]\n\\[ \u03bc = 79.2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 75 - 0.4756(14) years."
