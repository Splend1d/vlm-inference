All of these options.\n\nWhile the state does pose a significant threat to human security through its actions such as violence and oppression, it also has the ability to provide basic necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare to its citizens. Additionally, the state can enforce laws that protect individuals' rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, assembly, and association. Therefore, adopting a hands-off approach towards states and policies may not be the best way to achieve human security. Instead, governments should work to promote human rights and democratic governance, and take action to address pressing issues such as poverty, inequality, and conflict."
