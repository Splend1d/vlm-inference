This is because Turner's syndrome is caused by a defect in the sex chromosome number, specifically when there is only one X chromosome instead of two (X and Y chromosomes). The presence of an extra X chromosome is characteristic of Turner's syndrome.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. They have an extra X chromosome."
