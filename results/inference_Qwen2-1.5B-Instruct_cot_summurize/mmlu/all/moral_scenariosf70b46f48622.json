Wrong, not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, cooking your baby to eat for dinner is considered morally wrong because it goes against the principles of feeding infants and young children by bottle or breastfeed. It can lead to digestive issues and other health problems. In scenario 2, putting the naughty child in the corner to give the child a time out is also considered morally wrong because it can cause physical harm to the child if they feel scared or intimidated. However, it's not necessarily morally wrong to use physical punishment to discipline a child. The key here is that both actions involve using force or causing harm to another person, which is generally considered morally wrong."
