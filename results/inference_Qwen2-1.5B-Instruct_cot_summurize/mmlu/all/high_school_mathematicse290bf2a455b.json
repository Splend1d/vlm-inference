                    "text": " The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (often denoted as $x$) that will return a valid output value.\nFor the function $f(x)=\\frac{x+6}{\\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$, we need to find the values of $x$ for which the denominator is not equal to zero and the argument inside the square root is non-negative.\nThe denominator cannot be zero because it would make the fraction undefined. So we have the inequality $x^2-3x-4>0$. This quadratic equation can be factored as $(x-4)(x+1)>0$.\nThe solutions to this inequality are $x<-1$ or $x>4$. Therefore, the domain of $f(x)$ is $(-\\infty,-1) \\cup (4,\\infty)$.\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-1) \\cup (4,\\infty)}$. However, this is not one of the given options. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nThe function $f(x)=\\frac{x+6}{\\sqrt{x^2-3x-4}}$ has a domain if the denominator is not zero and the argument inside the square root is non-negative. We already know that $x^2-3x-4>0$ has solutions $x<-1$ or $x>4$. But we also need to consider the condition that the argument inside the square root must be non-negative, i.e., $x^2-3x-4 \\geq 0$.\n\nThis inequality can be rewritten as $(x-4)(x+1) \\geq 0$. The solution to this inequality is $x \\leq -1$ or $x \\geq 4$. Combining these with the previous conditions gives the final domain: $x \\leq -1$ or $x > 4$.\n\nHowever, we need to exclude the case where the denominator becomes zero. If $x=4$, then both the numerator and the denominator become zero, making the function undefined. Therefore, we need to exclude $x=4$ from our domain.\n\nPutting everything together, the domain of $f(x)$ is $(-\\infty,-1] \\cup (4,\\infty)$. But this does not match any of the given options. Let's re-examine the problem again.\n\nWe were told that the function has a domain. This means that the values of $x$ that satisfy the inequalities $(x-4)(x+1) \\geq 0$ and $x^2-3x-4 > 0$ must be included in the domain. However, we only considered the first inequality $(x-4)(x+1) \\geq 0$. We should also consider the second inequality separately, since it is more restrictive than the first one.\n\nLet's solve the second inequality:\n$x^2-3x-4 > 0$\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\n$(x-4)(x+1) > 0$\n\nNow let's consider the two cases for the sign of the expression $(x-4)(x+1)$:\n1. When $x < -1$, both factors are negative, so their product is positive.\n2. When $x > 4$, both factors are positive, so their product is positive.\n3. When $-1 < x < 4$, one factor is negative and the other is positive, so their product is negative.\n\nTherefore, the roots of the equation $(x-4)(x+1) = 0$ are $x = 4$ and $x = -1$. Since we want the expression $(x-4)(x+1)$ to be greater than 0, we must choose the intervals where the product is positive. These intervals are $(-\\infty, -1]$ and $[4, \\infty)$. However, this does not match any of the given options either.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem once more.\n\nWe were told that the function has a domain. This means that the values of $x$ that satisfy the inequalities $(x-4)(x+1) \\geq 0$ and $x^2-3x-4 > 0$ must be included in the domain.
