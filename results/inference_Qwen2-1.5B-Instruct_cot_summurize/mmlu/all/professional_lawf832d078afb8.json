At the criminal trial, the prosecutor called a witness who had participated in the scheme with the defendant. The witness testified about the operation of the scheme and was cross-examined by the defendant's attorney. The case resulted in a mistrial. An investor who was allegedly defrauded by the scheme has now brought a civil action against the defendant. She seeks to introduce the witness's testimony from the criminal trial. The witness has testimony from the criminal trial. The witness has moved to a foreign country. Is the witness's testimony in the criminal trial admissible in the civil action?\n\nA. No, because the burden of proof in a criminal action is different from the burden of proof in a civil action.\nB. No, because the parties are not identical in the two actions.\nC. Yes, because it is prior testimony of an unavailable declarant.\nD. Yes, but only if the investor demonstrates that she was unable to obtain the testimony of the witness by deposition.\n"

In a criminal case, the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, while in a civil case, the plaintiff must prove their claim by a preponderance of the evidence. Therefore, even though the burden of proof may be different between the two cases, the witness's testimony from the criminal trial can still be admitted as prior testimony of an unavailable declarant if the investor can demonstrate that they were unable to obtain the testimony through deposition or other means."
