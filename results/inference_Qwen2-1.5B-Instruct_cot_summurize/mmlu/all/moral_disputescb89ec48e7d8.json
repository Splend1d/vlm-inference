There is a difference between rules of membership and rules about settlement within a physical territory.\n\nCentral Park, while not a state, does have its own set of rules regarding who can use it and for what purposes. This includes rules around membership, such as whether someone can join or not based on certain criteria. However, these rules do not extend beyond the boundaries of the park itself and do not apply to anyone outside of the park's physical boundaries. Therefore, the example illustrates that territorial rights belong to those who physically occupy a particular space, rather than to individuals or groups who may claim ownership over that space."
