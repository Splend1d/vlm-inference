As a result, the largest platinum mining company in the state has filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the state's platinum tax statute. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion if the mining company attacks the statute as violating the equal protection of the laws?\n\nA. The state must convince the court that the classification in the statute is rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\nB. The state must convince the court that the classification in this statute is the least restrictive means by which to advance a compelling state interest.\nC.

The mining company must convince the court that the classification in the statute is not rationally related to the advancement of a legitimate state interest.\n\nThe state's statute imposes a tax only on the extraction of platinum, while other minerals such as silver, turquoise, sulfur, and stone are not taxed. This classification based on the type of mineral extracted suggests a rational basis for taxing platinum but not other minerals. Therefore, the mining company must prove that the classification is not rationally related to advancing a legitimate state interest.\n\nIt is important to note that the burden of proof lies with the party challenging the law (in this case, the mining company). They must demonstrate that the classification is not rationally related to the state's interest."
