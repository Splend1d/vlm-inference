Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves pretending to commit murder, which is not only illegal but also goes against ethical principles such as respect for human life and consent. It's considered morally wrong because it causes harm to another person without their consent or permission. \n\nScenario 2 involves getting angry after finding a plastic bag floating on a lake, which is a normal emotional response to a negative event. However, it doesn't involve any action that breaks any laws or violates anyone else's rights. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong."
