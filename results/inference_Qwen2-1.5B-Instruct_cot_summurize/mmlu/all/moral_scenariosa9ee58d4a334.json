Stuffing popcorn into a zipper bag can be seen as wasteful and disrespectful to the contents of the bag. Additionally, it could potentially cause harm or damage to the bag itself.\nScenario 2, on the other hand, is considered not wrong by most people's moral standards because it shows empathy and compassion towards an animal in need. Consoaning someone who is sick and helpless is also generally considered to be a positive act of kindness.\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong."
