Eisenhower made against the \"military-industrial complex\" in his farewell address was C. that military spending gave the arms industry unwarranted influence on politics and government. In his speech, he warned about the concentration of power in the hands of a few corporations, particularly those involved in the defense industry, and expressed concern about the potential for these interests to exert undue influence over government policy. He also criticized what he saw as the growing militarization of society and the potential for the military-industrial complex to become a threat to national security."
