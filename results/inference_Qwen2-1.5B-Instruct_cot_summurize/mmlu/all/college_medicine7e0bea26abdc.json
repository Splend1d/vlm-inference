The Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency depends on three factors: the speed of sound in the medium, the time of interaction between the sound source and detector, and the distance between them. The fourth factor (frequency of emitted sound) does not directly affect the perceived frequency of the sound.\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer."
