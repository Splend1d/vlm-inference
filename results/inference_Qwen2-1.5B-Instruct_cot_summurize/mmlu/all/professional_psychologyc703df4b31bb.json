Members supporting the minority position are most likely to change the opinion of the majority when they are consistent in expressing their opinion without appearing dogmatic. This approach allows them to build credibility and trust with the majority, which can lead to more open and respectful dialogue and ultimately result in a better outcome for both groups. It also helps to prevent the minority from being marginalized or ignored, as consistency and respect for diversity can help to foster a sense of community and cooperation."
