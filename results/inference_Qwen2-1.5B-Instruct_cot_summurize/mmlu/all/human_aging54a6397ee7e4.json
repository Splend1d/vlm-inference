This can be attributed to various factors such as life events, personal struggles, and societal pressures.\n\nWhile it is true that some people may have high levels of happiness due to their circumstances or personality traits, there is no consensus on which group experiences higher levels of well-being. Therefore, option A (unhappy people) cannot be considered a definitive answer.\n\nOption B (older adults) might be one possible explanation for the paradox of well-being, as older age is often associated with increased stress, health issues, and social isolation, which can negatively impact well-being.\n\nOption C (people with very low SES) could also contribute to the paradox because low socioeconomic status has been linked to lower levels of well-being in general.\n\nOption D (terminally ill people) does not fit the description of \"very low SES\" since terminally ill people typically have significant resources and access to healthcare, which can improve their quality of life.\n\nIn summary, the paradox of well-being is best explained by considering multiple factors including life events, personal struggles, societal pressures, and individual differences in resilience and coping mechanisms."
