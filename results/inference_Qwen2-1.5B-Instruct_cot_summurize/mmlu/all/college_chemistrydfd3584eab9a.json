In this case, the frequency differences are:\n\n\u0394\u03bd = 3174 G - 3074 G = 100 G\n\nSince there are four hyperfine levels, each separated by 100 G, we can divide the total frequency difference by 4 to find the frequency difference between any two adjacent hyperfine levels:\n\n\u0394\u03bd/4 = 100 G / 4 = 25 G\n\nNext, we need to find the energy gap \u0394E between these hyperfine levels. Since the X-band EPR spectrum is centered at 9.5 GHz, we know that the energy gap must be related to the magnetic field strength B using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = \\frac{h c}{4 \\pi B^2} \\]\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 Js), c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10^8 m/s), and B is the magnetic field strength. However, since we don't have the specific value of B from the given data, we'll proceed assuming it's known for the sake of calculation. Let's assume B = 3074 G (which matches one of the resonance frequencies).\n\nNow, substituting the values into our equation for \u0394E:\n\n\u0394E = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)(3.00 x 10^8 m/s)/(4 pi(3074 G)^2)\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\u0394E \u2248 1.24 x 10^-22 J\n\nFinally, we can plug this value back into our equation for g:\n\ng = \u0394\u03bd / \u0394E \u2248 25 G / 1.24 x 10^-22 J\n\nSimplifying:\n\ng \u2248 2.005\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. g = 2.005."
