A reporter announces which candidate leads in a public opinion poll.\n\nAn example of horse-race journalism is when a journalist or media outlet predicts or analyzes the outcomes of upcoming elections, political events, or other significant events based on public polls and surveys. This type of reporting can be seen as biased or manipulative because it often prioritizes the outcome over the process itself. Horse-race journalism is typically criticized for its lack of objectivity and its tendency to manipulate public perception through sensationalism and hyperbole."
