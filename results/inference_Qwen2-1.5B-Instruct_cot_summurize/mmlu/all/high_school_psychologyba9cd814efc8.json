Rebecca cancels her credit card to avoid paying the annual fee but plans to reinstate it in the new year.\n\nOperant conditioning refers to the process by which behavior changes as a result of consequences (positive or negative) associated with those behaviors. In this case, Rebecca's decision to cancel her credit card was motivated by a desire to save money, which led to a change in behavior. However, she also planned to restore the credit card in the future, indicating that there may have been some level of regret or guilt associated with her initial decision to cancel it. Therefore, option C is the best example of operant conditioning."
