A growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad\n\nBoth acts were passed to restrict immigration based on factors related to labor and employment, rather than race or religion. They both sought to limit the number of Chinese workers entering the United States and Australia, respectively, due to concerns about their potential impact on local economies and social structures.\n\nIn contrast, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was specifically designed to exclude Chinese immigrants from the United States because of fears they would compete with American laborers and take jobs away from them. It also targeted Chinese immigrants for fear of their political beliefs, particularly those who supported the Qing dynasty and opposed Western influence in China.\n\nThe Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 illustrate the broader trend of anti-immigrant sentiment in the late 19th century and early 20th century, where governments sought to control immigration and protect domestic industries and job markets from competition from foreigners. This reflects the broader economic and social changes taking place during this time period, including the growth of industrialization, urbanization, and globalization."
