Dietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas\nB. Food in the stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid secretion\nC. Short-chain fatty acids which move from colon to caecum (reflux) promote ileo-caecal motility\nD. The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the \"fasting\" to the \"feeding\" pattern.\n"

The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the \"fasting\" to the \"feeding\" pattern.\n\nThis statement is not true because the arrival of fat in the duodenum does not cause an immediate reduction in motility. In fact, studies have shown that fat intake can actually stimulate the small intestine to increase its motility and produce more digestive enzymes. This process is known as the \"lipid-induced phase shift,\" where fat digestion shifts the normal gut motility pattern towards faster rates of motility and enzyme production. Therefore, option D is incorrect."
