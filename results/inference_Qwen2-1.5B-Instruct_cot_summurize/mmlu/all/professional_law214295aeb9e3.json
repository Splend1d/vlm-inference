Since Friday was the Fourth of July, the judge asked the jurors to return on Monday. The trial began again on Monday morning at 8:30. By late evening the judge had instructed the jury. Due to the lateness of the hour, the jurors were sequestered for the evening to allow them to get an early start the next morning. The jurors returned Tuesday morning and were unable to reach a verdict. Unable to reach a verdict, the trial judge allowed the jurors to go home that evening. On Wednesday morning, the jury assembled and returned a verdict of guilty. On appeal, which of the following is Billy's strongest issue for seeking a reversal?\n\nA. The fact that the jurors did not begin to consider evidence until several days after they were empaneled.\nB. The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after being sworn.\nC. The fact that the jury took several days to return a verdict.\nD. The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations.\n"

The fact that the jurors did not begin to consider evidence until several days after they were empaneled.\n\nWhen a juror is sworn in, they are typically provided information about the case, including the charges against the defendant, the evidence that will be presented, and any relevant background information. However, this information may not be shared immediately upon their swearing in, as it can take time for all parties involved to review and understand the details of the case.\n\nIn this scenario, the jurors were sworn in on a Thursday afternoon and given information about the case by the judge. However, it appears that they were not formally sworn-in or provided with all necessary information about the case until later in the week. This delay could have affected their ability to effectively consider the evidence and make informed decisions during the trial.\n\nTherefore, option A is the strongest issue for Billy to seek a reversal based on the given information."
