(c) Bulk shipments for resale within the United States of books, pamphlets, flags, decorations or other symbols, excepting, however, scientific, technical, and literary works intended for scholarly purpose. . . \"The State Department designated a foreign country, as an \"assisting country,\" on the basis of its determination that medical supplies collected by public donation in this country had been sent to another country currently engaged in hostilities with the United States. As a consequence, the Treasury Department issued an order barring practically all products and goods from this foreign country into the United States. A distributor of state and foreign flags, has had a lucrative contract with the foreign country for the importation and sale of their flags in the United States. However, because of the Treasury Department's order, the foreign country is now barred from importing any of its flags into the United States. In an appropriate federal court, the distributor brings a suit against the Secretary of State and the Treasury Department to set aside the order barring the foreign country's imports on the grounds that it is inconsistent with the principles of our constitutional form of government. Which of the following is the most proper disposition of the distributor's suit by the federal court?\n\nA. Suit dismissed, because the distributor does not have standing to bring this action.\nB. Suit dismissed, because there is no adversity between the distributor and the defendants.\nC. Suit dismissed, because it presents a nonjusticiable political question.\nD. Suit dismissed, because it presents a moot issue.\n"
