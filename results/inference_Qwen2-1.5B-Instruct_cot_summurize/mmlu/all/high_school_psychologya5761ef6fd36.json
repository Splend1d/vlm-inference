                    "text": "The correct answer is B. People tend to stay in a slightly elevated state of arousal after a crisis has occurred because their brains and bodies are still responding to the stressor that caused the crisis, even though the immediate threat may no longer be present. This is known as the \"fight or flight\" response, which involves increased heart rate, blood pressure, and other physiological responses that prepare the body for action or defense against a perceived danger. Even after the crisis has passed, these responses can persist in the form of chronic stress, which can have negative effects on mental and physical health."
