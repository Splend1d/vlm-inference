In this case, since the patient's father was a carrier of the hemophilia gene and the fetus is XX, it means that the fetus has a 50% chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene and becoming a carrier or developing hemophilia if exposed to the disease-causing factor. However, since the mother is not a carrier of the gene, she does not pass on the hemophilia gene to the fetus."
