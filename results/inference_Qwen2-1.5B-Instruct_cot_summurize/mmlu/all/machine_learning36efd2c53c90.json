True, False.\n\nThe F1 score and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) are both important metrics in machine learning, but they have different applications and purposes.\n\nThe F1 score, also known as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is a measure that combines both precision and recall into a single metric. Precision measures how many true positives were found out of all positive predictions made by an algorithm, while recall measures how many true positives were actually found out of all relevant samples. Therefore, the F1 score provides a balance between the two, giving more weight to precision when there are few positive samples and less weight to recall when there are many positive samples.\n\nOn the other hand, the AUC is a metric that measures the ability of an anomaly detector to distinguish between normal and anomalous data points. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate better performance. Anomaly detection systems often use multiple metrics such as F1 score, AUC, and confusion matrix to evaluate their performance.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 is false because it suggests that the F1 score is particularly useful for datasets with high class imbalance, which may not always be the case. Statement 2 is true because the AUC is indeed one of the main metrics used to assess anomaly detectors."
