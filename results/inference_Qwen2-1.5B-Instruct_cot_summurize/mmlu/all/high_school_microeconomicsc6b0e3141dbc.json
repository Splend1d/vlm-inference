Placing limits on the quantity that can be produced. \n\nIn a free market economy, there is often too much supply and not enough demand for certain goods, leading to inefficiencies such as excess production and waste. By setting limits on the quantity that can be produced, the government can help to correct this imbalance and ensure that resources are allocated more efficiently.\n\nThis approach is known as \"market regulation\" or \"price controls,\" which involve setting prices below what they would otherwise be in order to reduce overproduction and stimulate demand. The goal is to create an equilibrium where supply meets demand and resources are used most effectively. This can include measures like quotas, tariffs, and subsidies.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that government intervention in markets can have unintended consequences and may not always lead to the desired outcome. Therefore, careful consideration and monitoring are needed when implementing any form of market regulation."
