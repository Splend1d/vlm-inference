So the correct answer is B: select new network members based on emotional factors. The theory posits that older adults tend to focus their social interactions on those who share similar values, beliefs, interests, and emotions, which can lead to fewer overall connections but stronger ones within existing groups. This is in contrast to younger individuals who may be more likely to form new friendships and expand their social circle through casual encounters or online interactions."
