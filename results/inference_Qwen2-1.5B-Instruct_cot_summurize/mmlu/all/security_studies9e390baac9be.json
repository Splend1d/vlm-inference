Technological advancements have to some extent rendered the battlefield gender-neutral. 'Virtual' warfare has resolved the historical tension between the citizen and the state security apparatus; if actual combat could be avoided then male and female soldiers could wage war on equal terms. However, technological advancement remains unequal and so the gender situation is different in different contexts, depending on development and security issues.\nB. The technological capacity to wage war with minimal civilian costs has abolished the threat of physical and biological gender victimization. The contemporary gender divide is structured on 'soft' issues associated with socio-economic hardship.\nC. Conflict in warfare and the gender divide between men and women is centred on the historical contract between the individual and the state. The 'right to fight' debate has equal meaning and saliency across the globe, and is universally applicable in all situations.\nD. Nuclear armaments and the threat of mass destruction have rendered the battlefield gender neutral in terms of its destructive capabilities. Whilst historically conventional warfare was conducted on the battlefield in which women were particularly vulnerable to violence, and post-conflict sexual violence, these threats no longer exist.\n"

Technological advancements have made the battlefield more gender-neutral. However, this is not always true because there are still significant differences in how technology is used by men and women.\n\nB. The threat of physical and biological gender victimization has been reduced due to advances in technology. This means that women may be less likely to experience violence during wartime or conflict.\n\nC. The issue of \"the right to fight\" is complex and varies from country to country. Some countries may allow women to participate in military service, while others may not.\n\nD. Nuclear weapons have rendered the battlefield gender-neutral in terms of its destructive capabilities. However, this does not mean that women are not at risk of harm during nuclear conflicts. Women can also be targeted by non-state actors who use nuclear weapons for political purposes."
