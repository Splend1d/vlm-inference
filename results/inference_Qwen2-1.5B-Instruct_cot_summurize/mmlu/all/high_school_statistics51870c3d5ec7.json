Convert the time from seconds to minutes.\n2. Calculate the standard deviation of the times in minutes.\n3. Use the formula for Standardized Score (z-score) which is:\n   \\( \\text{Standardized Score} = \\frac{\\text{Value - Mean}}{\\text{Standard Deviation}} \\)\n4. The value for the Standardized Score will remain the same since we're only changing the units.\n\nGiven that one student's time had a standardized score of \\( z = 2.40 \\), let's assume this time was originally given in seconds. Let's say the original time in seconds was \\( T_{\\text{original}} \\).\n\nThe time would have been converted into minutes by dividing it by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). So, if the original time was \\( T_{\\text{original}} \\) seconds, then after conversion to minutes, the time would be \\( \\frac{T_{\\text{original}}}{60} \\) minutes.\n\nAfter converting to minutes, the student's standardized score remains the same because we're just changing the units. Therefore, the student's standardized score when the time is expressed in minutes is still \\( z = 2.40 \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is **D. z = 2.40**."
