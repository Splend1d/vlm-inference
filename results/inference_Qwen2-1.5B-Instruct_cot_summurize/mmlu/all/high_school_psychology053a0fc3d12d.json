Chemicals travel from one neuron to another, influencing whether a neuron will fire or not.\n\nNeurons communicate by sending electrical signals called action potentials along their axons, which can then be detected by other neurons via specialized structures on their dendrites. The strength of these signals is regulated by chemical messengers that are released during synaptic transmission. These chemicals act as neurotransmitters, allowing information to flow between neurons in a bidirectional manner."
