In exchange for $1 received this day, I agree that you can have one month from today's date to decide whether to accept this offer. \"The first student then signed the paper and handed it to the second student. The second student handed a one dollar bill to the first student and left. One week later, the second student succeeded in obtaining a $1,000 loan from his parents. He then telephoned the first student to accept the offer. Upon hearing the second student say hello, and before the second student could accept the offer, the first student said, \"I've changed my mind. I do not want to sell my car. \"Can the second student still accept the first student's offer?\n\nA. No, because $1 is inadequate consideration.\nB. No, because the first student's statement was unequivocal notice that he no longer wished to contract with the second student.\nC. Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\nD. Yes, based on the principal of promissory estoppel.\n"

Yes, based on the principle of promissory estoppel.\n\nPromissory estoppel is a legal doctrine that prevents a party from denying a promise made by another party due to subsequent conduct or circumstances that led the other party to reasonably rely upon the promise. In this case, the first student made a clear and definite offer to sell their car for $1,000, which they later revoked without any further communication or justification.\n\nThe second student relied on the original offer and agreed to pay $1,000 for the car, even though the offer had been withdrawn. This reliance on the offer led the second student to take action to obtain financing, such as calling the first student to make an acceptance of the offer. However, the first student's withdrawal of the offer without any explanation means that the second student cannot now deny the validity of the original offer under the principle of promissory estoppel.\n\nTherefore, the second student cannot accept the first student's offer because it has become impossible to rely on the original offer due to the first student's unilateral decision to withdraw it without any explanation."
