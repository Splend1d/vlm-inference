Collection of samples from deep boreholes drilled into Earth\n\nThe collection of samples from deep boreholes drilled into Earth is the most comprehensive way to study the structure of Earth's core, mantle, and lower crust. These samples provide detailed information on the composition, temperature, pressure, and fluid content of these regions. By analyzing the chemical and isotopic compositions of the rocks and minerals in these samples, scientists can gain insights into the history of Earth's interior and how it has evolved over time."
