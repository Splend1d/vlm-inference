This is because checking accounts are typically considered \"deposits\" rather than loans, and they do not require as much capital to be lent out as other types of loans. Therefore, the banks would have fewer excess reserves to lend out, which would reduce their ability to create money. So, option D is the correct answer. Option A, B, and C do not affect the ability to create money through fractional reserve banking."
