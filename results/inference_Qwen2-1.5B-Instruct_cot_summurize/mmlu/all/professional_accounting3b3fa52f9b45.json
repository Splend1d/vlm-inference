This type of demand curve is often associated with luxury goods or services where consumers are willing and able to pay higher prices for them despite the increased cost. In this case, a 4% price increase leads to a 6% decrease in the quantity demanded, indicating that the relationship between price and quantity demanded is relatively stable."
