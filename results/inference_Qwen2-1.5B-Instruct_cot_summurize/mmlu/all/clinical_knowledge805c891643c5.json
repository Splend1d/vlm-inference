Impulses for pain travel principally up the dorsal columns.\n\nSensory assessment of the arm typically involves testing pain, proprioception (sense of body position and orientation), and vibration sense. The pain response can be assessed using a venepuncture needle or other means that do not cause significant discomfort to the patient. Proprioception, which is the awareness of one's own position and movement in space, can be tested by asking the patient to perform various movements such as reaching out their arms or moving their fingers. Vibration sense can be assessed by placing a tuning fork at different frequencies over the patient's skin and listening for vibrations. \n\nRegarding the movement of impulses for pain, it is primarily carried down the spinal cord rather than up. The trunk and limbs have separate nerve roots that carry pain signals, and the dorsal column-medullary tracts are responsible for transmitting these signals from the brainstem to the spinal cord and then on to the lower extremities. Therefore, the correct statement is:\n\nD. Impulses for pain travel principally up the dorsal columns."
