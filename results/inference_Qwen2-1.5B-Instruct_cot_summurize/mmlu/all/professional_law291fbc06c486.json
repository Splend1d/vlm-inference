However, this does not necessarily mean that they cannot produce documents or other tangible evidence related to their case. In this situation, the government can still obtain the records through other means, such as obtaining them through a search warrant or through an administrative subpoena. Alternatively, if the government has already obtained the records through a previous investigation, it could still use those records in the current case without violating the Fifth Amendment."
