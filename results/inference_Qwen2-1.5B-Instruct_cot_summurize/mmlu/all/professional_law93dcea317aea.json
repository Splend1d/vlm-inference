At trial, the alleged cocaine no longer exists, and the only evidence that the substance sold was cocaine is the informant's testimony that it tasted like cocaine and gave her a cocaine-like sensation. The informant has no formal training in identifying controlled substances. Should the court admit the informant's opinion testimony that the substance was cocaine?\n\nA. No, because identification of a controlled substance requires an expert with formal training.\nB. No, because, without a quantity of the controlled substance for testing, opinion testimony is insufficient to make a prima facie case against the defendant.\nC. Yes, if the court determines that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine.\nD. Yes, provided there is evidence sufficient to support a jury finding that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine.\n"

Yes, provided there is evidence sufficient to support a jury finding that the informant has sufficient knowledge and experience to identify cocaine. This means that the court should consider whether the informant has received proper training or education in identifying controlled substances and whether they have the necessary expertise to make an informed opinion on the type of substance being tested. Additionally, the court may also consider other factors such as the reliability of the informant's testimony, the weight of any other evidence presented at trial, and the overall strength of the case against the defendant. Ultimately, the court must balance these factors and determine whether the informant's opinion testimony meets the legal standards for admissibility."
