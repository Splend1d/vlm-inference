The result of dividing the dividend by the divisor is called the quotient.\n\nFor example:\n- If you have 45 and you want to divide it by 9, you would do:\n\\[ \\frac{45}{9} = 5 \\]\n\nThis means that 9 goes into 45 five times without any remainder.\n\nNow let's apply this concept to your question:\n\nGiven \\(30,000\\) divided by \\(10\\):\n\n1. First division: \\(30,000 \\div 10 = 3,000\\)\n\n2. Second division: Since \\(3,000\\) is already divisible by \\(10\\), there's no need for further division. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is **D. 3,000**."
