The Double-blind study is not one of the conditions sanctioned by the APA regarding the use of deception in a study. \n\nIn general, when conducting a double-blind study, neither the researchers nor the participants know who is receiving which treatment or condition. This helps to reduce bias and ensure that the results are objective.\n\nHowever, even in a double-blind study, it is still possible for researchers to manipulate variables in order to achieve their goals. Therefore, if the researcher manipulates variables or uses deception in a way that affects the outcome of the study, it would violate ethical guidelines such as those set forth by the APA.\n\nIt's important to note that while deception can sometimes be necessary for certain types of studies, it should always be done with care and consideration for the well-being of the participants involved."
