In other words, it's the smallest current that can cause the thyristor to turn on and remain on until the gate voltage is removed.\n\nGiven that the holding current (I_holding) of the thyristor is 2 mA, we need to find the latching current (I_latching). \n\nSince I_holding = 2 mA = 0.002 A,\nthe latching current will be half of this value because the thyristor must maintain the same level of current to stay on once turned on. So,\n\nI_latching = I_holding / 2 = 0.002 A / 2 = 0.001 A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 0.01 A."
