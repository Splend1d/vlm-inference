A decrease in taxes and selling bonds in an open market operation.\n\nWhen the economy is experiencing low demand, increasing taxes can reduce consumer spending and investment, leading to a reduction in overall economic activity. Selling bonds in an open market operation also reduces money supply, which can lead to a decrease in inflation and economic growth.\n\nOn the other hand, when the economy is experiencing high demand, decreasing taxes can stimulate consumer spending and investment, leading to increased economic activity. Increasing government spending can also help boost economic growth by providing more goods and services to consumers.\n\nTherefore, a combination of lowering taxes and selling bonds in an open market operation would be the most likely policy combination to bring the economy to its current level of real GDP, while maintaining full employment."
