The subaltern refers to populations that are marginalised or outside of the hegemonic power structure.\n\nPostcolonial theory, which emerged in the 1970s and 80s, critiques Western scholarship on colonialism and argues for an understanding of history that takes into account the perspectives of marginalized groups. The concept of the \"subaltern\" was developed by Indian scholar Gayatri Spivak, who argued that colonialism not only imposed new forms of domination but also created a sense of alienation among colonized peoples. She coined the term \"subaltern\" to describe these people who were neither fully part of the dominant class nor the oppressed, and thus felt both excluded and disempowered. This perspective has been influential in many fields including literature, philosophy, sociology, and cultural studies."
