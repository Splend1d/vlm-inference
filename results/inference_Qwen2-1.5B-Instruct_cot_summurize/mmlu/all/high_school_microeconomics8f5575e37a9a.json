A monopsony buys from a monopoly. \n\nIn a monopsony, one employer (in this case the monopoly) has the power to hire workers for their products or services. Therefore, they have the ability to buy labor from multiple sources. On the other hand, in a monopoly, there is only one seller of a product or service, so they cannot simultaneously buy and sell to two different types of consumers.\n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect because a monopoly does not have the ability to sell to two different types of consumers at the same time. Option C is also incorrect because a monopoly can still sell its product or service to another buyer, but it cannot buy from another buyer simultaneously. Option D is also incorrect because a monopolist does not necessarily sell two different types of goods."
