In this case, female applicants may have certain traits that make them less attractive to employers, but these same traits can also lead to better job performance once hired.\n\nAdverse impact refers to situations where an action or policy has a negative effect on a protected group, such as women in this case. Differential selection and adverse impact are both related to discrimination, but they differ in their focus. Differential selection focuses on the unequal selection of groups based on their attributes, while adverse impact focuses on the effects of policies or actions on specific groups.\n\nDifferece validity refers to the differences between different types of assessments or tests. It does not relate to the selection process itself.\n\nUnfairness is a broader concept that encompasses many forms of discrimination, including differential selection and adverse impact, among others."
