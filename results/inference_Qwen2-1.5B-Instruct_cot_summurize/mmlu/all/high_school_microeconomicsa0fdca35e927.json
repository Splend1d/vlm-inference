A decrease in the price of ice cream, a complimentary good to ice cream cones\n\nComplimentary goods are those that are consumed together and cannot be used independently. In this case, if the price of ice cream cones decreases, it means consumers can buy more ice cream cones with their budget, which would lead to increased demand for ice cream cones. On the other hand, if the price of ice cream increases, it may reduce demand as people might opt for less expensive alternatives like lollipops or other sweet treats. However, if the price of ice cream remains constant but the price of lollipops decreases, it could also potentially increase demand for ice cream cones because people may perceive them as being more affordable relative to the lollipops."
