This means that the firm can charge higher prices to consumers who are willing to pay more and lower prices to those who are not willing to pay as much. As a result, the monopolist can earn more revenue than a non-discriminating monopoly by charging higher prices to customers who are willing to pay more.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a discriminating monopoly does have a demand curve that is more elastic than a non-discriminating monopoly. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that a discriminating monopoly earns less revenue than a non-discriminating monopoly, which is not necessarily true.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that a discriminating monopoly will produce less than a non-discriminating monopoly, but this is not necessarily true either. The choice of production level depends on many factors such as the cost structure, competition in the market, and the ability of the firm to adjust its production levels quickly and efficiently."
