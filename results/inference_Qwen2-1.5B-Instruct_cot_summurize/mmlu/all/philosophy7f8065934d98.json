He believed that pleasure and pain are subjective experiences that depend on individual values and preferences. Therefore, he argued that utilitarianism should focus on promoting the greatest good for the greatest number, which could include both positive and negative pleasures. This view contrasts with the more narrow conception of utilitarianism that focuses only on maximizing positive pleasures, which Mill defended in his later work."
