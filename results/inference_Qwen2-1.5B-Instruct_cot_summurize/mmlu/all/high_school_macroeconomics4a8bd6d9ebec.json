When the government increases its spending, it creates an additional amount of money that flows into the economy. This influx of money can lead to higher interest rates and lower inflation, which can crowd out private sector borrowing and investment. On the other hand, if the government implements expansionary monetary policy along with fiscal policy, this could help to boost aggregate demand and prevent crowding out. However, the extent to which crowding out occurs will depend on the elasticity of the investment demand curve, which measures how much the quantity of investment responds to changes in the price level. If the investment demand curve is elastic, then the impact of crowding out may be greater."
