The state called the homeowner to testify, but his identification testimony was inconclusive. The homeowner testified that he was asleep during the burglary and awoke as the burglar was fleeing the premises. The homeowner admitted that he didn't see the face of the burglar and couldn't even tell whether the person was male or female. Thereafter, the prosecution offers evidence that at the time of the burglary, the defendant needed money to defend himself against other burglary charges. This proffered evidence should be\n\nA. admitted without restriction as probative evidence of motive.\nB. admitted, provided the court instructs the jury to limit use of the evidence to the defendant's motive to burglarize.\nC. excluded as lacking any probative value.\nD. excluded as substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.\n"

In this case, the proffered evidence of the defendant's need for money to defend against other burglary charges may have been relevant to show motive for committing the crime, but it is likely to be unfairly prejudicial because it could lead the jury to conclude that the defendant had a legitimate reason to commit the crime and therefore lacked the intent required to convict him of burglary. Therefore, the evidence should be excluded."
