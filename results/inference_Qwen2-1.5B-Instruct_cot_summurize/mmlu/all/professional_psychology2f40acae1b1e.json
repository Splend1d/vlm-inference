Therefore, option C (contacting the client first) would be the most appropriate course of action. It shows respect for the client's autonomy and allows the psychologist to take steps to ensure that the client understands the situation and has the opportunity to address any concerns or objections before proceeding with legal action.\n\nOption A (not using a collection agency) may be seen as unethical if it involves taking advantage of the client's vulnerability or lack of financial resources. Option B (using a collection agency only if informed beforehand) also raises questions about the psychologist's responsibility to provide adequate information and support to the client.\n\nOption D (using a collection agency only as a \"last resort\") acknowledges the importance of addressing potential issues proactively but still leaves the door open for the possibility of using a collection agency if other options fail. This approach can be seen as more flexible and adaptable than simply relying on a last-minute decision."
