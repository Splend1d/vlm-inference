This migration led to the creation of new neighborhoods and communities where people of different races and ethnicities could live together. While some ethnic groups were able to integrate into mainstream society, the black population often remained in the city's ghettos due to systemic racism and discrimination. This led to a situation where many African Americans felt marginalized and isolated from the rest of society. However, it also helped to create a more diverse and inclusive community in Chicago."
