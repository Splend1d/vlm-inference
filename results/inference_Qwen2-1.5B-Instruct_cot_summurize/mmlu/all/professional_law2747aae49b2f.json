The defendant has pleaded not guilty, claiming that he made an honest mistake as to the date the expenses were paid. At trial, the prosecutor offers evidence of the defendant's involvement in an earlier scheme to help a different client falsify tax returns in the same way. Is the evidence of the defendant's involvement in the earlier scheme admissible?\n\nA. No, because it is impermissible character evidence.\nB. No, because it is not relevant to the issues in this case.\nC. Yes, to show absence of mistake.\nD. Yes, to show the defendant's propensity to commit the crime.\n"

Evidence of the defendant's involvement in the earlier scheme can be used to show that he did not make an honest mistake and was aware of the potential consequences of filing false tax returns. This can be relevant to the issue of whether the defendant's actions were intentional or reckless, which is important in determining guilt. However, it is generally not appropriate to use such evidence to attack the defendant's credibility or character, as that would be impermissible character evidence."
