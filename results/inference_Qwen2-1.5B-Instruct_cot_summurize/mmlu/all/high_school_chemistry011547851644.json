The formula for work is:\n\nWork = Pressure x Volume change\n\nFirst, let's find the volume change:\n\nVolume change = Final volume - Initial volume = 2 liters - 2 liters = 0 liters\n\nNow, substitute the values into the formula:\n\nWork = 0.8 atmospheres x 0 liters = 0 atmospheres\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the negative value of the work (since work is usually measured as a positive quantity), we can conclude that the work done by the gas is -0 atmospheres.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. -3.2 L atm."
