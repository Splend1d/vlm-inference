When you add two polynomials together, the degrees of their variables will determine the new degree of the resulting polynomial.\n\nStatement 2 is false because not all ideals of F[x] are necessarily principal. For example, if F is the set of real numbers with addition and multiplication defined as usual, but F[x] denotes the set of all polynomials over F, then F[x] does not have any non-zero prime ideals. In other words, it's possible for an ideal to be generated by a single element, but it can also be generated by multiple elements. Therefore, statement 2 is not always true."
