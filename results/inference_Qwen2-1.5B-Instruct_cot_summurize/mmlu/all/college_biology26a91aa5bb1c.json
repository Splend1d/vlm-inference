However, photoperiod is more important for initiating flowering than circadian rhythm because it directly affects the availability of light energy, which is essential for photosynthesis and\u5f00\u82b1\u8fc7\u7a0b. Other factors such as changing air temperature and fluctuations in abscisic acid levels may also affect flowering but are less direct and specific to photoperiod.\n\nTherefore, B is the most reliable environmental signal that a plant in a temperate ecosystem could use to initiate flowering at the correct time of the year."
