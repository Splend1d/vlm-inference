The total power can be calculated as the sum of the squares of the individual wattmeters' readings.\n\nIf we assume that the two wattmeters measure the same load current and voltage (and therefore have the same power factor), then their readings will add up to give us the total power. However, since they are not directly connected in parallel, the power factor of the system cannot be determined from this method alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. None of above."
