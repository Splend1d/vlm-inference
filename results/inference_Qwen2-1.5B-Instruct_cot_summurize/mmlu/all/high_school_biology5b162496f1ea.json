                    "text": "The process of allopatric speciation, also known as geographical speciation or endosymbiotic speciation, is often summarized as:\n\nD. Geographic isolation \u2192 reproductive isolation \u2192 differential changes in allele frequencies \u2192 reproductive barriers \u2192 new species\n\nThis process involves two main stages: \n\n1. Geographic isolation - This occurs when populations become separated by physical barriers such as mountains, rivers, deserts, etc., preventing gene flow between them.\n\n2. Reproductive isolation - Once populations are isolated from each other, they may develop different genetic variations due to their reduced exposure to each other's genes. This can lead to differences in phenotype and morphology, which can then evolve into distinct species over time.\n\n3. Differential changes in allele frequencies - As populations diverge, there will be differential changes in allele frequencies within each population. This means that some alleles will become more common while others become less common.\n\n4. Reproductive barriers - These arise when individuals from different populations cannot interbreed successfully with each other because of physical or behavioral constraints (e.g., males not able to fertilize eggs from females).\n\n5. New species - After enough time has passed for these processes to occur, the resulting populations with increased genetic diversity and fewer reproductive barriers will eventually evolve into distinct species through further divergence.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most accurate summary of the process of allopatric speciation."
