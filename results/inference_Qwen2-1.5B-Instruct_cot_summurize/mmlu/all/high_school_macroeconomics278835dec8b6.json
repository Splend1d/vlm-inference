This allows economists to compare how prices have changed over time, which is important for understanding inflation and deflation. \n\nOption A, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), measures changes in the price level of a basket of goods and services that households purchase on an average basis. While it can provide insight into inflation, it does not measure changes in the price level of national output itself.\n\nOption B, the Real Interest Rate, measures the change in real income per unit of time rather than the change in prices. It is used to gauge the cost of borrowing and lending money, but it does not directly measure changes in the price level of national output.\n\nOption C, the Unemployment Rate, measures the percentage of people who are unemployed relative to the labor force. While it can indicate economic health, it does not measure changes in the price level of national output either."
