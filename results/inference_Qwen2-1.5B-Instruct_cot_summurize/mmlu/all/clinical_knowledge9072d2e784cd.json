This involves placing the index finger of one hand on the nail bed and the middle finger on the nail plate, with the thumb resting on the base of the nail. The person then places their other hand on top of the first two fingers and applies pressure to the nails. If there is any movement or flapping of the nail bed, it indicates that there may be clubbing present. This method is considered more accurate than simply inspecting the nail-bed angle from above or assessing the fluctuancy of the nail-bed, as it provides a more direct and objective assessment of the condition."
