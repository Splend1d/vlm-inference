Waardenburg syndrome is caused by mutations in the FOXP1 gene, which codes for a protein that regulates cell growth and differentiation. It is characterized by abnormalities in the skin, eyes, and hair, as well as a tendency to develop certain types of cancer. The other options listed (achondroplasia, crouzon syndrome, thanatophoric dysplasia) are all caused by mutations in genes related to FGFR3, which encode receptors for fibroblast growth factor proteins."
