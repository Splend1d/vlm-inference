This shortage could put pressure on wages, as employers compete for workers who can provide the necessary skills and expertise. As a result, labor productivity could decline if businesses struggle to find enough skilled workers to meet demand.\n\nOn the other hand, the shrinking labor force could also create new opportunities for those who are willing to work longer hours or at lower pay, which could help stimulate economic growth by boosting consumer spending and investment.\n\nIn summary, while the shrinking labor force could potentially impact both labor productivity and economic growth, the exact effects would depend on various factors such as the rate of retirement, the availability of replacement workers, and the overall economy."
