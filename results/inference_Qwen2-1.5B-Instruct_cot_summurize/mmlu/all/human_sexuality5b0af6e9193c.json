This procedure involves taking eggs from Xena and sperm from her partner, fertilizing them in a laboratory setting, and then transferring the resulting embryo back into her uterus. This can increase the chances of successful pregnancy by providing an opportunity to select embryos that have a higher chance of developing into healthy babies. Artificial insemination may also be considered if it is safe for Xena's body, but IVF offers more control over the process and potential for better outcomes."
