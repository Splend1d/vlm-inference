It is calculated as the product-moment correlation between the observed agreement matrix (which is the cross-tabulation of ratings) and the expected agreement matrix (which would be perfect if both raters were perfectly consistent). The kappa coefficient ranges from -1 to +1, with values closer to 1 indicating higher levels of agreement.\nIn summary, the kappa coefficient is a measure of agreement between raters, particularly when they use a scale or rating system, such as the INTER-SCORER reliability method."
