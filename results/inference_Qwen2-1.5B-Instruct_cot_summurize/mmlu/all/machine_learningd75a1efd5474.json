                    "text": "Statement 1: The softmax function is commonly used in multi-class logistic regression.\nThis statement is true. In machine learning and statistics, the softmax function is often used as a transformation to scale the output probabilities of a classification model so that they sum up to one. This transformation helps to prevent numerical instability issues that can arise when probabilities get very large or small, which can occur during training with categorical data. Additionally, softmax is widely used in multinomial logistic regression models where there are multiple classes with potentially different numbers of possible outcomes.\n\nStatement 2: The temperature of a non-uniform softmax distribution affects its entropy.\nThis statement is also true. The temperature parameter in a non-uniform (or \"soft\") softmax distribution scales the values of each element in the distribution. A higher temperature means that the distribution will be more spread out, while a lower temperature will make the distribution more concentrated. As the temperature approaches zero, the distribution becomes uniform (i.e., all elements have the same value) and its entropy approaches zero because it's effectively just a constant probability distribution. However, if the temperature is too high, the distribution might become unbounded and undefined. Thus, the temperature of a non-uniform softmax distribution does affect its entropy. Therefore, both statements are true. \n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC. True, True"
