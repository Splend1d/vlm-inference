False, False\n\nStatement 1 is false because the statement implies that the maximum margin decision boundaries for SVMs are always optimal, which may not always be true as there can be other optimal solutions depending on the data and problem at hand.\n\nStatement 2 is true because any decision boundary generated by a generative model with class-conditional Gaussian distributions can indeed be replicated using an SVM with a polynomial kernel of degree less than or equal to three. This is because the polynomial kernel transforms the input space into higher-dimensional feature spaces where the decision boundaries are easier to find and interpret."
