                    "text": "The President appointed a delegation to enter into negotiations with representatives of a foreign government to study the problem of preventing the extinction of certain species of rabbits. The delegation's goal was twofold: to study the problem and to formulate regulations in a bilateral agreement that would protect the endangered species and provide for a permanent commission that would continually monitor enforcement of the proposed regulations. After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers. Assume that after the treaty goes into effect, a state legislature enacts a statute that provides that \"any licensed rabbit-hunter in the state and its surrounding environs may increase his monthly catch of rabbits from 10 to 15 in each of the specified months of the authorized rabbit-hunting season from the first day of October until the last day of February. \" If challenged, the enactment of the aforementioned statute would most likely be declared\n\nA. constitutional, because the regulation of hunting is within the area of state action.\nB. constitutional, because the enactment falls within the Tenth Amendment's reservedpowers.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the commerce clause.\nD. unconstitutional, because all treaties are the supreme law of the land.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. constitutional, because the regulation of hunting is within the area of state action.\n\nUnder the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, states have the authority to regulate activities that do not involve interstate commerce, such as hunting or fishing. In this case, the state legislature's regulation of hunting during a specific time frame does not involve interstate commerce and therefore falls within the state's police power to regulate local matters. Therefore, the state legislature's statute is constitutional.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people. The state legislature's regulation of hunting does not involve any powers not delegated to the federal government, so it does not fall under the Tenth Amendment.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the Commerce Clause only limits Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce, not to limit states' ability to regulate local matters. The state legislature's regulation of hunting does not involve any activities that would be considered interstate commerce.\n\nOption D is incorrect because treaties between countries are binding on both parties and cannot override domestic laws passed by the state legislature."
