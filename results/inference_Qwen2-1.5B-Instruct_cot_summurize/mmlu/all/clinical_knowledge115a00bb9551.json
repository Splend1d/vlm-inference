These two physiological characteristics are essential for success in endurance events such as the marathon, but they do not directly affect body temperature regulation or oxygen delivery to the muscles. Body temperature regulation and oxygen delivery are primarily controlled by other physiological mechanisms such as thermoregulatory systems and respiratory gas exchange."
