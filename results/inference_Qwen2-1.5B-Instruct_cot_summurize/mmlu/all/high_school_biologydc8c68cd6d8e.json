This can happen when the environment doesn't favor any particular trait, allowing all traits to evolve at about the same rate and maintaining them as stable characteristics.\n\nArtificial selection occurs when humans select certain traits for breeding purposes, such as eye color or coat pattern, which then become more common in the population. Directional selection occurs when the environment favors one specific trait over others, causing that trait to increase in frequency within a population. Disruptive selection, on the other hand, happens when a mutation causes a trait to appear and disappear frequently during an individual's lifetime, but not in the population as a whole.\n\nIn the case of horses increasing in size over geologic time, it would be considered a stabilizing selection because the environment has not changed significantly enough to cause major changes in horse traits."
