The psychoanalytic perspective, which emphasizes unconscious motivations and desires, became increasingly popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a response to the scientific revolution and the rise of industrialization. It was also influenced by the work of Sigmund Freud, who developed the concept of the id, ego, and superego, and proposed that people's behavior is determined by their unconscious desires and conflicts. Other psychological perspectives that were popular during this time include behaviorism (which emphasized observable behaviors rather than internal processes) and existential psychology (which focused on individual freedom and choice)."
