To find the rate at which this decrease occurred (in terms of years), we divide the total decrease by the span of years between 1960 and 1996:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{-449,500}{(1996 - 1960)} = \\frac{-449,500}{36} = -11,575 \\]\n\nSo, the rate of decrease per year is -1,175 cases/year. This means that for every year, the number of cases decreases by 1,175.\n\nNow, to find the number of cases in 1987, we apply this rate of decrease to the number of cases in 1960:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cases in 1987} = 450,000 + (-1,175) \\times 7 = 450,000 - 8225 = 449,175 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 112875**."
