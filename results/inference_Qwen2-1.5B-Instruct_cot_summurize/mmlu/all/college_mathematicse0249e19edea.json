Therefore, to maximize the area, we should make both the length and the width as close to each other as possible.\n\nIn this case, making the length and the width equal would give us the largest area while still satisfying the constraint. So, let's set the length ($l$) and the width ($w$) to be equal:\n\n\\[ l = w \\]\n\nSubstituting $l = w$ into the perimeter equation gives us:\n\n\\[ 2l + 2l = 3x \\]\n\\[ 4l = 3x \\]\n\\[ l = \\frac{3}{4}x \\]\n\nNow, substituting $l = w$ back into the area equation gives us:\n\n\\[ A = l \\times w = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}x\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}x\\right) = \\frac{9}{16}x^2 = \\frac{3}{4}x^2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum area of the yard, in terms of $x$, is $\\boxed{\\frac{x^2}{4}}$."
