All of the above are valid conclusions.\n\nThe power of a hypothesis test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (H0) when it is false. In this case, the power is 0.8, which means that if the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is true, there is a 0.8 chance of correctly rejecting H0.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the probability of committing a Type I error, which refers to the probability of incorrectly accepting the null hypothesis (H0). This is different from the probability of committing a Type II error, which refers to the probability of failing to reject an incorrect null hypothesis (H0).\n\nTherefore, the probability of committing a Type I error is not directly related to the power of the test. However, we can calculate the probability of committing a Type I error by subtracting the power from 1. In this case, the probability of committing a Type I error is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.\n\nSo, option B is also a valid conclusion, as the probability of failing to reject H0 when the alternative hypothesis is true is indeed 0.2. \n\nOption C is also a valid conclusion, as the probability of committing a Type II error is the complement of the probability of committing a Type I error, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. \n\nTherefore, all of the options are valid conclusions."
