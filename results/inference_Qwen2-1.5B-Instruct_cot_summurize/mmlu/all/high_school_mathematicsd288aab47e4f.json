However, since we're dealing with magnitudes and not exact numbers, the correct answer might be rounded down or up depending on how the question was phrased. In this case, considering the context and precision required for such calculations, rounding down seems more appropriate here. Therefore, the magnitude of \\(v\\) is **D. 8.6**."
