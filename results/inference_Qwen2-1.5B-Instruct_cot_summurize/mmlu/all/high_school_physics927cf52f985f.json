                    "text": "The correct answer is C: The charge on Object B was doubled.\n\nWhen two charged particles (A and B) are placed in an electric field, they experience a force that is proportional to their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This force causes the particles to move towards each other or away from each other until they reach a state of static equilibrium.\n\nIn this scenario, both objects have equal charge and equal mass, so the net force acting on each object is zero. When either object's mass is halved, its acceleration due to gravity remains unchanged, but the force of attraction between it and the other object increases. This results in an increased force of repulsion between the objects, which can overcome the electrostatic force between them and cause them to move apart again.\n\nIf the charge on object B were doubled, it would still be in equilibrium with object A under the same conditions, as long as the total charge on both objects remained constant. However, if the charge on object A were doubled, it would no longer be in equilibrium with object B under the same conditions, as the electrostatic force between them would become stronger than the gravitational force of attraction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: The charge on Object B was doubled."
