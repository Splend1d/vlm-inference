Johnson on August 2, 1964, authorized the use of military force against North Vietnam if necessary to prevent further attacks on American ships or citizens in Southeast Asia. The resolution did not authorize the bombing of North Vietnam as some had feared, but it did allow for the possible use of \"dramatic measures\" to defend US interests and security.\nThis resolution was significant because it provided legal authority for the US government to engage in military action without explicit congressional approval, which was seen at the time as an infringement on Congress's constitutional powers. The resolution also highlighted the tension between the executive branch and Congress over the Vietnam War, with Johnson's administration arguing that they needed more flexibility to deal with the crisis, while Congress sought to limit their actions.\nIn summary, the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution played a role in shaping the dynamics of the Vietnam War, particularly regarding the extent of presidential power and the balance between executive and legislative branches."
