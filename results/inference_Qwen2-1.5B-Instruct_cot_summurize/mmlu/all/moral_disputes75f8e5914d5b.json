They recognize, enforce, and implement duties not to violate human rights.\n\nAshford believes that the most important test of whether or not legal and economic structures are minimally just is to ensure that they recognize, enforce, and implement duties not to violate human rights. This means that these structures must protect and promote the well-being of all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or any other characteristic, and must provide them with access to basic necessities such as food, shelter, healthcare, and education. Additionally, these structures should prevent discrimination against any group of people and provide equal opportunities for everyone to participate in society and contribute to its development."
