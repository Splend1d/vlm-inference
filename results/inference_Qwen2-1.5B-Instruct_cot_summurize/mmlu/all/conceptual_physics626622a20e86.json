This can happen when the aircraft is in a subsonic dive (when it dives down to travel faster than the speed of sound), but then breaks the sound barrier by exceeding the speed of sound again. Alternatively, if the aircraft is already traveling at a high speed, such as when it is in a supersonic flight path, it may produce a sonic boom even though it is not diving down. Therefore, all of these conditions would result in a sonic boom being produced by the aircraft."
