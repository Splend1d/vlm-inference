Instead, it suggests a negative impact on national identity and sovereignty. Globalization often leads to increased interconnectedness between countries, but it can also lead to feelings of disconnection and a loss of cultural distinctiveness. Additionally, some argue that globalization has contributed to the rise of nationalism and protectionism as people feel more connected to their own country or region."
