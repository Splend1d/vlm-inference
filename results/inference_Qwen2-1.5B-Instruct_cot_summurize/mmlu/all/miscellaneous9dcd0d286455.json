Triangle\n\nTrusses, which are also known as L-braces or \"trussing,\" are structures that use triangles to provide support and stability to beams in bridge construction. The triangle shape allows for easy bending and twisting of the material, making it ideal for distributing weight evenly across the beam and providing a strong base for the structure. This makes trusses an essential part of the design of modern bridges."
