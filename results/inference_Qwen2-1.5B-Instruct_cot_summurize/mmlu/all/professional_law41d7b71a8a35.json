In return, the owner promised to pay the gardener $2,400 upon completion of the job. Since a golf tournament was scheduled for the weekend of April 20 \u0080\u009421, the gardener agreed to replace all the sprinkler heads no later than April 19. Before accepting the job, the gardener had inspected the golf course and determined that 240 sprinkler heads had to be replaced. By April 14, the gardener had installed 80 new sprinkler heads on the first six holes of the 18-hole golf course. That afternoon, however, the owner learned that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, so he notified the gardener to discontinue the job. The next day, the owner hired a landscaper to complete the installation work at $8 per head. The landscaper installed the remaining 160 sprinkler heads and completed the work on April 19. Despite making reasonable efforts, the gardener was unable to find any gainful employment during the period. Also, the gardener's application for unemployment compensation was rejected at the same time. Which of the following statements, if found to be true, would provide the owner with legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener?\n\nA. The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt onApril 12.\nB. The gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged.\nC. The contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing.\nD. Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.\n"

This is because bankruptcy is considered a cause for termination of employment, even case law such as the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Young v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., which states that \"an employee who has been adjudicated bankrupt may be discharged from his employment.\" Therefore, option A is the correct answer. Options B, C, and D do not provide legal grounds for termination of employment based on the given information."
