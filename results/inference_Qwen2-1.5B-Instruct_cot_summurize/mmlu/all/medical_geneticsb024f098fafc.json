When an Hfr (high-fidelity replication) strain of E. coli acquires a F factor, it can then transfer this genetic material to other cells, making it possible to generate large numbers of clones of the same strain. This makes it useful for generating new strains of bacteria with specific traits by combining different genetic materials from different sources."
