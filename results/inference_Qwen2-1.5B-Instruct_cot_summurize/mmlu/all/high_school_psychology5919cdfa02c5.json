Skinner's theories regarding language acquisition is \"language acquisition device.\" This term refers to the idea that humans have an innate ability to learn and use language, which is not dependent on any external factors such as learning or reinforcement. In contrast, B.F. Skinner believed that language acquisition was primarily a result of socialization and reinforcement, rather than an inherent human trait."
