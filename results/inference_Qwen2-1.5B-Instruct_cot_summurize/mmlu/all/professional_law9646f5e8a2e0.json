The cab driver recognized the passenger as a former girlfriend, and the passenger invited him into her house when they arrived. Unknown to the cab driver, the passenger was an undercover police officer who worked in the sex crimes unit. When they were inside the passenger's house, the cab driver made sexual advances toward the passenger, who responded by kissing him and holding his hand. The cab driver was about to kiss the passenger again, when she got up to answer the phone in the kitchen. If the cab driver is subsequently arrested and charged with the attempted rape of the passenger, he should be found\n\nA. not guilty.\nB. not guilty, solely because he was entrapped.\nC. not guilty, if he raises the proper alibi defense.\nD. not guilty, if he was predisposed to commit thecrime.\n"

In some cases, it may be possible to argue that the cab driver acted outside of his normal behavior or that he did not have the intent to commit the crime. However, it is important to note that attempting to rape someone against their will is considered a serious offense and can result in severe penalties if convicted. Therefore, if the cab driver is ultimately found guilty of attempted rape, he could face charges such as attempted murder or rape, which carry significant consequences."
