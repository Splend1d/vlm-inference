Acceptance that there can be no absolute security, instead design resilient IT systems and build international cooperation and information exchange in order to reduce threat and increase resilience.\n\nWhile it is important to take steps to secure against cyber threats, such as implementing strong password policies and using firewalls, these measures alone cannot guarantee complete security. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and new threats may emerge that were not anticipated. Therefore, it is essential to have a comprehensive approach that includes both technical and non-technical measures.\n\nTechnical measures include implementing strong encryption, regular software updates, and patching vulnerabilities. Non-technical measures include educating employees about cybersecurity best practices, building a robust incident response plan, and investing in advanced technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect and respond to threats more effectively.\n\nInternational cooperation and information exchange is also critical for reducing the impact of cyber threats. This involves sharing intelligence with other countries, participating in joint exercises and drills, and collaborating on research and development of new technologies. By working together, nations can improve their ability to detect, prevent, and respond to cyber attacks, ultimately increasing overall security and resilience."
