These acts aimed to protect British trade by limiting imports from other countries and promoting British exports through tariffs and restrictions on imports. Therefore, these acts can be seen as a form of mercantilism, an economic theory proposed by French economist Jean-Baptiste Colbert.\n\nJean-Baptiste Colbert was a proponent of mercantilism, which emphasized the importance of protecting national interests and promoting the growth of the nation's economy through trade and commerce. He believed that a strong economy would lead to greater political stability and prosperity for the people.\n\nTherefore, based on the context provided, it is most likely that the Navigation Acts conflict with Thomas Malthus's theories and beliefs about population growth and overpopulation. Malthus argued that population growth outpaced food supply, leading to famine and poverty. However, the Navigation Acts focused on regulating trade rather than addressing population control, which suggests they did not align with Malthus's views on economics and population growth."
