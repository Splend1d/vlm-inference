In Scenario 1, the character is simply expressing their emotional response to seeing animals in the zoo, which is not inherently wrong. However, if they take further action by starting a petition to close the zoo, this could be seen as potentially harmful to the community and its residents who rely on the zoo for education and entertainment purposes.\nIn Scenario 2, the character is actively harming another living being by putting them in a coffin and sealing them up. This is clearly morally wrong and goes against the principle of respecting life and treating all beings with compassion and kindness.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
