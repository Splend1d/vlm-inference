This is considered morally wrong because it is not within their duty or responsibility to ignore someone in need. In scenario 2, the main character did not intentionally deceive their friend about their lack of knowledge for the sake of helping them study. However, this still falls short of the expected level of honesty and integrity. Therefore, both scenarios involve actions that could be seen as morally wrong depending on the context and circumstances."
