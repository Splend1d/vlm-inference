The defendant's attorney objects to the offering of the baby into evidence for comparison. The trial judge should\n\nA. permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of demonstrative evidence.\nB. not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be highly prejudicial to the defendant.\nC. permit the child to be exhibited as within the hearsay exception of pedigree.\nD. not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be self-serving to the complainant.\n"

Not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be highly prejudicial to the defendant.\n\nIn a paternity trial, it is important to ensure that all evidence presented is relevant and unbiased. Exhibiting the child in question without the consent or knowledge of the parties involved could create a bias towards one party or the other. It may also lead to unnecessary emotional distress for the child and their family. Therefore, the court should not allow the child to be exhibited for the purpose of comparison."
