May be helpful in diverticular disease\n\nFiber supplements can be beneficial for individuals with diverticular disease, as they help to promote regular bowel movements and prevent constipation. However, it is important to note that not all fiber supplements are created equal, and some may contain added sugars or other ingredients that could interfere with the treatment of diverticular disease. It is recommended to speak with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have a medical condition or are taking medications."
