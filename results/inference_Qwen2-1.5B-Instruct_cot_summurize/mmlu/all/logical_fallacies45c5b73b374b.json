In other words, it is an appeal to popular opinion or consensus as a basis for accepting something without necessarily understanding its underlying merits or consequences. \n\nThe other options listed do not fit the description given in the question. Appeal to common practice involves appealing to what is commonly believed or done, but does not involve any kind of consensus or widespread acceptance. Snob appeal involves making an argument based on social status or wealth, rather than merit. Argument by tradition involves appealing to established practices or customs, but again, does not necessarily imply consensus or widespread acceptance."
