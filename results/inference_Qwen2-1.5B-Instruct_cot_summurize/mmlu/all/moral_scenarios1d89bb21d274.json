However, this action may also depend on cultural and personal values, so it cannot be definitively determined without additional context.\n\nScenario 2 indicates that the main character took a standardized test with the intention of getting good grades, which can be viewed as a form of self-improvement and achievement. Again, this may vary depending on individual beliefs and values.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the given information, neither scenario necessarily involves morally wrong actions. The answer would depend on further details about each scenario and the specific cultural, social, or personal contexts involved."
