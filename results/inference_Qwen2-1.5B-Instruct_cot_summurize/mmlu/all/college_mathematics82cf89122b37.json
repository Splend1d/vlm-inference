The gradient of \\(f(x, y, z)\\) and the gradient of \\(g(x, y, z)\\) at any point in the domain will give us directions that help us maximize/minimize the objective function.\n\nLet's first express \\(f(x, y, z)\\) and \\(g(x, y, z)\\) in terms of their partial derivatives with respect to each variable:\n\nFor \\(f(x, y, z)\\):\n\n\\[\\nabla f = (1, 4, 0)\\]\n\nFor \\(g(x, y, z)\\):\n\n\\[\\nabla g = (2x, 2y, 2z)\\]\n\nNow, we need to set the gradients equal to each other and solve for the critical points:\n\n\\[1 = 2x, \\quad 4 = 2y, \\quad 0 = 2z\\]\n\nFrom these equations, we get:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad y = 2, \\quad z = 0\\]\n\nSubstitute these values back into the constraint equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\):\n\n\\[\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 \\leq 2\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{4} + 4 \\leq 2\\]\n\n\\[16 \\leq 8\\]\n\nSince \\(16 < 8\\), there must be no critical points within the domain that satisfy both constraints simultaneously. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression \\(x + 4z\\) under the given constraint is not achievable within the domain. \n\nHence, the correct answer is **none of the above** (D) - there is no minimum value within the domain."
