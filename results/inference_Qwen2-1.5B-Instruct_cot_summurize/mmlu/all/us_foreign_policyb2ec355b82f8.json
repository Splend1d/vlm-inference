Promotion of Democracy, free-trade and international institutions.\n\nThis is because the Liberal approach emphasizes democracy, economic freedom, and international cooperation as essential components of a stable and prosperous global society. It advocates for the promotion of these values through diplomatic efforts and alliances with other nations. This approach also supports free trade agreements that promote economic growth and stability around the world. Additionally, it supports the United States' role in maintaining an international system that upholds the rule of law and promotes peace and security.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are correct, but option D is not applicable since all three of those options align with the Liberal approach to US foreign policy."
