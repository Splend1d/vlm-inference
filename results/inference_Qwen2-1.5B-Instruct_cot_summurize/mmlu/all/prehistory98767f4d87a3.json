This period saw the development of farming techniques and the domestication of animals, leading to the rise of settled communities and the eventual emergence of complex societies. The exact timeline for this transition varies depending on factors such as climate, technology, and cultural practices, but it is generally estimated that it lasted for tens of thousands of years across much of Eurasia and Africa."
