This documentation can help the auditor understand the reason for the client's request and provide context for the confirmation process.\n\nOption A, B, and D are incorrect because:\n\n- Option A involves verifying the account balance through bank statements and cash receipt records, which may not necessarily address the specific issue raised by the client.\n- Option B selects a different account for confirmation randomly without considering the nature of the request or the relevance of the accounts involved, which could lead to selecting accounts that are not representative of the overall population.\n- Option D suggests explaining to the client why the request might affect the auditor's ability to provide an opinion on the financial statements, which does not directly address the issue raised by the client and may not be appropriate under all circumstances."
