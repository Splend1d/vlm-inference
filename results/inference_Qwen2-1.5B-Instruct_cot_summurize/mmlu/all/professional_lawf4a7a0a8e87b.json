The man decided to set fire to the waste paper in a trash container. He hoped that the fire would serve as a diversion so he and his date could run out of the restaurant without paying. He set fire to the waste paper and then went back to his table. As he anxiously waited, the maitre d' grabbed the man and told him that he had seen what occurred in the bathroom. The maitre d', who had been seated in a bathroom stall, saw the man, through a crack in the door, set the fire. The maitre d' extinguished the fire, which had charred a portion of the ceiling. This jurisdiction defines arson as the malicious burning of any structure. If charged with arson, the man should be found\n\nA. guilty, because he was reckless as to the restaurant's being damaged by fire.\nB. guilty, because he set the fire for the purpose of committing an unlawful act.\nC. not guilty, because he did not intend to burn down the restaurant.\nD. not guilty, because the fire only charred a portion of the ceiling.\n"
