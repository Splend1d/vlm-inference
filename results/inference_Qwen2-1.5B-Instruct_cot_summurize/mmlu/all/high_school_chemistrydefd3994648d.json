                    "text": "The ionization energy of an element is related to its electron configuration. In the case of magnesium, it has a stable ground state with one electron in the outermost shell. Sodium, on the other hand, has two electrons in its outermost shell, making it more electronegative than magnesium.\n\nBased on these facts, we can infer that:\n\n- The ionization energy of sodium (Na) will be higher because it requires more energy to remove the second electron from the outermost shell compared to removing the first electron.\n- The atomic radius of sodium (Na) will also be smaller because it has less electron shielding effect due to having fewer electrons in its outermost shell.\n\nGiven this information, the most probable values for the ionization energy and atomic radius of sodium are:\n\n- Ionization Energy: 898 kJ/mol (since sodium has a lower ionization energy)\n- Atomic Radius: 147 pm\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 147 pm, 523 kJ/mol."
