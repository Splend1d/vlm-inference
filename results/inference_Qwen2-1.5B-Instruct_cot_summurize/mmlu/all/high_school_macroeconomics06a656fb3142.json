An increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) generally indicates an increase in the general price level of goods and services in the economy, which can be caused by factors such as increased demand for goods and services, higher prices for raw materials used in production, or changes in supply and demand. This can lead to rising costs for consumers, including wages and prices of goods and services, and can contribute to inflation. Therefore, it's commonly referred to as \"inflation.\""
