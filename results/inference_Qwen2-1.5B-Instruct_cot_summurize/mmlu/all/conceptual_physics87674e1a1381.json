This type of radiation has a shorter wavelength than solar radiation because it is scattered by the atmosphere and other objects in the way. However, it still has a higher frequency than solar radiation due to its longer wavelength. Therefore, both the wavelength and frequency of terrestrial radiation are affected by the presence of the atmosphere."
