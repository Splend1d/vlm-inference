The West, notably Canada, Britain, and the US, have conducted research into the weaponization of Anthrax, Tularemia, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and anti-agricultural agents. However biological weapons were generally viewed in the West as lacking military utility. Instead strategists have concentrated on nuclear and conventional capabilities.\nB. The Soviet Union carried out the most extensive research program into genetic engineering to weaponize naturally occurring diseases. However, the Soviets most likely saw their biological weapons program as a counter to the global-strike complex that was emerging in NATO in the 1970s or as a way to inhibit recovery in a nuclear exchange. Biological weapons programs should therefore be regarded in a Cold War context.\nC. Biological weapons make use of living organisms or toxins to weaken or kill, but because these organisms and toxins occur in nature it makes it difficult to differentiate between naturally occurring disease and subversive activities which, moreover, make a state's capacity hard to verify.\nD. All of these options.\n"

While there is no clear consensus among experts on the impact of biological weapons on national security, some argue that they pose a serious threat to global stability and peace.\n\nOption A suggests that the West has conducted research into the weaponization of various diseases such as anthrax, tularemia, q fever, venezuelan equine encephalitis, and anti-agricultural agents. This option implies that biological weapons may not be militarily useful for attacking military targets, but they could be used against civilian populations or infrastructure.\n\nOption B argues that the Soviet Union carried out the most extensive research program into genetic engineering to weaponize naturally occurring diseases. This option suggests that the Soviets may have seen their biological weapons program as a counter to the global strike complex that emerged in NATO during the 1970s or as a way to inhibit recovery in a nuclear exchange. This option implies that biological weapons programs should be considered in a Cold War context.\n\nOption C suggests that biological weapons make use of living organisms or toxins to weaken or kill, making it difficult to differentiate between naturally occurring diseases and subversive activities. This option implies that the lack of easy differentiation can make it difficult to verify a state's capacity to develop and use biological weapons.\n\nTherefore, while the specific effects of biological weapons on national security may vary depending on the context and the actions taken by individual states, the overall impact of these weapons on global stability and peace cannot be ignored. It is essential for countries to work towards disarmament and peaceful resolution of conflicts through diplomatic means rather than relying on the development and use of biological weapons."
