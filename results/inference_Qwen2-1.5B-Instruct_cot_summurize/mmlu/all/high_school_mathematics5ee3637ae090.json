                    "text": " Let's denote the cost of each tube of toothpaste as follows:\n\n- The cost of Bright is $x$ dollars.\n- The cost of Fresh is $y$ dollars, where $y = x - \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{3x}{4}$.\n- The cost of Glow is $z$ dollars, where $z = y + \\frac{y}{4} = \\frac{7y}{4}$.\n\nWe know that the volume of Glow is $v$ cubic units, so we have:\n\\[z = \\frac{7y}{4}\\]\n\nWe also know that the volume of Fresh is $v_1$ cubic units, so we have:\n\\[y = v_1\\]\n\nSince the cost of Bright is $60\\%$ more expensive than the cost of Fresh, we can write:\n\\[x = y + \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{3x}{4}\\]\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n\\[x = \\frac{3x}{4}\\]\nMultiplying both sides by $4$ gives us:\n\\[4x = 3x\\]\nSubtracting $3x$ from both sides gives us:\n\\[x = 0\\]\nThis means that the cost of Bright is $0$, which is not possible in real life. Therefore, there must be an error in our calculations. Let's re-examine the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem states that the cost of Bright is $60\\%$ more expensive than the cost of Fresh, but it does not specify the percentage increase or decrease in volume between Bright and Fresh. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact cost of Bright and hence the value of $x$. Similarly, without knowing the exact volume of Fresh, we cannot determine the value of $y$.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the cost of Bright is $60\\%$ more expensive than the cost of Fresh, we can use the given information to find the values of $x$ and $y$. If we let $x = 100$ (the cost of Fresh), then the cost of Bright is $160$ dollars. This means that the cost of Fresh is $100$ dollars and the cost of Bright is $160$ dollars.\n\nNow, since the volume of Glow is $25\\%$ less than the volume of Bright, we can say that the volume of Glow is $80\\%$ of the volume of Bright, or $0.8$ times the volume of Bright. Since the volume of Bright is $100$ cubic units, the volume of Glow is $0.8 \\times 100 = 80$ cubic units.\n\nTo convert the volume of Glow into cents per unit of volume, we multiply the volume in cubic units by $100$: $80 \\times 100 = 8000$ cents. So the number of cents per unit of volume of Glow is $8000$ cents.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 120."
