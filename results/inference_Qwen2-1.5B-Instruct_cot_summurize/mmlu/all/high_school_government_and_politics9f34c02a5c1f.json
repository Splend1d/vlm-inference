Fiscal federalism\n\nFiscal federalism, also known as shared taxation or joint financing, is a principle that allows for multiple levels of government to work together and share resources. This principle is realized when the federal government provides most of the funding to a project in which multiple levels of government work together.\n\nConfederation refers to a system where different regions have their own governments with limited power to govern within their borders. Grant-based funding involves giving money directly to individuals or organizations without any conditions attached. Dual federalism refers to a system where powers are divided between two central governments but can overlap."
