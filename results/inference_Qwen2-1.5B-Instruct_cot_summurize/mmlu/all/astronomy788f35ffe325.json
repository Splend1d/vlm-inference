Light gases (H He) hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3) rocks metals.\n\nThe solar nebula was composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, which make up about 90% of its mass. The remaining 10% were made up of heavier elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, which are found as compounds in the form of water, ammonia, and methane. Rocks and metal grains were also present in the nebula, but they did not account for a significant portion of the total mass."
