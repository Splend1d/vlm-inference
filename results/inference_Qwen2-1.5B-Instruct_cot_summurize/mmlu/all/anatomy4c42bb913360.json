When a peripheral motor nerve is cut or severed, the associated muscle loses its ability to contract and becomes flaccid, meaning it is loose and\u65e0\u529b\u7684. This can lead to a loss of movement in the affected area. In this case, since the patient's wrist was cut, the muscles that control the wrist joint would be paralyzed and unable to move properly. After about six months, as the body attempts to heal itself, the muscles may begin to atrophy, but they will not regain full function until the nerves have fully regenerated and become functional again. However, if the nerve is completely severed, the muscles may never regenerate and remain flaccid. Therefore, the correct answer is B. flaccid paralysis."
