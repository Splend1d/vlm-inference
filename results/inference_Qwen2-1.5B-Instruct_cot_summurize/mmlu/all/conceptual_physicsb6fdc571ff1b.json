Therefore, the current in any given lamp will be the same as the current in the first lamp. However, without knowing the values of the other lamps or the resistance of the circuit, we cannot determine the exact value of the current in the second lamp. The only thing we can conclude is that the current in the second lamp must also be 2 A."
