Limited visualization refers to the tendency to focus on and remember only certain aspects of information, while ignoring other relevant details. In this case, Donia may have focused too narrowly on the fact that the newspaper she was carrying would not be useful as an umbrella and did not notice the cloudburst until it had already started raining heavily. This is an example of limited visualization rather than confirmation bias, functional fixedness, or conceptual constriction."
