The loan was secured by a mortgage on the home. The bank promptly recorded the mortgage, which was the only lien on the home at that time. Several months later, the man borrowed $40,000 from his mother in order to purchase a new truck and gave his mother a mortgage on the home to secure repayment of the debt. The mother promptly recorded the mortgage. The man later lost his job and was struggling to make loan payments to both the bank and his mother. To accommodate the man's financial situation, the bank extended the amortization period of its loan to substantially reduce the amount of each monthly payment. The bank did not alter the interest rate or increase the principal amount of the loan. At the time of the modification of the bank loan, the man was not in default in his payments to his mother. Neither the bank nor the man informed the mother of the modification of the bank loan. After the man later missed five payments to his mother, she commenced a foreclosure action. While the action was pending, the mother learned of the bank's loan modification. The mother asserted that her mortgage had become a first lien on the home and that the bank's mortgage had become a second lien. Is the mother's assertion correct?\n\nA. No, because the bank's loan modification was not detrimental to the rights of the mother.\nB. No, because the man was not in default in his payments to his mother at the time of the bank's loan modification.\nC. Yes, because the bank's loan modification was made without the mother's prior consent.\nD. Yes, because the bank's loan modification was material.\n"

Yes, because the bank's loan modification was material.\n\nWhen a lender modifies a loan, it can be considered \"material\" if it affects the terms of the original loan agreement. In this case, the bank modified the loan by reducing the monthly payment amount and extending the amortization period, which could have significant implications for the borrower's ability to pay off the loan.\n\nIf the modifications were not material, they would not affect the rights of the borrower or the security interests held by the lender. However, if the modifications were material, the lender would need to obtain the borrower's prior written consent before making any changes to the loan terms. If the lender does not obtain consent, the modifications may be invalid.\n\nIn this scenario, the modifications made by the bank were material, as they significantly reduced the borrower's monthly payments and extended the term of the loan. This could have been detrimental to the mother's security interest in the property, potentially leading to a loss of her claim to the proceeds of the sale of the home. Therefore, the mother's assertion that her mortgage became a first lien on the home and that the bank's mortgage became a second lien is correct."
