This is given by $P(10, 20)$.\n\nThe formula for combinations is $C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items to choose, and $n!$ denotes the factorial of $n$, which is the product of all positive integers up to $n$. \n\nSo, we have $P(10, 20) = C(10, 20) = \\frac{10!}{20!(10-20)!} = \\frac{10!}{20!8!} = \\frac{10!}{20!6!} = \\frac{10\\times9\\times8!}{20\\times19\\times8!} = \\frac{10}{20} = 1$.\n\nHowever, this counts the same assignment multiple times if we switch the order of the professors or the courses. Since there are only two distinct arrangements of the same set of objects (in this case, the professors), we need to divide our result by 2 to account for these duplicate assignments.\n\nTherefore, the number of unique assignments is $\\frac{10!}{20!} = \\frac{1}{20}$.\n\nBut we want the answer in terms of factorials, so let's convert this back into a fraction:\n\n$\\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{10!}{20!} \\cdot \\frac{20!}{10!} = \\frac{10!}{10!} = 1$.\n\nThis means that the number of unique assignments is 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 10^(20) - 100."
