This statement is not an assertion made in the realist case against humanitarian interventions. The other options are all assertions made by realists regarding the potential risks and benefits of humanitarian interventions: \n\nA) Realists argue that armed forces should only ever be used in the national interest, which suggests that humanitarian interventions can be imprudent due to their focus on international interests rather than national ones.\n\nB) Realists believe that foreign intervention can lead to a prolonged war with lasting instability, suggesting that humanitarian interventions may exacerbate existing conflicts or create new ones.\n\nC) Realists argue that foreign intervention often fails to achieve its intended goals, leading to long-term instability and potentially more conflicts down the line. This view supports the idea that humanitarian interventions are not effective in resolving conflicts."
