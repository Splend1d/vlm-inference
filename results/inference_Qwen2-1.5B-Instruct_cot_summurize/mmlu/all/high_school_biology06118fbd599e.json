This is known as convergent evolution, where organisms with different body plans develop similar structures to achieve similar functions. Therefore, the bones in these animals likely developed from similar embryonic tissues, which supports the idea that they have homologous structures. Additionally, this similarity provides evidence for the hypothesis that humans, bats, and dolphins share a common ancestor, which is supported by other lines of evidence such as molecular biology and paleontology. Therefore, option D (A and C) is correct."
