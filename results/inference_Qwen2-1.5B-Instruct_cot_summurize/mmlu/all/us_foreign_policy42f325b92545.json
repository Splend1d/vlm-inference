The United States relies heavily on imported oil, which has led to concerns about energy security and the impact of oil prices on the economy. As a result, the government has taken steps to develop alternative energy sources and reduce its dependence on imported oil, such as through initiatives like the Clean Power Plan and the development of nuclear power plants. Additionally, the United States has used economic tools, such as trade agreements and sanctions, to influence international energy policies and encourage changes in production practices."
