                    "text": "A criminal defendant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to ten years in prison, starting on Jan. 1, 2000. Sec. 204 of the state penal code provided for early release for good behavior, and under that provision he would have been granted supervised release as of Jan. 1, 2007. On Feb. 1, 2006, the state legislature repealed Sec. 204 and passed Sec. 205a. It reduced the good time credits for anyone convicted from that date onward, and also for anyone in prison as of the date of the section's passage. The new release date was calculated to be Jan. 1, 2009. The criminal defendant brought a habeas corpus action arguing that Sec. 205a was an unenforceable ex post facto law as to him. The state courts turned him down saying that good time credit was a privilege and not a vested right. The case ultimately came before the U.S. Supreme Court. Did the Supreme Court invalidate Sec. 205a as an unconstitutional ex post facto law?\n\nA. No, because good time credits were an act of grace that could be taken away at any time.\nB. Yes, because it retrospectively increased the punishment over what was in effect when the offense was committed.\nC. Yes, because the legislature does not have the authority to pass a law that decreases good time credits for prisoners.\nD. No, the criminal defendant did not have a vested right in the early release date.\n"

Yes, because it retrospectively increased the punishment over what was in effect when the offense was committed.\n\nThe state legislature's repeal of Sec. 204 and passing of Sec. 205a retroactively changed the eligibility criteria for early release based on good behavior. This change is considered an ex post facto law because it increases the severity of the crime beyond what was originally established by the law in question (Sec. 204). Therefore, the Supreme Court would likely find Sec. 205a invalid as an unconstitutional ex post facto law."
