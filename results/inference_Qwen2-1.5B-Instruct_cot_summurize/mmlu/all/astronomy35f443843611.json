It has also been suggested that Titan may have had active geological processes in the past, though this remains to be proven conclusively.\n3. Titan's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrocarbons, including methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and other organic compounds.\n\nIt should be noted that while Titan does not have any confirmed evidence of current or recent geologic activity, it has been speculated about based on observations of its surface features and composition."
