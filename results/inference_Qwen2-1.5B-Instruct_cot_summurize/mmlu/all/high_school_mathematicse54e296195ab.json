R <= T <= M <= L.\n\nThis is because if the function f is both increasing and concave up on the interval [a,b], then the left sum (R) will be less than or equal to the right sum (T). The reason for this is that an increasing function has its values decreasing from left to right, so the integral of the function from a to b must be positive. This means that the total area under the curve from a to b is greater than 0, which implies that the right sum (T) must also be greater than the left sum (R).\n\nAdditionally, since the function is concave up, the midpoints between the intervals (M) will always be higher than the points where the function changes direction (L), which in turn is lower than the midpoints. Therefore, the left sum (R) will always be greater than the midpoints, and the right sum (T) will always be greater than the midpoints as well.\n\nFinally, the trapezoids formed by connecting the midpoints will have areas equal to their bases multiplied by their heights, which are all greater than the midpoints themselves. Thus, the trapezoidal sum (M) will be greater than any point on the graph, making it the smallest of the four sums listed."
