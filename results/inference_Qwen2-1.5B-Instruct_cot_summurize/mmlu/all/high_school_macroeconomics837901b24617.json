Higher taxes and buying Treasury securities.\n\nWhen the government increases taxes, it reduces the amount of money available for spending on goods and services. This leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and can cause a recession if there is not enough stimulus from monetary policy.\n\nBuying Treasury securities is also an example of monetarist policies because it involves increasing the supply of money in the economy by injecting more liquidity into the system. However, this does not necessarily lead to higher employment or output as it depends on how much money is spent on government programs versus consumer spending.\n\nOption A (higher taxes) and option C (lower government spending) both involve reducing the amount of money available for spending, which would have a similar effect on aggregate demand and economic activity as higher taxes. Option B (lower taxes) involves decreasing the amount of money available for spending, but it is not as effective at stimulating the economy as raising taxes since it is not a direct increase in aggregate demand.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. Higher taxes and buying Treasury securities."
