Binge eating episodes involve consuming large amounts of food quickly without any sense of control or moderation. \n\nA. Feeling that eating habits are chaotic may indicate an issue with portion control, but it does not necessarily correlate with binge eating.\n\nD. Feeling unable to choose the type of food eaten is more related to specific types of food being consumed rather than binge eating itself."
