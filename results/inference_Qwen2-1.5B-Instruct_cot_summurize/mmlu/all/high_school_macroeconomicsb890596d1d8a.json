This is because consumers have more money to spend on goods and services, which can lead to higher levels of consumption.\n\nOn the other hand, if the increase in disposable income is not sufficient to cover any changes in prices or taxes, then there may be no change in either consumption or savings.\n\nIn summary, while an increase in disposable income may lead to an increase in both consumption and savings under certain conditions, it is not always the case that savings will necessarily increase by exactly $X. Therefore, option D (saving remains constant) is not necessarily true in all cases."
