The U.S. Constitution states that the president nominates and Senate confirms Supreme Court justices, who serve for life with lifetime appointments. Since the Constitution was written in 1789, it has not changed to allow for multiple parties or terms. Therefore, the justices must be confirmed by the Senate, which has historically been controlled by one party."
