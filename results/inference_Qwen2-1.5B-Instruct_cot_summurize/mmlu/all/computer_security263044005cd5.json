                    "text": "The correct answer is C: Forward secrecy.\n\nForward secrecy refers to the property of encryption systems in which the same message cannot be decrypted even if the encryption key has been compromised by an attacker after it was used for encrypting the message. In this scenario, since Alice and Bob have already exchanged their messages using the encrypted communication channel, any attempt by an adversary to intercept these messages will not be able to decrypt them because the encryption key has already been compromised.\n\nAuthentication, deniability, and backward secrecy do not apply in this scenario because they refer to different aspects of security measures in cryptographic systems. Authentication involves verifying the identity of users or entities involved in a transaction. Deniability involves hiding actions taken by an entity from others, such as hiding the fact that an attack occurred. Backward secrecy refers to the ability of a sender to send a message without fear of the receiver being able to decrypt it later on.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate security property that addresses Alice and Bob's concern is forward secrecy."
