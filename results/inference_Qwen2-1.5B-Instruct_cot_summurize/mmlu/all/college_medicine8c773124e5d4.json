                    "text": "The function of neurons is to transmit information between different parts of the nervous system, such as sensory neurons that receive input from the outside world and motor neurons that send output signals to muscles or glands. The function of a neuron can be described as:\n\n1. Synaptic transmission: Neurons communicate with each other through chemical synapses, where neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft. These neurotransmitters carry signals from one neuron to another.\n\n2. Ion channels: Neurons have ion channels that allow ions like calcium, potassium, and sodium to enter or exit the cell. These ion channels are activated during the depolarization phase of an action potential, allowing ions to flow out of the cell.\n\n3. Receptor binding: Neurons also have receptors on their surfaces that bind to specific molecules called ligands. When these ligands bind to the receptor, it triggers a response that can propagate throughout the neuron.\n\n4. Membrane potential: The resting membrane potential (also known as the resting potential) is the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell membrane. This potential can either be hyperpolarized or depolarized depending on whether the cell is receiving positive or negative charge, respectively.\n\n5. Action potential initiation: When the membrane potential becomes sufficiently large (usually above about -70 mV), the cell enters a state of persistent hyperpolarization. This causes the cell to become more resistant to depolarization, leading to a slower firing rate of action potentials.\n\n6. Threshold potential: The threshold potential is the minimum membrane potential required for the neuron to initiate an action potential. Once this threshold is crossed, the neuron will fire an action potential.\n\nTherefore, based on the given options, the answer is **D** (an action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential). It's important to note that all other statements describe functions related to how neurons transmit and process information within the nervous system."
