Wealthy countries subsidies and trade barriers make it difficult for developing countries to take advantage of the potential of globalisation for advancing food security.\nB. World Trade Organisation rules do not cover agriculture, so globalisation really has no bearing on food security.\nC. Supermarkets are so far the only way in which food and agriculture have experienced globalisation.\nD. Developing countries need to create publicly-owned food reserves in order to realise the potential benefits.\n"

Increased access to food: Globalisation allows for greater access to food from different regions and countries. This means that people in developing countries can now import foods that they may previously have had difficulty accessing due to transportation costs or lack of local production.\n\n2. Improved food quality: Global markets allow for the exchange of knowledge, technology, and best practices between producers around the world. This can lead to improved food safety and quality standards.\n\n3. Enhanced food security: Globalisation can help reduce food insecurity by increasing the availability of diverse crops and ensuring that there is a sufficient supply of food to meet demand.\n\nNegative effects:\n\n1. Unequal distribution of resources: While globalisation can increase food access, it can also exacerbate existing inequalities in terms of resource allocation. Developed countries tend to benefit more than developing countries when it comes to trade deals and agricultural subsidies.\n\n2. Environmental degradation: Globalisation often leads to increased use of pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals, which can have negative impacts on the environment and human health.\n\n3. Loss of cultural traditions: The spread of globalised agricultural practices can sometimes come at the expense of traditional farming methods and cultural practices that are important to many communities.\n\nTo address these challenges, governments and international organizations should work towards promoting sustainable development, equitable trade policies, and the protection of local cultures and environments. Additionally, developing countries could consider creating public-private partnerships and investing in their own agricultural sectors to ensure self-sufficiency and resilience in the face of globalisation's potential drawbacks."
