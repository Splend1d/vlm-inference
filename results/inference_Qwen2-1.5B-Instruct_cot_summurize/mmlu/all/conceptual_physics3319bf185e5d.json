When the temperature increases, the volume of the water also increases. This expansion can cause the water to boil at a higher temperature than it would if the pressure were not reduced.\n\nWhen water freezes, it contracts because the temperature causes the molecules of water to slow down. When the temperature decreases, the volume of the water also decreases. This contraction can cause the water to freeze at a lower temperature than it would if the pressure were not increased.\n\nTherefore, boiling and freezing both occur when water is subjected to decreased atmospheric pressure."
