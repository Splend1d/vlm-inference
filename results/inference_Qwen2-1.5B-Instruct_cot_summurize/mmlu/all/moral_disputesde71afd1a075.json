Therefore, killing a fetus would be morally wrong. This argument relies on biological determinism, which holds that all aspects of an individual's existence, including their morality, are determined solely by their biology. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while a fetus may have some degree of moral standing due to its humanity and sentience, it does not necessarily have full moral rights or the capacity for self-awareness. Option C is also incorrect because while a fetus is sentient, this does not necessarily mean that it has full moral rights or that it is morally wrong to harm or kill it. Option D is incorrect because option B is the correct interpretation of the argument presented in the question."
