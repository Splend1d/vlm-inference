It states that if the subject's headache is a dualist state, then it must be the case that the object's tickle is also a physical state (as stated by the conditional \"Dh \u2283 ~Pt\"). However, this condition cannot be satisfied because the object's broken toe is not a physical state. Therefore, the subject's headache cannot be a dualist state. This interpretation follows the rules of logical inference and does not introduce any new premises or conclusions beyond those provided in the original statement."
