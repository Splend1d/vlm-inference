In this case, the total value of cheese produced is $3 x 10 = $30 and the total value of crackers produced is $2 x 20 = $40. Therefore, the total value of all goods produced is $30 + $40 = $70. Since the price per unit of each good is constant (in this case, $3 for cheese and $2 for crackers), the total value of all goods produced can be calculated as $3 x 10 + $2 x 20 = $100. However, since the question asks for the GDP in terms of cheese and crackers, we need to divide the total value of all goods produced by the price per unit of each good. This gives us $100 / ($3 + $2) = $100 / $5 = $20. Therefore, the GDP for this economy is $20 x $3 = $60. However, this does not match any of the options provided. It seems there may have been a mistake in the calculation or the question was incorrectly worded."
