The energy content of her feces and urine is also given as 647 kJ and 318 kJ, respectively.\n\nTo calculate the digested energy intake (DEI), we subtract the energy content of feces and urine from the total gross energy intake:\n\nDEI = GEI - (Fecal Energy + Urinary Energy)\nDEI = 9279 kJ - (647 kJ + 318 kJ)\nDEI = 9279 kJ - 9655 kJ\nDEI = 644 kJ\n\nTo calculate the metabolizable energy intake (MEI), we need to convert DEI into a unit that reflects its ability to be used by the body for growth and repair. In this case, we can use the term \"metabolisable energy\" which refers to the amount of energy that is available for utilization in the body. To do this, we multiply the digested energy intake by a conversion factor known as the metabolizable energy coefficient (MEC). This factor varies depending on the source but generally ranges between 0.7 and 0.8.\n\nFor example, if we assume a MEC of 0.75 for a healthy adult, then:\n\nMEI = DEI * MEC\nMEI = 644 kJ * 0.75\nMEI = 486 kJ\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 9279-318 kJ and 9279-647 kJ."
