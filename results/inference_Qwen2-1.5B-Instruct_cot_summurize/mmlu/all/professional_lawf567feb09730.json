After inspecting the tomatoes, the chef refused to give his approval, because he felt that the tomatoes were not of sufficient quality. As a result, the owner refused to accept and pay for the tomatoes. The distributor brought a breach of contract action against the owner because he refused to pay for the tomatoes.

                    "text": "The answer is C. The evidence is barred, because the written contract appears to be a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement.\n\nWhen two parties enter into a contract, they typically agree to specific terms and conditions that govern their relationship. In this case, the written contract includes a provision that the owner must approve the quality of the heirloom tomatoes before payment can be made. This is an example of an oral condition precedent, which means that it is part of the contract itself rather than being a separate agreement or statement.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), if a party has a right to insist upon an oral condition precedent in a written contract, then that right applies even when the written contract itself contains such a condition. However, there are exceptions to this rule. One exception is if the written contract appears to be a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement, meaning that all the necessary terms and conditions have been included in the written document without any further agreements or understandings between the parties. In this case, the court would likely find that the written contract is a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement and therefore the oral condition precedent is barred.\n\nIn summary, the evidence presented by the distributor regarding the chef's refusal to approve the tomatoes is not admissible to show that the written agreement was subject to an oral condition precedent. Instead, the evidence is only relevant to show that the written contract is a complete and total integration of the parties' agreement, which precludes the application of the oral condition precedent. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
