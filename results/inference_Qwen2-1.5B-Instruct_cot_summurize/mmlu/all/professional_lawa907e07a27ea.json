The case was tried to the court solely on documentary evidence. Immediately after the close of the evidence, the judge announced from the bench, \"Judgment shall be entered for the manufacturer,\" and judgment was so entered. The buyer has appealed the judgment. What is the buyer's best argument for persuading the appellate court to reverse the judgment?\n\nA. The judgment is clearly erroneous because it was based solely on documentary evidence.\nB. The manufacturer was required to file proposed findings and conclusions before the trial court ruled.\nC. The trial court erred because it announced the judgment without giving the parties an opportunity to submit proposed findings and conclusions.\nD. The trial court erred by not providing findings and conclusions.\n"

This would allow both sides to have an opportunity to present their arguments and evidence to the court, rather than relying solely on documentary evidence as the only basis for the judgment. Therefore, option C (trial court erred because it announced the judgment without giving the parties an opportunity to submit proposed findings and conclusions) would be the most persuasive reason for the appellate court to overturn the judgment."
