The defendant admitted that she told the victim she could save him if he brought a large sum of money wrapped in a handkerchief to a ritual. After the ritual, the defendant returned the handkerchief to the victim filled with waste paper rather than the money. After the defendant was convicted of false pretenses, she moved for a new trial and offered the affidavits of several jurors who sat on the case. An affidavit containing which of the following facts will most likely furnish the defendant's best basis for securing a new trial?\n\nA. A juror misunderstood the judge's instructions regarding the burden of proof.\nB. A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.\nC. Ajuror fell asleep during defense counsel's closing argument.\nD. A juror admittedly stated during deliberations that he had a personal animosity toward the defendant.\n"

A juror, in violation of the court's instructions, read a newspaper article implicating the defendant in several other similar schemes.\n\nThe juror's statement that they read an article implicating the defendant in other similar schemes would be relevant evidence to show that the jury may have been influenced by extraneous factors or bias against the defendant, potentially undermining their impartiality and rendering the conviction invalid. This is because such evidence can undermine the reliability of the verdict, leading to a miscarriage of justice."
