In this case, the mRNA codon is \"TGA\" (where T stands for thymine and G stands for guanine). The reverse complement of this codon would be \"TGAC\". However, we need to adjust the order of the bases to match the standard reverse complementing rule, which is to swap the positions of the two adjacent bases. So, the correct order is \"CGUA\". Therefore, the nucleotide sequence of the tRNA anticodon is \"5'-CGUA-3'\". \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 5'-CGUA-3'"
