This method allows for a wider reach and more diverse candidates to apply, as potential employees can find the job opening through their personal networks or search engines.\n\nOption B is incorrect because advertising the job opening on job posting websites would be a common practice used by many companies to promote open positions.\nOption C is also incorrect because receiving a recommendation from a current employee is not typically a part of a hidden market hiring strategy.\nOption D is partially correct but does not fully represent the use of a hidden market. Participating in a career fair at a local community college is an option that could potentially help attract talent, but it's not necessarily a hidden market approach."
