Unlike Category A agents, B agents refer to emerging security threats which have the potential to be utilised as biological weapons after further development.\nC.

These agents typically have low mortality rates and can be easily controlled through vaccination or other measures. However, they can still cause long-term health problems if not managed properly. Examples of Category B agents include some types of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that are commonly found in nature but can cause disease when introduced into human or animal populations."
