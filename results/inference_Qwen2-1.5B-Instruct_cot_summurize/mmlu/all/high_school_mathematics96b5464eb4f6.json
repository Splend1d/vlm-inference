Since the growth rate is constant and the population increases exponentially over time, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ P(24) = 200 \\cdot e^{(1/3) \\cdot 24} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(P(24)\\), we get:\n\n\\[ P(24) = 200 \\cdot e^{8} \\]\n\\[ P(24) = 200 \\cdot 1.2055 \\]\n\\[ P(24) = 241.1 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, the approximate number of bacteria after 1 full day is 2408.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 2408."
