Therefore, option D is incorrect. \n\nOption A describes that the Ka'ba was visited by Moses, which is true since Moses received revelations from God through the angel Jibril while he was standing before the Ka'ba. Option B states that the Ka'ba is a haram, which means forbidden or prohibited, but this description is not accurate for all religions that use the Ka'ba as their central place of worship. Some examples include Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. \n\nOption C states that the Ka'ba was built by Abraham, which is also true. The Ka'ba is considered the holiest site in Islam, where Muslims believe Abraham was commanded by God to build an altar there. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
