This is clearly not possible, so there must be an error in our reasoning or calculation.\nLet's re-examine the problem. The given equation suggests that we can rewrite it as $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = (a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-bc-ca) = 150$. We know that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, so $a^2+b^2+c^2 \\ge ab+bc+ca$ by AM-GM inequality. Therefore, $a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-bc-ca < a^2+b^2+c^2$. So we have:\n\\[(a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-bc-ca) < (a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2).\\]\nSince $a+b+c > 0$, this implies that $a+b+c < a^2+b^2+c^2$. Thus, $a^2+b^2+c^2 > a+b+c$.\nOn the other hand, since $a+b+c$ is an integer, we must have $a+b+c = a^2+b^2+c^2$.\nSo we have $a^2+b^2+c^2 < a+b+c < a^2+b^2+c^2$, which is a contradiction.\nTherefore, there must be an error in our reasoning or calculation.\nLet's re-examine the problem again.
