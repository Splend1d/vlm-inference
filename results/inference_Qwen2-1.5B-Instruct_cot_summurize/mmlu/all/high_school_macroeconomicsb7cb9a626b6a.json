U.S. GDP falls and Brazil's GDP rises.\n\nWhen an American firm moves its manufacturing plant from the United States to Brazil, it means that some jobs are lost in the United States due to the increased competition from Brazilian manufacturers. This decrease in employment in the United States leads to a decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the country as a whole.\n\nHowever, the move also creates new job opportunities in Brazil as the company expands its operations there. As a result, the GDP of Brazil increases due to the creation of new jobs and economic activity. Therefore, the overall impact on GDP in both countries would be a fall in the United States and an increase in Brazil."
