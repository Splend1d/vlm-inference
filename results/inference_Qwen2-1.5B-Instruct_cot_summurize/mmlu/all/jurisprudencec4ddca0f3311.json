We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong. \n\nHume argues that our knowledge of morality is limited and subjective, and that we cannot have objective knowledge of what is morally right or wrong. He believes that morality is based on emotional responses rather than objective principles, and that these emotions can vary from person to person.\n\nTherefore, Hume's attack on natural law is founded on his argument that we cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong. This belief undermines the idea that there is a universal moral order that applies to all people at all times, and instead suggests that morality is a matter of personal opinion and subjectivity."
