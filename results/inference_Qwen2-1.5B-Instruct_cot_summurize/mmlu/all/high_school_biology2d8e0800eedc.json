Net primary productivity (NPP) refers to the amount of energy that is captured and used by photosynthetic organisms in an ecosystem. It represents the total amount of solar energy that is converted into chemical energy through photosynthesis. This is important for understanding how energy is distributed within an ecosystem and how it affects the availability of resources for other organisms."
