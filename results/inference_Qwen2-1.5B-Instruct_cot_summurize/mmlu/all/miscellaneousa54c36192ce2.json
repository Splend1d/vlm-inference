Last year, the total amount of tobacco sold by American tobacco farmers increased significantly, but the number of smokers in the country continued to decline. If the following are true, they can be the reason for the above phenomenon, except:\n\nA. More women start smoking this year than men who have quit.\nB. People who continue to smoke consume more tobacco than in previous years.\nC. The number of people who started smoking grass or taking snuff this year is more than the number who have given up smoking.\nD. More cigarettes produced in the U.S. are exported to other countries this year than last year.\n"

This statement does not provide any information about the tobacco industry's financial situation or its impact on the number of smokers in the country. Therefore, it cannot be the reason for the decline in the number of smokers despite an increase in tobacco sales. \n\nOption A suggests that there may be a shift towards women starting to smoke, which could explain why the number of smokers continues to decline while the tobacco industry remains financially strong. Option B implies that people who continue to smoke are consuming more tobacco than before, which could also contribute to the decline in the number of smokers. Option C indicates that the number of people who switched from smoking grass or taking snuff to smoking cigarettes has increased, which could lead to a decrease in overall smoking rates. \n\nTherefore, option D is the only one that does not provide any explanation for the decline in the number of smokers despite an increase in tobacco sales."
