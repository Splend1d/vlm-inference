One day, a truck driver pulled into the gas station for some gas. After filling up the gas tank, the truck driver entered the convenience store for a bite to eat. He was eating a bowl of chili when he noticed a cockroach in the food. The truck driver demanded a new serving of chili. When the owner refused, the truck driver stormed out of the store in anger. The truck driver jumped into his truck and decided to get even by causing some damage. He purposely drove into one of the gas tanks, which ruptured the gas line. The collision caused a terrible explosion and the building became engulfed in flames. The owner could not escape the blaze and burned to death. At common law, the truck driver should be found guilty of\n\nA. arson only.\nB. murder only.\nC. arson and murder.\nD. arson, burglary, and murder.\n"

This action constitutes both arson (the act of setting fire to property) and burglary (entering a dwelling without permission). Additionally, the driver's actions may also constitute murder if it can be shown that the owner died as a result of the explosion or fire caused by the driver's actions. Therefore, the correct answer is D. arson, burglary, and murder."
