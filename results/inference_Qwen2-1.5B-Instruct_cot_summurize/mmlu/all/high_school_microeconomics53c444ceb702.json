This is because the owner of a small store in their hometown may have other skills or interests outside of running the business, and they may place a value on those skills if they were to pursue them as a full-time job. For example, the owner may be skilled at cooking, and could potentially work as a chef instead of running the store. However, it is not typically considered an explicit cost to run a business, but rather an implicit cost due to the time and resources invested in maintaining the business."
