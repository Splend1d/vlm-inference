This results in an inflow of $15,000 (the total amount paid minus the par value).\n- The par value of the common stock is $10 per share, so the par value is not included in the calculation of the cash inflow.\n- The cash inflow from financing activities would then be $15,000 - $5000 = $10,000.\n- Adjusting for the par value, the final cash inflow from financing activities would be $10,000 + $5000 = $10,500.\n- The remaining cash inflow from financing activities ($10,000) can be classified as a decrease in shareholders' equity.\n- Therefore, the correct classification for the cash inflow from financing activities would be $10,000 (decrease in shareholders' equity)."
