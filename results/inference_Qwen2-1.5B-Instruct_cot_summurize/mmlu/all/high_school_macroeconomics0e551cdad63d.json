This can lead to a decrease in the quantity demanded, which in turn can cause prices to fall and the demand curve to shift to the left.\n\nOn the other hand, when there is a lower rate of inflation, consumers have more purchasing power and tend to buy more goods and services. This can lead to an increase in the quantity demanded, which in turn can cause prices to rise and the demand curve to shift to the right. \n\nSpeculation about future exchange rates may also affect the demand curve for a currency by changing investor expectations and leading to changes in investment flows. However, this is not directly related to the current state of inflation or deflation in a country. \n\nAn increase in interest rates in Mexico relative to other countries would likely shift the supply curve for Mexican pesos to the right because it would make it cheaper for foreigners to invest in Mexican assets. This could potentially lead to an increase in foreign demand for Mexican pesos, but it would not necessarily shift the demand curve itself. \n\nA decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles would also be expected to shift the demand curve for the Mexican peso to the right, as it would make it easier for Mexicans to export their goods abroad. However, this is not directly related to the current state of inflation or deflation in Mexico."
