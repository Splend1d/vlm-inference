However, if we were to interpret them based on common business practices:\n\n- A. Divest objectives: This might refer to a company that decides to sell off certain divisions or products in order to reduce costs and focus on more profitable areas of its business.\n  \n- B. Hold objectives: This could be interpreted as a strategy where a company chooses to maintain the status quo, possibly through cost-cutting measures or maintaining current product lines, rather than pursuing growth opportunities.\n\n- C. Growth objectives: These would likely involve expanding into new markets, developing new products, or increasing market share, all with the aim of driving long-term revenue growth.\n\n- D. Harvesting objectives: This term seems to be somewhat ambiguous, but it could potentially refer to a strategy that involves selling off assets or businesses at a time when their value is high due to market conditions or strategic decisions. It could also imply a strategy of managing investments or resources effectively to ensure maximum returns for shareholders.\n\nPlease note that these interpretations are generalizations and may vary depending on the specific context and industry."
