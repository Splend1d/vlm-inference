This can be inferred from the mention of the ruler who appointed Sanehat to lead his army and the description of Sanehat's military prowess and success against his enemies. Additionally, the use of the term \"clan\" suggests that the ruler and his followers were part of a larger group or community, likely including multiple clans. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer based on the context provided."
