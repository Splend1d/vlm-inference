Minimum average total cost equals price.\n\nIn the long run, when there are strong barriers to entry and homogeneous products, firms will enter the market and compete on price, resulting in minimum average total cost equaling price. This is known as Cournot competition. \n\nStrong barriers to entry can prevent new firms from entering the market quickly, allowing existing firms to set prices based on their costs. Homogeneous products mean that consumers cannot easily differentiate between different brands or products, making it easier for firms to compete on price. Finally, minimum average total cost equals price means that all firms in the market are earning zero economic profit (or at least very close to zero), which occurs in perfect competition where there are no barriers to entry and firms have complete information about the market.\n\nBarriers to entry and homogeneity do not necessarily imply zero economic profits, but they do indicate conditions that are conducive to competitive markets."
