One of the men told the other that he knew an alarm specialist who could help disarm the security system. One of the men then approached the alarm specialist and asked if he would assist them in disarming the home's alarm system. The alarm specialist said that he didn't want to participate in the crime but told the man how he could disarm the system himself. The two men thereafter went to the home to commit the burglary. When they arrived at the home, they saw a vicious guard dog patrolling the fenced-in area of the home. Deciding it would be too risky to confront the dog, the two men abandoned their planned burglary. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the criminal liability of the two men and the alarm specialist?\n\nA. The two men are guilty of conspiracy.\nB. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of conspiracy.\nC. The two men are guilty of conspiracy and the two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of attempted burglary.\nD. The two men and the alarm specialist are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary.\n"

In this case, the two men agreed to burglarize the home, which is a crime. However, they did not actually carry out the burglary themselves; instead, they decided to abandon the plan when they encountered a dangerous guard dog. Therefore, they cannot be considered guilty of carrying out the crime.\n\nHowever, the alarm specialist was involved in the conspiracy as well because he provided information about how to disarm the security system without participating in the crime itself. So, even though he may not have been directly involved in committing the crime, he still played a role in the conspiracy."
