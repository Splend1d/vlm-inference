This statement can be seen as equivalent to the statement that the Turing machine M halts in at most n steps.\n\nStatement II: \"The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.\"\nThis statement means that if we start with an empty tape, and run the Turing machine M on it, then after running for at least n steps, M will print a 1 on the tape. This statement implies that M does not halt in at most n steps but instead runs forever, eventually printing a 1.\n\nStatement III: \"M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.\"\nThis statement means that if we start with an empty tape, and run the Turing machine M on it, then M will scan at least n different locations on the tape during its computation. However, it doesn't specify whether M prints a 1 or halts after n steps. \n\nGiven these interpretations, the correct answer would depend on the specific implementation of Turing machines M. Without knowing the exact behavior of M, we cannot determine which of the statements are true. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nA. None\n\nHowever, based on the interpretation provided, Statement II seems more likely to be decidable because it specifies that M prints a 1 after n steps, whereas Statements I and III do not make such a requirement."
