Therefore, it can measure a country's level of economic activity, including production and income. However, GDP does not necessarily reflect a country's level of stability, as it is influenced by many factors beyond just production levels. For example, changes in government policies, natural disasters, and global events can all affect a country's economy and impact its GDP. Therefore, option D is correct: I and III."
