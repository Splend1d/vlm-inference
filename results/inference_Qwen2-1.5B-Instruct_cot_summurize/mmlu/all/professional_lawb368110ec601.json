                    "text": "In 1940, a state conveyed to a man a tract of land by deed that was immediately recorded. The man died a widower in 1990, devising all of his real property to his son. The will was duly probated shortly thereafter. In 2005, the son conveyed the tract of land to a friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 2009. The son's will, duly probated following his death, named the friend as sole legatee and devisee of the son's entire estate. In 2008, the son mortgaged the tract of land to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 2008, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to a rancher in 1988 and recorded in 1988. In that instrument, the son purported to grant the rancher a mortgage on the tract of land. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, the State of Baden has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. What is the probable legal effect of the son's mortgage agreement in 2008 with the bank?\n\nA. The mortgage would be invalid, because the son conveyed his interest in the property to the friend in 2005.\nB. The mortgage would be invalid, because the first mortgage in 1988 would take precedence over the second mortgage.\nC. The mortgage would be invalid, unless the mortgagee bank had knowledge of the prior conveyance to the friend.\nD. The subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.\n"

The subsequent mortgagee, the bank, would prevail as against the prior conveyee (the friend), who failed to record before the mortgage was effectuated.\n\nUnder the law of recording statutes and title theories, if a mortgage is granted on a property without the grantor having previously conveyed an interest in the property to another person, the subsequent mortgagee may be able to assert priority over the previous mortgage. However, this depends on various factors such as the date of the original conveyance, the date of the subsequent mortgage, and any notice requirements under the recording statutes. It is possible that the bank's mortgage would be upheld even though the original conveyance was made to the friend before the bank's mortgage was executed, as long as the bank had actual or constructive notice of the earlier conveyance at the time of execution of its own mortgage."
