In this case, the body's response to the cold water becomes less intense as the individual spends more time in the water. This is an example of sensory adaptation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the person continues to enjoy the song even though they have heard it many times before. Option B is also incorrect because the person responds immediately every time the fire alarm is sounded, which suggests that their sensitivity has not changed. Option D is incorrect because the person relies heavily on their hearing in a dark corridor, which would suggest that their sensitivity has decreased rather than increased."
