The real property of any female who may hereafter marry, and which she shall own at the time of marriage, and the rents, issues, and profits thereof, shall not be subject to the sole disposal of her husband, nor be liable for his debts, and shall continue her sole and separate property, as if she were a single female.\n\"\u00a72. The real and personal property, and the rents, issues, and profits thereof, of any female now married, shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband; but shall be her sole and separate property, as if she were a single female, except so far as the same may be liable for the debts of her husband heretofore contracted.\n\"\u00a73. Any married female may take by inheritance, or by gift, grant, devise, or bequest, from any person other than her husband, and hold to her sole and separate use, and convey and devise real and personal property, and any interest or estate therein, and the rents, issues, and profits thereof, in the same manner and with like effect as if she were unmarried, and the same shall not be subject to the disposal of her husband nor be liable for his debts.\"\n\u2014Married Women's Property Act, New York State (1848)\nWhich of the following groups would be most likely to support the perspective of the Married Women's Property Act?\n\nA.

It stated that their real and personal property, including their income, should remain their own separate property and not be subject to their husbands' debts. This act was seen as important because it protected the rights of women and gave them greater control over their lives.\n\nTherefore, the group that would be most likely to support this act is D. Congregational ministers, who were involved in religious organizations and would have been concerned about protecting the rights of women. They would understand the importance of these laws and would likely support them. \n\nOption A, participants in the Seneca Falls Convention, would also support these laws because they were advocating for women's rights during the time period when this act was being debated and enacted. Option B, Southern supporters of the concept of \"female virtue,\" would not necessarily support this law because it goes against traditional gender roles and values. And option C, proponents of the \"cult of domesticity\" value system, would not necessarily support this law either, as it challenges traditional ideas about women's place in society."
