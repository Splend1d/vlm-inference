                    "text": "The correct answer is C: because the atmosphere prefersentially scatters short wavelengths.\n\nWhen light enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters various particles and gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone. These particles scatter shorter wavelengths (such as blue and violet) more than longer wavelengths (such as red and orange), which causes the sky to appear blue. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n\nSo why do we see the sun in yellow or orange when it sets behind clouds? The same reason - the sun emits a mixture of different colors of light with different wavelengths, and the atmosphere again scatters these colors differently depending on their wavelength. Blue light is scattered more by the Earth's atmosphere compared to red light, so the sky appears blue after sunset.\n\nIt's important to note that while Rayleigh scattering explains why the sky appears blue, it does not explain why the sky is blue in general. In fact, many other factors can cause the sky to appear blue, including the presence of certain clouds or aerosols in the air, the reflection of sunlight from bodies of water or snow, and the refraction of light through the atmosphere. However, Rayleigh scattering is still an important factor that contributes to the overall appearance of the sky."
