Which of the following best describes how technology companies can use this observation for planning purposes?\n\nA. Technology companies can accurately predict the dates when new computing innovations will be available to use.\nB. Technology companies can plan to double the costs of new products each time advances in processing speed occur.\nC. Technology companies can set research and development goals based on anticipated processing speeds.\nD. Technology companies can spend less effort developing new processors because processing speed will always improve at the observed rate.\n"

Technology companies can set research and development goals based on anticipated processing speeds.\n\nBy observing that computer processing speeds tend to double every two years, technology companies can set their research and development goals accordingly. This allows them to focus on areas where they can make significant improvements in processing speed without needing to invest heavily in new technologies. For example, if a company wants to develop a faster processor, they could aim to increase its processing speed by 50% every two years until they reach their desired level of performance. This approach is more efficient than constantly investing in new technologies that may not provide immediate returns or may even become obsolete before they have had a chance to fully realize their potential."
