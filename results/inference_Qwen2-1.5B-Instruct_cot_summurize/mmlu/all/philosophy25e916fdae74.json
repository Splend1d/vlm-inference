Part of the mores of the group: This means that the rule is accepted and practiced by members of the group as being morally correct or justifiable.\n2. Universalally Teachable: The rule should be understandable and applicable to everyone in the group without needing further explanation or clarification.\n3. Not merely a taboo: The rule should not only be accepted but also respected and followed, rather than being seen as something to avoid or ignore.\n4. Beloved by all members of the group: The rule should be loved and admired by every member of the group, and not seen as a source of conflict or disagreement.\n5. Applied consistently: The rule should be applied consistently across all aspects of the group's life, including its social, political, economic, and cultural practices."
