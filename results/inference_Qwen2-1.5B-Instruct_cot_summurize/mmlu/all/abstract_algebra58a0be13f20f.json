Therefore, \\(aH\\) forms a group under the operation induced from \\(G\\), as long as \\(a\\) is indeed in \\(H\\).\n\nStatement 2:\nIf \\(H\\) is a subgroup of \\(G\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) belong to \\(G\\), then \\(aH = bH\\) if and only if \\(ab\\) is in \\(H\\).\n\nThis statement is false. The correct way to express this is: \n\n- If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both elements of \\(H\\), then \\(aH = bH\\) (because \\(H\\) is closed under multiplication).\n- However, just knowing that \\(ab\\) is an element of \\(H\\) does not imply that \\(aH = bH\\). This would be true if \\(H\\) was closed under addition or some other operation, but it doesn't hold in general without additional information about the specific properties of \\(H\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
