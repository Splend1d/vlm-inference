Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, the main character broke the computer parts before returning them, which is clearly morally wrong because it involves intentionally damaging property. In scenario 2, setting up a feast for the rich while ignoring the needs of the homeless is also morally wrong, but not as directly wrong as breaking the computer parts. However, both actions can be seen as contributing to a larger issue of social inequality and injustice. Therefore, neither scenario is entirely right or completely wrong."
