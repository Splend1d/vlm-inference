The pain was initially on the right but now has become generalized. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 143/83 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows guarding with diffuse rebound tenderness. There are no palpable masses. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a perforated appendix. Examination of peritoneal fluid from this patient will most likely show which of the following organisms?\n\nA. Candida albicans\nB. Citrobacter freundii\nC. Escherichia coli\nD. Staphylococcus aureus\n"

However, it is not specific for any particular organism as it can contain a variety of bacteria, including E. coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans.\n\nIn this case, the CT scan of the abdomen showed a perforated appendix, which suggests that there is inflammation and damage to the appendix. This condition typically causes symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Therefore, it is possible that the peritoneal fluid would contain E. coli, which is a common cause of bacterial infections in the appendix.\n\nIt's important to note that the diagnosis of appendicitis is based on clinical features, including the presence of signs and symptoms such as fever, nausea or vomiting, and abdominal pain. Additionally, a physical exam by a healthcare provider is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis."
