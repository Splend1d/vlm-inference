Union efforts often focus on negotiating higher wages, improving working conditions, and advocating for better benefits. They may also engage in activities such as strikes, boycotts, and other forms of industrial action to achieve their goals. However, decreasing the prices of substitute resources is not typically an objective of union actions."
