Negligence is a legal doctrine that holds individuals or entities liable for their actions if they fail to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances. In this case, the mechanic should have taken more precautions to prevent such an incident from occurring. Therefore, the neighbor may be able to recover damages for the harm caused by the mechanic's negligence."
