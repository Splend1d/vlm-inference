The punishment should be designed to correct the wrongdoing and prevent its recurrence in the future. In other words, it should aim to restore the balance between the offender and society.\n\nFriendly actions or degradation may also be considered as a form of punishment if they are appropriate and necessary to achieve the goal of restoring social order and preventing further wrongdoing. Ultimately, the decision on whether to use one type of punishment over another depends on the specific circumstances of each case and the goals of the justice system."
