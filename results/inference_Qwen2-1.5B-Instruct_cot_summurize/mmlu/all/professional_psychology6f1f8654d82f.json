When intergroup hostility is reduced through group competition, it can be seen as a form of threat reduction, as it creates a sense of shared goal and reduces the perceived threat to individual members of the group. By working together towards a common goal, individuals may feel more connected to their group and less likely to engage in hostile behavior towards others within the group."
