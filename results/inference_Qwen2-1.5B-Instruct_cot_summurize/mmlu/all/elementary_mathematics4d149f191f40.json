The other options do not provide the correct relationship between the number of photos per book and the total number of books: A is the inverse operation (dividing by 8), B subtracts the number of books from the total, and C adds the number of books to the total, none of which accurately represents the multiplication of these two quantities. Therefore, the correct answer is D, \\( 25 \\times 8 \\)."
