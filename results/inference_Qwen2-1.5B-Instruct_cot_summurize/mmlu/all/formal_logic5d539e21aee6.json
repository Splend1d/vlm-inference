(~F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n\nThis formula states that either France's subsidizing agriculture is not a necessary condition for England's importing beef, or China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds. It means that the two conditions cannot both be true at the same time and that one of them must be false in order for the other to be true. This is equivalent to saying that if England does not import beef, then it is not necessarily the case that France subsidizes agriculture; similarly, if China promotes human rights without South Africa supplying diamonds, then this is not necessarily true."
