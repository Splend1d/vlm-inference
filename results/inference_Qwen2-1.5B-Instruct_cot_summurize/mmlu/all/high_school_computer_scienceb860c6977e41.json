Lossless compression\n\nHuffman coding is used for lossless compression in data storage and transmission because it can efficiently compress data by assigning shorter codes to frequent items and longer codes to infrequent items, without losing any information about the original data. This allows for efficient storage and transmission of large amounts of data while maintaining high quality."
