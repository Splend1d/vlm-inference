And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nThe most likely source of Islam in Mali came from\n\nA. wandering Berber mystics.\nB. conquering Mughal armies.\nC. contact with Muslim trade caravans.\nD. pilgrims to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia.\n"

The passage mentions the use of the Qur'an by heart, the practice of praying, and the study of Islamic law (fiqh), all of which are hallmarks of Islam. Therefore, it is most likely that Islam in Mali came from contact with Muslim trade caravans. \n\nOption A, wandering Berber mystics, is unlikely because the passage does not mention any interactions between these groups and the people of Mali. Option B, conquering Mughal armies, is also unlikely as the passage does not describe any military conquests or influence from this period. Option D, pilgrims to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia, is even less likely as the passage does not mention anything about such pilgrimages."
