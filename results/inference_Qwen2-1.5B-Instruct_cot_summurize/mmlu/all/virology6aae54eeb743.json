Therefore, option A is correct. \n\nPolyomaviruses are an important group of small viruses that cause several human diseases such as papilloma and cervical cancer, chickenpox, and certain types of brain tumors in animals. They are known for their unique replication strategies, including the ability to use the host cell's ribosomes to synthesize viral proteins.\n\nPlease note that this information may vary depending on the specific virus being discussed."
