On October 31, the owner entered into a written contract with a worker that provided that the worker would be employed for the months of November and December to work at the retail store for $2,000 per month. At the end of November, the owner noticed that business had not increased as much as he had expected. The owner informed the worker that unless he agreed to take a cut in his salary, he would be fired. Reluctantly, on December 1, the worker orally consented to a salary reduction of $500 for the month of December. Which of the following statements regarding the December 1 agreement between the owner and the worked is most accurate?\n\nA. It effectuated a valid reformation of their original written contract.\nB. It effectuated a valid modification of their original written contract.\nC. It effectuated a novation of their original written contract.\nD. It did not alter the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of their original contract.\n"

In this case, the worker orally agreed to a reduction in salary from $2,000 to $1,500 for the month of December, which was a modification of the original contract. Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement regarding the December 1 agreement."
