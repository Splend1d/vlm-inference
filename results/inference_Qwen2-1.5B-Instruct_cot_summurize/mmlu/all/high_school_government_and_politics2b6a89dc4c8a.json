Influence peddling refers to the practice of using one's public office or position of power for personal gain, often by soliciting or accepting gifts, favors, or payments from private individuals or businesses. In this scenario, the former president is using their public office and influence to advise the current president on a specific foreign policy issue, which could potentially lead to conflicts of interest or undue influence."
