By the terms of the lease, the tenant expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the tenant, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The tenant and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the tenant, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the student would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. The student failed to pay the taxes on the property. The new owner, after paying the taxes, brought suit against the student for the amount paid. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the new owner.\nB. the student, because he did not contract with the tenant to pay the taxes on the property.\nC. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not \"run with the land,\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.\nD. the student, because the covenant to pay taxes is merely collateral and does not \"run with the land. \"\n"

The student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not \"run with the land,\" unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.\n\nUnder common law, a covenant runs with the land if it has been recorded or acknowledged by the parties at the time of conveyance. In this case, there is no evidence that the covenant to pay taxes was recorded or acknowledged at the time of conveyance. Therefore, the covenant does not run with the land, and the student cannot be held liable for paying the taxes.\n\nAdditionally, the student's assignment of the leasehold interest was valid under the terms of the assignment, and the landlord did not object to the assignment. Therefore, the student is only responsible for paying the monthly rental of $300, and the landlord can recover from the student any amounts owed in arrears.\n\nIn summary, the judgment should be for the student, because the covenant to pay taxes does not run with the land unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease."
