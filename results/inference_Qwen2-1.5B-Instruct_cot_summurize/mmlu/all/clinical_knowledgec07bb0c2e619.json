More prominent in expiration\n\nPleural friction rubs can cause a crackling sound during expiration, which means it is more prominent in expiration compared to inhalation. This characteristic makes it easier to distinguish between pleural friction rub and other types of lung sounds. The other options (altering with coughing, no pain over the area, clubbing) do not necessarily indicate a pleural friction rub."
