In Dr. Lykowski's case, it seems like his current divorce is causing him distress, which may be influencing his behavior towards the client. Recognizing this could help him address his countertransference and continue providing effective therapy while maintaining professional boundaries. Consulting with another psychologist might also be beneficial if he feels unsure about how to handle these feelings. Referring the client to another therapist immediately without discussion could potentially harm the therapeutic relationship."
