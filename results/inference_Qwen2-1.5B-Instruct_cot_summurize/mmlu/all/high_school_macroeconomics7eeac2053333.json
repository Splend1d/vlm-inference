The price mechanism (Say's Law) holds, meaning supply equals demand for all goods and services.\nIII. Input and output prices will stay in line with each other.\n\nHowever, they do not necessarily believe that the government should worry about maintaining aggregate demand at an adequate level. In fact, classical economists often advocate for policies that encourage economic growth and stability, such as low taxes and minimal government intervention. They also emphasize the importance of private enterprise and competition to drive innovation and efficiency. Therefore, option D is the most accurate representation of their beliefs on these topics."
