It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nMarx and Engels would be most inclined to view which of the following developments as a significant event in European history?\n\nA. The War of the Roses\nB. The French Revolution of 1789 to 1793\nC. The Seven Years' War\nD. Britain's Glorious Revolution of 1688\n"

The French Revolution of 1789 to 1793\n\nThe French Revolution was a pivotal moment in European history because it marked the beginning of the decline of feudalism and the rise of capitalism. It led to the establishment of the first democratic government in Europe and paved the way for the abolition of slavery and the eventual end of the slave trade.\n\nOption A (The War of the Roses) was a conflict between English nobles during the late 15th century. Option C (The Seven Years' War) involved conflicts in Europe during the early 18th century, which had little impact on European economic structures or social dynamics. Option D (Britain's Glorious Revolution of 1688) was a political event in England during the late 17th century, unrelated to the development of capitalist economies or the rise of class struggle."
