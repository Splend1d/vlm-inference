The motorcyclist was injured and brought suit against the driver of the car and the driver of the truck. The jury returned a verdict finding that the motorcyclist's injuries were caused by negligence on the part of all three of the parties. The jury assigned 55 percent of the fault for the motorcyclist's injuries to the motorcyclist, 25 percent to the driver of the car, and 20 percent to the driver of the truck. The jury found that the amount of the motorcyclist's injuries was$100,000. The motorcyclist enforces the judgment against the driver of the car and collects $45,000 from the driver of the car. If the driver of the car then brings an action against the driver of the truck for contribution, the driver of the car should\n\nA. recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the driver of the truck.\nB. recover $27,000.\nC. recover $20,000.\nD. recover $15,000.\n"

In this case, the driver of the car is seeking contribution against the driver of the truck. \n\nSince the jury found that the motorcyclist's injuries were caused by negligence on the part of all three parties (motorcycle rider, car driver, and truck driver), it means that the driver of the car contributed to the motorcyclist's injuries in some way. However, the jury also found that the motorcyclist was partially responsible for his own injuries as well.\n\nGiven these findings, the driver of the car cannot recover any money from the driver of the truck, because the court has already determined that the driver of the car is not more at fault than the truck driver. Therefore, the driver of the car can only recover from the motorcycle rider if the jury finds that the motorcycle rider was also negligent. But since the jury did not find the motorcycle rider to be at fault, the driver of the car cannot recover from him either.\n\nSo, the driver of the car can only recover from the other two drivers, which means the driver of the car would have to pay $27,000 ($45,000 - $18,000) to the driver of the truck for contribution."
