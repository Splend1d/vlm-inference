While it may seem harmless or even playful at first glance, this type of behavior can be seen as manipulative and potentially harmful. It can lead to feelings of being taken advantage of and can cause harm to your self-esteem and sense of worth. Therefore, option B, \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" is the correct answer."
