To prevent this, it is important to escape user input and use parameterized queries instead of using dynamic SQL. This can be achieved by using prepared statements or parameterized queries with placeholders for variables that need to be inserted later. Additionally, it's important to validate user input before using it in a query and to restrict access to sensitive data to authorized users only."
