The plaintiff alleges only a cause of action arising under a federal statute, although state law provides a similar cause of action.

Should the state court hear the case?\n\nA. No, because cases arising under federal law must be decided in federal court.\nB. No, because state courts must abstain in cases arising under federal law until a federal court has decided the federal issue.\nC. Yes, because state courts may not discriminate against cases arising under discriminate against cases arising under federal law.\nD.

Tompkins (1938) that \"the federal courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over all controversies between citizens of different States respecting their respective rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" This means that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving federal law, including those arising under a federal statute.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff's claim arises under a federal statute, so the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over it. State courts would lack subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case. Therefore, the state court should not hear the case."
