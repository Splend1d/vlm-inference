The sympathetic nervous system primarily stimulates the heart and other organs to increase their activity, but it does not stimulate the dilation of the pupil of the eye.\n\nOther responses:\n\nB. Constriction of blood vessels: This response is also typically stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system.\nC. Increased secretion of the sweat glands: This response is also typically stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system.\nD. Increased peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract: This response is also typically stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system."
