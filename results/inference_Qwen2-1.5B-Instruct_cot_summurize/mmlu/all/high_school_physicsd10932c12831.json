So the force experienced by each new particle will still be proportional to its velocity times the magnetic field strength, but the proportionality factor will now be 2 instead of 1 for each new particle. Therefore, the total force on all new particles combined will still be equal to the original force multiplied by 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1/2 F"
