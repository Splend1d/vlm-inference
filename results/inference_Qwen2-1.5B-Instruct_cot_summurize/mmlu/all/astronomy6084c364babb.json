Because it's in the northern hemisphere where it is winter now.\n\nMars Exploration Rover (MER) Spirit, which landed on Mars in 2004, was designed to explore and study the planet's geology, atmosphere, and potential for liquid water. It spent most of its mission exploring the northern part of Mars, which is the region with the most active volcanoes and other geological features. However, during its final months on the surface, Spirit began experiencing problems with its solar panels, which allowed it to operate only at night. This meant that it had limited visibility from the sky, making it difficult to orient itself correctly.\n\nAs a result, Spirit began to tilt towards the north, facing away from the sun and unable to see much of the Martian landscape. The team worked hard to try to fix the problem, but ultimately decided to bring the rover back to Earth for repairs. When it returned to Earth, scientists found that the cause of the tilt was due to a combination of factors, including the position of the rover's solar panels and the angle of the Martian terrain."
