Everything will happen; everything ought to happen.\n\nAccording to Immanuel Kant's philosophy, there are two types of universal moral principles: the first type is called the \"principle of necessity\" (also known as the \"law of nature\"), which states that everything must happen for it to be in accordance with the law of nature. The second type is the \"principle of morality\" (also known as the \"law of freedom\"), which states that every action has an objective reason or purpose, and therefore should be done out of duty rather than out of inclination or desire.\n\nTherefore, Kant argues that laws of nature are laws according to which everything will happen, while laws of freedom are laws according to which everything ought to happen."
