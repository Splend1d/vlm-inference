It is often expressed as a percentage of the full-scale value (e.g., 0.1% for a resolution of 1 unit). The smaller the resolution, the more sensitive the instrument is to changes in the measured variable.\n\nAccuracy and precision refer to how close the measured value is to the true value, while sensitivity refers to how well the instrument responds to small changes in the measured variable. Sensitivity is not directly related to the ability of the instrument to detect changes in the measured variable; rather, it is the rate at which the instrument responds to changes in the input signal. In other words, it measures the instrument's ability to measure variations in the input signal over time."
