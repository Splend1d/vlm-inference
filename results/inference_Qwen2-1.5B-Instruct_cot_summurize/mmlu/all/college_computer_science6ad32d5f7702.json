III only.\n\nMergesort uses a divide-and-conquer approach that involves dividing the input list into smaller sublists, sorting those sublists, and then merging them back together. To achieve this, we need to have some way to compare and merge the elements in a list efficiently. \n\nAn array is a linear data structure where each element has an index. Therefore, we can use arrays to store the elements in a sorted order and then sort the elements using the merge operation.\n\nA singly linked list is a linear data structure where each node contains a value and a pointer to its next node. To sort a list, we need to be able to compare and merge the nodes efficiently. We can do this by maintaining a temporary pointer and comparing the values at the pointers until we reach the end of one of the lists.\n\nA doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list but it also has a pointer to the previous node. We can still use the same merge operation as above to sort the list.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. III only because an array is the only linear data structure that allows us to easily sort the elements in a list."
