This is generally considered a positive action because it encourages children to eat nutritious foods and develop good habits at an early age.\n\nScenario 2 involves giving a speech to encourage citizens to commit heinous acts, which goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Promoting violence or advocating for harmful actions can be seen as morally wrong because they harm others and violate societal norms.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, scenario 2 is morally wrong."
