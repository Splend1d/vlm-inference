The high school was severely damaged and needed to be rebuilt. As a consequence, the city council held an emergency meeting to determine what measures should be taken to locate an appropriate alternative facility in which to conduct classes. Thereupon, the city council passed the following resolution: \"During restoration of the high school building, classes shall be conducted at the most suitable facility which submits the lowest bid. In determining a \u0080\u0098suitable' facility, the city council shall consider such factors as location and available classroom space. \"Several bids were submitted. The lowest bid was submitted by a church. The church was located on the same block as the high school and contained sufficient seating capacity for all students. In addition, there were a sufficient number of separate rooms to allow different classes to meet at the same time. The city council voted unanimously to accept the church's offer. Furthermore, the church agreed to remove all religious symbols and paraphernalia from the classrooms utilized by the students. Only the main chapel was exempt, so that it could remain open for prayer. No high school classes or activities were to be held in the main chapel. A parent of one of the high school students is upset at this arrangement. On his son's behalf, the parent has filed suit in federal district court to challenge the constitutionality of permitting public school classes to be held in a church. Judgment for whom?\n\nA. The city, because the classroom arrangement does not inhibit or advance religion.\nB. The city, because the church was the lowest bidder in accordance with the emergency ordinance.\nC. The plaintiff, because the present arrangement for conducting classes in a church-owned facility constitutes excessive entanglement with religion.\nD. The plaintiff, because the emergency measure was not necessary to further a compelling state interest.\n"

The plaintiff, because the present arrangement for conducting classes in a church-owned facility constitutes excessive entanglement with religion.\n\nThe case involves a conflict between the rights of parents who want their children to attend classes in a secular setting and the government's desire to accommodate religious practices within the context of a public education system. The issue at hand is whether allowing classes to be held in a church-owned facility goes beyond simply accommodating religious practices and into an area where the government is directly involved in promoting religion.\n\nIn evaluating this case, courts typically look at the extent to which the religious practice interferes with secular functions and whether it promotes or endorses religion. If the religious practice significantly intrudes upon secular functions and promotes religion, then it may be considered excessive entanglement and therefore unconstitutional under certain circumstances. \n\nIn this scenario, the church-owned facility provides adequate space and resources for teaching purposes while also remaining neutral about religious matters. However, the presence of religious symbols and paraphernalia in the classroom raises concerns about excessive entanglement since they could potentially influence the learning environment and promote religious beliefs over secular ones.\n\nTherefore, if the court finds that the arrangement constitutes excessive entanglement with religion, the defendant (the city) would likely lose the lawsuit. This would mean that the church is entitled to hold classes in its facility without any restrictions, and the government cannot force secular activities to take place in a religious setting."
