Six months later, the friend lost his job and was unable to repay the loan to the creditor. After learning of his friend's situation, the creditor sent his friend the following letter on June 1:\"I promise to discharge the $15,000 debt which you owe me upon delivery of your autographed baseball bat if you promise to deliver the bat to me by August 1 . \"After receiving this letter, the friend telephoned the creditor and accepted the offer. The friend's verbal acceptance of the creditor's offer most likely effectuated\n\nA. a bilateral executory accord.\nB. an accord and satisfaction.\nC. a substituted compromise agreement.\nD. a novation.\n"

In this case, the creditor transferred their right to receive the debt (the $15,000) to the friend in exchange for the friend delivering the baseball bat. This is a form of contract modification that satisfies the requirements of a novation."
