While both methods are used to detect unit roots, the DF method assumes that the errors in the time series data are normally distributed and that the process is non-stationary at first differences. On the other hand, the PP approach assumes that the errors are i.i.d., that the process is stationary at first differences, and that the data are integrated.\n\nB. The PP approach differs from the DF approach by reversing the null and alternative hypotheses: Under the null hypothesis of the PP test, we reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than the significance level chosen; otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In contrast, under the null hypothesis of the DF test, we fail to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is greater than or equal to the significance level chosen; otherwise, we reject the null hypothesis. \n\nC. The PP test does incorporate an automatic correction for autocorrelated residuals in the test regression. However, this correction is only applied when the residuals are found to be autocorrelated using the Durbin-Watson statistic. This adjustment helps in reducing Type II error rates, especially in cases where the residual autocorrelation is low but the time series data contains high autocorrelations due to measurement errors or structural breaks.\n\nD. Both DF and PP tests can be robust in small sample sizes, as long as the number of observations exceeds the order of integration of the time series. However, PP has been shown to have better power in small samples compared to DF, which may be due to its ability to handle higher-order integrations more effectively.\n\nIn summary, the key difference between the two approaches is their underlying assumptions about the nature of the errors and the stationarity conditions assumed for the process. Additionally, PP incorporates an automatic correction for autocorrelated residuals, making it more robust against such issues."
