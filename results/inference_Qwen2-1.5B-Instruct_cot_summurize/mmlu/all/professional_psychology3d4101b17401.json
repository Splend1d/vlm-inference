However, the most important factor is whether the use of deception is justified by the objectives of the study. If the use of deception is necessary to achieve the goals of the study and there is no alternative method to obtain the desired results, then the use of deception may be acceptable. Additionally, it is important that the researcher provides clear and transparent explanations of the deception to participants and obtains their informed consent before proceeding with the study. Finally, the researcher should ensure that any deception does not significantly mislead participants or result in harm or distress."
