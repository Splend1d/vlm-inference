The defendant moved to dismiss the action, and the court granted the motion in an order that stated: \"The defendant's motion to dismiss is granted, and this action is dismissed with prejudice.\" The court accordingly entered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff then filed the same claim against the defendant in federal court, invoking diversity jurisdiction. The defendant has asserted the defense of res judicata (claim preclusion) in its answer. Should the federal court give preclusive effect to the state court judgment?\n\nA. No, because the judgment was entered by a state court, not a federal court.\nB. No, because the state court did not rule on the merits in its dismissal.\nC. Yes, because a dismissal with prejudice operates as a judgment on the merits.\nD. Yes, because a judgment for failure to prosecute operates as a judgment on the merits under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n"

Yes, because a dismissal with prejudice operates as a judgment on the merits.\n\nUnder Rule 419 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a dismissal with prejudice means that the court enters final judgment and does not permit the parties to appeal or seek review of the dismissal. This type of dismissal operates as a judgment on the merits, which can be used to establish res judicata or other defenses. In this case, the state court's judgment dismissing the action with prejudice serves as conclusive evidence of the court's ruling on the merits of the case, including any defenses raised by the defendant. Therefore, the federal court should give preclusive effect to the state court judgment."
