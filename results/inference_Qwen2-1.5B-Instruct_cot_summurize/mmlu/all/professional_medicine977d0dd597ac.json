He is a high school freshman and a member of the track team. He reports that his symptoms began shortly after starting spring training. He practices sprints 5 nights a week and runs 2 to 5 miles several days a week in addition to leg training with weights. He admits to being tired and says the training is becoming more intense and that he is a little concerned about his ability to continue on the team. His appetite has been unchanged. Medical history is unremarkable and he takes no medications. He has been your patient for the past 3 years. He seems more sullen than you remember from previous visits. You ask his mother to leave the examining room while you complete the physical examination. After she leaves the room, he admits that he is worried about some lumps in his groin. It is most appropriate to obtain additional history regarding which of the following?\n\nA. Fever and chills\nB. Mood symptoms\nC. School performance\nD. Sexual activity\n"

The mention of lumps in his groin also suggests that he may have concerns or pain associated with this area, which would further support the need for further evaluation. However, without specific information about fever and chills or his school performance, it is not clear if these symptoms are relevant to the current visit. Therefore, option B (mood symptoms) is the most appropriate to consider when assessing the patient's presenting symptoms."
