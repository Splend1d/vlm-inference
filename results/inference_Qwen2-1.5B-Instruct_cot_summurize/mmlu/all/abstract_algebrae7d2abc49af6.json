                    "text": "To factor the polynomial \\(x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1\\) into linear factors modulo \\(7\\), we first need to find the roots of the polynomial and then determine which combination of these roots gives us a polynomial that is divisible by \\((x - r)\\) for some \\(r\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\).\n\nThe given polynomial has no real roots, so let's consider its complex roots:\n\n- \\(z^3 + 2z^2 + 2z + 1 = 0\\) (in \\(z\\))\n- Let \\(z = u + vi\\) where \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are integers from \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7\\).\n- Then, \\(z^3 = (u+vi)^3 = u^3 + v^3i^3 + 3uv(u^2 - vi^2)i = u^3 - v^3 + 3uv(-v^2 + i) = u^3 - v^3 - 3uv^3 + iv\\).\n- We want to solve for \\(u^3 - v^3 - 3uv^3 = 0\\) mod \\(7\\). Since \\(u^3 - v^3\\) is always congruent to 0 mod \\(7\\), we focus on \\(3uv^3\\). This is equivalent to solving for \\(3uv^3 = k\\) mod \\(7\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer.\n- For example, if \\(v = 1\\) and \\(u = 6\\) (since \\(u\\) must be less than 7), then \\(3uv^3 = 3(6)(1)^3 = 54\\) is not congruent to any integer modulo \\(7\\). If we try \\(v = 2\\) instead, then \\(3uv^3 = 3(6)(2)^3 = 288\\) is congruent to \\(1\\) mod \\(7\\), since \\(288 = 40*7 + 1\\).\n- Therefore, one root of our cubic equation modulo \\(7\\) is \\(z = 1 + 2i\\).\n\nNow, let's express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(z\\) and \\(z^{-1}\\):\n\n\\[z = 1 + 2i\\]\n\\[z^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1 + 2i} = \\frac{(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)} = \\frac{1 - 4}{1 + 4} = \\frac{-3}{5}\\]\n\nSo, \\(x = z(z^{-1}) = (1 + 2i)(-3/5) = -3/5 - 6i/5\\).\n\nSince we're working modulo \\(7\\), we also have \\(x = -3/5 + 6i/5\\), but we only consider \\(x\\) with non-negative imaginary part as valid solutions.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of \\(x\\) are \\(-3/5, 6/5, 2, 1\\). The corresponding roots of the original polynomial modulo \\(7\\) are \\(x = 2, 1, 6/5, 2/5\\).\n\nThus, the correct factorization is \\((x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1)\\).\n\nSo, the answer is A.
