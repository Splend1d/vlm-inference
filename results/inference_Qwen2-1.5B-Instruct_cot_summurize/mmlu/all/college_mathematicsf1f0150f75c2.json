Since \\(f(0) = -7 < 0\\), it suggests that the polynomial will cross the x-axis at least once, but without more information about the exact form of the polynomial, we cannot definitively say how many real roots it has.\n\nHowever, based on the general rule, we know that since there's only one sign change, there could be at most two positive roots. Without further analysis or additional constraints, we cannot confidently conclude the exact number of real roots.\n\nTherefore, given the limited information provided:\n\nOption B: One is the correct answer."
