According to the World Health Organization, red and processed meats such as bacon, sausages, and ham are high in saturated fat, which can increase the risk of heart disease. However, it is important to note that a balanced diet should include a variety of foods from different food groups, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and dairy products. Additionally, consuming adequate amounts of lean proteins from sources like poultry, fish, and plant-based proteins (such as beans, lentils, and tofu) can also help meet nutritional needs."
