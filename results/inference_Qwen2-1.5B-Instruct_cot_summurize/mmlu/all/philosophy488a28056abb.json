According to John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism, the value of an action or pleasure is determined by its contribution to overall happiness and well-being for the greatest number of people. Therefore, if someone prefers a particular pleasure over another, it may be because they believe it will bring them closer to achieving their goals or fulfilling their desires. However, this does not necessarily mean that the pleasure itself is objectively more valuable than the other. It is up to individuals to decide what makes them happy and choose actions that align with their values and preferences."
