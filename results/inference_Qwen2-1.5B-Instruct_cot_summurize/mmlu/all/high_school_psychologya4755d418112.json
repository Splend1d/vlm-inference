The behaviorist model of personality emphasizes that personality traits and behaviors are learned through experience, rather than being inherent or fixed characteristics of the individual. This means that environmental factors play a much larger role in shaping an individual's personality than do biological or genetic factors. Therefore, the behaviorist model is considered to be less deterministic than the other three models."
