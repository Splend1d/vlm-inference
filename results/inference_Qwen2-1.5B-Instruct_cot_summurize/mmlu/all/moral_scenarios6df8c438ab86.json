Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nScenario 1 involves throwing a life vest at someone who is already struggling for survival, which goes against basic principles of rescue and survival skills. This action could potentially save someone's life, but it also has serious consequences if not done properly or with appropriate precautions.\n\nScenario 2 involves playing baseball in one's grandmother's backyard, which is generally considered harmless and enjoyable. There are no clear moral implications associated with this activity, and it is not inherently wrong or right.\n\nTherefore, the main character did something clearly morally wrong in scenario 1, while they did nothing morally wrong in scenario 2."
