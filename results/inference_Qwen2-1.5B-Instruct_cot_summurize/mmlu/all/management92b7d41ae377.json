Uncertain and non-routine\n\nProgrammed decisions are characterized by their uncertainty, as they involve making choices that have potential consequences that cannot be predicted with certainty. They may also be non-routine because the situation or problem being addressed is unique or not easily solved through standard procedures.\n\nComplex decisions can also be programmed, but this refers to situations where there is significant complexity involved in the decision-making process. In contrast, routine decisions refer to decisions that are made repeatedly based on established processes and guidelines, while low-risk decisions typically involve minimal uncertainty and low probability of negative outcomes."
