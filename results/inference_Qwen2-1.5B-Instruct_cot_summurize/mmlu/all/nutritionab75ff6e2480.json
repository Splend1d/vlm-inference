Increasing muscle glycogen use during exercise\n\nAdaptive responses to endurance training involve changes in the body's ability to store energy and use it efficiently. When an individual engages in endurance training, their muscles become better at utilizing glucose (sugar) as an energy source during exercise. This adaptation leads to increased muscle glycogen stores, which can be used for energy when needed.\n\nMuscle glycogen stores are important because they provide quick energy during short bursts of activity like sprinting or high-intensity interval training. As a result, endurance training increases the capacity of the body to perform these types of activities more effectively and sustainably over time."
