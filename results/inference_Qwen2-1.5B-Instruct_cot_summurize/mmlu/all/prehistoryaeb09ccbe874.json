The Aurignacian culture, which flourished in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic period, is known for its distinctive tool-making techniques and aesthetic preferences. One of the defining features of Aurignacian tools is their use of a relatively flat, polished surface called an Aurignacian point. This point shape allowed for a greater degree of flexibility in shaping the tool's edge, enabling it to be used for a variety of tasks such as butchering, hunting, and crafting. \n\nIn contrast, Mousterian technology, which emerged later, often involved the production of projectile points, or spearheads, rather than usable blades. These were typically made using a different technique that involved chipping away at a core stone until it broke off into smaller pieces, allowing them to be shaped into a pointed tip. While Mousterian tools were also effective in many contexts, they lacked the versatility and adaptability of Aurignacian tools.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface."
