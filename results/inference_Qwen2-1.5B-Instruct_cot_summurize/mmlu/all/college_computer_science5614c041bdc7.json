This problem is decidable because it can be solved using basic arithmetic operations.\n\nThe problem stated in II is not decidable. It requires us to determine if the output of a program is equal to \u03c0's decimal expansion, which is undecidable due to the non-computability of \u03c0's decimal expansion.\n\nThe problem stated in III is also not decidable. It asks whether a specific algorithm will always produce the same output for all prefixes of \u03c0's decimal expansion, but this property is not guaranteed by the algorithm itself; rather, it depends on the specific implementation details of the algorithm. Therefore, this problem is also not decidable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and II only."
