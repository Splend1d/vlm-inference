Reinforcers, as they both involve the process of rewarding or punishing behavior in order to modify it. In Murray's case, he was interested in understanding how social norms and rewards shape behavior, while Maslow believed that self-actualization is achieved through the attainment of personal goals and values. Both theorists believe in the importance of reinforcement in shaping behavior, but their focus and applications may differ."
