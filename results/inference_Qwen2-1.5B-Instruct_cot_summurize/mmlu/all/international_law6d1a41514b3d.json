However, some states may have greater influence over others based on their power, resources, or historical relationships.\n\nFor example, the United Nations Security Council has five permanent members - the UK, US, France, Russia, and China - who hold veto power over decisions made by the council. This gives these countries a significant level of control over global politics.\n\nSimilarly, some states may have greater economic or military power, which can give them greater influence over other states. For instance, a country with large reserves of oil could exert greater influence over nations with weaker economies.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that international law is not a fixed system and can change depending on the needs and priorities of different states. Therefore, while certain states may have more influence or power than others, this does not necessarily mean that they have a \"hierarchy\" over others."
