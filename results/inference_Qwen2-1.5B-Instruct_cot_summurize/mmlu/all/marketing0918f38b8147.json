Luxury products are typically items that are bought by a small percentage of the population and require consumers to have a higher income level in order to afford them. They also require a significant amount of time and effort for research and comparison shopping, as they are often not widely available or easily comparable to other products. Additionally, luxury products may change rapidly in technology and design over time, requiring frequent updates to keep up with changes in fashion or societal preferences."
