The proton gradient across the membrane where the ATP synthase is embedded represents potential energy.\n\nIn oxidative phosphorylation, the energy required for ATP synthesis comes primarily from the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane (or outer membrane in prokaryotes). This proton gradient is created by the electrochemical gradient of the concentration of hydrogen ions across the mitochondrial membrane, which results from the active transport of protons against their concentration gradient. This proton gradient is used to drive the recombination of protons into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the ATP synthase enzyme complex."
