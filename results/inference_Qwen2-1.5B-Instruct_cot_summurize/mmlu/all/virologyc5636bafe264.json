Informed consent\n\nInformed consent is the process by which participants in an experiment or research study are fully informed about the nature and purpose of the study, as well as its potential risks and benefits. This ensures that participants understand what they are agreeing to participate in, and that their rights and welfare are respected. It is considered one of the most important elements of ethical research on human subjects because it ensures that participants are not coerced into participating and that their participation is voluntary and informed."
