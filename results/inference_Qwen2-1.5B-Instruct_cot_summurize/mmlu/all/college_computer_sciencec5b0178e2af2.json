However, increasing the clock cycle rate or disallowing forward propagation in the pipeline will not improve the execution time of a typical program because these changes do not allow for parallelism between instructions.\n\nDoubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache can potentially improve performance by allowing more recent instructions to be fetched faster from memory. However, this does not directly affect the number of cycles needed to execute an instruction. Therefore, it is unlikely that doubling the cache sizes would significantly improve the execution time of a typical program."
