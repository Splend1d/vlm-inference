The daughter says, \"I visited Mom today for the first time in 6 months; her memory has worsened, her bills are unpaid, and her house is unusually messy.\" The patient says, \"I'm perfectly healthy.\" Medical history is significant for hypertension diagnosed more than 25 years ago, and two small strokes occurring 3 years and 7 months ago. The daughter gives you three empty medicine bottles from her mother's home: metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and aspirin. The patient is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 36.4\u00b0C (97.6\u00b0F), pulse 76/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 196/112 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. Muscle strength in her left hand is 1/5. Strength in the right extremities is 4/5. The patient is oriented only to self; she does not know the day of the week or today's date. She recalls 0 of 3 words at 5 minutes, and she is unable to name 2 objects, correctly draw interlocking pentagons, or count backwards by serial sevens. Complete blood count, renal function studies, liver function studies, and urinalysis are all within the reference ranges. ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms?\n\nA. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nB. Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration\nC. Neurosyphilis\nD. Vascular dementia\n"

Vascular dementia\n\nVascular dementia refers to a type of dementia that results from damage to the brain caused by a stroke, which can lead to problems with memory, language, behavior, and personality. In this case, the patient's medical history includes previous strokes, as well as symptoms consistent with vascular dementia, such as memory loss and confusion.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and corticobasilar degeneration are both types of neurodegenerative diseases that can cause similar symptoms, but they affect different areas of the brain. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy, while corticobasilar degeneration affects the part of the brain responsible for controlling movement and balance.\n\nNeurosyphilis is a rare infection caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum that can affect the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. It can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, including memory loss, but it is less common than other causes of dementia and would not be expected to cause the symptoms described in this case.\n\nErectile dysfunction and anxiety disorders are also possible diagnoses, but they are not typically associated with the specific symptoms described in the patient's presentation."
