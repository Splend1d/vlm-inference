In this process, metals like iron and nickel were formed and began to accumulate at the center of the growing planet. As the planet continued to grow, these metals were pushed towards the surface through the effects of convection currents within the planet. This process led to the formation of the rocky outer layers of the planet, with the inner core containing primarily metallic materials."
