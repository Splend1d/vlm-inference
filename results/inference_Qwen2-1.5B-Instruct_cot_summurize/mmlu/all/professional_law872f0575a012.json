This amount was the fair market value of the work to be performed. The landscaper performed the work for four months but was then offered another job for $500 per month and, after notifying the homeowner, stopped doing the promised work and took the other job. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything. The homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper to complete the work for $300 per month. In a lawsuit between the landscaper and the homeowner, what is the likely result?\n\nA. The homeowner will recover $600, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.\nB. The homeowner will recover $400, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.\nC. The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.\nD. Neither the landscaper nor the homeowner will recover, because neither has suffered any loss.\n"

However, the landscaper's earnings from the new job would not constitute unjust enrichment since it was not part of their original agreement with the homeowner. Therefore, the landscaper would only recover $600 for the work already done.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The homeowner will recover $400, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper."
