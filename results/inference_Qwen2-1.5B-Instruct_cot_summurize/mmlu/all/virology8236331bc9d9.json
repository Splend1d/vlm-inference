Self-assemble of virus L1 protein into VLP\n\nThe successful HPV vaccine is composed of self-assembled virus-like particles (VLPs) made from the L1 protein of the human papillomavirus (HPV). These VLPs mimic the structure and function of the virus, but do not contain any live viruses or genetic material. The VLPs are designed to stimulate an immune response against HPV infection, leading to protection against certain types of cervical cancer."
