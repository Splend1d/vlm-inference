An increased risk of low birth weight: Cocaine use has been linked to reduced fetal growth and development, which can result in low birth weight.\n2. Poorer growth and lower intelligence: Studies have shown that children born to mothers who use cocaine have lower IQ scores than those born to non-users.\n3. Smaller head circumference: Cocaine use can also cause changes in brain structure, such as a smaller head circumference, which can affect cognitive development and overall health.\n\nIt's important to note that cocaine use during pregnancy is not only harmful to the mother but also to the developing fetus. If you or someone you know is experiencing cocaine use during pregnancy, it's crucial to seek help immediately. There are many resources available, including support groups, counseling, and medication-assisted treatment options."
