So the common difference of this arithmetic sequence is 20.\n\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and n is the term number.\n\nWe want to find the 8th term, so we substitute $a_1 = 20$, $d = 20$, and $n = 8$: \\[a_8 = 20 + (8-1) \\cdot 20 = 20 + 7 \\cdot 20 = 20 + 140 = 160.\\]\n\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{A}$."
