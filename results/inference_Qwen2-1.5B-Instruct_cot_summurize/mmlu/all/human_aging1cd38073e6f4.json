Development in any particular areas (e.g., social) is tied to development in other areas (e.g., cognitive)\n\nThis perspective acknowledges the interconnected nature of human development, where changes in one area often have an impact on another. For example, changes in cognitive abilities can affect how individuals interact socially or how they perceive their environment. Similarly, changes in socio-cultural conditions can influence development in various domains such as language acquisition, emotional regulation, and social skills. This understanding underscores the importance of considering historical and cultural contexts when studying development."
