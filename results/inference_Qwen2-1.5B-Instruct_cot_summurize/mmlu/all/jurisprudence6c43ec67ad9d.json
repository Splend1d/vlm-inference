The Nazi law in question was validly enacted. \n\nHart's response to Fuller's argument is that Nazi laws were validly enacted because they had been promulgated by a legitimate authority, which was the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). Therefore, the laws were not arbitrary or capricious, but rather were based on clear and legitimate principles.\n\nIt is important to note that Hart's views on legal validity are controversial, and some scholars have criticized his approach as overly simplistic and ignoring the complexities of legal systems. However, for the sake of this question, we can assume that Hart would likely support the view that Nazi laws were validly enacted."
