Increased body fat\n\nAs we age, our bodies tend to lose muscle mass and gain body fat, which can lead to a decrease in overall strength and an increase in risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Additionally, bone density decreases, leading to an increased risk of fractures. Therefore, it is important for older adults to maintain a healthy balance between muscle and fat, and engage in regular physical activity to help prevent these changes in body composition."
