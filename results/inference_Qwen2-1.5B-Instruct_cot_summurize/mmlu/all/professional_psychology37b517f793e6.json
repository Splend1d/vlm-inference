This type of leadership style involves setting clear expectations and boundaries to ensure that all team members understand their roles and responsibilities.\n\nOption A (establishing supportive relationships with subordinates) does not directly address the path-goal theory of leadership. While it may involve building trust and rapport with subordinates, it does not necessarily maximize subordinate satisfaction and motivation as predicted by the path-goal theory.\n\nOption B (including subordinates in decision-making) can be seen as an aspect of the instrumental leadership style, but it is less explicitly stated than the other options. Option D (setting challenging goals and encouraging higher levels of performance) also aligns with the path-goal theory of leadership, as it emphasizes setting goals that are both challenging and aligned with the employees' personal aspirations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. sets challenging goals and encourages higher levels of performance"
