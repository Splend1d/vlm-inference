The principal also included a copy of the disciplinary code in the letter. On January 19, the student and his mother met with the principal in his office to discuss the matter, and the student admitted that he used abusive language to a fellow student. On January 22, the student's parents received a letter informing them that his teacher had upheld the school administration's decision to suspend their son.

The student's suspension did not constitute a denial of due process.\n\nThis is because the student's suspension was based on his violation of specific sections of the disciplinary code, which were clearly outlined in the letter sent to his parents. Additionally, the student's admission of wrongdoing during the meeting with the principal was taken into account, and the recommendation for suspension was upheld by the school board. Therefore, the student's rights to due process were not violated."
