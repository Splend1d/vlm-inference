An alliance refers to the sense of connection and mutual respect that develops between group members, which creates a supportive environment for sharing feelings and experiences. This is similar to the therapeutic alliance in individual therapy, where the therapist and client form a bond based on trust and empathy. Therefore, option D (alliance) is the correct answer."
