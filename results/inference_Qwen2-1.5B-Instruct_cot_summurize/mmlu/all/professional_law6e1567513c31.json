Finally, the parents of one dead soldier has enough and sues the preacher, and the case goes all the way to the Supreme Court. Would the Court likely find in favor of the preacher or the father?\n\nA. The father, as a funeral is a private affair.\nB. The preacher, because it involves a matter of public interest.\nC. The father, because time, place, and manner restrictions should have been in place.\nD. The father, because the First Amendment does not include protection for vicious verbal assaults such as this.\n"

The father, because the First Amendment does not include protection for vicious verbal assaults such as this.\n\nThe First Amendment protects free speech, but it also includes limitations on what can be said and how it can be said. In this case, the preacher's actions were clearly not protected by the First Amendment, as they amounted to a violent and abusive attack on the family of a deceased soldier.\n\nWhile the preacher may argue that his actions were part of a larger cause or mission, the court would likely find against him based on the clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the family."
