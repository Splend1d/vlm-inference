However, if this spending increase is not matched by an equal increase in government spending or taxation, then crowding out occurs. This means that the additional spending from consumers and firms does not directly result in more overall economic activity because the government cannot borrow enough money to cover these additional expenditures. As a result, the economy may grow faster than what would have occurred without crowding out, but it will not reach its full potential."
