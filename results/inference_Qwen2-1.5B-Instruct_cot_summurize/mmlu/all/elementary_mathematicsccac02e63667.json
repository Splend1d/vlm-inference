Then, if there is an even number of values in the set, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If there is an odd number of values, the median is simply the middle value.\n\nGiven the set: 13, 18, 23, 25, 29, 32\n\nArranging it in ascending order gives us:\n\n13, 18, 23, 25, 29, 32\n\nSince there are an odd number of values (6), the median is the middle value, which is 25.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 25."
