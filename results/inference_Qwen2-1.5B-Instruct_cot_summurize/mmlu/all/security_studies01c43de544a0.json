Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential.\nB. The hierarchical analysts believe that generally there has been a tendency of officials to have over-inflated the estimation of the levels of violence and wealth generated by their activities. If the wealth is not as great as is widely believed, their threat to the licit economy is vastly reduced.\nC. Hierarchical forms of organization are highly adaptable and small fluid groups enable a pronounced degree of resilience (attributable to the logic of supply rising to meet demand) against law enforcement efforts confined to rigid ranking of cooperation.\nD. Hierarchical groups pose a serious degree of harm by their profit-driven crimes under centralized leadership. Targeting the proceeds or leadership would therefore produce a reduction in their threat on the legitimate economy.\n"

Hierarchical forms of transnational crime may not necessarily be limited to a specific territorial affiliation with a particular state/ethnic-cultural group, but rather may operate across multiple jurisdictions and regions.\n\nB. It is possible for hierarchical organizations to have exaggerated estimates of their wealth and violent activities due to the influence of leaders who prioritize their own interests over those of their followers. This could potentially reduce the perceived threat to the legitimate economy if these estimates turn out to be inaccurate.\n\nC. Hierarchical organizations may be more adaptable and resilient than other types of criminal groups, particularly in situations where resources and support are available from within their own network. This could make them more difficult to disrupt or dismantle.\n\nD. If hierarchical organizations were to target the proceeds or leadership of another group, it could result in a decrease in their overall threat to the legitimate economy. However, this approach might also increase tensions between different hierarchical organizations, leading to further conflicts and instability."
