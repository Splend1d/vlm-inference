The economy initially had some unemployed resources.\n\nAn expansionary fiscal policy, such as increased government spending or tax cuts, typically results in higher levels of aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS). As a result, prices rise due to the increased money supply, leading to inflation. However, if the increase in AD is larger than the increase in AS (i.e., the economy has some unemployed resources), then there may still be a surplus in the economy, which can lead to a temporary increase in unemployment. This situation occurs when the economy is initially in equilibrium with AD above AS but the increase in AD overshadows the decrease in AS due to the presence of unemployed resources. Therefore, option B is correct."
