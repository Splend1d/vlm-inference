Instead, they may rise slightly due to the increased demand for energy. However, there can be some variability in how much glucose is produced by the liver and muscles compared to what is used for energy during exercise. This can lead to fluctuations in blood glucose levels, but overall, the blood glucose concentration during this time period should remain relatively stable."
