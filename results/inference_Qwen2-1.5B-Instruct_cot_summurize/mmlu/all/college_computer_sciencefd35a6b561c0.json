We can see that there are four bits representing the first track (F), three bits representing the second track (E), two bits representing the third track (2), and one bit representing the fourth track (0). So, the total number of bits in the segment is 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\nNow, let's count how many bits are occupied:\n- F: 1 bit\n- E: 1 bit\n- 2: 1 bit\n- 0: 1 bit\n\nSo, there are 4 bits out of 10 that are occupied, which means the percentage of occupied tracks is 4/10 * 100% = 40%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 44%."
