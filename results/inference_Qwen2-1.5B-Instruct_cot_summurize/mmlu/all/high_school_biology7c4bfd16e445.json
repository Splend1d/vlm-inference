A guanine cap is added to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA.\n\nThis is incorrect because a guanine (G) cap is not added to the 5' end of the mRNA, but rather a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap is added instead. The 7-methylguanosine cap is found on the 5' end of messenger RNA (mRNA). This modification helps to stabilize mRNA during translation and prevent degradation by ribosomes."
