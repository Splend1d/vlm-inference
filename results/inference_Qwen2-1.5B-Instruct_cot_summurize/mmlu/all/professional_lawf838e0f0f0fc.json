The boyfriend asked his girlfriend to drive the getaway car, to which she agreed, on the condition that no loaded weapons were used during the robbery. On the day of the robbery, the boyfriend and his girlfriend drove to the grocery store. Unknown to the girlfriend, the boyfriend entered the store with a loaded gun. The boyfriend approached one of the cashiers and told him to fill a bag with all the money from the register. When the cashier refused, the boyfriend shot and killed him. He then turned to the next cashier and pointed his gun at her. The cashier suffered a heart attack and died. The boyfriend then took the money from the registers himself and exited the store. One of the customers had called the police, and they were waiting outside. A shootout ensued, and the boyfriend was killed by the police. If this jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder, the girlfriend is guilty if how many counts of murder?\n\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 3\nD. None.\n"

In this scenario, the boyfriend committed the underlying felony of robbing the grocery store, so he is considered to be the \"agency\" or \"principal\" actor in the crime. As such, anyone who aids or abets the commission of the underlying felony can also be charged with murder.\n\nIn this case, the girlfriend helped the boyfriend commit the underlying felony by driving the getaway car, but she did not actually participate in the actual robbery itself. Therefore, she would only be charged with murder if she was involved in some way in aiding or abetting the commission of the underlying felony, which includes helping the boyfriend enter the store with a loaded gun or providing information about the location of the safe deposit box. However, there is no indication that she played any role in the actual robbery itself. So, based solely on the facts presented, the girlfriend could potentially be charged with two counts of murder: one count for the death of the first cashier and another count for the death of the second cashier."
