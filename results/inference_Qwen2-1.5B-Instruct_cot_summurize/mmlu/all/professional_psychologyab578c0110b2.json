A significantly higher Verbal IQ score on the WAIS-III suggests that the individual may have an underlying mental health condition such as depression, which can affect cognitive function and performance IQ scores. However, it's important to note that other factors such as personality traits and environmental factors can also contribute to differences in IQ scores between verbal and performance IQ. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations."
