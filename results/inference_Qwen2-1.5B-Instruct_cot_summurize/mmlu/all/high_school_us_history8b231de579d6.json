Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nThe ideas expressed above were influenced by which of the following?\n\nA. Widespread prosperity in the 1920s\nB. Widespread economic hardship in the 1920s\nC. The rapid growth of the welfare state in the 1920s\nD. Highly publicized antitrust prosecutions\n"

Widespread economic hardship in the 1920s\n\nCalvin Coolidge's statement about the importance of economy in the interest of all reflects the context of the Great Depression and the harsh economic conditions experienced during that period. The idea of protecting citizens' property from unjust taxation aligns closely with the concerns raised during this time about the need for fiscal responsibility and the potential for government overreach.\n\nWhile there may have been other influences, such as the growing awareness of social issues like poverty and unemployment, the specific historical backdrop of the 1920s provides the clearest connection between the quote and the events of that era. The Great Depression and its aftermath led to widespread economic hardship, which underscored the need for governments to be cautious with their tax powers and ensure that they do not infringe upon individual liberties."
