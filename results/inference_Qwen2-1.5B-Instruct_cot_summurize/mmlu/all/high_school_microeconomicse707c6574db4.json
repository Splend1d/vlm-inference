This could lead to an increase in demand for multigrained bread, causing prices to rise. As a result, the demand curve shifts to the right, indicating an increase in the quantity demanded. However, this does not necessarily mean that the supply curve will also shift to the right, as there may still be other factors affecting supply, such as production costs or consumer preferences."
