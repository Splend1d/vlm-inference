This can be achieved by increasing consumer or business confidence, reducing taxes, lowering interest rates, or expanding government spending on infrastructure or social programs.\n\nOn the other hand, shifting the aggregate supply curve to the left would decrease output and prices, leading to a recession rather than closing it. Similarly, shifting the aggregate supply curve to the right would not necessarily lead to economic growth but could also contribute to inflation if demand exceeds supply."
