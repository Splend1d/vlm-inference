Normative, Descriptive and Instrumental\n\nThis type of theory focuses on the ethical implications of corporate actions and how they impact society as a whole. It emphasizes the importance of corporate responsibility towards stakeholders such as employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, and the community. The normative aspect of this theory deals with the moral obligations that businesses have towards their stakeholders, while the descriptive aspect looks at the actual practices and behaviors of corporations in relation to their stakeholders.\n\nThe instrumental aspect of this theory is concerned with the practical implications of these ethical obligations, such as the cost-benefit analysis of different corporate strategies and the potential consequences of different corporate actions. This approach seeks to maximize the interests of all stakeholders by finding a balance between economic efficiency and social responsibility.\n\nOverall, stakeholder theory provides a framework for understanding the complex relationships between businesses and their stakeholders, and it helps organizations make decisions that are both ethically sound and financially beneficial."
