Lyotard's dictum \"I define postmodernism as incredulity toward meta-narratives\" suggests that postmodernists reject the idea of universal truths or overarching narratives that govern human experience and society.\n\nTherefore, option A (individual stories are suspect) is not directly supported by Lyotard's definition of postmodernism. Option B (the law is static) could be seen as part of the postmodern critique of authority and hierarchies, but it does not fully capture the essence of Lyotard's concept. Option C (universal values are meaningless) goes too far because postmodernism acknowledges that some universal principles such as freedom, equality, and justice still hold significant value. \n\nOption D (literature reproduces repression) is also not directly supported by Lyotard's definition. Postmodernism does not necessarily mean that literature is repressive; rather, it emphasizes the importance of questioning and deconstructing dominant narratives and ideologies in order to create more truthful representations of reality."
