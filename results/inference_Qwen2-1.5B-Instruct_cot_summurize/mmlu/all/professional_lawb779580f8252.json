The note read as follows: \"Do you think this contract of sale for my boat complies with state law? I would have talked to you in person about this, but I'm on my way out of town. I will be back next week.\" The attorney reviewed the document and wrote a one-page letter to the client stating that the document complied with state law. The lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a lawyer included a bill for $500, which was a reasonable fee. The client refused to pay the attorney anything, arguing that she had never agreed to retain the attorney and that she had received nothing of value from the attorney because the sales transaction was never concluded. Assume that there is no applicable statute or rule governing the formation of attorney-client relationships in the jurisdiction. If the attorney sues the client for the $500, will the attorney be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because even if the parties had an agreement, that agreement was discharged under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\nB. No, because the attorney and the client never agreed on the essential terms of a contract.\nC. Yes, because the attorney took action on the client's note to his detriment.\nD. Yes, because the client's note and the attorney's performance created an implied- in-fact contract.\n"

Yes, because the client's note and the attorney's performance created an implied-in-fact contract.\n\nThe doctrine of frustration of purpose refers to a situation where the purpose of a contract has been frustrated due to unforeseen circumstances beyond both parties' control. In this case, the client's note indicates that she intended to take legal advice on a specific matter related to her business, specifically a contract for the sale of a boat. However, when she left town, it became impractical for her to continue seeking legal advice from the attorney. This event caused a significant disruption to the original purpose of the contract, leading to its frustration.\n\nThe attorney, therefore, performed services on behalf of the client without any expectation of compensation in return, based on the assumption that the client would seek further advice after returning to town. This performance by the attorney is considered a detriment to the client, who did not receive anything of value for these actions. Hence, assuming the attorney acted reasonably and diligently, the attorney can argue that they have a valid claim against the client for the fees charged during the time of frustration.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the outcome depends on the jurisdiction's laws regarding the formation of attorney-client relationships, which may vary. It's also crucial to consider whether the client's note was a genuine request for legal advice or if it was merely a means to avoid payment for past services rendered."
