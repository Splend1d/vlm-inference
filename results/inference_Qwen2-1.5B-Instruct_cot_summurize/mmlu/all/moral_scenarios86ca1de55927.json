This behavior can be seen as irresponsible and unprofessional, especially if it affects their ability to perform their job effectively or leads to negative consequences for themselves or others.\nScenario 2, on the other hand, involves telling an age-inappropriate joke or using language that may be perceived as inappropriate or offensive. While this type of behavior can be considered morally wrong in some contexts, it is not necessarily considered morally wrong in all situations or contexts, and depends on the specific circumstances and cultural norms involved.\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer would be A.
