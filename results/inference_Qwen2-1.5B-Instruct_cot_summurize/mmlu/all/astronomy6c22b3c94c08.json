The North Star, also known as Polaris, is located at the north celestial pole and can be seen from anywhere on Earth with an unobstructed view of the northern hemisphere. As you travel northward, the angle between the observer and Polaris increases, causing the star to appear lower in the sky. This phenomenon is due to the rotation of the Earth around its axis."
