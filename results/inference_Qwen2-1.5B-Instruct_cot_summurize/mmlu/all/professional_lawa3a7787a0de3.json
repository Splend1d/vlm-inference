At trial, the prosecutor calls the defendant's wife as a willing witness to testify that the defendant told her in confidence that he had misrepresented his assets on the loan application. The defendant objects to his wife's testimony. Should the testimony be admitted?\n\nA. No, because even though the wife is a willing witness, the defendant has the right to exclude confidential marital communications in federal court.\nB. No, but only if the law of the state where the defendant and his wife reside recognizes a privilege for confidential marital communications.\nC. Yes, because in federal court the right not to testify belongs to the testifying spouse, and she is a willing witness.\nD. Yes, because while the adverse testimonial privilege is recognized in federal court, the marital communications privilege is not.\n"

No, because even though the wife is a willing witness, the defendant has the right to exclude confidential marital communications in federal court.\n\nThe reason is that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not recognize an absolute privilege for confidential marital communications between spouses in federal court. However, the rules do allow the defendant to object to the admission of such evidence based on the doctrine of spoliation or undue prejudice. Therefore, the decision whether to admit the testimony lies within the discretion of the judge, who must balance the probative value of the testimony against any potential prejudice to the defendant. In this case, the judge would consider whether the testimony would be relevant to prove the truth of the matter asserted by the prosecution and whether it was given under oath and voluntarily. If the judge determines that the testimony meets these criteria, then it may be admissible."
