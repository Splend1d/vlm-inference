Therefore, increasing the concentration of any reactant or decreasing the temperature would not increase the amount of product formed.\n\nHowever, increasing the pressure could decrease the activation energy required for the reaction to occur, potentially leading to a higher yield of product. This is because increased pressure can reduce the volume of the system and thus lower the Gibbs free energy of the system, making it easier for the reaction to proceed. However, this is not directly related to the concentration or temperature of the reactants.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Increasing the pressure."
