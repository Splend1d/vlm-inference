For Earth, we have $G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{N m}^2/\\text{kg}^2$, $M = 5.97 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg}$, and $m = 5.97 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg}$.\n\nPlugging these into our expression gives us:\n\n$$\nW_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{2(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{N m}^2/\\text{kg}^2)}{5.97 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg}}\n$$\n\n$$\nW_{\\text{planet}} = \\frac{13.348 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{N}}{\\text{kg}}\n$$\n\n$$\nW_{\\text{planet}} = 13.348 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{N/kg}\n$$\n\nTo convert this back to Newtons, we multiply by the gravitational acceleration on Earth ($g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$):\n\n$$\nW_{\\text{planet}} = 13.348 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{N/kg} \\times 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\n$$\n\n$$\nW_{\\text{planet}} = 12.93 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{N}\n$$\n\n$$\nW_{\\text{planet}} = 1.293 \\, \\text{N}\n$$\n\nThis means that the astronaut weighs approximately 1.293 N on the planet. The correct answer is not listed among your choices, but the closest one to what you calculated is D. 1600 N. This calculation was based on assuming the same mass and radius for the planet as Earth, which is likely not accurate since the masses and radii are different. However, in this context, considering the closest option among the ones provided, the best estimate would be A. 200 N or B. 400 N, depending on whether the assumption about the planet being exactly twice Earth's size holds true or not."
