Resource scarcity concerns: Energy is one of the most critical resources for human life, and its availability can have significant impacts on national security. In times of resource scarcity, countries may face disruptions in energy supply, which can lead to economic instability, social unrest, and even conflict.\n\n  B. Political instability: Energy is often closely linked to geopolitical tensions and conflicts, as countries compete over access to natural resources and influence over others. A lack of stable energy\u4f9b\u5e94 can exacerbate existing political divisions and fuel regional tensions.\n\n  C. Globalization: Energy is a global commodity, and its distribution and consumption can be influenced by international politics and economics. Countries that rely heavily on imported energy sources may become vulnerable to external shocks or geopolitical pressures.\n\n  D. Contingency planning: Energy security is essential for any country's strategic planning and contingency planning, as it can affect military readiness, economic stability, and diplomatic relations.\n\nTherefore, all of these factors make energy security a crucial topic of study in contemporary security studies."
