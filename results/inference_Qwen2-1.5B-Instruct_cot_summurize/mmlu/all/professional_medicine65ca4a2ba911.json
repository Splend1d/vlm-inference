Antigenic variation. \n\nAntigenic variation refers to changes in the surface antigens of an organism, which can lead to cross-reactivity between different strains of the same pathogen. This can result in recurrent infections, as the immune system becomes more tolerant to the antigenic variants of the same pathogen.\n\nIn this case, the patient's previous infection with the same strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae may have led to the development of antibody tolerance, making it easier for the bacteria to colonize the urethra during subsequent infections. The presence of gram-negative diplococci in the urethral exudate also suggests that there may be other organisms present that could contribute to the recurrence of the infection."
