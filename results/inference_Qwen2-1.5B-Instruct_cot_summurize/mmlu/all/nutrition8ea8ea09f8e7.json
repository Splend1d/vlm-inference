It has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and may play a role in regulating metabolic disorders such as obesity.\n\nCurcumin is a compound found in turmeric that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It has also been shown to have potential anti-cancer properties.\n\nGenistein is a phytoestrogen that is present in soybeans and other legumes. While it does not directly regulate gene expression like some other dietary compounds, it may influence gene expression through its ability to bind to estrogen receptors in certain tissues.\n\nTherefore, all of these compounds have the potential to act as epigenetic modifiers through their effects on gene expression."
