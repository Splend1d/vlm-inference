He made significant contributions to the field, including developing his famous theory on demand and supply, which helped explain the causes of recessions and depressions. Keynes also played a key role in the development of macroeconomics, which examines the behavior of entire economies rather than individual markets or firms. His work on monetary policy, especially his advocacy for government intervention during periods of economic downturns, has had a lasting impact on economic thinking and practice."
