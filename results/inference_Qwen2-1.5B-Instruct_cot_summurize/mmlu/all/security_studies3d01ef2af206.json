This approach emphasizes the importance of state sovereignty, international law, and diplomacy in addressing security concerns. It also recognizes the role of non-state actors such as multinational organizations and civil society in promoting security. Additionally, this perspective acknowledges the complex nature of security and the need to consider multiple factors such as economic, political, and cultural influences on security.\n\nOption B, Peacekeeping, Peace-making, and Conflict Prevention, while important, may not be as dominant as option D due to the fact that they often require cooperation between states, which can sometimes lead to disputes and conflicts. Option C, Re-addressing Past Practice as a Possible Cause of Insecurity, focuses more on historical analysis and the causes of insecurity rather than the strategies for addressing it."
