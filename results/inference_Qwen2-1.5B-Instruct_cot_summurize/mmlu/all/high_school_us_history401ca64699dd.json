It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nIn his opinion on the case Dred Scott v. Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney upheld the sentiment above by stating that\n\nA. separate but equal facilities for people of different races was constitutional\nB. corporations were entitled to the same protections guaranteed to individuals under the Fourteenth Amendment\nC. school prayer violated the principle of \"separation of church and state\"\nD.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D: Congress had no right to regulate slavery in United States territories.\n\nThe passage you provided quotes Frederick Douglass's opinion about the advantages of slaveholders over opposition, which suggests that he believed there were certain rights or privileges granted to slaves that did not exist for free people. This could be interpreted as a defense of slavery, particularly in the context of the issue of congressional regulation of slavery in territories.\n\nHowever, the passage does not provide any direct evidence or reasoning supporting Douglass's position on whether Congress had the authority to regulate slavery in US territories. Therefore, based solely on the information given, it would be incorrect to conclude that Douglass's statement supports the idea that Congress has the power to regulate slavery in territories.\n\nIt is worth noting that the passage you provided is not directly related to the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, nor does it discuss the constitutionality of Congress regulating slavery. The case involved questions regarding the citizenship status of an enslaved African American named Dred Scott, who challenged his master's assertion that he was a citizen of the state of Missouri because he was born there. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Scott, declaring that he was not a citizen of Missouri and therefore could not be tried in that state's courts.\n\nTherefore, without additional context or evidence, it cannot be concluded that Douglass's quote supports the idea that Congress has the authority to regulate slavery in territories."
