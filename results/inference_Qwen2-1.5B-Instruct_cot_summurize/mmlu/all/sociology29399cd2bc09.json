It is often used when conducting interviews, focus groups, or other types of qualitative research.\n\nWhen using eyballing as a method for collecting data, researchers will typically keep their eyes fixed on the person they are observing while asking questions or engaging in conversations with them. This allows the researcher to observe the person's body language, facial expressions, and other non-verbal cues, which can provide valuable insights into their thoughts and feelings.\n\nWhile it may seem like an invasive or uncomfortable practice, eyballing is actually a common and effective way to collect data in many fields, including psychology, sociology, and anthropology. However, it is important to ensure that the observations are ethical and do not violate the participant's privacy or autonomy."
