Asexual reproduction in animals typically results in the formation of genetically identical daughter cells, which can then fuse to form a new organism. However, this does not necessarily result in the formation of a zygote, as some organisms may also produce a single cell that undergoes mitosis to produce multiple daughter cells without fusion. For example, certain types of bacteria and yeast reproduce asexually through binary fission, where a single cell splits into two identical daughter cells without fusion."
