Omission training.\n\nOmission training is a behavior modification technique where a teacher removes an unwanted behavior until it stops occurring naturally. In this scenario, the teacher is removing the disruptive child from the classroom when they want to stay and disrupt the class. This is an example of omission training, which is used to discourage certain behaviors in children."
