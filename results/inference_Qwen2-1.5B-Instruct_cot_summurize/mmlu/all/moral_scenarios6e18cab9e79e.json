Additionally, cutting someone's hair without permission can be seen as disrespectful and aggressive.\n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 2 is not morally wrong because ironing clothes for someone else is a common and acceptable household chore. It is not causing any harm to anyone and is not intruding on anyone's personal space."
