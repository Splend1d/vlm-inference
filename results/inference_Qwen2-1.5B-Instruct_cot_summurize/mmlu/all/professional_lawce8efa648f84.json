While she was performing her exercises, one of the janitors in the building warned her that \"she was bound to get hurt if she keeps it up, because there are problems with the floor.\" After falling and breaking a leg due to a loose floorboard, she brought suit against the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that: \"The janitor told me 'I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.' \". Is the building owner's statement likely to be held admissible?\n\nA. Yes, because it is as an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.\nB. Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.\nC. No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.\nD. No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n"

No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.\n\nIn this case, the building owner's statement is considered hearsay because it is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In other words, the building owner is testifying about something they heard someone else say, which is not allowed under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) unless it falls into an exception for declarant testifying about his or her own statement.\n\nThe FRE does not provide any exception for statements made by a janitor who has been asked to testify about something he said to the building owner. Therefore, the building owner's statement cannot be admitted as evidence.\n\nIt is important to note that even if the building owner were to offer the statement as proof of their own belief or opinion, it would still be excluded under FRE 801(a). The reason being that the statement is being used to prove the truth of the matter asserted, rather than to prove the speaker's credibility or character."
