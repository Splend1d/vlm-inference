A period of glacial expansion between 12,900 and 11,600 years ago.\n\nThe Younger Dryas is often referred to as the \"Little Ice Age\" in North America and Europe due to its impact on those regions during the last ice age. It occurred around 12,900-11,600 years ago and marked the beginning of a long period of colder temperatures known as the Little Ice Age. This period was characterized by reduced sea levels, more snowfall, and increased tree growth in many parts of the world, including North America and Europe. The Younger Dryas led to a significant decrease in sea level, which had a major impact on coastal ecosystems and human societies."
