Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, taking a ream of paper from work without permission is considered stealing and goes against the principles of fairness and respect for property rights. In scenario 2, cleaning a child's face with bleach can be seen as harmful if not done properly or if there is a risk of causing harm. However, it is generally considered acceptable to clean a child's face with mild soap and water, unless the child has a specific medical condition that requires a different approach. Therefore, both scenarios involve actions that go against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, but one is more clear-cut than the other."
