The plaintiff claims that while he was cleaning the machine, two wires came into contact with each other and caused the machine to turn on. At trial, the manufacturer has offered evidence that it was unreasonably expensive to design the machine so that the wires could not come into contact. In rebuttal, the plaintiff offers evidence that after this action was filed, the manufacturer redesigned the machine to prevent the wires from redesigned the machine to prevent the wires from coming into contact. Is evidence of this change in design admissible?\n\nA. No, because the change in design may have been unrelated to this type of accident.\nB. No, under the rule regarding remedial measures that encourages manufacturers to make their products safer.\nC. Yes, as evidence tending to show that the machine could be designed to keep the wires from coming into contact.\nD. Yes, as evidence tending to show that the manufacturer was negligent because its initial design failed to prevent the wires from coming into contact.\n"

Yes, as evidence tending to show that the machine could be designed to keep the wires from coming into contact.\n\nThe rule allowing evidence of a change in design is known as the \"remedial measure\" exception. This exception allows courts to admit evidence of changes made by the defendant to correct defects in their product before an injury occurs. In this case, the manufacturer redesigns the machine to prevent the wires from coming into contact, which is a reasonable response to the plaintiff's claim that the original design was defective. Therefore, the change in design is admissible to prove negligence on the part of the manufacturer."
