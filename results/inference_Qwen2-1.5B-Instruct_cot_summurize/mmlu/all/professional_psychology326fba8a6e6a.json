According to Berkowitz's revision of the frustration-aggression hypothesis, individuals who perceive themselves as being at a disadvantage or threatened by others tend to display aggressive behavior. This is because they feel a sense of loss or inferiority and may feel compelled to assert their dominance over others. In this scenario, if the target of the aggression is of lower status than the aggressor, it can create a power imbalance that may trigger aggressive behavior. Therefore, option D is the best answer."
