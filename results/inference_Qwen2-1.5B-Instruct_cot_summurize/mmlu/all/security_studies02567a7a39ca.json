Post-structuralism provides no basis for political action, being a dangerous mix of faux radicalism, relativism and obscurantism, whilst constructivism is an orientation to world politics rather than a specific political theory.\nB. Constructivism offers a number of specific political theories applicable to Critical Security Studies but all of these lack the tenability required in security studies. Post-structuralist theories similarly lack the durability desired by CSS scholars.\nC. Post-structuralism and constructivism are ill-defined theories that are better described as political orientations, applicable in vague terms but lacking the substance required by scholars in contemporary security studies.\nD. Constructivism is too dangerous a mix of political ideologies, combining elements of radicalism and relativism. Post-structuralism is more of an orientation to world politics rather than a specific and applicable political theory.\n"

Post-structuralist theories similarly lack the durability desired by CSS scholars.\n\nThis answer acknowledges both constructs as theoretical frameworks with potential applications in security studies, but also highlights their weaknesses when compared to other established political theories. It suggests that while constructivism may offer some useful insights, it lacks the necessary rigor and practicality for security studies. Similarly, post-structuralism, while potentially offering broader perspectives on power dynamics, does not provide enough coherence or foundation for applying it directly to security policy-making."
