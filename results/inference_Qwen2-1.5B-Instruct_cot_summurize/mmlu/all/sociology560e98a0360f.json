In the past, many countries had high levels of fertility due to cultural norms that emphasized having more children as a sign of success or status. However, as societies have become more educated and urbanized, women have delayed their marriage and childbirth decisions. This has led to a decline in the general fertility rate. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that there were fewer women of childbearing age, but this is not necessarily true. Women who choose not to have children may still be included in the general fertility rate if they do not marry or have children.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because errors in the measurement of birth rates and production of statistics can lead to an underestimation of fertility rates, not an overestimation.\n\nOption D is correct because poverty, poor housing, and bad sanitation can increase the risk of infertility and other reproductive health issues, leading to lower fertility rates."
