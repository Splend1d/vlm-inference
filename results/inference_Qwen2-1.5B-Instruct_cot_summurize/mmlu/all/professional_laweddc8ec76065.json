After receiving the letter, the woman sent the man a fax that stated, \"The price is a little high, I'll give you $800. \" The man responded by fax, \"I will not accept $800. \" The next day, the woman telephoned the man and said, \"I changed my mind, I will pay $1,000 for the motorcycle. \" The man refused to sell the woman his motorcycle. If the woman sues the man for breach of contract, which of the following defenses would be the man's best defense?\n\nA. Since the woman's purported acceptance was oral, it constituted a different mode of communication from the written offer.\nB. The contract was unenforceable under the statute of frauds, because the woman's purported acceptance was oral.\nC. The woman's counter offer terminated her power of acceptance.\nD. The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.\n"

The man's rejection of the woman's counter offer terminated the woman's power of acceptance.\n\nUnder the law of contracts, if an offer is accepted in writing, any subsequent communications, including counter offers, must also be in writing. In this case, since the original offer was made via fax, any subsequent responses such as the woman's counter offer or the man's rejection of the counter offer were also required to be in writing. Therefore, the man's rejection of the woman's counter offer, which occurred after she had already received and read the initial offer, effectively terminated her power of acceptance and rendered the contract voidable at her option."
