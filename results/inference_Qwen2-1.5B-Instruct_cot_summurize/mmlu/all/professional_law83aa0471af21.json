The purchaser noticed that the car made a squeaking noise when the brakes were applied, so the purchaser took the car back to the dealership to have the mechanic there take a look at it. The mechanic worked on the car and then told the purchaser that the problem had been fixed. A few days later, the brakes failed, causing the purchaser to crash into a tree. The purchaser suffered a serious head injury in the crash. If the purchaser asserts a claim against the car dealership for damages for his injuries, will the purchaser prevail?\n\nA. Yes, if the brakes were defective when the dealership sold the car to the purchaser.\nB. Yes, because the dealership is strictly liable for defective repairs on cars it has sold.\nC. No, because the car had been driven more than 1,000 miles.\nD. No, unless the dealership's employee was negligent in repairing the brakes.\n"

Yes, because the dealership is strictly liable for defective repairs on cars it has sold.\n\nStrict liability means that a business or individual is responsible for any harm caused by their product or service even if they did not cause the defect themselves. In this case, the dealership is responsible for any defects in the brakes of the car sold to the purchaser. Even though the brakes failed after the accident, the dealership can still be held liable based on the doctrine of strict liability."
