By overwriting the return address to point to the location of the attacker-injected code.\n\nWhen a program calls a function, it stores the return address in a special area called the \"call frame\" or \"return address\". When the function returns, it will call the same address from the call frame and execute the code inside the function. However, if an attacker can write malicious code into this return address, they can cause the program to run arbitrary instructions instead of returning to the calling function.\n\nTo do this, the attacker would need to write their malicious code into the return address using some form of buffer overflow attack, which involves reading data beyond the end of the allocated memory space for that address. This allows them to overwrite the return address with their own code and control what happens when the program tries to return.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer."
