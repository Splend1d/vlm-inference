She suggests that while there may be some cases where moral judgments can be clearly defined, such as when it comes to specific legal actions, most of our moral judgments are more complex and involve considerations of context, personal relationships, and other factors. Therefore, it is difficult to give clear guidance on what actions are right or wrong without sacrificing the complexity and nuance of human morality."
