Each nucleosome consists of eight to ten copies of DNA wrapped around a core fiber of histones, including H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The DNA molecule is enclosed within a proteinaceous shell made up of multiple copies of histones. This arrangement allows for the compact storage and packaging of large amounts of genetic information into small spaces."
