This theory suggests that behavior can be learned through repeated associations between stimuli and responses, which are reinforced or punished depending on their consequences for the organism's survival. In the context of this question, it refers to the idea that people choose their actions based on their inherent values and beliefs, rather than solely on external factors such as rewards or punishments."
