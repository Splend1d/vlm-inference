This could lead to a decrease in demand for the country's currency, as people may choose to hold onto their dollars rather than invest them elsewhere. As a result, the value of the currency would likely decrease because there would be fewer foreign buyers willing to pay for it. Additionally, if the country has been exporting goods at a high rate, an increase in the value of the currency could make those exports less competitive on international markets, leading to decreased net exports."
