In these cases, it is important to evaluate for any signs of inflammation or infection in the surrounding areas such as the hard palate, upper lip, upper central incisor, and lower first molar. These areas may be swollen or tender to touch, indicating an increased risk of infection. It is also important to consider the possibility of systemic symptoms, such as fever or malaise, which can indicate a more serious underlying condition. Additionally, careful examination of the entire oral cavity can help identify any signs of infection or inflammation that may not have been initially apparent."
