Both parents are expected to co-operate in the continued care of their children\n\nWhen a couple divorces, they may choose to share custody of their children, which means that each parent will have some level of responsibility for the child's welfare and socialization. This can include shared parenting responsibilities such as decision-making about the child's education, health, and well-being, as well as shared childcare responsibilities such as dropping off and picking up the child from school or daycare.\n\nIt is important for both parents to work together to ensure that the child's needs are met, and to communicate openly and effectively with each other regarding the child's welfare. This can help to prevent any issues related to custody or visitation rights, and can also help to promote positive relationships between the parents and their children."
