Poor technique, physical impairment, or lack of understanding.\n\nThese factors can make it difficult for a patient to use their inhaler correctly and effectively, which is essential for managing asthma. Severe leg ulcers and previous recovery from an acute exacerbation of asthma would also be relevant considerations in this context. Forthcoming surgery might be relevant if it involves breathing techniques that may interfere with using an inhaler. However, poor technique, physical impairment, or lack of understanding would directly impact the ability of the patient to use their inhaler appropriately."
