Misrepresenting the condition or quality of a product or service can lead to fraudulent actions that harm the buyer's trust in the seller. In this case, the seller is intentionally misleading the buyer by exaggerating the car's sharpness, which would likely cause the buyer to make a decision based on false information. Therefore, this situation supports claims of both fraud and misrepresentation."
