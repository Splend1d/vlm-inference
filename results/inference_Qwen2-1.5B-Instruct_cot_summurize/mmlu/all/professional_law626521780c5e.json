Men over 65 must wear only brown or grey attire, while those under 65 must wear button down dress shirts with neckties, except for when they are exercising or working physically. The Act has other restrictions and specifications for dress and grooming mandates for men and women. A class action was filed to challenge the Act based on a constitutional attack. Which argument listed below more closely reflects the constitutional argument that is most likely to succeed in court?\n\nA. The law is unconstitutional because it violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\nB. The law is unconstitutional because it is primarily discriminatory against women's rights.\nC. The law is unconstitutional because it violates procedural due process.\nD. The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n"

The law is unconstitutional because it infringes on fundamental rights of the individual.\n\nThis argument is more closely aligned with the constitutional argument that is most likely to succeed in court, as it focuses on the infringement of fundamental rights of individuals rather than specific violations of laws. It also addresses the issue of discrimination by limiting the types of clothing and grooming that individuals may wear, which could be considered an infringement on their right to personal appearance."
