Since Q1 = $48,815 and the mean (\u03bc) is $55,800, we can calculate the median (M) using the formula:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{Q_1 + \\text{Mean}}{2} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{48,815 + 55,800}{2} = \\frac{104,615}{2} = 52,307.5 \\]\n\nThis value falls within the middle half of the distribution, so it corresponds to the median salary, which is also the mode.\n\nGiven the distribution's symmetry around the mean, the standard deviation (\u03c3) is equal to the difference between the mean and the median divided by two, because this is the distance from the mean to both sides of the center. \n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{\\text{Median - Mean}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{52,307.5 - 55,800}{2} = \\frac{-3,4925}{2} = -1,746.25 \\]\n\nHowever, since the standard deviation cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of this result to get the correct interpretation: \n\n\\[ \\sigma = |-1,746.25| = 1,746.25 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. $13,968**."
