This would result in decreased military spending, which would lead to increased spending on defense-related goods and services by the federal government. As a result, aggregate demand in the United States would increase. \n\nOption A, an American entrepreneur founding and locating a software company in London, would not have a significant impact on aggregate demand in the United States as it involves international trade rather than domestic spending.\n\nOption C, the Chinese government making it increasingly difficult for American firms to export goods to China, could potentially decrease aggregate demand in the United States if companies were forced to pay higher tariffs or face other barriers to trade. However, this is less likely given that the Chinese government has historically been relatively open to foreign investment and trade.\n\nOption D, a Mexican entrepreneur founding and locating a software company in St. Louis, would also not significantly affect aggregate demand in the United States unless there was a direct link between the two economies through trade or investment."
