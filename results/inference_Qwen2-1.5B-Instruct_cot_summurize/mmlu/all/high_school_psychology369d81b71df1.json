In this case, Coach Peterson decides not to let Jake play in the first quarter of the next game because he is late for practice. This action serves as a punishment and will teach Jake that being late to practice could result in missing games. The other options (positive punishment, negative reinforcement, modeling) do not apply in this scenario since there is no indication of positive or negative reinforcement being provided to Jake, and there is no evidence of modeling behavior."
