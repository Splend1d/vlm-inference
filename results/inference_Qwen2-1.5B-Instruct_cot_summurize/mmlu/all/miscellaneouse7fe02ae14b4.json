Global division of labor\n\nGlobal division of labor refers to the practice of multinational corporations sourcing goods from countries with lower production costs, such as Asia, for export to developed countries like the US or Europe. This arrangement allows these companies to maintain their competitive edge while reducing costs and increasing profits. In this scenario, the use of inexpensive labor in Asian countries by footwear companies based in the US and Europe exemplifies the global division of labor."
