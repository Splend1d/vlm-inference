In this case, the consumer will pay the full amount of the tax, while the producer will only be able to recover a portion of the tax through lower prices or other means.\nIf the demand curve is price elastic and the supply curve is perfectly elastic, then the producer will still bear most of the burden of the excise tax because the producer can simply reduce output and pass the cost onto the consumer. However, the consumer will still bear some of the tax as they purchase fewer units of the product.\nIf the demand curve is price inelastic and the supply curve is price elastic, then the producer will bear the majority of the burden of the excise tax. The consumer will pay the full amount of the tax, but the producer may be able to recover some of the tax through reduced prices or other means.\nFinally, if the demand curve is perfectly inelastic and the supply curve is price elastic, then the producer will bear the entire burden of the excise tax. In this case, the consumer will pay the full amount of the tax, while the producer will only be able to recover a portion of the tax through lower prices or other means."
