The negation of this statement, \"All lobsters are red,\" would be represented as:\n\nB. ~(\u2203x)(Lx \u2283 Rx)\n\nHowever, option A is more concise and directly translates the meaning of the original sentence without using any logical symbols or abbreviations. Option B uses an abbreviation for \"there exists\" and also includes the word \"exists,\" which can lead to confusion in understanding the intended meaning. \n\nOption C introduces a new variable \"z\" with no context provided, making it ambiguous. Option D uses another abbreviation for \"all,\" but still does not fully capture the meaning of the original statement since it omits the existential quantifier (\"exists\") and adds an additional implication symbol. Therefore, option A is the most accurate and clear representation of the given sentence in predicate logic."
