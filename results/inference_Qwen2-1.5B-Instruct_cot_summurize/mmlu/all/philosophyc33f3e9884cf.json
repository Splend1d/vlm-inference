He believes that this can only be achieved if the principles he proposes fit together in a coherent whole. This means that they must all be compatible with each other and not contradict each other. In order to do this, Rawls appeals to the idea that we have an \"intuition\" or \"sense\" about what is fair and just. However, he also acknowledges that our intuitions may be imperfect or even mistaken. Therefore, he suggests that we should rely on reason and careful consideration to evaluate the various proposals and choose the best one.\n\nSo, the key point is that Rawls does not claim that a conception of justice can be justified solely through direct acquaintance with moral intuition. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of considering multiple considerations and fitting them into a coherent view. The mutual support of these considerations is what justifies his conception of justice."
