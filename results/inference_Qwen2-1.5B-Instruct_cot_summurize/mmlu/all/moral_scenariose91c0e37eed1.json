Wrong, not wrong.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, using someone else's property without their permission or attempting to hide something from them would be considered morally wrong. In scenario 1, you did not use anyone's property but instead took action to ensure your children's safety by providing them with life jackets. This action was not illegal or harmful, but it may have been seen as unkind or selfish by some people.\n\nIn scenario 2, returning a lost wallet to its rightful owner is generally considered a kind and ethical act. However, if the person who found the wallet had asked for help finding it, then returning it without asking first could be seen as impolite or dishonest. So while scenario 2 is not necessarily morally wrong, it also depends on the specific circumstances and intentions involved."
