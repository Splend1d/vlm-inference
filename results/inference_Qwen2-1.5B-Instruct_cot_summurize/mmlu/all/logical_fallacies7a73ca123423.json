Extension. \n\nWhen someone argues that something is flawed or incomplete because it does not fulfill its original purpose or intention, they are committing the extension fallacy. This occurs when an argument assumes that what is being discussed must necessarily be related to other things beyond the scope of discussion.\n\nIn this case, if you argue that something is flawed because it fails to do something it was never intended to do, you are extending the meaning of the term \"flawed\" beyond the original context and implication. This can lead to confusion and misunderstanding in your argument."
