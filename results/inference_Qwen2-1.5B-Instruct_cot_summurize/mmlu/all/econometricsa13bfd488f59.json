As the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients.\n\nBoth the Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* statistics are used to test for linear dependence in time series, but they do so in different ways. The Box-Pierce Q statistic is based on the Durbin-Watson statistic and uses it as a measure of autocorrelation at lag 1. On the other hand, the Ljung-Box Q* statistic is based on the Durbin-Watson statistic and uses it as a measure of autocorrelation at all lags up to and including the order of the moving average model being tested.\n\nIn general, both tests can be useful in detecting linear dependence in time series, but their performance depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the model being tested. When comparing the Q and Q* statistics, it's important to consider factors such as the distribution of the residuals, the presence of outliers, and the overall fit of the model."
