(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nBootstrapping can be used when we want to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic based on an empirical sample, but we don't have access to the true population distribution. In these cases, we need to generate random samples from the empirical sample to obtain estimates of the sampling distribution.\n\nPure simulation is not suitable for estimating the sampling distribution because we don't know the true population distribution beforehand. We can use simulation methods such as resampling or jackknife to approximate the sampling distribution, but this requires more computational effort and may not provide accurate results.\n\nIn contrast, bootstrapping allows us to estimate the sampling distribution by generating random samples from the empirical sample. This approach is useful when we want to estimate the distributional properties of the data in the experiment, even if we don't have complete information about the population distribution. Bootstrapping also provides a way to check the assumptions underlying the analysis, such as normality or independence.\n\nTherefore, options (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are all valid reasons why bootstrapping might be preferred over pure simulation."
