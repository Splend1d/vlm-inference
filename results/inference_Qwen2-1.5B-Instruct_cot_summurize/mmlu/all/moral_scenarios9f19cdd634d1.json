However, some people may feel uncomfortable with cooking meat or animals, especially if they have religious or ethical objections to eating meat.\n\nScenario 2: I asked the woman my age on a date.\nThis scenario is not explicitly wrong either, but it could be seen as potentially inappropriate depending on the context and the relationship between the parties involved. Asking someone's age on a date can sometimes make them feel uncomfortable or like their privacy is being invaded. It depends on the situation and the individual's comfort level."
