However, once it reaches the opposite side, it would encounter no further resistance or friction and would continue in freefall towards the center of the Earth. Eventually, it would reach the opposite side and continue in freefall towards the center of the Earth, but it would never reach the surface again as it would eventually pass through the opposite side's opening and enter outer space."
