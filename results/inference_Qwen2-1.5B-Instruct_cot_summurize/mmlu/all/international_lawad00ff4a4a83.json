It recognizes the inherent rights of indigenous peoples and their right to self-determination. Therefore, it is not considered as a qualified right.\n\nThe other three articles (Article 3, Article 8, and Article 9) are recognized as qualified human rights that provide specific protections or guarantees for certain groups or individuals. For example:\n\n- Article 3 provides protection against torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\n- Article 8 provides protection against discrimination based on race, color, sex, national origin, religion, political opinion, or any other status protected by law.\n- Article 9 provides protection against arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence."
