Our strength, because it gives to us rights of the public interest over private interests; our weakness, because it rallies all vicious men against us. We must smother the internal and external enemies of the Republic or perish with it; now in this situation, the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people's enemies by terror. Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue; it is not so much a special principle as it is a consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to our country's most urgent needs.\nFrench revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, 1794\nThe passage above appears to articulate which of the following political principles?\n\nA. From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\nB. Might makes right\nC. The end justifies the means\nD. The government is best that governs least\n"

The end justifies the means\n\nThe passage suggests that the government should use force and violence to maintain order and stability, rather than relying on traditional methods such as taxation and social welfare programs. This aligns with the idea that the ends justify the means, where the desired outcome (the preservation of the republic) justifies any necessary means (violence). \n\nOption A, from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs, would suggest providing resources based on individual merit, rather than distributing them equally.\n\nOption B, might makes right, does not fit the context provided in the quote. It implies that power is more important than morality or justice.\n\nOption D, the government is best that governs least, contradicts the idea presented here that the government should use force to maintain its authority.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The end justifies the means."
