This is because adding more hidden states allows the HMM to capture more complex patterns in the observed data, which can improve the accuracy and generalization ability of the model.\n\nHowever, the statement about collaborative filtering being a useful model for modeling users' movie preference is also true. Collaborative filtering involves using the preferences of similar users to predict the preferences of new users or items. It has been widely used in recommendation systems and is effective in predicting user preferences based on their past interactions with other users. Therefore, both statements are true. The answer is C. True, False."
