Decrease interest rates and risk an inflationary period.\n\nWhen a nation experiences an annual budget surplus, it means that more money is coming in than going out, which can lead to a reduction in government spending and an increase in savings. This can also result in a decrease in interest rates as the central bank may want to encourage borrowing and investment by lowering the cost of borrowing. However, if the surplus is not used wisely, such as paying off a portion of the national debt, then there could be a risk of inflation because people might start spending more on goods and services, leading to higher prices. This could cause an inflationary period, which could negatively impact businesses and consumers alike. Therefore, using a portion of the surplus to pay down the national debt can potentially decrease interest rates but also risk an inflationary period."
