When someone asks for moral advice, they are typically seeking the opinion or perspective of another person on a particular ethical or moral dilemma they are facing. In this context, the other person is not issuing a command or informing them of their preferences, but rather engaging in a discussion and deliberation about what the best course of action would be based on their own values and beliefs. Therefore, option C is the most accurate description of what someone might be asking for when they seek moral advice."
