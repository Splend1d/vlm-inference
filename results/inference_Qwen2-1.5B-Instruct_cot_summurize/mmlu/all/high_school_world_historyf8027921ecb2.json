That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nCrosby's argument in the passage is most likely a response to which of the following developments of the period 1450\u20131750 C.E.?\n\nA.

The colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans\n\nThe passage describes how the West capitalized on natural resources and human assets from other continents, including those in North and South America, as part of their quest for global hegemony. This suggests that the passage is responding to the historical development of colonization by European powers, particularly the colonization of North and South America.\n\nOption A (the development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India) does not fit because there was no significant development of direct trade links during the 1450\u20131750 CE period. Option B (the beginning of the Industrial Revolution) is also not correct since this occurred much later than the time frame described in the passage. Option D (increasing development of seafaring technologies) does not seem directly related to the passage's focus on colonial exploitation of resources and labor.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C, the colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans."
