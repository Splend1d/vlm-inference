While they do not have the power to set prices above marginal cost, they still have some control over supply and demand, which can lead to prices that exceed average total cost in the long run if there is excess demand for their product. This situation is called \"excess capacity.\" However, it's important to note that this does not necessarily mean that firms will be making a profit in the short term, as profits may fluctuate depending on market conditions."
