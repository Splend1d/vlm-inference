The tenant, because the landlord has not shown good cause to terminate the tenancy.\n\nGood cause to terminate the tenancy means that there is a valid reason for the landlord to do so, such as non-payment of rent or violation of the lease terms. In this case, the landlord did not show good cause by giving proper notice to terminate the tenancy or by taking actions that would constitute abandonment of the premises.\n\nTherefore, the tenant is entitled to continue occupying the building until the landlord can find another tenant or prove that they have no intention of returning to the premises."
