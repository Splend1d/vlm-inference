Migrationism refers to the movement of people and their culture across geographical boundaries, but it does not necessarily imply the development of specific characteristics of civilization in one location and then spreading them elsewhere. Diffusionism suggests that certain characteristics of civilization were originally developed in one place and then spread to other parts of the world. Anti-originalism, on the other hand, challenges the idea that certain civilizations or cultures have always been dominant or superior. None of these options accurately describe the belief that all of the characteristics of civilization developed in one place and then spread to other regions."
