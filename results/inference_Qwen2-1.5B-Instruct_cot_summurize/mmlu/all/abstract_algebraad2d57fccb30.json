This is because it satisfies the closure property (\\(ab \\in H \\text{ or } ab \\in K\\)), the identity element (which in this case is the identity element of \\(G\\)), and inverses for each element (since if \\(h \\in H\\) and \\(k \\in K\\), then there exists an inverse element \\(h^{-1} \\in H\\) and \\(k^{-1} \\in K\\)). Thus, \\(HK\\) is indeed a subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\nStatement 2 is false.\nAll groups of order \\(p^2\\) where \\(p\\) is prime are not necessarily Abelian. For example, consider the cyclic group of order \\(8 = 2^3\\), which has elements of orders \\(1\\), \\(2\\), and \\(4\\), but it is not Abelian because its non-identity elements commute with each other. Other groups like the quaternion group \\(Q_8 = \\langle x,y: x^4 = y^2 = e, xyx = yxy\\rangle\\) also have order \\(8\\) and are not Abelian. Therefore, statement 2 is false."
