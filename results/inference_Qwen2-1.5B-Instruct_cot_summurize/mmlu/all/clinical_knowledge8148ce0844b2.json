To ensure best lung expansion and accuracy and consistency of readings.\n\nStanding or sitting upright helps in achieving maximum lung expansion, which is essential for accurate measurement of peak flow rates. When a patient is lying down, they may have difficulty fully expanding their lungs, leading to inaccurate readings. Additionally, standing or sitting upright allows for easier observation by healthcare providers during the testing process."
