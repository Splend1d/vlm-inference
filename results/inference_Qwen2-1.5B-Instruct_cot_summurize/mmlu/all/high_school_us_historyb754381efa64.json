But . . . I conceive great hope that the time approacheth and now is that we of England may share and part stakes [divide the prize] (if we will ourselves) both with the Spaniard and the Portuguese in part of America and other regions as yet undiscovered.\n\"And surely if there were in us that desire to advance the honor of our country which ought to be in every good man, we would not all this while have [neglected] the possessing of these lands which of equity and right appertain unto us, as by the discourses that follow shall appear most plainly.\"\n\u2014Richard Hakluyt, Divers Voyages Touching the Discovery of America and the Islands Adjacent, 1582\nThe ideas expressed in the passage above most closely reflect the influence of which of the following?\n\nA. The Enlightenment philosophy of natural rights.\nB. The economic policy of mercantilism.\nC. The religious philosophy of predestination.\nD. The social contract theory.\n"

However, it's worth noting that Richard Hakluyt was an English explorer and writer who lived during the early modern period, and his views on colonization and the potential for European expansion into the New World may have been influenced by various philosophical and political theories of the time. It's possible that some elements of the Enlightenment philosophy of natural rights or the social contract theory might have informed his perspective on colonial expansion."
