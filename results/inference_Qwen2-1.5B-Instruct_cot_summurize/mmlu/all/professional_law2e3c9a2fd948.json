When he confronted her with it she laughed derisively, admitted to the adultery in sordid detail, and taunted him with insults. He got into a rage and killed her on the spot. In the trial for first degree murder, defense counsel asked for a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter. The trial judge refused. On appeal will the husband prevail on an argument that the facts justified a charge of voluntary manslaughter?\n\nA. No, voluntary manslaughter is only available when the adultery is witnessed in real time by the defendant.\nB. No, mere words are never a sufficient provocation to establish voluntary manslaughter.\nC. Yes, an admission of adultery always justifies a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\nD. Yes, there was sufficient provocation to justify a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\n"

Yes, there was sufficient provocation to justify a jury charge of voluntary manslaughter.\n\nVoluntary manslaughter is a lesser-included offense of first-degree murder, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with malice aforethought. However, even if the defendant had no intent to kill, but rather acted out of anger or frustration due to provocation, they could be charged with voluntary manslaughter under certain circumstances.\n\nIn this case, the defendant's actions were clearly motivated by his belief that his wife was having an affair and that she had committed adultery. This is a strong provocation factor. Additionally, the defendant's response to the letter and the subsequent attack on his wife indicate a lack of control over his actions, further supporting the notion that he was provoked.\n\nTherefore, based on the facts presented, the jury would have been justified in finding the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter."
