An appeal to emotion that argues against a position based only on negative personal feelings toward the position.\n\nAn appeal to emotion is a persuasive technique in which the speaker appeals to the listener's emotions, rather than using logical reasoning or evidence. In this case, the argument is that if one feels negatively towards a certain position or idea, then it must be false or incorrect. This type of appeal relies heavily on emotional responses and may not provide strong arguments for why the position is true."
