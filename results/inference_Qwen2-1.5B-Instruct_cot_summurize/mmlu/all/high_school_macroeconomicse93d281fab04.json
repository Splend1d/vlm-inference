In this case, the 20-ounce bottle of pop costs $1.25, which allows us to understand that the value is proportional to its size. This makes the dollar amount useful for comparing prices across different items or quantities, rather than just for exchanging goods and services directly. The other options (medium of exchange, store of value, and transfer of ownership) do not provide the same level of utility in understanding the relationship between monetary units and their associated values."
