A Christian/Marxist approach.\n\nHardin's approach to the moral issues of hunger and poverty is a combination of Christian values and Marxist economic theory. He argues that poverty and hunger are not simply individual failures but are part of a larger social and economic system that needs to be addressed through reforming capitalism and redistributing wealth. This approach combines Christian principles of compassion and charity with Marxist ideas about class struggle and inequality."
