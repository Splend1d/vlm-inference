In this scenario, if the government wants to fix the recession, it would likely implement a tax cut.\n\nA tax cut would lead to an increase in demand for loans, as individuals and businesses have more money available to spend. This would result in a rise in the supply of loanable funds (i.e., the amount of money that can be lent out) due to the higher demand for them.\n\nAs a result, the interest rate would fall because there is now more money being lent out than there are loans available to lend it. This would cause a rise in demand for the U.S. dollar, as people will want to hold onto their dollars rather than use them to buy goods and services.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Tax cut, which would lead to an increase in loanable funds, falling interest rates, and a rise in demand for the U.S. dollar."
