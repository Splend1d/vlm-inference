Pyloric stenosis\n\nPyloric stenosis is a condition where there is a narrowing or obstruction in the pylorus, which is the opening at the top of the stomach that leads to the esophagus. This can cause problems with swallowing and eating, as well as heartburn and acid reflux. In some cases, it can also lead to inflammation of the esophagus (esophageal inflammation) and ulcers.\n\nCrohn's disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are both inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract, but they do not directly affect the sphincter. Esophageal varices are a rare complication of chronic liver disease that can occur when blood vessels in the esophagus become damaged and leak fluid into the surrounding tissue.\n\nGastroschisis is a rare congenital disorder where part of the stomach is missing from the body. It does not involve the sphincter."
