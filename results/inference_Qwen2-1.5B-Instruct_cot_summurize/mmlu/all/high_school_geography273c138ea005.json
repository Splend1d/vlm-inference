Based on Comparative Advantage.\n\nTransnational corporations (TNCs) distribute their operations based on their comparative advantage, which is their ability to produce certain products or services more efficiently than other companies. TNCs often locate their operations in countries that have lower labor costs, higher productivity rates, or better access to raw materials, while maintaining a strong presence in developed countries through subsidiaries or joint ventures. This allows them to take advantage of economies of scale, reduce transportation costs, and minimize risks associated with international operations. However, it's important to note that TNCs may also conduct accounting and research services in countries with economies that are not necessarily low-cost, but rather focused on innovation and knowledge-based industries."
