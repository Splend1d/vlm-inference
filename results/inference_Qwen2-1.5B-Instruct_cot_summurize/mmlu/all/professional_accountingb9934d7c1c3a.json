Obtaining a detailed fixed-asset register and ensuring items are appropriately capitalized.\n\nThis procedure would be used to test the existence assertion of property, plant and equipment by ensuring that the assets listed on the register are actually present and accounted for in the financial statements. An auditor may also verify that the items being reported as assets are not subject to any restrictions or encumbrances that could limit their use or value. Additionally, the auditor may check for any changes made to the asset registry since the last audit to ensure accuracy."
