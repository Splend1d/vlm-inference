However, it's important to note that this action could potentially harm others if not done carefully or thoughtfully.\n\nScenario 2 involves creating a cure based on religious beliefs, which can be seen as morally controversial depending on one's personal beliefs and values. It's important to respect people's rights to freedom of religion and expression, but at the same time, it's also important to consider the potential consequences and impacts of such actions on society."
