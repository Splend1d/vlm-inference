If the student conducted all the research and analysis, they would typically be listed as the first author. However, if the student received guidance or support from their faculty advisor throughout the research process, it may be appropriate to include the advisor as an author as well, especially if they made significant contributions that were not performed by the student alone. Ultimately, the decision about who should be listed as an author should be based on the individual circumstances of the research project and the roles each person played in the research process."
