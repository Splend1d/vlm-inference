Water moves from a source region with high hydrostatic pressure to a sink region with low hydrostatic pressure.\n\nIn this theory, water flows upward against gravity through the xylem vessels of plants towards the leaves. The cohesion between water molecules and the walls of the vessels acts as a tension force that propels the water upwards. As the water moves up, it encounters regions of lower hydrostatic pressure, which causes it to flow downhill and continue its journey through the xylem. This movement of water is primarily driven by the cohesion between water molecules rather than by living cells."
