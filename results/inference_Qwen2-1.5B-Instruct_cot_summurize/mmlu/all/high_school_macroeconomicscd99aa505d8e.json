To address this, the country may need to increase exports and reduce imports, which would lead to a decrease in the current account balance. This could involve adjusting exchange rates or other monetary policies to stabilize the economy. However, paying off debt is not directly related to the current account deficit but rather the overall level of external liabilities and assets."
