Subsequent contact metamorphism resulted in localized recrystallization of the shale into sandstone.\n\nThis sequence of events corresponds to the formation of sandstone from mud. The process begins when mud or sediment is deposited on the ocean floor or another body of water. Over time, this sediment can be compressed and subjected to heat and pressure, leading to the lithification of the sediment. This process is known as diagenesis.\n\nIn this case, the contact metamorphism occurs after the initial deposition of mud has been lithified into sandstone. Contact metamorphism involves the transformation of rock under the influence of heat and pressure at the boundary between two different types of rocks. In this example, the shale would have been transformed into sandstone through the process of contact metamorphism.\n\nTherefore, option D is the only one that aligns with the presence of a layer of sandstone in bedrock just above a layer of shale."
