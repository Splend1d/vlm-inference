In this case, Max intentionally killed a nearby customer by dropping a gun that accidentally discharged after being drawn from his holster. The accidental discharge was a natural and probable consequence of his use of the gun to threaten the cashier and obtain the cash from the register. Therefore, Max can be convicted of first-degree murder based on the principle of causation and proximate cause."
