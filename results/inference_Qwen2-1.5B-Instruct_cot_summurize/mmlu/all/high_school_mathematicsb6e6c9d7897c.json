The domain is the same, but the range is tripled.\n\nWhen you replace sin(x) with 3sin(2x), you are essentially multiplying the input (x) by a factor of 3. This means that the new function has three times as many output values as the original function, so the range of the new function is three times larger than the range of the original function. However, the domain remains the same because the input value can still be any real number in the interval [0, 2\u03c0]. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
