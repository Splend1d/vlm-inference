This means that if the pressure decreases, the volume increases.\n\nGiven that the initial pressure is 200 atm and the final pressure is 1 atm, we can use the formula:\n\nVolume = Initial Volume / Pressure\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nVolume = 0.1 L / 200 atm = 0.0005 L/atm\n\nSince the new pressure is 1 atm (or 1/200 atm), we multiply the initial volume by this ratio:\n\nNew Volume = 0.0005 L/atm * 1 atm = 0.0005 L\n\nThis gives us an answer close to B. 20L, but not exactly. The exact value would depend on how much the volume increased from 0.1 L to 0.0005 L when pressure decreased. However, for practical purposes, it's often reasonable to assume that the volume will increase proportionally to the decrease in pressure. So, the most likely answer is C. slightly more than 20L. \n\nHowever, since the question asks specifically about the change in volume between 200 atm and 1 atm, and given the context of the problem, it seems like the correct interpretation is that the volume remains relatively unchanged due to the inverse relationship between volume and pressure, making the closest option A. slightly less than 20L."
