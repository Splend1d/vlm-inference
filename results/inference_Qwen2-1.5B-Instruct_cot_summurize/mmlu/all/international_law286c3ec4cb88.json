States are under an obligation so to conduct themselves that the negotiations are meaningful\n\nWhile states have certain obligations in international law, such as respecting human rights and complying with international humanitarian law, there is no specific obligation for states to conduct negotiations in a particular way. The goal of negotiations should be to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of disputes between states, but this does not necessarily require a formal or structured approach. States may choose to negotiate informally or through various other means, depending on the nature of the dispute and the context in which it arises."
