This is because the GARCH(2,2) model has two parameters (the ARCH parameter and the MA parameter), so the number of degrees of freedom is 2.\n\nB. The value of the log-likelihood function will almost always be bigger for the restricted model than for the unrestricted model. This is because the restricted model has fewer parameters, so it is less flexible and therefore has a lower log-likelihood.\n\nC. If the relevant values of the log-likelihood functions are -112.3 and -118.4, the value of the test statistic is 12.2. This is because the likelihood ratio test compares the difference between the log-likelihoods of the unrestricted and restricted models. Since the log-likelihood function is negative, the test statistic will be positive, which corresponds to rejecting the null hypothesis.\n\nD. The likelihood ratio test compares the slopes of the log-likelihood function at the maximum and at the restricted parameter value. This is because the likelihood ratio test uses the difference between the log-likelihoods of the unrestricted and restricted models as a measure of how much more restrictive the restricted model is. The larger this difference, the stronger evidence there is against the null hypothesis that the model can be restricted to a constant conditional variance."
