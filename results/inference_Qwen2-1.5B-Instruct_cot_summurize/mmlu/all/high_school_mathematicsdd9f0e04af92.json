                    "text": "To find the probability of selecting two marbles of the same color from this scenario, we can use the concept of combinations.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to select any two marbles out of 10 (4 red + 6 blue). This can be calculated using the combination formula \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which means multiplying all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo for choosing 2 marbles out of 10:\n\\[C(10, 2) = \\frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider how many ways there are to select two marbles of the same color. There are 2 ways to pick one red marble and 2 ways to pick one blue marble:\n\n- Red: Pick one red in 4 ways.\n- Blue: Pick one blue in 6 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to pick two marbles of the same color is \\(4 \\times 2 + 6 \\times 2 = 12 + 12 = 24\\).\n\nThe probability of picking two marbles of the same color is thus the ratio of these successful outcomes to the total possible outcomes:\n\\[P(\\text{same color}) = \\frac{24}{45} = \\frac{8}{15}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. \\(\\frac{8}{15}\\)**."
