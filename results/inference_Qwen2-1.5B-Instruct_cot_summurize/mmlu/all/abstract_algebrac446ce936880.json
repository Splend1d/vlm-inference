In this case, $a=(1,1)$. So, the order of the subgroup $<1, 1>$ is 2 because $a^2 = (1, 1)^2 = (1, 1)$, and there's no other power of $a$ that equals the identity.\n\nNow, let's consider the factor group $\\mathbb{Z}_{11} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{15}/<1, 1>$. This is the same as saying $\\mathbb{Z}_{11} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{15} / \\langle(1, 1)\\rangle$. Since the order of the subgroup $<1, 1>$ is 2, it follows that the order of the factor group is also 2. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nB. 2"
