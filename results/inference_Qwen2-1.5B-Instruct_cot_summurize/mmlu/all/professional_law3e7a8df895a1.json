They were smoking marijuana when another car skidded and crashed into the man's car. The collision damaged the man's car and inflicted personal injuries upon him. The woman was likewise injured. In fact, the impact produced a state of unconsciousness in her that lasted several minutes. The woman sued the other driver seeking to recover for his alleged negligence. At trial, the woman testified to her injuries and to the other driver's negligence. In defense, the other driver called an attorney who lived next door to the woman. The attorney proposed to testify that after the accident, the woman consulted him about her claim and asked the attorney in confidence how she could falsely testify that she wasn't smoking marijuana at the time of the accident. Upon objection by the woman's attorney, the attorney's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as a statement against interest.\nC. inadmissible, because it violates the woman's privilege against self-incrimination.\nD. inadmissible, because it violates the attorney-client privilege for confidentialcommunications.\n"

Under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, no person may be compelled to incriminate himself or herself in any criminal proceeding. The attorney's testimony would violate this constitutional right if the woman were to testify about the conversation with the attorney. Therefore, the attorney's testimony cannot be admitted under any of the options listed."
