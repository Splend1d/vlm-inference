Remove ants and measure subsequent leaf damage.\n\nThis experiment would eliminate any interference from the ants, allowing us to observe the effect of removing the insect defectors (the ants) on the plant's health. If the ants were responsible for the damage, their removal should result in less damage to the plant."
