Increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations.\n\nWhen conducting a test of controls, the auditor aims to determine whether there are any significant deviations from the relevant control procedures. The tolerable rate of deviations refers to the acceptable range within which the deviations can occur without causing a material misstatement in the financial statements. \n\nIf the tolerable rate of deviations is too low, it may indicate that the controls are not functioning effectively and could lead to material misstatements. On the other hand, if the tolerable rate of deviations is too high, it may suggest that the controls are functioning properly but at the expense of increased audit effort or additional resources.\n\nTherefore, increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls typically results in a higher tolerable rate of deviations because more items will be examined, reducing the overall deviation rate while still ensuring sufficient evidence is obtained to detect any potential misstatements. This approach helps maintain the appropriate balance between detecting material misstatements and minimizing the cost of the audit."
