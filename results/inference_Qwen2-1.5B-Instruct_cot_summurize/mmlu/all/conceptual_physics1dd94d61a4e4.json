This can happen through various processes such as convection (the movement of fluids), conduction (movement of matter by contact with other objects), and radioactive decay. However, radiation is primarily responsible for the loss of heat from the surface of the planet, as it allows heat to escape without being absorbed or reflected back onto the surface."
