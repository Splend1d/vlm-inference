Since there is no lis pendens rule in international law and all depends on the consent of the parties to a dispute, there is no priority or hierarchy among international courts and tribunals\nD.

However, the court or tribunal with the first opportunity to hear the case will typically have the authority to decide the matter based on the evidence presented at trial.\n\nIf two states or individuals present their cases simultaneously to different courts or tribunals, then the court or tribunal that hears the case first may be given priority under the lis pendens rule. This means that the court or tribunal that was first seized of the case will have exclusive jurisdiction to decide the matter.\n\nIt's important to note that this rule applies only when the same party presents multiple claims to separate courts or tribunals. If one party brings a claim to a single court or tribunal, then the court or tribunal with first seizure of the case will have exclusive jurisdiction to decide the matter."
