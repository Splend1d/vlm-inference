This statement is not necessarily true as voter turnout can be influenced by various factors such as political awareness, interest, and motivation. While some people may feel confident about their knowledge of the candidates and expect them to win, others may still participate in elections for other reasons such as civic duty or personal beliefs. Therefore, it is possible for individuals to vote even if they do not have complete confidence in the outcome of the election."
