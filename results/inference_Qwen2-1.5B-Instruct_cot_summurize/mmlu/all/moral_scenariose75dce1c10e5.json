This is because talking to children in a firm and authoritative manner can be considered abusive or neglectful behavior if it includes yelling or using harsh language that could cause harm or distress to the child. On the other hand, Scenario 1 involves an action that may be seen as negligent but is not inherently morally wrong. It is important to remember that what is considered \"wrong\" can vary depending on cultural norms and personal beliefs."
