This gives us \\( C(5, 2) \\), where \\( C(n, k) \\) represents the combination of choosing \\( k \\) items from a set of \\( n \\).\n\nSo, the number of ways to select 2 damaged suitcases out of 5 is:\n\n\\[ C(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of selecting exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of 3 is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 2 damaged}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of ways to select 2 damaged suitcases}}{\\text{Total number of ways to select 3 suitcases}} = \\frac{10}{2300} \\]\n\nSimplifying this fraction, we get:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{exactly 2 damaged}) = \\frac{1}{230} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. 2/23**."
