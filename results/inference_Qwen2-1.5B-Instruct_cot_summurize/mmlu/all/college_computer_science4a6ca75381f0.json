While it is possible to display line segments as straight in bitmap graphics, they may not always appear perfectly straight due to the limitations of the hardware used for rendering the image. Realistic lighting and shading cannot be done using bitmap graphics alone, but they can be achieved by combining bitmap graphics with other types of graphics or by using more advanced techniques such as vector graphics. Polygons can be filled with solid colors and textures using bitmap graphics, but they cannot be textured or colored in the same way that polygons can be in vector graphics."
