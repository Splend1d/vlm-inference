Organized transnational crime groups are those structured groups randomly formed or otherwise but do not have a formally defined role for its members or continuity of membership but have a developed purpose for the intent of committing crimes.\nB. Transnational organized criminal activities consist of profit driven crime for a high level return that may result in the subversion or infiltration of the legal economy through the reinvestment of illicit profits.\nC. Transnational criminal organizations are those organizations whose modes of operation result in breaking domestic laws, e.g. murder, theft or money-laundering, underlined by the employment of systematic violence.\nD. The terms 'transnational crime' and 'organized crime' are sometimes used interchangeably but not all transnational crime will be committed by an organized group nor will all organized groups engage in transnational crime. The pursuit of profit for illicit activity eludes definition and may include those individuals or businesses that engage in occasional transnational criminal activity but are otherwise legitimate operatives.\n"

However, it can also refer to transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), which are organized groups involved in illegal activities such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and terrorism. Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer to describe how TNC may be regarded as a new concept. It acknowledges that while some TCOs may engage in illegal activities, many others operate legally and contribute positively to society."
