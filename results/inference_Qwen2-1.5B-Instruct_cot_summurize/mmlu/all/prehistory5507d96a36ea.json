However, it has been suggested that metalworking may have begun in South America around 4,000 BCE, based on the discovery of copper tools and ornaments in various parts of the continent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to your question would be D. 6200 B.P. (Before Present), which refers to a specific time frame within the last 2,000 years, rather than a specific date for the first evidence of metal use."
