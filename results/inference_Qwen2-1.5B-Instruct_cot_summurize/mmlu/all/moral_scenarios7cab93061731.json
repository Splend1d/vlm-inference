Calling into work due to feeling unwell is generally seen as acceptable behavior and does not involve any harm or wrongdoing towards others.\n\nScenario 2 involves going grocery shopping during senior hours, which is often discouraged for various reasons such as promoting younger people's health and preventing older people from being exposed to potential hazards. However, it can be argued that this action is not necessarily morally wrong if done with good intentions and respecting the store's policies and rules. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
