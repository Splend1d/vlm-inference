This is because the act of filling someone else's cup with their preferred beverage is generally considered acceptable behavior.\nOn the other hand, robbing a female dormitory for underwear is clearly morally wrong. It involves breaking into someone's property without permission and taking personal belongings that belong to them. This action goes against the principles of respect for others' property rights and can be seen as theft or burglary. Therefore, the main character who did this is doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
