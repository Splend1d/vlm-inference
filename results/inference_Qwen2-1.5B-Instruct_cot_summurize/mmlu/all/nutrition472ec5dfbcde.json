For an adult in nitrogen equilibrium there is only a small requirement for an intake of protein since amino acids arising from tissue protein catabolism are available for new protein synthesis.\n\nThis statement is correct because in a state of nitrogen balance, or positive nitrogen balance (when the body is taking in more nitrogen than it is losing), the body has enough amino acids available to synthesize new proteins from existing tissues. This means that the body does not need to consume additional protein from external sources. However, if the body is in a state of negative nitrogen balance (when the body is losing more nitrogen than it is taking in) then it may require an increased intake of protein to replace lost amino acids."
