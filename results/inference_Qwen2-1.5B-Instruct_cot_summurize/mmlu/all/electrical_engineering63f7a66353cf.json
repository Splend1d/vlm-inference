Since each lamp has 300 lumens:\n\n\\[ \\text{Lumens per Lamp} = 300 \\text{ lumens/lamp} \\]\n\nSo, to find out how many lamps are needed to produce a total luminous flux of 720 lumens, divide the total luminous flux by the lumens per lamp:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of Lamps} = \\frac{720}{300} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of Lamps} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 2."
