HM pays insufficient attention to the role of the labourer, instead focusing on the capitalist as the source of power and most important actor. HM can also allude to capitalist power structures, to the detriment of supporting the human security of workers.\nB. HM too often accuses capitalism of acting solely in self-serving ways, and explains everything in terms of class struggle, to the detriment of wider analysis. Some versions of HM claim to have uncovered objective laws of history which are widely disputed in their accuracy.\nC. HM is inevitably reductionist and oversimplifies the complexities of capitalism, recognising only its negative aspects and harmful effects.\nD. All of these options.\n"

However, some critics argue that it overemphasizes the importance of capital and capitalists at the expense of other factors, such as laborers and social relations.\n\nAdditionally, some versions of HM may be accused of being reductionist or oversimplifying complex historical and economic systems. They may focus too much on the negative effects of capitalism without considering broader societal dynamics and the role of class struggles.\n\nSome versions of HM may also be criticized for attributing all events in history to class struggle rather than acknowledging the existence of objective laws of history. This view has been disputed by many historians and philosophers who argue that there are no objective laws of history and that historical events are shaped by a variety of complex factors.\n\nTherefore, all of these criticisms of HM are valid."
