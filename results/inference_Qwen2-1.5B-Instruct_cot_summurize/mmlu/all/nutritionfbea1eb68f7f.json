However, based on recent data from the United Nations, there have been significant changes in the nutritional status of many countries around the world over the past few decades. For example, in 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that about half of all children under five years old in low- and middle-income countries were stunted, defined as having a height for age less than expected for their peers. In contrast, only about one-third of children in high-income countries were stunted in the same year.\n\nIn terms of individual countries, some studies have suggested that China may be undergoing a rapid nutrition transition. For example, a study published in the Lancet in 2017 found that between 2010 and 2014, the prevalence of underweight among children aged 0-59 months declined by 36% in China, compared to a decline of only 8% in the United States during the same period. However, it is important to note that these trends can vary depending on the specific country and time period being considered, and further research is needed to fully understand the extent and causes of this change."
