This perspective contrasts with catastrophism, which posits that major geological events such as mass extinctions have occurred suddenly and drastically altered the Earth's surface. Natural selection and unilineal evolution describe specific biological evolutionary models, while there is no direct description of \"the slow agency of existing causes\" in any of these frameworks."
