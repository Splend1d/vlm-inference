It has several advantages over other methods such as full structural models:\n\n(i) It receives strong motivation from financial and economic theory.\n(ii) In its reduced-form version, it can be used to produce time-series forecasts without requiring an explicit specification of the functional form of the relationships between the variables.\n(iii) VAR models are typically highly parsimonious, meaning they have fewer parameters than the full structural models that they replace.\n(iv) OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression can be applied separately to each equation in a reduced form VAR.\n\nTherefore, options (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are all correct."
