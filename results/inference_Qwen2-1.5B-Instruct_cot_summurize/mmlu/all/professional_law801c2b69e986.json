Bob was so grateful for the loan that he named his business \"Wilson and Lamar Hardware\" and purchased signs and advertising displaying this name. He also listed Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar as \"partners\" on his stationery. When Ted found out, he was flattered to the point that he voluntarily reduced Bob's interest rate from 9 percent to 8 percent per annum. A few weeks later, Pete Smith, who had assumed that both Wilson and Lamar were operating the hardware store and was not familiar with the true situation, sold goods to Wilson and Lamar Hardware. Pete Smith has been unable to collect for the goods and he seeks your advice. Your advice to Pete is\n\nA. only Bob Wilson is liable.\nB. Bob Wilson and Ted Lamar are liable jointly.\nC. Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.\nD. only the de facto partnership arising from the relationship between Wilson and Lamar is liable.\n"

Bob Wilson is liable for the entire amount and Ted Lamar is liable only to the extent the debt cannot be collected from Bob Wilson.\n\nWhen two individuals enter into a business venture without naming each other as partners or co-owners, it is considered a de facto partnership. However, if one party becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations, the other partner may have to assume responsibility for the debts incurred by the de facto partnership.\n\nIn this case, since Ted Lamar voluntarily reduced Bob Wilson's interest rate from 9% to 8%, it can be inferred that Bob Wilson became liable for the entire amount of the debt. Therefore, Bob Wilson is responsible for the full amount of the debt, while Ted Lamar is only liable up to the amount that can still be collected from Bob Wilson."
