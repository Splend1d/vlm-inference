Three days after the contract was formed, but prior to delivery of the casebooks, the publisher called the owner of the law bookstore and informed him that, because of a calculation error, the price for the casebooks should have been $11 per book, and the shipment could not be delivered unless the owner promised to pay that amount. The owner reluctantly agreed. The owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is\n\nA. enforceable, because it was not supported by any new consideration.\nB. enforceable, under the principle of promissory estoppel.\nC. unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.\nD. unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.\n"

In this scenario, the law bookstore relied on the publisher's promise that the price would be $11 per book, and as a result, they agreed to pay that amount. Therefore, the owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is considered an enforceable contract due to promissory estoppel.\n\nIt is important to note that promissory estoppel only applies if there was a reasonable reliance by the other party. In this case, the owner did not rely on the promise in good faith or with a reasonable belief that it would be honored, so promissory estoppel does not apply.\n\nAdditionally, the statute of frauds requires that all contracts involving the transfer of property or the creation of a legal obligation be in writing. However, in this situation, the contract was made orally and\u4e66\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f, which is sufficient under the statute of frauds.\n\nIn summary, the owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is enforceable due to promissory estoppel, even though the contract was made orally rather than in writing."
