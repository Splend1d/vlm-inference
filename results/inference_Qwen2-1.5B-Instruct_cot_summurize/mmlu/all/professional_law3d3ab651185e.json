He sent it in response to an ad for new ideas in an industry publication. He discussed it with the producer's assistant in a phone call, and mentioned his expectation of compensation. She said, \"Well, of course, we always pay for a writer's work.\" She said she would go over it with her boss to see if he liked it. Several months later, the writer saw a casting call for a new series. The plot and characters were nearly identical to those described in his synopsis. He sued the producer for breach of contract. The producer defended by arguing that there was no contract. What is the likely ruling of the court?\n\nA. The court will rule that there is an express contract because there was a meeting of the mind and mutual assent to the basic terms.\nB. The court will rule that there was an implied in fact contract between the parties based on the conduct that they manifested.\nC. The court will rule that there was no consideration specifically mentioned and under those circumstances, the law viewed the synopsis as a gift to the producer.\nD. There were too many terms left out for this to be a contract, and it was too indefinite for the court to imply what the terms might have been.\n"

This is because the writer did not provide any consideration (money or something else of value) for the use of his idea, and there is no evidence that the producer agreed to pay him anything. Additionally, the fact that the producer had already seen the plot and characters of the new series before receiving the synopsis from the writer suggests that there may have been some misunderstanding about the nature of the relationship between the two parties. Therefore, the court is unlikely to find that there was an express or implied contract."
