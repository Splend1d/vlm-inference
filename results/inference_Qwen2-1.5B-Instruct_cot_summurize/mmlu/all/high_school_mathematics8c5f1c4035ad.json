Then we have $a = k$, $b = ka$, and $c = kc$ for some positive number $k$.\n\nSubstituting into the equation $\\frac{a^3}{bc} = 6$, we get $\\frac{k^3(a)^3}{(ka)(kc)} = 6,$ or $\\frac{k^3a^3}{a^2c} = 6,$ or $\\frac{k^3a^3}{akc} = 6,$ or $\\frac{k^3}{k} = 6,$ or $k^2 = 6.$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find $k = \\sqrt{6}$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible value for $a$ is $k = \\sqrt{6}$, which corresponds to option A.
