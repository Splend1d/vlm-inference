These movements can be driven by individuals who share common values and concerns about these issues. They may also attract support from other groups with similar interests, such as businesses or religious organizations.\n\nWhile economic interests can certainly play a role in shaping political consciousness, it is not necessarily true that they are the only factor driving social movements. Personal, cultural, and environmental issues can also have significant impacts on political consciousness and can inspire people to take action to address them.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer."
