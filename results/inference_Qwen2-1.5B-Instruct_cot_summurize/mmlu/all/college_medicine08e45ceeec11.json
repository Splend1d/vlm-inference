A baseball player hits baseballs from a tee in order to build muscle memory.\nB. A concert flute player falls short of finishing a piece that has a very complex ending without mistakes\nC. A high school English student submits a paper for review by his professor.\nD. A high diver takes instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move.\n"

A high diver takes instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move.\n\nIn Vygotsky's sociocultural development theory, the zone of proximal development refers to the stage where an individual can make progress when their abilities are supported by their environment but beyond which they cannot progress independently. This concept suggests that individuals have different levels of ability depending on the context in which they operate. In the given options, only D (a high diver taking instruction from her coach) aligns with Vygotsky's theory, as it involves learning from an external source to improve one's performance within a specific area."
