Which of the following correctly states which phase of cellular respiration harvests the most energy and the correct explanation why?\n\nA. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because it is here that pyruvate is completely broken down into CO2.\nB. The most energy is released during the Krebs cycle because in addition to the production of ATP, both FADH2 and NADH are produced. Each of those molecules will release 2 ATPs and 3 ATPs, respectively.\nC. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because in addition to the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP, all the potential energy held in NADH and FADH is transferred to ATP.\nD. The most energy is released during oxidative phosphorylation because H2O is completely broken down into H+ and O2.\n"

Glycolysis produces 2 ATP per glucose molecule, while the Krebs cycle produces 18 ATP from one glucose molecule. Oxidative phosphorylation involves the electron transport chain and generates approximately 30-50 ATP per glucose molecule.\n\nTherefore, the stage that releases the most energy is oxidative phosphorylation, as it combines the production of ATP with the transfer of energy stored in NADH and FADH to generate additional ATP."
