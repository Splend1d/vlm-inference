When it is not committed against another vessel and when it is not committed for 'private ends'. \n\nPiracy refers to acts of violence or intimidation carried out against ships or their crews, with the intent to extort money or other valuable items from the crew or passengers of the ship. However, there are certain exceptions that can prevent an act of violence from being classified as piracy.\n\nFor example, if the attack is committed against a public vessel of another state, then it may be considered piracy. Similarly, if the attack is committed for \"private ends,\" such as revenge or personal gain, then it may also be considered piracy.\n\nHowever, if the attack is committed against another vessel or for \"private ends,\" then it may not be considered piracy. For instance, if the attack is committed against a private yacht or merchant ship, but the attacker is not claiming any rights under international law or has no intention of making a profit from the attack, then it may not be considered piracy.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer."
