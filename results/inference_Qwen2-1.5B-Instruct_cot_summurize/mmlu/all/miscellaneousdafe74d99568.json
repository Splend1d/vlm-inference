However, this amount is not necessarily reflected in the company's cash flow statement as it does not represent the actual change in cash balance. Instead, it represents the increase in the company's debt or obligation to pay its employees. Therefore, when Corporation X pays out $300,000 in salaries, it increases its total liability (including salary expense) but decreases its cash balance."
