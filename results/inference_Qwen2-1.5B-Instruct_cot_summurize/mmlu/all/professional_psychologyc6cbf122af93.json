Neuropsychological testing showing the expected profile of deficits and spared functions.\n\nNeuropsychological testing is one of the most accurate methods for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease because it evaluates cognitive function in a standardized way, which helps to identify specific cognitive domains that are affected. It also allows for comparison with normal aging processes, which can help differentiate between typical age-related changes and early signs of Alzheimer's disease. Computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scans can show cerebral atrophy, but they do not directly diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Brain biopsies can provide information about the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, but they cannot confirm the diagnosis."
