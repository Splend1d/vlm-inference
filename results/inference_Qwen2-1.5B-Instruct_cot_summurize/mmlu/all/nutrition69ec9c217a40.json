It is important to note that these features can also be present in other eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa or binge-eating disorder, but they are not exclusive to anorexia nervosa. Additionally, depression is a common comorbidity in individuals with anorexia nervosa, but it is not necessarily a diagnostic feature of the condition itself. Therefore, option A (Depressive symptoms) is a correct answer, while options B (significant weight loss), C (body image distortion), and D (fear of becoming fat) are all considered diagnostic features of anorexia nervosa."
