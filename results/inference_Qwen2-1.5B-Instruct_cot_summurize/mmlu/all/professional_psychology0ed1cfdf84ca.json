Traditional leanings suggest that the behavior of an individual is determined by their genetic makeup and environmental factors such as nutrition and stimulation. They do not predict the duration or intensity of crying based on the level of arousal. Therefore, option A (the length of nighttime crying depends on the level of arousal) is incorrect. Option C (family B's infant cries for longer periods of time at night) is also incorrect because there is no information given about the infants' levels of arousal or their environments. Option D (neither infant will tend to cry more than the other at any time) is also incorrect because it does not take into account the different ways in which families can respond to crying infants. It is possible that one family may provide more consistent care and attention to their crying infant, while another family may respond differently depending on their circumstances."
