The delegation's goal was twofold: to study the problem and to formulate regulations in a bilateral agreement that would protect the endangered species and provide for a permanent commission that would continually monitor enforcement of the proposed regulations. After compiling their findings and drafting the necessary regulations, the President and the leader of the foreign government entered into a treaty to form a permanent commission to oversee the problem and to grant it the necessary enforcement powers. The validity of this treaty would most likely be upheld under which of the following principles?\n\nA. The presidential power to conduct foreign affairs.\nB. An ancillary power of the President under his treaty-making power.\nC. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.\nD. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by a majority in Congress.\n"

The treaty itself is then negotiated between the President and the foreign government, and once the treaty is signed, it becomes binding law between the two countries.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The treaty-making power, but only if the treaty is ratified by a majority in Congress."
