The marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost when the production or consumption of a good creates a positive externality.\n\nIn this case, the individual's decision to produce or consume the good does not have an impact on others outside their immediate circle. Instead, they are benefiting from the external effects of their actions, such as improved air quality or increased economic activity in a neighborhood. This creates a positive externality, which means that the marginal social benefit (the benefit to society) exceeds the marginal social cost (the cost to society).\n\nIf the marginal social benefit were equal to the marginal social cost, then there would be no net benefit for society, and the good would be produced or consumed at its market equilibrium level. However, since the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost, there is an excess demand for the good, and the price will rise above the market equilibrium level. This leads to an increase in the total surplus for all participants, including the producer and consumer."
