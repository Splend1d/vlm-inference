The specified mean length of 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of a 95 percent confidence interval.\n\nConfidence intervals provide an estimate of the population parameter (in this case, the mean petal length) along with a range of values that we can be reasonably sure contains the parameter. In this case, the null hypothesis (\u03bc = 3.5 cm) and the alternative hypothesis (\u03bc > 3.5 cm) have been tested using a random sample of 50 petals, resulting in a p-value of 0.0487 (which is less than 0.05).\n\nSince the p-value is less than the alpha level (0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the population mean petal length is greater than 3.5 cm.\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the population mean petal length would be calculated as follows:\n\nLower Limit = \u03bc - Z * SE\nUpper Limit = \u03bc + Z * SE\n\nwhere Z is the critical value from the standard normal distribution table based on the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.964 for a 95% confidence interval). \n\nIn this case, since we're looking for a 95% confidence interval, we use Z = 1.964 and \u03b1 = 0.05, which gives us:\n\nLower Limit = 3.5 - 1.964 * 0.25 = 3.5 - 0.49 = 3.01\nUpper Limit = 3.5 + 1.964 * 0.25 = 3.5 + 0.49 = 3.99\n\nTherefore, the lower limit of a 95% confidence interval is 3.01 cm, and the upper limit is 3.99 cm.\n\nSo, the correct statement is that the specified mean length of 3.5 cm is below the lower limit of a 95% confidence interval."
