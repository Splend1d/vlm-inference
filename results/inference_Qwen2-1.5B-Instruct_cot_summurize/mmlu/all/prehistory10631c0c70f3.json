They also have a rich cultural heritage, including burial practices that include grave goods, indicating a level of sophistication and social organization. Additionally, complex societies typically have a sedentary lifestyle, meaning they live in permanent settlements rather than nomadic groups, which requires advanced agricultural techniques and storage facilities. Finally, these societies likely engage in trade and exchange, which would be evident through artifacts and evidence of commerce."
