When a teenage male opened the door, the police officer told him that a convict had escaped and asked if he had seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood. The teenager said he hadn't but then asked the police officer to come inside to ensure the house was safe. The police officer entered the home and proceeded to look around. When he went into the kitchen, the police officer noticed a bag containing white powder on the counter. Suspecting that the bag contained narcotics, the police officer questioned the teenager as to its contents. The teenager said he didn't live in the house and had never seen it before. The police officer confiscated the bag and took the teenager to the station house for questioning, at which time it was determined that the teenager had escaped from a psychiatric hospital and had broken into the home earlier in the day. Furthermore, the results of a police lab test found that the bag contained heroin. As a result, the police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the home. He was apprehended and charged with possession of heroin. The homeowner's attorney has filed a motion to suppress, claiming that the heroin confiscated by the police was unlawfully obtained. The motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the teenager did not have the authority to consent to a search of the house.\nB. granted, because the teenager did not have an ownership or shared occupancy interest in the premises.\nC. denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling.\nD. denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling and reasonably believed that the teenager was competent to give consent.\n"

However, when the police officer asked the teenager further questions, including about the contents of a bag located on the counter, the teenager gave a truthful response.\n\nBased on this information, the police officer had probable cause to conduct a search of the house, and the teenager's consent was voluntary and knowing. Therefore, the police officer had a reasonable belief that he had permission to enter the dwelling and that the teenager was competent to give consent. Consequently, the heroin found during the search cannot be suppressed under the Fourth Amendment."
