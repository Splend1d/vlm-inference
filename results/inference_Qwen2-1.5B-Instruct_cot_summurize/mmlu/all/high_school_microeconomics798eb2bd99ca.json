This can lead to an increase in the quantity demanded of denim jeans as consumers seek out more affordable alternatives. As a result, the supply curve shifts to the left, indicating a decrease in the quantity supplied by producers. Since the price has risen, it will also tend to increase the price of denim jeans. However, the quantity supplied does not necessarily decrease; instead, it increases due to the higher price encouraging producers to produce more. Therefore, the answer is B. supply falls, increasing the price and increasing the quantity."
