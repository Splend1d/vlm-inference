The parietal lobe, located on the side of the brain just above the eye, plays an important role in processing sensory information, including taste sensations. If someone has suffered damage to their parietal lobe, they may experience changes in their ability to detect or process specific types of sensory information, such as taste. This could include changes in how they perceive sweetness, which is why some people who have had parietal lobe damage may still enjoy sweet foods but do so differently than others. Therefore, it's possible that the sweet iced tea your grandmother gave you was made with sugar for reasons other than its natural sweetness, such as to compensate for her damaged parietal lobe."
