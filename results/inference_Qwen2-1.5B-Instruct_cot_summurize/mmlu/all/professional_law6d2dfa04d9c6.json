When the investor's title search revealed the above language in the grantee section of the deed to the woman, the investor refused to close the transaction. The contract was silent as to the woman's title obligation. The woman has sued the investor for specific performance. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\nB. The investor, because the woman's heirs did not join in the contract.\nC. The woman, because the contract did not obligate her to provide marketable title.\nD. The woman, because the deed's restraint on transfer is void as a matter of law.\n"

The investor, because the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period specified in the deed.\n\nUnder the UCC, a party who enters into a written contract must have a clear understanding of all material terms, including restrictions on the transferability of property. In this case, the restriction on transfer is part of the deed, which is a valid consideration for the sale of the land. Therefore, the woman cannot sell the land during the 10-year period without the consent of the buyer or the court's approval. If the woman does not comply with the restriction, the court will enforce it against her."
