The pharmaceutical company initially intended for the contraceptive to be available for purchase without a doctor's prescription. However, a study by the Food and Drug Administration revealed that the contraceptive might prove harmful to some users with preexisting health problems. As a result, Congress enacted legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the contraceptive across state lines to those who do not have a doctor's prescription. This law is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because Congress has the power to provide for the general welfare.\nB. constitutional, because Congresshas the power to regulate interstatecommerce.\nC. unconstitutional, because it deprives the manufacturer a property right without just compensation.\nD. unconstitutional, because it interferes with the right of privacy of contraceptive users.\n"

As a result, Congress passed legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the contraceptive across state lines to those who do not have a doctor's prescription. \n\nThis law falls under the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. Congress can regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of goods within a state or between states in order to protect public health, safety, and welfare. In this case, the FDA's findings showed that the contraceptive was potentially dangerous, so Congress acted to prevent its widespread use among people without proper medical guidance.\n\nWhile the law may be seen as interfering with the rights of contraceptive users, it is still considered constitutional because Congress has the authority to regulate commerce."
