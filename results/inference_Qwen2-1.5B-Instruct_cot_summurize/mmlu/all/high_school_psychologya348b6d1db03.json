Increase the speed with which messages can be transmitted\n\nMyelin is a fatty substance that surrounds and insulates nerve fibers, providing insulation for electrical signals. This insulation helps reduce friction between the neuron's axon and the cell membrane, allowing the signal to travel faster. The specific increase in speed depends on the type of myelin present (for example, whether it is oligodendrocyte myelination or Schwann cell myelination), but generally speaking, the more dense the myelin layer, the faster the signal will propagate through the nervous system. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the myelin sheath does not directly influence the number of messages a dendrite can receive.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the myelin sheath maintains the amount of neurotransmitter needed for an action potential, as this is controlled by the presynaptic terminal and not the myelin sheath itself.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because the myelin sheath does not decrease the amount of information a dendrite can convey in one firing; instead, it increases the efficiency of information transmission."
