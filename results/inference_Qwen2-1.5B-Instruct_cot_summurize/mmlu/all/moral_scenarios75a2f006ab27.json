This action goes against the principle of fairness and respect for others' well-being.\nIn contrast, scenario 2 involves an act of kindness and respect towards one's child, as the parent is doing something that shows love and concern for their child's comfort and happiness. Therefore, scenario 2 is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
