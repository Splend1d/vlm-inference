The defense medical expert did an independent medical examination and reviewed all medical records. The expert testified that the accident did not cause the injuries because the medical records proved a long history of prior treatment for the same symptoms. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff but awarded only $10 in damages. On post-trial motions, the plaintiff argued that the expert's testimony was inadmissible hearsay because he based it on prior treating physicians' records, and the prior doctors were not available for cross-examination. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, what is the correct ruling?\n\nA. Testimony regarding the plaintiff's condition prior to the accident is irrelevant and the testimony is inadmissible.\nB. The Federal Rules of Evidence allow the admission of hearsay statements that were made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.\nC. Medical testimony that is relevant to the issues can never by excluded from the defendant's case because it is always reliable.\nD. The testimony is inadmissible hearsay because there was a constitutional right under these facts to cross-examine the doctors who wrote the prior records.\n"

The expert's testimony was based on his review of the plaintiff's medical records, which were relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff's injuries.
