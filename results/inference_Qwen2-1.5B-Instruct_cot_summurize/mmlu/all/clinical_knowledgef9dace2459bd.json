Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour\n\nImpacted faeces, also known as faecal impaction, can present with symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, bloating, and constipation. However, it can sometimes resemble other conditions like rectal cancer or anal fissures, making it challenging to diagnose correctly. Therefore, impacted faeces can indeed be mistaken for a rectal tumour, although not necessarily by itself. \n\nThe other options:\n\n- A palpable median groove in the prostate is not an adverse finding.\n- A thrombosed haemorrhoid is painful due to the blood clot blocking the blood flow through the vein.\n- Peri-anal warts cannot be demonstrated solely on proctoscopy; they require biopsy for confirmation."
