This is called sarcomeric shortening.\n- B: In the relaxed position, tropomyosin blocks myosin from accessing the binding site of actin. This prevents myosin from moving along the filament.\n- C: Myosin has two domains: a head domain that binds actin and a tail domain that moves the head away from the actin. Myosin can bind multiple actin molecules in one cycle.\n- D: Troponin and tropomyosin are the major proteins involved in the structure and function of the sarcomere. Troponin forms part of the myofilament, while tropomyosin forms part of the Z-line."
