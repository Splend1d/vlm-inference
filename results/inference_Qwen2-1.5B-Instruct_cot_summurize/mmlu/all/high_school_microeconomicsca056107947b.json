This means that changes in supply will not significantly affect the price of the good or service, making the demand curve relatively flat.\nThe demand curve for the oligopoly firm's output with a homogeneous product may also be relatively inelastic, as the products are identical and the consumers do not care about the differences between them. However, this does not necessarily mean that the demand curve is the least elastic.\nThe demand curve for the oligopoly firm's output with a differentiated product would likely be more elastic than either of the other two options, as the products are different and the consumers are willing to pay more for the differentiated ones. The demand curve for the monopoly firm's output is likely to be the most elastic, as the only competitor is the owner of the business, which makes the market structure highly concentrated.\nTherefore, the answer is D. Demand for the monopoly firm's output."
