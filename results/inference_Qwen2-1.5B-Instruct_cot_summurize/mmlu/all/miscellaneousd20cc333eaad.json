Contagious diffusion, where new ideas or practices spread from one place to another through contact and interaction with other groups. In this case, the Sami people's traditional practice of reindeer herding has been adopted by Norwegian farmers who have started raising their own livestock. This process of diffusion can be seen as a form of contagion because it spreads quickly and easily across different social and cultural contexts."
