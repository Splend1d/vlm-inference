The centrifugal force causes the object to move in a circular path, and its magnitude depends on the speed of rotation and the radius of the circle. Since the direction of the centrifugal force is always radially outwards from the center of the circle, the net force on the object will be directed inward towards the center of the circle. Therefore, option A is correct."
