It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God.\"\nIbn Battuta, ca. 1325\u20131354 C.E.\nIbn Battuta's experiences were LEAST similar to the experiences of which of the following?\n\nA. Zheng He\nB. Marco Polo\nC. Lorenzo de Medici\nD. Xuanzang\n"

He mentions that Aden is surrounded by mountains and can only be approached from one side. He also notes that Aden lacks crops, trees, and water sources, but instead relies on reservoirs for its water needs.\n\nThe passage does not mention anything about Zheng He, Marco Polo, Xuanzang, or any of these individuals traveling to Aden. Therefore, we cannot determine if they had similar experiences to Ibn Battuta's.\n\nLorenzo de Medici was an Italian nobleman who lived during the Renaissance period (14th century). He was known for his patronage of the arts and sciences, including the founding of the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence. His experiences would likely differ greatly from Ibn Battuta's, who traveled to distant lands such as Aden, Yemen, and the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC. Lorenzo de Medici"
