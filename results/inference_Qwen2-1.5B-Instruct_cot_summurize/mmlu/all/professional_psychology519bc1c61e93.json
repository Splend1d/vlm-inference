If someone is experiencing suicidal thoughts or behaviors, it is crucial to seek professional help immediately. This can include speaking with a mental health professional or seeking emergency medical care.\n\nWhile some individuals may experience worsening symptoms of depression or other mental health conditions while taking antidepressants, this does not necessarily mean that they are more dangerous to themselves. It is possible for individuals to experience side effects or adverse reactions to medications, which could be concerning but should not automatically lead to the conclusion that the person is more dangerous to themselves.\n\nIn general, it is important to approach any concerns about an individual's mental health with empathy and understanding, rather than making assumptions or jumping to conclusions based on limited information. Seeking help from a mental health professional or trusted friend or family member is always the best course of action."
