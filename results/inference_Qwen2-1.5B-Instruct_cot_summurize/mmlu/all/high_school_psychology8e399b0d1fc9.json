This is why people with low blood sugar might be more inclined to seek out food as a way to alleviate their symptoms. Engaging in risky behaviors or pursuing a romantic interest may also occur when glucose levels drop, but eating a meal is a more practical solution for immediate energy needs. Studying to improve grades is not typically associated with low blood sugar levels unless the person is experiencing symptoms that affect their ability to focus on learning."
