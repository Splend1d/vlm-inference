However, whether or not this action is considered ethical would depend on the specific circumstances and the relationship between the parents involved.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be situations where the results of psychological testing could potentially impact the parent-child relationship, and therefore the decision-making process surrounding such testing should be carefully evaluated. It is also possible that the results could lead to legal issues if they are misused or disclosed without proper consent.\n\nTherefore, based on the given options, the most appropriate answer would be C: illegally and unethically. While the action itself is legal, the potential consequences and ethical implications need to be considered."
