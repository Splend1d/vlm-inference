He found that people tend to have certain traits or characteristics that define their personality from an early age, which do not change significantly as they grow older. While there may be some variations in these traits due to factors such as experience, environment, and socialization, the overall shape of one's personality tends to stay relatively consistent throughout adulthood. Therefore, option C is the most accurate statement about personality changes with age."
