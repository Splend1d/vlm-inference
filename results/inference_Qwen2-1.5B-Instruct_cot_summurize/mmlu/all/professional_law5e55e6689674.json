This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely\n\nA. invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\nB. invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.\nC. valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.\nD. valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.\n\nThis is because the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, but it does not grant Congress the power to regulate or interfere with the internal affairs of individual states. The supremacy clause of the Constitution, Article VI, Section 2, Clause 1, states that \"all Powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" Therefore, Congress cannot pass laws that violate the rights of individuals or states without their consent, and it cannot infringe upon the powers reserved to the states or to the people.\n\nIn this case, the federal law prohibiting the state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende is constitutional because it is within Congress's plenary power to regulate commerce between the states, but it is not within its general welfare power to regulate the internal affairs of states. Additionally, the fact that the state is the only state that mines pitchblende does not mean that the federal law limits the taxing power of the state; rather, it simply means that the federal law applies only to the state."
