XOR, NOR, NAND.\n\nThese three gates are called universal because they can be combined with each other and other logic gates to implement any Boolean function. For example, you could use an XOR gate to implement the \"not\" operation (NOT), or a NAND gate to implement the \"and\" operation (AND). Similarly, you could use an XOR gate to implement the \"or\" operation (OR) and a NAND gate to implement the \"exclusive or\" (XOR). \n\nThe other options do not qualify as universal gates because they either have limited functionality or cannot be used to implement all possible logical functions. For example, an OR gate cannot be used to implement a NOT operation, nor can it be used to implement the AND, OR, XOR, or exclusive or operations."
