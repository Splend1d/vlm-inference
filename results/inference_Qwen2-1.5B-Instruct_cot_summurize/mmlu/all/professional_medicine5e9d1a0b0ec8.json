Isoniazid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic that can be used as a prophylactic treatment for Streptococcus pyogenes infections such as pharyngitis. It works by inhibiting bacterial growth and reducing the likelihood of reinfection. However, it should only be given under medical supervision due to its potential side effects, including liver damage and bone marrow suppression. Intravenous therapy is not indicated unless there are severe complications or the patient is at high risk for complications from the infection. Intravenous penicillin and intravenous prednisone are not appropriate treatments for this condition. Intravenous immune globulin may be useful if the child has a history of allergies or if the infection is caused by a specific strain of bacteria."
