This method also allows for precise control over the amount of medication being administered, ensuring that patients receive the appropriate dose while minimizing the risk of overdose or underdose. Additionally, this method may reduce the need for the patient to request medication frequently, allowing them to adjust their dosage based on their individual needs and preferences. Therefore, option D is the most effective recommendation for reducing medication use while maintaining optimal patient care."
