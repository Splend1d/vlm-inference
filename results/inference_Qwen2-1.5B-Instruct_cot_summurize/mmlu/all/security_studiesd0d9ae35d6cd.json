The adoption of extraordinary measures can retrospectively convince an audience of the existential threat.\n\nSecuritization refers to the process through which governments or organizations use threats or dangers to justify restricting rights, freedoms, or access to information.

However, it does not directly relate to the ability of the securitizing actor to reveal their power over an audience. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
