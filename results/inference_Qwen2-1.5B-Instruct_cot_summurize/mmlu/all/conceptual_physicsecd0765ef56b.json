These equations apply to situations where the speed is close to the speed of light, which is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second. \n\nHowever, they also hold true for relativistic speeds, where the speed of an object exceeds the speed of light. This means that if you consider a situation where the speed of an object is very high compared to its rest mass, then the equations will still be valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Both of these."
