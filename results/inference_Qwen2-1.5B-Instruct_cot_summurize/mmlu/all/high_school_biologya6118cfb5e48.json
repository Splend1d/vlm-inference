Gene 1 is located on chromosome A, and gene 2 is on chromosome B.\n\nIn this scenario, crossover would most likely occur during meiosis I when homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material. In this case, genes 1 and 2 would be on different chromosomes (chromosome A and chromosome B respectively), so they would not be able to undergo crossover during meiosis I. However, if both genes were located on the same chromosome (e.g., chromosome A), then crossover could occur during meiosis I or meiosis II."
