Externalities and should be taxed.\n\nExternalities refer to the effects of an individual's actions on others that are not accounted for in their cost or benefit calculations. In this case, education is providing benefits to society as a whole, such as increased knowledge and skills, which can lead to improved productivity and economic growth. Therefore, it may be appropriate to tax the benefits of education rather than subsidizing them, in order to ensure that these benefits are distributed fairly among all members of society."
