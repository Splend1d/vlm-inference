Interpersonal\n\nInterpersonal communication involves direct interaction and dialogue between individuals, which can lead to the formation or change of predispositions towards an issue. This type of communication allows for the exchange of ideas, emotions, and beliefs, and can be more effective than other forms of communication in shaping attitudes and behaviors. The media can also play a role in influencing attitudes and behaviors, but it may not necessarily form or change predispositions directly. Groups and public discussions can also have an impact on attitudes and behavior, but they may not be as effective as interpersonal communication in shaping predispositions."
