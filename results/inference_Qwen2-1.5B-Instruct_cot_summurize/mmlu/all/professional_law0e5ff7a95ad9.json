He then began oil drilling operations and removed large quantities of oil, which he sold. At no time did he give notice to the personal assistant of his oil-drilling activities. Months passed before the personal assistant learned that the uncle was selling oil from the drilling operations. The personal assistant has now brought an action in equity for an accounting of the value of the oil removed and for an injunction against any further oil removal.

In this case, the rancher gained possession of the 200-acre tract by conveying the land to his uncle and his heirs. Therefore, the right to remove oil from the tract is also an incident of the right to possession.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the right to remove oil does not necessarily attach to a defeasible fee simple (a fee simple subject to certain conditions or restrictions). \n\nOption B is incorrect because the personal assistant does have an interest in the 200-acre tract, even though it may be defeasible. The rancher conveyed the land to his uncle and his heirs, so the personal assistant is considered an heir under the conveyance.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the uncle did act in bad faith by removing oil without giving notice to the personal assistant. This would not affect the determination of whether the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession."
