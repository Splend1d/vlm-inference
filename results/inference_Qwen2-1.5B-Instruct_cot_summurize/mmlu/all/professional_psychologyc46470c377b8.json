It is often associated with higher levels of job satisfaction, productivity, and motivation. However, it is not necessarily related to turnover. Other factors such as job security, compensation, and organizational culture can also influence turnover, but affective commitment is not directly linked to it. Therefore, it is unlikely that affective commitment would be least predictive of turnover among these options."
