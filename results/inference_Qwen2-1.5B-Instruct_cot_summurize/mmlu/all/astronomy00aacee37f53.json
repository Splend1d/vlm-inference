The ozone layer acts as a natural shield against harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, protecting life on Earth from these harmful rays. Without this natural protection, the UV radiation from the sun would penetrate deeper into the atmosphere, causing significant damage to plants, animals, and humans.\n\nThis loss of the ozone layer led to a decrease in the amount of sunlight reaching the surface of Mars, which caused the planet to cool down. As a result, Mars has a lower temperature than it had before, and its surface features are now visible through the thin Martian atmosphere. This cooling also resulted in the drying up of rivers and lakes, and the disappearance of large bodies of water such as Lake Mariner, which was once one of the largest lakes on Mars."
