This type of growth is caused by the action of gravity on the roots and stems of the plant. As the plant grows upwards, it pulls against the surface it is growing on, causing it to grow towards the ground.\n\nPhototropism, also known as phototropism, is the growth of a plant in response to light. Plants can move their leaves towards the light source or away from the light source depending on the direction of the light source.\n\nGravidotropism is the growth of a plant towards the center of its environment due to the accumulation of nutrients or water. Negative gravidotropism is the opposite of this, where the plant grows away from the center of its environment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Thigmotropism."
