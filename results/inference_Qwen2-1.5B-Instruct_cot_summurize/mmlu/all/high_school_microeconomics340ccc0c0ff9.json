An effective price ceiling must be at a price below the equilibrium price.\n\nWhen a government sets a price ceiling below the equilibrium price, it creates an excess demand for the good because consumers perceive the price as being lower than it actually is. This excess demand leads to a shortage of the good and can lead to higher prices and reduced supply if left unregulated. Therefore, a price ceiling that is set too low will not solve the problem of excess demand and may even exacerbate it."
