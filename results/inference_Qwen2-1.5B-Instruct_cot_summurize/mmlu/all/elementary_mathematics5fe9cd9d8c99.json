So, the total number of apples is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Apples} = 15 \\times 18 = 270 \\]\n\nNext, since they use 7 apples for each pie, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pie to find out how many pies they can make:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of Pies} = \\frac{\\text{Total Apples}}{\\text{Apples per Pie}} = \\frac{270}{7} \\approx 39.2857...\\]\n\nSince you can't make a fraction of a pie, the bakers can make a maximum of 39 whole pies (rounding down from approximately 39.28). Therefore, the correct answer is C. 39."
