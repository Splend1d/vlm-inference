The mental nerve.\n\nThe mental nerve, also known as the mandibular branch of the facial nerve (CN VII), is responsible for innervating the muscles of mastication and the posterior two-thirds of the tongue. It provides sensory and motor fibers for these functions. \n\nIn the context of a biopsy procedure, it is important to ensure that the patient's comfort and safety are prioritized. To do this, the dentist or oral surgeon may use local anesthesia to numb the area around the incision site, including the mental nerve. This would allow for a painless biopsy without causing any discomfort to the patient."
