She contends that contaminants, consisting mostly of the solvent, were released into the ground at the facility and have migrated and continue to migrate to her property, contaminating the soil, the groundwater, and her well. She alleges various acts of negligence on the part of the facility owner in causing the release of the contaminants into the ground. She also alleges that employees of the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently spilling some of the solvent onto the ground while filling a rooftop tank at the facility. The solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that if there was any contamination, the facility owner and the supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts to the contamination and that therefore the homeowner cannot show how much damage each has inflicted on her. There is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert. Should the court grant the summary judgment motion?\n\nA. No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.\nB. No, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner.\nC. Yes, because there is no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier. damages against the solvent supplier.\nD. Yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert.\n"

Yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert.\n\nWhen two or more parties are involved in a tortious act, such as pollution, they may be considered joint tortfeasors and may be held liable for an indivisible injury. However, this does not necessarily mean that each party is equally responsible for the entire cost of the harm caused. In fact, it can be argued that each party should only be held accountable for their share of the total damages based on their individual actions and contributions to the harm.\n\nIn this case, the homeowner has alleged that the facility owner and the solvent supplier are jointly and severally liable for the contamination. However, there is no evidence presented to support this claim. The summary judgment motion by the solvent supplier argues that since the facility owner and the solvent supplier did not act in concert, the homeowner cannot prove which party is responsible for the damage. Therefore, the court should grant the summary judgment motion.\n\nIt's important to note that this is just one possible interpretation of the situation, and other factors could influence the outcome depending on the specific details of the case."
