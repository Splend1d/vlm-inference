Marital Communication Privilege.\n\nUnder common law, marital communications are privileged from discovery during divorce or separation proceedings, unless they relate to issues such as custody or maintenance that would otherwise be discoverable. In this case, if the statement was made before the marriage, it would fall under this privilege. Therefore, the court would likely sustain the objection for the Marital Communication Privilege. \n\nHowever, if the statement was made after the marriage, the objection may not apply due to the passage of time and the change in circumstances surrounding the statement. It ultimately depends on the specific facts of the case and how long ago the statement was made."
