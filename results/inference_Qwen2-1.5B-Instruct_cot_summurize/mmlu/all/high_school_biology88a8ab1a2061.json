Stomata are small openings in the leaf that allow for gas exchange between the plant and its environment. In hot and dry environments, there may not be enough water available for the plant to produce enough chlorophyll (the pigment that captures light energy) to support photosynthesis. As a result, the plant may need to reduce the number of stomata on its leaves to conserve water and minimize heat loss. This adaptation would help the plant survive in these extreme conditions. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Hot and dry."
