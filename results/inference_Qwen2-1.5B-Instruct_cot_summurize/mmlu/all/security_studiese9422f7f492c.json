Looting and theft, especially where corruption is endemic, states are weak, and weapons stockpiles are not properly secured.\n\nLooting and theft can occur when there is a lack of security measures in place for weapons held by state military or police forces. This can lead to unauthorized access and the transfer of weapons from one location to another, either intentionally or unintentionally. Additionally, corruption and weak governance can make it easier for individuals or groups to gain access to weapons and use them for illegal activities. As a result, weapons may find their way onto the illicit arms market through these means."
