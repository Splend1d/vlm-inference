Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, spending your child support check on food and clothes for your children is considered morally wrong because it goes against the principle of fairness and equity, where you should use your resources to benefit yourself and others equally. This behavior can lead to resentment and conflict within the family unit.\n\nIn scenario 2, not slamming on your breaks to avoid hitting a ball rolling into the road is not inherently morally wrong but may be seen as reckless or irresponsible by some people. However, it is generally considered acceptable behavior if it does not cause harm to others or property. Therefore, the answer is not wrong, not wrong."
