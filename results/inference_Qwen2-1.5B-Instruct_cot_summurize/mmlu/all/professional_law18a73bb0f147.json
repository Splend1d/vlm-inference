The fact that the victim died of a heart attack before the fire spread to his bedroom does not necessarily mean that the defendant should be held liable for felony murder. It is possible that the defendant could have been negligent or reckless in setting the fire, even if the heart attack occurred after the fire had already started. Therefore, it is possible that the defendant could still be found guilty of felony murder based on other factors. However, without additional information about the circumstances surrounding the fire and the actions of the defendant, it is difficult to say for certain whether the defendant would be least likely to be held liable under this scenario."
