Slowness of response: When there is a delay between the time at which an observation is made and its effect on the dependent variable, it leads to autocorrelation.\n2. Overreaction: If the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is nonlinear or complex, then the error term may be more responsive to past errors than to new ones.\n3. Omission of relevant explanatory variables: If some relevant explanatory variables are not included in the model, they may cause autocorrelation.\n4. Outliers: If there are outliers in the data, they can lead to autocorrelation.\n\nTherefore, all options (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are possible causes of autocorrelated residuals. The correct answer is D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)."
