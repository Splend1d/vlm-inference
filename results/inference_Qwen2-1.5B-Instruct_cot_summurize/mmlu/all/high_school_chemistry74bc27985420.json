Clausius-Clapeyron equation.\n\nThe Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid changes with its heat of vaporization, or enthalpy of vaporization. It is used to study phase transitions and can be used to predict how a substance will change from a liquid to a gas as the temperature increases. The equation is given by:\n\nln(Pg/Pl) = -R * (1/Tg - 1/Tl)\n\nwhere Pg is the vapor pressure of the substance at the transition point, Pl is the vapor pressure at the boiling point, Tg is the temperature at the transition point, and Tl is the temperature at the boiling point. \n\nThis equation was named after the French physicist Jules Clapeyron who developed it in the early 20th century. The R in the equation represents the universal gas constant, which is equal to 8.314 joules per kelvin per mole."
