At a pretrial hearing, the defendant told the judge that he was unhappy with the public defender who had been appointed to represent him and that he wanted the judge to appoint another lawyer. The judge refused to appoint another lawyer, telling the defendant, with no further explanation, that his only other choice was to represent himself. The defendant said that he would represent himself at trial then, as \"anything [was] better than having this lawyer.\" The defendant did not raise the subject again, and he represented himself at trial. After hearing overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt, the jury convicted him of armed robbery. On appeal, the defendant has requested a new trial on the ground that he was deprived of his right to counsel. Should the appellate court grant the defendant's request?\n\nA. No, because the defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel.\nB. No, because the trial court's error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence.\nC. Yes, because the defendant was not capable of effectively representing himself.\nD. Yes, because the record does not establish a valid waiver of the right to counsel.\n"

Yes, because the record does not establish a valid waiver of the right to counsel.\n\nThe defendant's statement that he would represent himself at trial was made during the pre-trial hearing, before any formal appointment of counsel had occurred. This statement indicates that the defendant had not yet formally appointed counsel and therefore had not actually been provided with legal representation. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the defendant intentionally waived his right to counsel by making this statement. \n\nFurthermore, the fact that the defendant later represented himself without objection from the defense team suggests that there may have been some form of cooperation between the defendant and the defense team regarding the defense strategy. However, this cooperation does not necessarily mean that the defendant's decision to represent himself was not a valid waiver of his right to counsel. \n\nIn summary, while the defendant's statement that he would represent himself may indicate that he intended to do so, the absence of any formal appointment of counsel and the subsequent lack of objection to the defendant's representation suggest that the defendant's decision to represent himself was not a valid waiver of his right to counsel. Therefore, the appellate court should grant the defendant's request for a new trial."
