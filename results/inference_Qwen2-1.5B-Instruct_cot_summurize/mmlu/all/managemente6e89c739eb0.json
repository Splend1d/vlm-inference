Small span of control\n\nHierarchical structures typically have a smaller span of control compared to other organizational structures such as flat or networked organizations. This means that there are fewer levels of management between the top leader and the bottommost employee, which can lead to more flexibility in decision-making and faster response times to changes. However, this also means that there may be less discipline and stability within the organization."
