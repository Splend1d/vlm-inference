Ten weeks post-fertilization.\n\nPalatine processes are the structures that form on the roof of the mouth during embryonic development, and they begin to fuse around week 10 of gestation (which is approximately ten weeks post-fertilization). These structures help in the formation of the palate, which is the roof of the mouth. The fusion of the palatine processes also helps in the formation of the soft palate, which further helps in the development of the speech organs."
