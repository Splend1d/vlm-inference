The marginal revenue (MR) curve is the slope of the demand curve, which indicates how much additional revenue is generated from an additional unit sold at the current price.\n\nIf the monopolist sets the price at a level where MR = MC, the profit-maximizing quantity will be equal to the output level at which MR = AVC. In this case, the marginal revenue curve will be parallel to the demand curve because both curves intersect at the same point.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer."
