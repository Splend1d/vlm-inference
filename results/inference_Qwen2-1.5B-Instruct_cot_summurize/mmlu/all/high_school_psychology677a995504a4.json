The nature versus nurture debate refers to the question of whether human characteristics and abilities are determined by genetic factors (nature) or learned experiences (nurture). While genetics can play a role in shaping our traits, environmental factors also have a significant impact on our development and behavior. Therefore, it is often argued that both nature and nurture contribute to our overall development."
