Schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects the brain's ability to think, feel, and interact with others, leading to hallucinations, delusions, and other symptoms. If someone is found to have these symptoms, they may be considered legally insane under certain circumstances, such as if they cannot provide informed consent or if their behavior poses an immediate danger to themselves or others. However, it's important to note that being legally insane does not necessarily mean that someone is completely unable to comprehend the consequences of their actions."
