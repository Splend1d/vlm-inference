This zone includes all the resources beneath the seabed and subsoil within it, but does not include natural resources that are shared with adjacent states or other countries.\n\nWhen a coastal state is unable to fully utilize its EEZ resources due to overfishing, it must provide access to those resources for other states in its EEZ. These other states have the right to access and use these resources, subject to certain conditions and restrictions as determined by the coastal state. In cases where the coastal state is unable to fully utilize its EEZ resources, it must prioritize the access of developing and land-locked states to the surplus resources.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement regarding third states' fishing rights within an EEZ is that they have the right to access those resources if the coastal state is unable to fully utilize them. However, this access should be prioritized for developing and land-locked states."
