This means Skinner's contribution is not only the land's fair market value but also includes the mortgage on it. However, since the mortgage is assumed, we do not subtract it from Skinner's contribution.\n\nNow, let's add Skinner's total contribution to the partnership's equity (which includes both the land and the assumed mortgage):\n\n$40,005 (total contribution) + $10,000 (mortgage) = $50,005\n\nSince this amount ($50,005) exceeds Skinner's capital contribution by $10,005, Skinner's basis in the partnership interest can be calculated as follows:\n\nCapital Contribution = $50,005 - $10,005 = $40,000\n\nThis amount ($40,000) represents Skinner's basis in the partnership interest, so the correct answer is:\n\nA. $27,000"
