In many jurisdictions, it is generally acceptable for therapists to receive feedback or guidance from other professionals with whom they have established a relationship, such as a supervising psychologist or a colleague who has experience in similar cases.\n\nHowever, there may be some situations where additional ethical concerns arise, such as if the therapist's actions or decisions could impact the patient's treatment or well-being. It is important for therapists to consider these factors carefully when making referrals or seeking consultations with other professionals.\n\nIn general, ethical conduct requires that therapists act in the best interests of their patients and adhere to professional standards and regulations."
