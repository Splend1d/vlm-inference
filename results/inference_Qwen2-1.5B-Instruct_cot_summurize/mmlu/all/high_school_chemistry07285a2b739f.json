H2O and CH3OH\n\nBoth water (H2O) and methanol (CH3OH) are polar solvents, meaning they can dissolve polar molecules such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and other hydrocarbons. However, methanol is nonpolar compared to water.\n\nWhen methanol dissolves in water, it forms an aqueous solution, which means the two liquids will mix well and form a homogeneous mixture. On the other hand, when water dissolves in methanol, it also forms an aqueous solution, but this time the two liquids do not mix well, resulting in an immiscible mixture.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct."
