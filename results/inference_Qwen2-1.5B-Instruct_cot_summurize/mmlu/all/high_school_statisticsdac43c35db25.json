By only including those who actually completed the survey, we ensure that our sample is as diverse as possible and provides a more accurate representation of the entire class.\n\nIf we decide to randomly select 27 additional class members and send the survey to them, it will introduce bias into our sample due to the fact that we are selecting individuals based on their response to the survey rather than their participation in the survey itself. This may lead to an inaccurate picture of the overall class' attitudes or behaviors.\n\nOn the other hand, if we follow up with those who did not return the survey, it may increase the likelihood of receiving responses from those who were interested in participating but were unable to do so for whatever reason. However, this approach still relies on the assumption that those who did not return the survey have different characteristics from those who did, which could be flawed depending on the reasons why they did not participate.\n\nTherefore, option B (using the surveys that were returned and leaving the sample size at 75) is the most appropriate choice in this scenario."
