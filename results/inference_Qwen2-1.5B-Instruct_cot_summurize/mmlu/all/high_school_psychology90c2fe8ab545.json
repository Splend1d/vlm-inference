In the case of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, many people had flashbulb memories of the destruction and subsequent rescue efforts. This is because the event occurred so quickly and was so traumatic for most individuals, it left a lasting impression on their minds. \n\nImplicit and engram memory refer to long-term memories that can be retrieved through specific cues or prompts. Explicit memory refers to memories that are more easily recalled by recalling information rather than through recall cues.\n\nTherefore, C. flashbulb memory is the correct answer."
