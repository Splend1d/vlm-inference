She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype?\n\nA. Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR\nB. The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier\nC. The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype\nD. The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained\n"

This mutation results in a dominant-negative effect, which means that only one copy of the mutated gene is required to cause the disease. Therefore, even if the second CFTR mutation was not detected, it would still explain the patient's clinical phenotype. \n\nOption A is incorrect because multiple copies of the mutated gene are necessary for the disease to occur.\nOption B is incorrect because being a CFTR obligate carrier does not necessarily mean that the patient will have the same clinical phenotype as the carrier.\nOption C is incorrect because genetic testing can identify both homozygous carriers and heterozygous carriers of the CFTR mutation, but the patient's clinical phenotype suggests that she is a heterozygous carrier.\nOption D is incorrect because the patient's clinical phenotype is consistent with the presence of the G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene."
