BaCl2 + Al2(SO4)3 \u2192 AlCl3 + BaSO4\n\nThis equation has no unbalanced ions or electrons, so it does not require balancing.\n\nB. H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O\n\nThis equation requires balancing because there are two hydrogen atoms on the left side of the equation and only one on the right side. The correct answer would be B.\n\nC. NaOH + H3PO4 \u2192 Na2HPO4 + H2O\n\nThis equation requires balancing because there are three hydroxide ions (OH-) on the left side of the equation and only one on the right side. The correct answer would be A.\n\nD. C2H2(g) + N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + N2(g)\n\nThis equation requires balancing because there are two carbon atoms on the left side of the equation and only one on the right side.
