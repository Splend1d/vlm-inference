Bipedalism and relatively stable brain size. \n\nThis period is known as the Oldowan stage of hominin evolution and is characterized by the development of bipedalism, which allowed for better mobility over long distances. At this time, the brain size was relatively stable, indicating that the human species had not yet reached its full potential. This period also saw the emergence of the first stone tools, which were used for various purposes such as butchering animals and making weapons."
