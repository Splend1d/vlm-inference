It was developed by Claude Shannon in 1948 and later expanded by Walter Weaver in 1950. The model assumes that messages are composed of symbols, which can be encoded into a binary code using a coding scheme. Once the message has been encoded, it can then be transmitted over a channel to its destination, where it will be decoded back into its original form using another coding scheme."
