One method begins by heating a solid or liquid in a flask to produce a gaseous product. The gas passes through a tube and displaces water in an inverted, water-filled bottle. The mass of the starting material is measured, along with the volume of the displaced water and the temperature of the system. The pressure in the inverted water-filled bottle is equal to the external pressure. Once the barometric pressure has been recorded, what other information is needed to finish the experiment?\n\nA. The heat of formation of the gas\nB. The density of the water\nC. The mass of the displaced water\nD. The vapor pressure of the water\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The mass of the displaced water.\n\nTo determine the molecular mass of a gas using this method, you need to know the mass of the starting material and the volume of the displaced water. This can be done by measuring the initial mass of the solid or liquid before it is heated, as well as the final mass of the gas when it is collected in the inverted bottle. You also need to measure the volume of the displaced water. Finally, you need to know the temperature of the system at the start and end of the experiment.\n\nOnce you have these measurements, you can use them to calculate the molar mass of the gas. To do this, you will need to know the molar mass of the gas and its chemical formula. You may also need to know the specific heat capacity of the gas to convert the mass of the starting material into moles.\n\nThe other options listed (A) the heat of formation of the gas, (B) the density of the water, and (D) the vapor pressure of the water) are not directly related to the calculation of the molecular mass of the gas. They would only be relevant if you were trying to determine the composition of the gas being produced during the experiment."
