After using their bronchodilator inhaler.\n\nAfter using a bronchodilator inhaler, it is recommended that the patient rinse their mouth with water for 30 seconds or until they feel comfortable. This helps to wash away any medication residue and prevent irritation in the throat. It's important to follow this procedure as it can help improve the effectiveness of the inhaler and reduce the risk of side effects."
