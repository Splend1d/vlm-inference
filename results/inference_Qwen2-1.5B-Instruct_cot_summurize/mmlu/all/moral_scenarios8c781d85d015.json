However, since this behavior is not harmful to anyone else and does not cause any direct harm to the individual being laughed at, it can be seen as a non-moral issue rather than an action that violates ordinary moral standards. \n\nScenario 2 involves cheating on an exam, which goes against the principles of honesty and fairness. It is a clear violation of ethical norms and can lead to serious consequences such as academic failure, loss of trust from peers and teachers, and potential legal issues if caught. Therefore, scenario 2 is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
