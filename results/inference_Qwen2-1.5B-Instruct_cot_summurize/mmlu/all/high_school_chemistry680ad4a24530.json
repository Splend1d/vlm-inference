The molar mass of propane is calculated as follows:\n\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molar mass of propane (C3H8) is:\n\\[ \\text{Molar Mass} = 12.01 + 3(1.008) = 15.038 \\text{ g/mol} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles using the formula for moles:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Moles} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Molar Mass}} \\]\n\nGiven that the mass of propane is 6.2 grams and its molar mass is 15.038 g/mol, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Number of Moles} = \\frac{6.2}{15.038} \\approx 0.4069 \\]\n\nRounded to one decimal place, this gives us approximately 0.41 moles.\n\nHowever, since the options given are not provided in scientific notation, we should round the result to the nearest whole number or significant figure if necessary. In this case, rounding to two significant figures, we get 0.41 mol.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol."
