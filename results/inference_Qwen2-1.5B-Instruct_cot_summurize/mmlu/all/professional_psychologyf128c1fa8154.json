It does not involve random assignment of subjects to different groups and it does not assess causality.\n\nIn a CORRELATIONAL study, researchers collect data on two or more variables over time and try to identify patterns in their relationships. They may also control for other variables that could influence the relationship between the variables being studied. Correlational studies are often used to explore associations between variables without trying to determine whether one variable causes changes in another.\n\nCorrelational studies are useful when you want to understand the nature of a relationship between two variables, but you do not want to make any claims about the direction or strength of the relationship. If you want to test whether one variable causes changes in another, you would need to use a different research design, such as an experiment or a controlled trial."
