Whether the kernel function is Gaussian versus other shapes.\n\nIn general, using a Gaussian kernel results in smoother regression lines (less curvature), which can help prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model. However, this also means that it may be less effective at capturing complex patterns in the data, leading to underfitting. \n\nOn the other hand, using a non-Gaussian kernel like a triangular or box-shaped kernel allows for greater flexibility in fitting the data and can potentially avoid overfitting if the non-Gaussian shape of the kernel allows the model to capture more complex relationships in the data. However, it also increases the risk of underfitting due to increased complexity.\n\nTherefore, whether the kernel function is Gaussian versus non-Gaussian has the most significant impact on the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in Kernel Regression."
