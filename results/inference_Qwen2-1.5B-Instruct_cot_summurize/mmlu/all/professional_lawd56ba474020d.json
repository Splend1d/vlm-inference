It had a contingency clause requiring him to make a completed application for a mortgage within a specified time. It said that time was of the essence. The purchaser failed to apply but instead asked a mortgage broker friend for his opinion as to whether he would qualify. The seller told the purchaser that she rescinded the sale because there was no mortgage application within the agreed time. A few days later, the purchaser made a belated application and received approval, but the seller insisted on a rescission of the contract. Will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?\n\nA. Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.\nB. Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval \u0080\u0093 the first notice communicated is the effective one.\nC. No, because the amount of time that he was late was a \"de minimus\" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.\nD. No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.\n"

No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.\n\nThe purchaser's failure to apply for a mortgage within the agreed time was a breach of the contract, which made the buyer liable for damages. However, the purchaser's reliance on his friend's opinion rather than making a formal application did not absolve him of this obligation. The fact that the seller informed the purchaser that they were rescinding the sale before receiving any response from the purchaser does not affect the validity of the rescission. The rescission occurred when the purchaser failed to comply with the terms of the contract, not when the seller rescinds it. Therefore, the seller will likely not prevail in rescinding the transaction based solely on the purchaser's tardiness in applying for a mortgage."
