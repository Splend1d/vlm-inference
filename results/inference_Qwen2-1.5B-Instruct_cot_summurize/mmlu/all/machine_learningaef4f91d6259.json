However, this does not mean that it is always desirable or optimal.\nThere can be cases where the MLE is not an efficient estimator, even though it may be unbiased and consistent. For example, if there are multiple parameters in the model that need to be estimated simultaneously, then the MLE may not be the most efficient choice since it involves solving a system of equations with potentially many unknowns.\nIn summary, while the MLE is generally considered to be an efficient estimator, it is not necessarily desirable for all applications. In some cases, other estimation methods such as Bayesian inference may provide more useful results."
