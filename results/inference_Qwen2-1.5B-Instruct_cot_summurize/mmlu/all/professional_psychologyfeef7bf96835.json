Inflicting pain or stress on animals is acceptable in research only when an alternative (non-painful) procedure is unavailable and the use of the procedure is justified by the potential value of the study.\n\nResearching the impact of animals in psychological studies involves ethical considerations, including the treatment of animals during experiments. It's important to note that using animals for psychological research can sometimes involve painful procedures, but these methods must be justified by their potential benefit to humans. If there are no other alternatives available, and the pain or distress caused to the animals is minimally inflicted, then such research may be considered ethically acceptable under certain circumstances. However, the overall ethical framework requires that all possible non-invasive methods be explored before resorting to more invasive ones."
