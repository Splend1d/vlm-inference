When combined with other behavioral techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses on changing negative thought patterns and behaviors related to smoking, the rate of success is typically higher than if either technique was used alone. The combination of these two approaches may lead to greater motivation and commitment to quitting smoking, making it more difficult for the individual to resume smoking once they stop using the patches."
