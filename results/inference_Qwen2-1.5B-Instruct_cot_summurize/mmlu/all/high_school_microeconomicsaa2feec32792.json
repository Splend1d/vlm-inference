A price ceiling will be located below the equilibrium price.\n\nA price ceiling sets a maximum price that a seller can charge for their product or service. When a price ceiling is set at a level that is lower than the equilibrium price, it leads to excess demand and shortages in the market. This is because consumers are willing to pay more than the price ceiling, which means there is a surplus of goods available in the market. As a result, sellers may choose not to produce as much as they would like due to the lack of buyers willing to pay the higher price. Therefore, a price ceiling is likely to lead to an outcome where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, resulting in a shortage of goods rather than a surplus."
