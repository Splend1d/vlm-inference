Yes, because the activity was outrageous and shocking.\n\nIntentional infliction of emotional distress can be established based on the defendant's conduct that causes severe emotional harm or distress to another person. This includes situations where the defendant engages in tortious acts such as battery, assault, stalking, harassment, and more. In this case, the defendant subjected the father to severe physical abuse, which can result in emotional distress. \n\nAdditionally, the defendant's actions were outrageous and shocking, which means they go beyond what society generally accepts as appropriate or reasonable. Such behavior may include activities like torture, animal cruelty, or gross negligence that cause significant distress to others. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that establishing IIED requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning that the evidence must be clear, convincing, and compelling enough to convince the jury that the defendant acted with malicious intent and caused severe emotional distress."
