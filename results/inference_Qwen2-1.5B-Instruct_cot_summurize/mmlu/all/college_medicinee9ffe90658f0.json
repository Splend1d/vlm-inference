Elaborative rehearsal\n\nElaborative rehearsal involves creating connections between new and old information through active mental processes such as connecting new ideas with existing knowledge or experiences. In this case, the student was able to relate the basic information about electrochemical cells to their understanding of redox reactions, which involved building on top of previous knowledge to gain deeper insights into the topic. This type of rehearsal is considered more effective than chunking or maintenance rehearsal because it allows students to connect new information to existing knowledge in a meaningful way."
