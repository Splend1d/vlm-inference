However, it is important to note that R has different values depending on the temperature scale used. For example, if you use Kelvin as your temperature scale, then R would have units of J/(mol*K). If you use Celsius, then R would have units of atm*L/mol*K. So while all of the given options are valid, they do not necessarily reflect the standard value of R."
