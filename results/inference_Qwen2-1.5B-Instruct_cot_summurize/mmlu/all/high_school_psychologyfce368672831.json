However, it's important to continue to read and update textbooks regularly to keep informed about current topics.\n\nA degree in another field may not be necessary if one already has a strong foundation in psychology and education, but pursuing additional qualifications can be beneficial for personal growth and career advancement.\n\nWhile a graduate education program can provide adequate preparation for professional practice, it's still important for school psychologists to seek out additional training opportunities and continue their education throughout their careers to stay current with the latest developments in the field."
