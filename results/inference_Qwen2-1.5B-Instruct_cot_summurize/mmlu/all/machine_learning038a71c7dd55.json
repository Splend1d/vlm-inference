False, False\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect because the kernel density estimator does not involve regression; it estimates the probability density function (PDF) or cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a continuous random variable based on a set of sample points. It does not perform regression as stated.\n\nStatement 2 is also incorrect. A learned decision tree's depth refers to the maximum depth of any branch in the tree, which depends on both the number of training examples and the complexity of the decision rule used for splitting nodes during training. Therefore, it cannot be larger than the number of training examples."
