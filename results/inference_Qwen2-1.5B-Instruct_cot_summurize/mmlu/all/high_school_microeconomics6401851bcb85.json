In the long run, supply is not able to adjust fully to changes in demand.\n\nIn the short run, all inputs (such as labor and capital) are considered fixed, meaning they cannot be changed or adjusted by firms immediately. This allows them to quickly respond to changes in demand through changes in production levels. However, in the long run, when firms face permanent constraints on their resources such as limited natural resources or technological limitations, it becomes more difficult for them to adjust their output levels in response to changes in demand. As a result, the adjustment of supply to changes in demand becomes less efficient over time. Therefore, option D is incorrect. Option A is also incorrect because all inputs can potentially change during the long run, but only certain types of inputs can change significantly. Options B and E are also incorrect because while some inputs may change, others remain constant throughout the long run."
