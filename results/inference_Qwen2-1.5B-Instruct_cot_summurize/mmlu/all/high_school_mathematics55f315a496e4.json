However, this doesn't match any of the given options. Let's reevaluate the problem.\n\nWe know that the expected value of the larger number is the sum of the products of each outcome and its probability. In this case, the outcomes are the numbers from 1 to 6 for both dice, with equal probability of $\\frac{1}{6}$ for each.\n\nSo, the expected value is:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 3 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 4 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 5 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 6 = \\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = \\frac{21}{3}.$$\n\nThis matches option C. So, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{161}{3}}$."
