This type of syllogism involves making a general statement about all members of some class and then applying that generalization to individuals within that class. In this case, the generalization is that all A's are B, where A represents the class of all A's and B represents the class of all B's. The conclusion follows from the premises because it logically follows that if every member of the class of all A's is also a member of the class of all B's, then every member of the class of all A's must be a member of the class of all B's."
