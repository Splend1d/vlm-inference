A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a convalescent home on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the proposed zoning change. However, the real estate developer's subsequent application for approval for a proposed home on the grounds was rejected because the rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. In an action brought in state court seeking a judgment declaring the city charter amendment invalid, the court will most likely declare the amendment\n\nA. unconstitutional, as violation of the real estate developer's due process rights.\nB. unconstitutional, as an unlawful delegation of legislative power to a regulatory body.\nC. constitutional, as a valid exercise of the city's police power.\nD. constitutional, as a valid exercise of a power reserved by the people to themselves.\n"

This means that any decision made by the city council regarding land use must be subject to a referendum if the majority of the voters in the municipality agree.\n\nThe city's charter amendment required any changes in land use agreed to by the city council to be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. Since the city council approved the proposed zoning change without a referendum, it is considered an unlawful delegation of legislative power to a regulatory body. Therefore, the court will most likely declare the amendment unconstitutional."
