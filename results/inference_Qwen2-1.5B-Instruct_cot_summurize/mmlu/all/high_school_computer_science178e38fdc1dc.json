Every time the computer-controlled player has a turn, the game runs slowly because the computer evaluates all potential moves and selects the best one.

The game's running speed can only be improved if the game is played between two human players instead of with the computer-controlled player.\nB. The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time the computer-controlled player has a turn.\nC. The game's running speed cannot be improved because computers can only be programmed to find the best possible solution.\nD. The game's running speed cannot be improved because the game is an example of an algorithm that does not run in a reasonable time.\n"

The game's running speed might be improved by using a process that finds approximate solutions every time the computer-controlled player has a turn.\n\nAn approximation-based approach to solving problems like the game could help improve its running speed. This method involves finding a good enough solution rather than finding the optimal one, which would require more computational resources. By selecting the best move from among all possible options, the game could potentially reduce the number of steps it takes to make each decision, leading to faster gameplay. However, this approach may not completely eliminate the need for extensive computation since there will still be some steps where the computer makes decisions based on all possible outcomes. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice."
