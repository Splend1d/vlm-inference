They work by reducing the amount of goods and services people need when economic activity is weak (recessions) or strong (expansions), thereby preventing inflation and maintaining economic stability. These types of automatic stabilizers can be both effective and efficient, but they require careful management to ensure that they do not become too large and lead to excessive deficits or surpluses."
