The number of times an event has been rehearsed does not necessarily indicate its true value or meaning. Additionally, the absence of a denominator to compute an average can make it difficult to compare the relative importance of different types of events. \n\nIt is also worth noting that the ability to verify information about older events may be limited due to factors such as age-related cognitive decline or loss of memories related to certain events. Therefore, while some older events may be less likely to be forgotten or lost, their verifiability can still be affected by various factors."
