At sentencing the court made additional factual findings, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that resulted in the addition of a 10-year enhancement to the sentence, which was over and above the maximum provided for by the jury's verdict. Defense counsel objected that the judge-made enhancement was unconstitutional and denied his right to a jury trial on that issue. Does counsel have a valid constitutional argument?\n\nA. No, sentencing laws widely authorize the sentencing court to engage in fact-finding that is based on a preponderance of the evidence.\nB. No, it has never been decided that a defendant has a right to be judged on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nC. Yes, judicial fact-finding that increases the maximum sentence over what the jury's verdict allows is unconstitutional.\nD. Yes, it is unconstitutional for a court to use its discretion to fashioning a defendant's sentence.\n"

Yes, it is unconstitutional for a court to use its discretion to fashion a defendant's sentence.\n\nThe Constitution provides that no person shall be \"deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\" This includes the right to a fair and impartial trial, including the right to present witnesses and evidence as well as the right to confront witnesses against them. The Due Process Clause also requires that the government must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, not just preponderance of the evidence.\n\nIn this case, the court added an additional 10-year enhancement to the sentence based on a preponderance of the evidence, which goes beyond the maximum provided for by the jury's verdict. This exceeds the standard allowed under the Constitution, and therefore constitutes an unconstitutional exercise of the court's discretion.\n\nTherefore, defense counsel had a valid constitutional argument that the judge-made enhancement was unconstitutional."
