Tropical rainforest.\n\nThis is because the statement \"A researcher conducts a survey of a biome and finds 35 percent more species than she has found in any other biome\" suggests that the researcher's findings are higher than those from any other biome. In a tropical rainforest, there are typically many different plant and animal species due to its high biodiversity. Therefore, it is likely that the researcher's findings would be significantly higher than those from other biomes like Tundra or Temperate deciduous forest. The statement also implies that the researcher has conducted this survey before, so she must have some knowledge about the types of species that can be found in these biomes."
