However, the committee should ensure that the auditor's independence and objectivity are maintained throughout the audit process. Additionally, the committee should consider factors such as the quality and timeliness of the audit, the effectiveness of the internal control system, and the overall financial health of the company when determining the compensation of the auditor."
