We use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normal. Means are not.\nC. We use z for proportions because the sampling distribution of sample proportions is approximately normal, but that is not the case for the sampling distribution of sample means.\nD. When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation, more variability is introduced into the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n"

This is because the sampling distribution of the mean depends on the shape of the underlying distribution of the population and how it is sampled, while the sampling distribution of the proportion depends only on the number of successes in the sample. Therefore, when we want to make inferences about the population mean, we typically use the z-statistic, which is based on the standard normal distribution."
