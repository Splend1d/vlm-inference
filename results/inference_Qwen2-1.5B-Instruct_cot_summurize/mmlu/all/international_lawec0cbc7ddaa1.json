In the 1990's it became apparent the European Court of Human Rights had to be reformed because it was a part time court that could not process the growing number of complaints.\n\nIt is true that the European Court of Human Rights has faced challenges related to its workload and staffing, but these issues were not specifically attributed to being a part-time court. The Court does have some flexibility in how it handles cases, including allowing for more flexible working hours or adjusting the number of judges assigned to certain cases based on workload. However, it is not accurate to say that this is the primary reason why the Court needed to be reformed in the 1990s."
