This measurement is not used for measuring horses and would not be included in a standard measurement chart.\n\nHowever, if you're referring to the length of the hand as an indicator of the size or breed of a horse, there are several breeds that are known for their large hands, such as Thoroughbreds and Quarter Horses. In this case, the answer would be C (ten inches). \n\nIf you have any other questions about measurements or horse-related topics, feel free to ask!"
