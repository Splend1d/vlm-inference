The idea of exceptionalism suggests that the United States has a unique role to play in the world, and that its actions should be guided by a set of moral values that are different from those of other nations. This can lead to conflicts with other countries that do not share these values or that perceive them as a threat to their own interests. Therefore, some Europeans may view the influence of exceptionalism as a way for the US to dominate and control other nations, rather than promoting peace and cooperation."
