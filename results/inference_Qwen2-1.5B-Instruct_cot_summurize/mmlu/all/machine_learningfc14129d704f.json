True, False\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect because convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to perform very well on various image datasets including CIFAR-10. In fact, some CNN architectures have achieved state-of-the-art results on this dataset with accuracies above 95%.\n\nStatement 2 is also incorrect. While it's true that ensembles of neural networks may sometimes show higher correlation in their learned features compared to single models, this does not necessarily mean that these ensembles will always result in lower classification accuracy. The effectiveness of an ensemble depends on many factors such as the diversity of its constituent models and their ability to generalize from the training data. Therefore, statement 2 is false."
