                    "text": "The main objective of the article \"Will Cloning Harm People?\" by Mike Pence, Governor of Indiana, is to use consequentialist arguments to argue that cloning is immoral. Specifically, he argues that cloning could lead to harm and suffering for both the cloned individual and those who are involved in its creation.\n\nIn his article, Pence states that \"the ultimate goal of life is to maximize happiness\" (p. 2). He then goes on to say that \"there can be no question about the moral wrongness of destroying human beings\" (p. 3), which implies that he believes that cloning would be morally wrong.\n\nPence also uses consequentialist arguments to argue that cloning could cause harm to individuals and society as a whole. For example, he argues that cloning could lead to unintended consequences such as genetic defects or diseases, which could harm individuals and society. Additionally, he suggests that cloning could have negative effects on the economy, as it could increase healthcare costs due to the need to treat potential genetic defects or diseases.\n\nOverall, Pence's main objective in his article is to use consequentialist arguments to show that cloning is immoral because it could cause harm to individuals and society."
