Carnegie's ruthless business practices were causing him to lose touch with his working-class origins.\n\nThe cartoon depicts Carnegie standing amidst piles of money while looking away, symbolizing how he may be neglecting his responsibility to those who worked for him. This could represent a critique of his business ethics, where he may have been willing to sacrifice the well-being of his workers for personal gain, rather than maintaining a connection with his working-class roots."
