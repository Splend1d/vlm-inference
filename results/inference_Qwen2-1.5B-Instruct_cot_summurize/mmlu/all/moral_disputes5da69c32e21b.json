Additionally, cloned individuals may face scrutiny from others who view them as an extension of their clone's identity or personality, leading to potential conflicts and misunderstandings. Therefore, it is important for cloned individuals to have support systems and resources available to help navigate these challenges and maintain their sense of self."
