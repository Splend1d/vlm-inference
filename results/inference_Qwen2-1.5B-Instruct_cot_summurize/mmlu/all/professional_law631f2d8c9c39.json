He has run up debts that he did not tell her about, and so he uses his interest in the property to secretly get a mortgage from the bank. When he dies, the bank attempts to execute on the mortgage. Can it do so? Apply the majority view on this issue.\n\nA. No, the mortgage lien could not destroy the joint tenancy, and when the partner dies, the property passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.\nB. No, although the mortgage destroyed the joint tenancy, the bank has to get a deed of trust in order to execute on jointly owned property.\nC. Yes, the bank got title to the property by virtue of the mortgage, which destroyed the joint tenancy, and it can execute on its lien.\nD. Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.\n"

Yes, the mortgage was the equivalent of a deed of trust and the joint tenancy was severed by the mortgage lien, giving the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage.\n\nIn a lien theory state, if a person holds an interest in real property (such as a mortgage or lien) without any right of survivorship, the property will pass to the surviving joint tenant upon the death of the original joint tenant. In this case, the man who took out the mortgage used his interest in the property to secretly obtain a mortgage from the bank. This act severed their joint tenancy and gave the bank unfettered legal authority to execute on its mortgage, even though the property remains held by the deceased man's estate.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer."
