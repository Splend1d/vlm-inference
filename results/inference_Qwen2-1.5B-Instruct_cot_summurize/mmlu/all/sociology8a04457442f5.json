The 11+ examination is an entrance exam administered by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to determine which students should be admitted to these schools based on their academic performance.\n\nWhile there may be some schools that are not part of the tripartite system due to various reasons such as lack of facilities or resources, the majority of schools fall under one of the categories mentioned - Grammar Schools, Technical Colleges, and Secondary Modern Schools.\n\nThese schools provide a more specialized education, with a focus on subjects like science, technology, engineering, mathematics, arts, and humanities. They also tend to have higher academic standards compared to other types of schools in Singapore. Therefore, it is common for students who perform well in the 11+ exam to be admitted to these schools rather than the mainstream public schools."
