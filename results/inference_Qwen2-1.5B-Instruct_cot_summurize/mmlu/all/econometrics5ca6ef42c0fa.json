This is because multicollinearity refers to the situation where two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other, which can lead to inflated variance and bias in the OLS estimators. As a result, the OLS estimators may become inefficient as the sample size increases, even if they remain consistent. In this case, it is important to consider alternative regression techniques that can handle multicollinearity more effectively, such as ridge regression or lasso regularization."
