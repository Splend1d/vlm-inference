Increases, Decreases.\n\nIf Dawn Corp. had allocated the unfavorable labor rate variance and the unfavorable labor efficiency variance to work in process finished goods and cost of goods sold instead, it would result in higher costs being recorded for those items, which could lead to lower gross profit margins. This would result in a higher contribution margin percentage and potentially increase net income (income from operations) as well as reduce the amount of work in process inventory that needs to be carried through to cost of goods sold. However, this would also decrease the current ratio because there would be less working capital available to cover short-term liabilities such as accounts payable."
