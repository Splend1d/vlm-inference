John's duty to return to Mary that car that he borrowed from her.\n\nThis is because a right to goods and services typically refers to the ability to receive or demand something in exchange for payment, such as a car or a service. Therefore, when John borrows Mary's car without returning it, he is violating his duty to Mary by failing to fulfill his obligation to return the car to her.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a duty to allow someone to pursue their goals does not necessarily involve a right to goods or services. \n\nOption C is also incorrect because a duty to not harm someone involves a prohibition on causing them physical harm, which is different than a duty to return goods or services.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because a duty to not commit suicide is a moral or legal obligation, rather than a duty to provide goods or services."
