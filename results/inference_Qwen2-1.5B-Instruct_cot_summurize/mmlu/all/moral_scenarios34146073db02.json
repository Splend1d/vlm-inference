This action is generally considered harmless and non-moral wrong. It does not involve any harm or wrongdoing towards others.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is using their computer graphics skills to create a custom report card that they present to their widowed mother. While this could potentially be seen as manipulative if the report card is not accurate or meaningful, the main character's intentions were likely altruistic and to make their mother happy. The act of creating the report card and presenting it to her may also be seen as a form of love and care for her. Therefore, while there may be some moral considerations involved, it is not necessarily a clear case of \"wrong\" based solely on the actions described."
