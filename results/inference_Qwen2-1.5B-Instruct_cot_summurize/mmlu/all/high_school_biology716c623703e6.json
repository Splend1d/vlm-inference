This would make option C (it requires relatively high parental care of offspring) unlikely.\n\nOption A (It lives in a newly colonized habitat) is also less likely because organisms with relatively short lifespans tend to be more adaptable and able to move to new habitats as they evolve.\n\nOption B (It is an aquatic organism) is less likely than option C because aquatic organisms typically have shorter lifespans due to their limited mobility and the need for water resources.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, option D (the age at which the offspring themselves can give birth is relatively young) is the most likely answer."
