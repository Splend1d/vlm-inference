The statement in the passage indicates that President George Herbert Walker Bush's vision of a \"new world order\" was made possible by the end of the Cold War. This was because the end of the Cold War led to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, which had been the ideological and military foundation of the Cold War. This change in power dynamics created a new partnership of nations and allowed for greater cooperation between countries on issues such as terrorism, justice, and peace."
