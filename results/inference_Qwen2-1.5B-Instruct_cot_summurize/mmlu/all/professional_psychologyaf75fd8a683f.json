Zeigarnik in his 1987 paper \"Remembering and forgetting: The role of experience in memory.\" In this study, Zeigarnik found that people were more likely to remember things they had just learned or experienced rather than those they had already forgotten. He also found that people were more likely to remember things that were difficult for them to do or understand, while they were less likely to remember things that were easy for them to do or understand. So, option A (we tend to remember unfinished tasks better than finished ones) is correct."
