Promoting improvements in the education of the population.\n\nEconomic growth can be achieved through various policies, but promoting improvements in the education of the population is one of the most effective ways to achieve sustained economic growth in the long term. Education is crucial for developing skills and knowledge that are necessary for innovation and productivity, which are key drivers of economic growth. Additionally, investing in education can lead to higher levels of human capital, which can improve overall productivity and reduce poverty rates over time. \n\nWhile other policies such as imposing tariffs or placing taxes on savings may have short-term effects, they do not necessarily promote long-term economic growth. Similarly, increasing government spending can also provide short-term benefits, but it does not address underlying structural issues that may hinder economic growth. Therefore, promoting improvements in the education of the population is the most likely policy to bring about economic growth in the long run."
