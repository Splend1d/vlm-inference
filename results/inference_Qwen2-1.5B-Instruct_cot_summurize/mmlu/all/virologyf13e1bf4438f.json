The virus enters the mother's bloodstream through the placenta, where it can damage the developing fetus and cause serious complications such as congenital heart defects, deafness, blindness, and mental retardation.\n\nThe exact mechanism by which rubella causes foetal abnormalities is not fully understood, but research suggests that the virus may cross the placenta and enter the fetal blood stream, causing inflammation and damage to the developing organs and tissues. In addition, the virus may induce cytokines and chemokines in the mother, which can affect the immune response to the fetus and increase the risk of birth defects.\n\nOverall, the transmission of rubella during pregnancy is considered a significant public health concern, and vaccination campaigns have been implemented to prevent the disease and reduce the risk of adverse outcomes for both mothers and fetuses."
