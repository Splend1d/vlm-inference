The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase. \n\nIn a Classical economy, where aggregate demand is assumed to be perfectly elastic, changes in aggregate demand lead to proportional changes in both the price level and quantity of output. This is because the price level adjusts immediately without any lag time due to transaction costs or inventory holding periods. Similarly, the quantity of output adjusts proportionally with changes in aggregate demand as well. Therefore, if aggregate demand shifts to the right, it leads to an increase in both the price level and quantity of output."
