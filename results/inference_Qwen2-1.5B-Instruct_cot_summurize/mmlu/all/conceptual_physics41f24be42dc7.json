Increase.\n\nWhen an object approaches at a faster speed, it is moving towards your eyes more quickly, causing your brain to perceive the flash of light as occurring closer together in time. This results in a higher perceived frequency or rate of flashing lights. Therefore, if the frequency of the flashes increases as the light source approaches, it would be due to the increased speed and proximity of the object."
