Asking students to determine how many one-liter bottles of water can fill a one-gallon container\n\nThis activity involves comparing and converting between different units of volume, which is an important skill for understanding and using non-standard units of measurement. By asking students to compare the volumes of various liquids, they can learn about the relationship between liters and gallons and develop their understanding of non-standard units of measurement."
