Non-enveloped with an icosahedral structure. \n\nTogaviruses are a group of negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that have a non-enveloped shape and an icosahedral (5-sided) viral capsid. The capsid consists of 20 spherical, lipid-rich domains arranged in a icosahedral arrangement, which gives the virus its characteristic \"ball-and-stick\" shape. The capsid is surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer, which helps to stabilize the virus and protect it from environmental stresses. Togaviruses can be either enveloped or non-enveloped, but most togaviruses are non-enveloped."
