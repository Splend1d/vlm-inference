However, since the question asks for the remainder when dividing by 8, we need to look at the last digit of the quotient (15 in this case) and determine if it is greater than or less than 8.\n\nIn this case, the last digit is 5, which means that 15 divided by 8 has a remainder of 7. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 15 remainder 7."
