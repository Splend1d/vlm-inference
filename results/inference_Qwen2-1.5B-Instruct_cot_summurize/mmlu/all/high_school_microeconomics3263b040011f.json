In such a case, the monopolist will earn a positive profit because they are able to sell their product at a price above the marginal cost.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the monopolist will not necessarily break even if the government sets the output level at the allocative efficient quantity. Option B is also incorrect because the monopolist will not incur an economic loss if they are producing at the allocative efficient quantity. Option D is incorrect because there may be no deadweight loss in a perfectly competitive market where the monopolist has entered the market voluntarily.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
