However, if you need to choose between them, it depends on the specific problem you're trying to solve.\n\nRidge regression is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function during training, which helps in reducing overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. It's useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where there might be redundant or irrelevant features.\n\nLasso regression, on the other hand, is another type of regularization technique used for feature selection. It works by adding an L1 penalty term to the loss function, encouraging sparsity in the coefficients. This means it selects only certain features, thereby reducing the number of variables while still maintaining some predictive power.\n\nIn summary, both ridge and lasso regression can be effective for feature selection depending on your dataset, the complexity of your model, and the trade-off you want to make between bias and variance."
