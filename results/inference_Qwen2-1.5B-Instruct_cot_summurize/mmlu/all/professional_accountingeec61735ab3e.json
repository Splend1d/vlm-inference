                    "text": "To find out how many DVD players need to be sold for the company to break even, we can use the following formula:\n\nBreak-even point = Fixed Costs / (Unit Variable Cost - Unit Variable Profit)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the profit from each type of product:\n\n- For DVD players: Revenue - Variable Cost = $600 - ($160 * x) where x is the number of DVD players sold.\n- For home entertainment systems: Revenue - Variable Cost = $600 - ($460 * y) where y is the number of home entertainment systems sold.\n\nThe total revenue is the sum of the revenue from both types of products, minus the total variable costs (which includes the fixed costs).\n\nLet's assume x + y equals the total number of units sold, which means that the equation for the total revenue becomes:\n\nTotal Revenue = (x + y) * (Price per unit)\n= (x + y) * ($600 - ($160 * x)) or (x + y) * ($600 - ($460 * y))\n\nThe total variable cost is the sum of the variable costs for both types of products:\n\nTotal Variable Cost = ($160 * x) + ($460 * y)\n\nThe total fixed costs are given as $90,000.\n\nNow, we solve for x + y in terms of the total revenue:\n\n(x + y) * ($600 - ($160 * x)) - ($160 * x) - ($460 * y) - $90,000 = 0\n\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\n600x - 160x^2 - 160y - 460y = -90000\n\nFactor out the common term x:\n\nx(600 - 160x - 460 - 460y) = -90000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx(1040 - 160x - 460y) = -90000\n\nDivide through by -1040:\n\nx(1040 - 160x - 460y) = 90000\n\nMultiply through by -1:\n\n-1040x + 160x^2 + 460xy = -90000\n\nRearrange into standard form:\n\n160x^2 + 460xy + 1040x - 90000 = 0\n\nWe're looking for integer solutions since x represents the number of DVDs sold, which must be an integer. Let's try different values for x starting with 1 until we find a solution that satisfies all conditions.\n\nFor x = 1:\n\n160(1)^2 + 460(1)(1) + 1040(1) - 90000 = 0\n\nThis does not equal zero, so we continue trying other values.\n\nFor x = 2:\n\n160(2)^2 + 460(2)(2) + 1040(2) - 90000 = 0\n\nThis also does not equal zero, indicating our approach needs to be refined further.\n\nAfter testing several values, we find that when x = 800, the equation balances out perfectly:\n\n160(800)^2 + 460(800)(800) + 1040(800) - 90000 = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n6480,000 + 33,280,000 + 832,000 - 90000 = 0\n\nAdding these numbers together gives:\n\n7480,220 - 90000 = 0\n\nTherefore, x = 800 is the value that makes the equation true. This means the company needs to sell 800 DVD players to break even.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 500."
