Total revenues from production are equal to the sum of explicit and implicit costs.\n\nWhen a firm is producing a good and making a normal profit, it means that the revenue generated from selling the product exceeds its explicit costs (which include both fixed and variable costs). Therefore, the total revenues from production are greater than the sum of explicit and implicit costs.\n\nIt's important to note that in this case, explicit costs refer only to the fixed costs associated with production, while implicit costs may also include some variable costs. However, for the purposes of answering the question, we can assume that all costs are explicit."
