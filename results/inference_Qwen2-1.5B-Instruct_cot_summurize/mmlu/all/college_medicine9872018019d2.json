MERRF results from a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that impairs protein synthesis, oxygen consumption, and energy production. When an affected male and a normal female reproduce, which of the following best predicts the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring?\n\nA. None of the offspring will be affected\nB. All males and no females will be affected\nC. Half of males and half of females will be affected\nD. One-fourth of the offspring will be affected\n"

In this case, since both parents are carriers of the recessive allele for MERRF, their offspring have a 25% chance of being homozygous recessive (aa), 50% chance of being heterozygous (Aa or aa), and 25% chance of being homozygous dominant (AA).\n\n- Heterozygous individuals (Aa): There would be an equal number of males and females who are not affected by MERRF.\n- Homozygous recessive individuals (aa): There would be only one affected male.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio of the offspring in a population with MERRF is:\n\n1/4 (affected males) + 1/4 (affected females) = 1/2\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. One-fourth of the offspring will be affected."
