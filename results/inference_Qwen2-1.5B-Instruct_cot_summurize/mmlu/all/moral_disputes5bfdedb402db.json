However, I can provide an answer based on general knowledge and ethical principles.\n\nThe death penalty is not compatible with the right to life or the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment set forth by the United States Constitution. The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution specifically prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" which includes the death penalty. Therefore, according to the law, the death penalty is unconstitutional.\n\nVan den Haag's argument for the death penalty, if presented without any evidence or reasoning supporting it, would not necessarily be considered morally impermissible under ordinary moral standards. However, if Van den Haag had provided specific reasons why he believes the death penalty is justified, such as compelling evidence of serious crimes, then his arguments might be more ethically defensible. \n\nIn summary, while the death penalty may be morally permissible in certain circumstances, it is inherently inconsistent with the fundamental rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, including the right to life and the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. It is therefore generally considered to be morally impermissible.\n\nAs for whether these arguments should be accepted, they would depend on the specific context and evidence presented. In some cases, where strong evidence supports the death penalty, it may be argued that the benefits outweigh the potential harm caused by executing someone who has committed a heinous crime. However, this is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and evaluation, and cannot simply be dismissed based on general principles of morality."
