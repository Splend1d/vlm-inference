Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, spending the rent money at the casino goes against ordinary moral standards because it involves using someone else's property for personal gain without their consent or permission. In scenario 2, driving above the speed limit to defuse a bomb is not inherently wrong, but it may be seen as reckless or dangerous behavior that could have negative consequences if not done properly. However, this is a specific situation and there are different opinions on what constitutes right and wrong based on individual values and beliefs."
