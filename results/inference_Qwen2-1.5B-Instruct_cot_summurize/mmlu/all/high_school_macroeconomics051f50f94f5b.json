This approach can help stimulate economic growth by increasing aggregate demand, which can help reduce the inflationary gap.\n\nOn the other hand, decreasing taxes without changing spending would lead to reduced investment and consumption, potentially worsening the inflationary gap. Similarly, decreasing spending without changing taxes would also exacerbate the problem of reducing demand, leading to higher prices and slower economic growth.\n\nTherefore, option C (increasing spending matched with an increase in taxes) is not recommended because it combines two opposite fiscal measures that could worsen the situation. Option B (increasing spending and keeping taxes unchanged) is also less preferable due to the risk of increased inflation. Option D (decreasing taxes and decreasing spending) would also not be ideal as it would reduce demand further and might lead to even higher inflation."
