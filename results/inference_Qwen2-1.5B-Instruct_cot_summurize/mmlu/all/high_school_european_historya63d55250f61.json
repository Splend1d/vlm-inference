Governments did little to address problems of industrialization before 1850.\n\nThe Luddites were a group of textile workers who protested against the introduction of machinery into their industry, leading to widespread destruction of machines. This was a reaction to what was perceived as a threat to their livelihoods and way of life. Before 1850, governments tended to view industrialization more positively, supporting technological progress and economic growth rather than addressing concerns over worker displacement and social disruption. The Luddites' protests were part of a broader movement against industrialization that had been building up since the early 18th century."
