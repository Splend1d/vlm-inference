Therefore, the correct answer is A. includes structural and frictional unemployment. This means that the natural rate of unemployment accounts for both the long-term trend of unemployment due to changes in the economy (structural unemployment) and the short-term fluctuations caused by factors such as job search activity (frictional unemployment)."
