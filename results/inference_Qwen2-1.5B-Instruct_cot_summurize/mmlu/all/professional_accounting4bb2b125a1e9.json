If the exercise price is greater than the market price, it means that the warrant has intrinsic value because it can be exercised for a profit.\n\nIn this case, the exercise price ($20) is higher than the market price ($30), so there is intrinsic value in the warrant. Therefore, the theoretical value of the warrant would be the difference between the exercise price and the market price, which is $30 - $20 = $10.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. $10."
