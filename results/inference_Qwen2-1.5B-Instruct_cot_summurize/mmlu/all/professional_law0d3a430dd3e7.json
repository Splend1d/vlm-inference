After the meeting, she was injured in the building's elevator as it suddenly fell and crashed to the basement from the third floor. She sued the building's owner, but at trial the only evidence she had regarding the issue of negligence was that she was in the elevator when it malfunctioned. Will the trial judge dismiss the case as a matter of law without letting it go to the jury?\n\nA. Yes, because the injured person always has the affirmative burden of proving negligence.\nB. Yes, because it cannot be presumed that the building owner was negligent.\nC. No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\nD. Yes, because the woman assumed the risk when she decided to use an obviously dangerous instrumentality.\n"

No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\n\nWhen a building owner fails to take reasonable steps to ensure that their property is safe, even if there is no direct negligence on their part, they may still be held liable for injuries caused by the misuse or neglect of the property by others. This principle is known as vicarious liability, which holds a principal responsible for the actions of an agent who commits tortious acts within the scope of their employment. In this case, the injured party did not have any direct involvement with the accident; rather, the elevator malfunction occurred due to faulty maintenance or design. Therefore, the owner would likely be held liable for the injuries sustained during the incident."
