He was known for his wisdom and virtue, and he is often cited as an example of what a great leader should be. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would shun politics or avoid involvement in political matters. \n\nOn the other hand, A, B, and D all refer to individuals who were influential in Chinese history and were associated with various schools of thought, but none of them have been mentioned as having avoided politics or shunned it."
