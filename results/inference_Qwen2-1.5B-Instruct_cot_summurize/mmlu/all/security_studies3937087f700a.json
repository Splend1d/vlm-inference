Although the subject of vocal opposition by campaigners, gun shows employ strict legal restrictions on participants, ensuring that those with criminal records are not able to purchase weapons.\nB. Gun shows are regulated to ensure that weapons purchased legally cannot be resold on the black or grey markets.\nC. Gun shows and arms fairs do not contribute in a significant way to the trade in illicit arms.\nD. Gun shows and arms fairs often do not require participants to undergo security checks before purchasing weapons, and encourage an environment where more attention is paid to price tags than details about where weapons will be distributed or used.\n"

Gun shows and arms fairs often do not require participants to undergo security checks before purchasing weapons, and encourage an environment where more attention is paid to price tags than details about where weapons will be distributed or used. This can lead to illegal weapons being sold at these events, as buyers may be unaware of the origins or legality of the weapons they are purchasing.\n\nAdditionally, gun shows and arms fairs can also facilitate the flow of arms across borders, which can contribute to the trafficking of illicit weapons. By providing a marketplace for arms dealers and smugglers to operate, these events can create opportunities for organized crime groups to sell guns to customers who are looking for easy access to weapons.\n\nOverall, while gun shows and arms fairs can play a role in promoting lawful firearms sales, it's important to recognize their potential contribution to the illegal arms market."
