This can cause businesses and consumers to hold off on borrowing, leading to lower economic activity overall. As a result, interest rates tend to rise as central banks try to combat inflation or stimulate growth through monetary policies such as lowering interest rates.\n\nOn the other hand, when the economy is growing rapidly and the unemployment rate is low, contractionary fiscal policy can help reduce inflation by encouraging savings over spending. This can make the dollar more attractive to investors outside of the United States, as they perceive it as having less purchasing power than before. In this scenario, the dollar would appreciate due to its relative strength compared to other currencies. However, if the economy slows down again, the opposite effect could occur, with the dollar depreciating as the country's currency becomes more expensive to import goods from elsewhere."
