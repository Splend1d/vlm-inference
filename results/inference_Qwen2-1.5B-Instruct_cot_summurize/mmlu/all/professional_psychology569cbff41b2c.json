Should Continue Seeing Wayne in Therapy But With His Permission Contact the Police to Discuss the Threat.\n\nIt is important for mental health professionals to take threats of violence seriously and consider all possible actions to ensure the safety of themselves and others. In this case, it is reasonable for Dr. Pannicli to continue seeing Wayne in therapy and asking him to bring his partner to the next session to discuss the situation. However, it is also important to take action if the threat is deemed to be serious enough to warrant intervention by law enforcement. Therefore, Dr. Pannicli should contact the police to discuss the threat and determine the appropriate course of action."
