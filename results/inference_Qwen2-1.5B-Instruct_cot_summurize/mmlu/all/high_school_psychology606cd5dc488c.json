According to Whorf's linguistic relativity hypothesis, the structure of a language can influence the way people think and behave. Specifically, it suggests that the structure of a language affects the way words are used in sentences, which in turn influences the way ideas and concepts are expressed and understood. This has been observed across different languages and cultures, indicating that language plays a significant role in shaping human thought and behavior."
