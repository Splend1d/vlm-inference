When an individual performs an action such as walking or reaching out to grab something, the signals from the primary motor cortex travel through the spinal cord and then down to the muscles involved in that movement. This results in bilateral (on both sides) contraction of the muscles in the limb being used for the action, which can either be on the same side (ipsilateral) if the person is standing still, or on the opposite side (contralateral) if they are performing a lateral movement like reaching out."
