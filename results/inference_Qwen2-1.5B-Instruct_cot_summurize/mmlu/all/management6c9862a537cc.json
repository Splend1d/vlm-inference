                    "text": "The statement \"There is no discernible link between planning and performance\" suggests that there may be some confusion or misunderstanding about the relationship between planning and performance in business management. This could potentially apply to any of the individuals listed, but it would likely be more appropriate for someone who specializes in business strategy and organizational design rather than someone who focuses on financial analysis or market trends.\nOut of the options provided, Michael Porter is a business strategist who has written extensively on the importance of understanding the external environment (e.g., economic, social, technological, political) when developing strategic plans. However, he does not specifically focus on the link between planning and performance, so his perspective might not directly address the statement at hand.\nMilton Friedman is an economist who is often associated with the idea of \"laissez-faire\" economics, which emphasizes minimal government intervention in the economy. While Friedman's work has been influential in shaping modern economic thinking, his views on the role of government in managing businesses and markets are complex and nuanced, and do not necessarily align with the statement at hand.\nGary Hamel is an organizational theorist who has written extensively on the concept of \"strategic agility,\" which involves being able to adapt quickly to changes in the external environment. While Hamel's ideas have influenced many organizations, including those in the business world, his work does not focus exclusively on the link between planning and performance.\nHenry Mintzberg is an organizational theorist who has studied the structure and function of organizations, as well as their relationships with customers and other stakeholders. He has written extensively on the concept of \"organizational architecture,\" which refers to how an organization is structured and organized internally. While Mintzberg's work has had a significant impact on organizational theory, his focus is primarily on the internal structures and functions of organizations, rather than the link between planning and performance.\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is most likely that the individual who holds this position is Milton Friedman, as he is known for his views on the role of government in managing businesses and markets, which do not necessarily align with the statement at hand."
