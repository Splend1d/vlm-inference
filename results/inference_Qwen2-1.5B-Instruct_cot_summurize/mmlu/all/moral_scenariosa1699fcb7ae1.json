However, scenario 1 involves a situation where the main character intentionally hid information from someone else, which is generally not considered morally wrong unless it causes harm or violates trust. Scenario 2 involves an action that could potentially cause harm if not done carefully, but it is still not necessarily morally wrong. Therefore, both scenarios could be seen as having some level of moral wrongness depending on the specific circumstances and intentions behind each action."
