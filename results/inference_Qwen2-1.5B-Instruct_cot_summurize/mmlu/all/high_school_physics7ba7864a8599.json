                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred.\n\nExplanation:\nIn a cyclic process, there are two types of work: work done against the pressure (isobaric) and work done against the temperature (isothermal). According to the first law of thermodynamics, work can be expressed as the difference between the work done against the pressure and the work done against the temperature. Therefore, if we consider only the work done against the pressure, the net work done during the cycle would be zero because it's equal to the work done against the temperature. However, this does not necessarily mean that the net amount of heat transferred is also zero.\n\nFor example, if the isothermal step involves the gas undergoing a reversible expansion at constant volume, the gas will do negative work on its surroundings due to the increase in volume. This negative work is exactly balanced by the work done by the gas against the pressure in the isobaric step. Therefore, the net work done during the cycle is not equal to zero, and the net amount of heat transferred is not necessarily zero either. In fact, for many processes, the net amount of heat transferred is negative because the surroundings absorb heat from the gas.\n\nSo, option D is the correct answer, which states that the total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred."
