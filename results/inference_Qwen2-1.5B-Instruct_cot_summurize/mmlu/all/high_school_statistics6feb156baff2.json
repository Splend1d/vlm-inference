This increase in data can help reduce the uncertainty associated with the estimate, which means that the interval around the estimated value will become narrower.\n\nTo calculate the new standard error (which represents the variability of the estimate) when the sample size is increased, we use the formula:\n\nSE_new = SE_old / sqrt(n)\n\nwhere:\n- SE_new is the new standard error,\n- SE_old is the old standard error,\n- n is the new sample size.\n\nMultiplying the old standard error by 1.732 (approximately) gives us an idea of what the new interval would look like if we were to use this larger sample size. So, the interval becomes wider, but it's still centered around the true population parameter."
