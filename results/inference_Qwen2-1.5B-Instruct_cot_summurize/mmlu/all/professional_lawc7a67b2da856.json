Tomato growers in a second state wish to ship tomatoes for sale into the first state but its tomatoes are in compliance only with the federal standards. The tomato growers' association in the second state brought an injunctive action in federal court against the agricultural department of the first state to enjoin enforcement of the genetic engineering rule on the basis of federal preemption. According to U.S. Supreme Court precedent, how will the courts decide the preemption claim?\n\nA. There is no preemption because the first state's law does not contradict the federal law and both laws could be complied with simultaneously.\nB. The injunction will be granted because tomatoes that are in compliance with federal law never have to be approved also under a state law.\nC. When it comes to fresh produce, federal laws will always preempt state laws, and the injunction will be granted for that reason.\nD. The first state's law sets standards that interfere impermissibly with the second state's law and therefore the first state's law is preempted.\n"

The first state's law sets standards that interfere impermissibly with the second state's law and therefore the first state's law is preempted.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court precedent holds that when federal laws are applicable to a particular issue, those laws generally take precedence over conflicting state laws. In this case, the federal government has established standards for the sale and transportation of tomatoes, which do not include genetic engineering factors. Therefore, if a state law conflicts with these federal standards, that state law is preempted by the federal law.\n\nIn conclusion, the courts will likely find that the first state's law is preempted by the federal law, and the tomato growers' association in the second state can bring an injunction against the agricultural department of the first state to prevent enforcement of the genetic engineering rule on the basis of federal preemption."
