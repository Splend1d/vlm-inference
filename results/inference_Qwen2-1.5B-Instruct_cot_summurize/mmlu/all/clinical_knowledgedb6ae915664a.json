A large goitre can cause compression of the trachea, which can lead to hoarseness and difficulty speaking. This is known as trachal compression syndrome. The other options are not necessarily true:\n\n- Compression of the esophagus does cause stridor, but this is less common with a large goitre.\n- Dysphagia is not always an indication for surgery; some patients may prefer to manage their condition without surgery.\n- The severity of thyrotoxicosis can vary depending on the size and location of the goitre, but a larger goitre is generally associated with more severe symptoms."
