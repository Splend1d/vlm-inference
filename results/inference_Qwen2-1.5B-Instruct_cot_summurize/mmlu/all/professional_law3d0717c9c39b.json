Inadmissible, because character evidence may not be introduced in this manner.\n\nThe rule against introducing character evidence is known as the \"spousal privilege,\" which states that spouses are immune from testifying about each other's conduct. However, if the spouse is called to testify about conduct that occurred outside the marriage or if the testimony involves matters unrelated to the relationship between the spouses, then the privilege does not apply.\n\nIn this case, the defendant's ex-wife testified about her experience with the defendant during their marriage, which would fall under the category of unrelated conduct. Therefore, the testimony cannot be used to impeach the defendant's character for truthfulness, which is relevant to the crime charged.\n\nAdditionally, calling a spouse to testify about conduct unrelated to the marriage can create an appearance of bias and undermine the credibility of the witness. This can lead to a miscarriage of justice if the witness is perceived as biased or unreliable.\n\nTherefore, the testimony should be ruled inadmissible."
