Household Responsibilities\n\nFeminist therapy focuses on addressing gendered roles and expectations that may impact an individual's sense of self-worth, identity, and autonomy. In this context, household responsibilities such as cooking, cleaning, and caring for children can be seen as examples of how societal expectations can limit individuals' ability to express themselves freely and pursue personal goals.\n\nSelf-in-relation is about understanding one's own thoughts, feelings, and experiences from a relational perspective, which can include examining how different relationships (including familial ones) have shaped one's sense of self. However, it does not specifically address the issue of household responsibilities.\n\nEmpowerment therapy aims to empower individuals by helping them recognize and challenge negative beliefs and behaviors that prevent them from achieving their full potential. It is not focused on specific aspects of feminist therapy but rather broadens the scope of treatment to include both emotional and social factors.\n\nHousehold responsibilities refer more directly to the issue at hand, as they involve the role of men and women within domestic settings and the ways in which these roles can affect individuals' sense of identity and agency."
