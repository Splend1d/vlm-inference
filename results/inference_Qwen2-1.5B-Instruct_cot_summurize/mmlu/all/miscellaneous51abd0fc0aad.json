III and IV only.\n\nElectric fences are typically designed to be high enough that they cannot be jumped over by adult animals, but low enough for smaller animals like cattle or sheep to cross. Therefore, an electric fence would need to be at least 18 inches tall to prevent mature cattle from jumping over it, while still being low enough for sheep to safely cross.\n\nIt's important to note that the exact height required will depend on various factors such as the specific species of animal being kept, the size of the field, and the desired level of protection against trespassing. It's always best to consult with experts in the field of livestock management and fencing design to determine the appropriate height for your specific situation."
