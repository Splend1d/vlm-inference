She delivered her first child spontaneously at 34 weeks' gestation; pregnancy was complicated by iron deficiency anemia. She has no other history of serious illness. Her blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Examination shows no abnormalities. Ultrasonography shows a dichorionic-diamniotic twin intrauterine pregnancy consistent in size with an 8-week gestation. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?\n\nA. Abruptio placentae\nB. Fetal chromosome abnormality\nC. Hyperthyroidism\nD. Preterm labor and delivery\n"

Additionally, her blood pressure being normal at 100/70 mm Hg may indicate that the placenta is functioning well, further supporting the diagnosis of preterm labor. The ultrasound result also confirms that the fetus is growing normally, suggesting that there is no fetal chromosomal abnormality. However, the presence of twins at this stage increases the risk of complications such as preterm labor and delivery. Therefore, option D (preterm labor and delivery) is the correct answer."
