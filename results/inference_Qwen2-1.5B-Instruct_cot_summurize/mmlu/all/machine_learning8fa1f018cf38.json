It was designed to analyze text from movies and books in order to measure sentiment.\n\nStatement 2 is true because the Penn Treebank has indeed been used for language modeling. The Penn Treebank is a large collection of annotated texts that includes sentences from various domains such as news articles, web pages, scientific papers, and more. It has been widely used in natural language processing research for tasks like language modeling, machine translation, and information extraction."
