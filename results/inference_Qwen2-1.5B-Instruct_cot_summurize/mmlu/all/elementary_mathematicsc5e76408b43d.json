To find the tip, multiply the cost of the meal (before the tip) by the tip percentage (20%).\n\nTip = Cost of Meal Before Tip \u00d7 Tip Percentage\nTip = $44 \u00d7 20%\nTip = $44 \u00d7 0.20\nTip = $8.80\n\nNow, add the tip to the cost of the meal to get the total amount spent on lunch.\n\nTotal Amount Spent = Cost of Meal + Tip\nTotal Amount Spent = $44 + $8.80\nTotal Amount Spent = $52.80\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $52.80."
