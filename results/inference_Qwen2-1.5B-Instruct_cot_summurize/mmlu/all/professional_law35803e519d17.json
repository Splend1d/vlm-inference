At the hospital she refused the transfusion because of religious beliefs. She died shortly thereafter. The physician verified that the patient would have fully recovered if she had agreed to treatment. What damages can the pedestrian's estate collect from the driver of the car?\n\nA. All damages for wrongful death because it is foreseeable that this kind of negligence could injure someone who will not accept treatment for religious reasons.\nB. No damages, because the pedestrian's wrongdoing in not accepting treatment was the sole cause for her death.\nC. Damages for the wound and the pain and suffering up to the point that she refused the transfusion.\nD. No damages, because the pedestrian's refusal of treatment constitutes contributory negligence.\n"

However, the doctrine requires that the injury must occur as a result of the defendant's negligence, which means that the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's actions were the actual cause of the injury.\n\nIn this case, the driver of the car was negligent in hitting the pedestrian, causing an open wound on her body. This act occurred as a result of the driver's negligence, but whether or not the pedestrian's refusal to receive a blood transfusion was a proximate cause of her death is unclear. Without further evidence, it is possible that the driver could still be held liable for the pedestrian's death under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, but the exact extent of their liability would depend on the specific facts of the case."
