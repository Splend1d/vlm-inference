Punishments are used with nonhuman animals, and negative reinforcements are used with humans.\nB. Negative reinforcements are used in classical conditioning, and punishments are used in operant conditioning.\nC. Punishments are primarily used when training an organism to perform a behavior and negative reinforcements are used to train an organism to stop performing a behavior.\nD. Punishments decrease the frequency of a behavior and negative reinforcements increase the frequency of a behavior.\n"

                    "text": "The major difference between negative reinforcement and punishment is that negative reinforcement involves increasing the likelihood of a behavior being repeated by removing an unpleasant stimulus or providing a desirable stimulus as a reward, while punishment involves decreasing the likelihood of a behavior being repeated by introducing an unpleasant stimulus or withholding a desirable stimulus.\n\nNegative reinforcement and positive reinforcement are two types of shaping techniques used in behavior modification, but they differ in their focus on the behavior rather than the motivation of the organism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Punishments decrease the frequency of a behavior and negative reinforcements increase the frequency of a behavior."
