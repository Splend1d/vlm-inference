In this case, we're comparing the growth rate of different functions.\n\nOption A (O(1)) would be constant time, meaning it doesn't change based on the input size.\nOption B (O(n)) would grow linearly with respect to the input size, so it's faster than all other options but slower than O(log n).\nOption C (O(n^2)) grows quadratically with respect to the input size, which means it's slower than O(n) and faster than O(log n).\nOption D (O(log n)) grows logarithmically with respect to the input size, making it the fastest growing option compared to the others.\n\nTherefore, the largest asymptotic order is O(log n)."
