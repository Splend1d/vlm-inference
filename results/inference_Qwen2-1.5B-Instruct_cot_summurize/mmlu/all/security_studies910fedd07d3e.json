Resilience refers to the ability of an IT system to identify and defend against a cyber-security threat.\nB. The only way to build a truly resilient IT system is to ensure that it can repel all types of threat and remain and avoid attack.\nC. Resilience in an IT system refers to its ability to function when there are no threats to its security.\nD. Resilience refers to the ability of IT systems to recover from attack.\n"

It refers to the system's ability to recover quickly after an attack or breach, prevent further damage, and mitigate the impact of any data loss or theft. \n\nBuilding a truly resilient IT system involves implementing measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption, access controls, and regular backups to protect against various types of attacks. These measures help to detect and respond to potential threats before they cause significant harm to the system or organization. By maintaining a high level of resilience, organizations can minimize the risk of a successful attack and protect their assets from financial losses and reputational damage."
