One example is serum methylmalonic acid as a biochemical functional index for vitamin B12 status. What is the primary aim of such biochemical functional index measurements?\n\n\nA. To achieve a better estimate of the dietary intake of the micronutrient.\nB. To overcome interference, eg by acute phase-linked effects.\nC. To correct for nutrient losses, e.g. through urinary excretion.\nD. To provide an additional status estimate that can probe critical tissue adequacy, and hence the risk of consequent clinical disease or physiological malfunction.\n"

This approach helps to overcome interference from acute phase-linked effects, nutrient losses due to urinary excretion, and other factors that may affect the measurement of micronutrient status. By incorporating these additional measures, scientists and healthcare providers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's nutritional health and identify potential deficiencies or excesses before they lead to serious health issues."
