This can be done using the modulus operator (%). If the result of dividing the number by 2 has a remainder of 0, then the number is odd; otherwise, it is even.\n\nIn the given code fragment, the condition is checking if the result of dividing num by 2 is equal to 0. This means that the number is odd because any number that is not divisible by 2 with no remainder is odd. \n\nTherefore, option C, (num MOD 2) = 0, is the correct answer."
