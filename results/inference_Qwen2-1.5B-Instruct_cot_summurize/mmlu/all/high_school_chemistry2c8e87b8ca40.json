The Cl2 molecule is much larger than F2 (atomic radius is 99 pm for chlorine and is 64 pm for fluorine). Which is the best reason for the large difference in boiling points?\n\nA. Chlorine has a higher dipole moment than fluorine.\nB. The intramolecular bonds in Cl2 are much weaker than those in F2.\nC. The Cl2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the F2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\nD. The mass of chlorine is much greater than the mass of fluorine.\n"

The Cl2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the F2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\n\nLondon forces are electrostatic interactions between atomic orbitals that are not directly related to the presence or absence of an electric field. They are strongest when the electron density of two atoms is similar, which is what happens in the case of chlorine and fluorine.\n\nTherefore, the large difference in boiling points between chloro\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't provide the information you're looking for."
