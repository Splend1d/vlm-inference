Reaction formation. \n\nReaction formation occurs when an individual unconsciously redirects their negative emotions towards someone else or something outside themselves, rather than dealing with them directly. In this case, Janice's feeling of hostility and contempt towards her husband may be directed at him indirectly through her actions of over-doting on him. This is an example of reaction formation."
