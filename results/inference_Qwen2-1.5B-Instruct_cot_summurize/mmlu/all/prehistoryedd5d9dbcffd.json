Initially, hand axes were simple tools used for butchering animals, chopping wood, and digging. However, as humans learned to control fire, they began to use them for tasks such as cooking food, making weapons, and creating art.\n\nAs humans developed new technologies, such as the wheel and the plow, they also modified their hand axe technology accordingly. For example, the development of the plow required the creation of larger and more durable hand axes that could be used to break up soil and transport heavy loads.\n\nOverall, hand axe technology has undergone significant changes over time, with improvements in tool design and function leading to more advanced tools and techniques."
