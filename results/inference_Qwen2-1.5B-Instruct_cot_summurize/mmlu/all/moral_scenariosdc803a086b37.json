This is because selling illegal drugs is generally considered unethical and goes against societal norms of legality and responsibility. The other scenario, where the main character avoided running over an animal by swerving, does not involve any actions that go against ordinary moral standards. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
