I and III\n\nVirtual memory systems use pages as the smallest units of addressable memory, which means they have a fixed size regardless of the system's actual physical memory capacity. This allows programs to be loaded into memory even when the system has less physical memory available than requested by the program. However, programs must still be resident in main memory during their execution, as this is where the operating system loads and executes them. Additionally, pages contain semantic characteristics of the program, such as code, data, and stack frames, rather than being simply physical addresses."
