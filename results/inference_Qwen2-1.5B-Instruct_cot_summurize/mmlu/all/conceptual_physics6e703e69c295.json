The distance to the star is given as 20 light-years. \n\nTo find out how long it takes for the gravitational wave to travel from the star to Earth, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{20 \\times 1,000,000}{299,792} \\approx 683 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nSince there are 86,400 seconds in an hour and 3,153,600 seconds in a day, we can convert this time into hours or days.\n\n\\[ \\text{Hours} = \\frac{683}{3,153,600} \\approx 0.000224 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Days} = \\frac{683}{86,400} \\approx 0.0078 \\]\n\nSo, the gravitational wave from the star exploding would take about 0.0078 days, which is less than 20 years.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. less than 20 years."
