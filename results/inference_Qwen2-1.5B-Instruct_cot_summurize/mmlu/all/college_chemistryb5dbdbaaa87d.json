This means that the overall concentration of the weak acid in excess is increased. As a result, the equilibrium shifts towards the right, meaning more of the weak acid is converted into its conjugate base, increasing the concentration of the conjugate base. \n\nSince the buffer solution is designed to maintain a constant pH, as the concentration of the conjugate base increases, the concentration of the weak acid must decrease for the system to remain at equilibrium. This causes the pH of the buffer solution to increase.\n\nTherefore, doubling the volume of the buffer solution will have a significant effect on its pH, making it significantly higher than before."
