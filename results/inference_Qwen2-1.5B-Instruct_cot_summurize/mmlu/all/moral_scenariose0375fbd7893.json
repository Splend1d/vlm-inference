This behavior goes against public health guidelines and could potentially put others at risk.\n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 2: Tearing down birthday decorations is not necessarily morally wrong, but it depends on the context and circumstances. If it's done accidentally or out of frustration rather than malicious intent, it might be considered harmless. However, if it's done maliciously or recklessly to cause harm, then it could be seen as morally wrong."
