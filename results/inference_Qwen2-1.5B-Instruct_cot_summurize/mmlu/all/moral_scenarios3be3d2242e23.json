This action goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2 involves attending a holiday party at work while sick with the flu, which is generally considered acceptable behavior under normal circumstances. However, it may not be advisable for someone who is feeling unwell, especially during the holiday season when many people are celebrating. It is important to prioritize one's health and well-being over social obligations."
