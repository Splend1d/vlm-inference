According to Carens, liberals believe that individuals should not have any moral obligations that would conflict with the rights and duties that liberalism itself prescribes. Therefore, if a black doctor has a moral obligation to practice in a black community, it would conflict with this belief, so liberal egalitarianism does not have anything to say about such questions."
