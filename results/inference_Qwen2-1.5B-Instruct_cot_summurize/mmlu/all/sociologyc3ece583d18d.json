The upper and middle classes had access to more affluent areas of society such as the suburbs, while the working class tended to live in urban centers or in rural areas. This division between the two classes was reflected in their use of public spaces, with the upper and middle classes often using parks and other amenities in the suburbs, while the working class preferred to stay at home or in communal living spaces like tenements or council housing estates."
