Breeding with individuals from a different population may cause the extinction of the first population due to a decrease in diversity.\n\nThis statement highlights the potential for a population to be endangered by breeding with individuals from another population, which can lead to a decrease in genetic diversity within the original population. This can make it more difficult for the population to adapt to changing environmental conditions or face threats such as disease or predation. As a result, the population may become less resilient and more susceptible to extinction."
