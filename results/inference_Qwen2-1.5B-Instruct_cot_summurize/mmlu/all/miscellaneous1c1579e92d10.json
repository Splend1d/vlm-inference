When cool air flows from a higher altitude to a lower altitude, it can experience adiabatic cooling as it descends and encounters warmer air. This process results in the air becoming cooler and more dry. \n\nIt's important to note that the amount of moisture in the air increases with temperature, so even though the air may be cooled, it may still contain some moisture content due to evaporation. However, this moisture content is typically less than what would occur if the air were not cooled at all."
