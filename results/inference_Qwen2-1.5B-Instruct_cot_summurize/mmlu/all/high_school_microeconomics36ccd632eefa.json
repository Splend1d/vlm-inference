Marginal benefit equals marginal cost. \n\nMarginal utility refers to the additional satisfaction or pleasure gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service, while marginal cost refers to the additional cost incurred for producing one more unit of a good or service. The point at which marginal benefit equals marginal cost is called the \"break-even\" point and it represents the optimal level of consumption for maximizing total utility.\n\nIn other words, the point at which the marginal benefit (the extra satisfaction received per dollar spent) equals the marginal cost (the additional expense for producing that extra amount of output). This ensures that the additional money spent on producing one more unit of output does not lead to any increase in overall satisfaction, as the extra cost would be offset by the decrease in satisfaction. Therefore, this is considered the optimal level of consumption for maximizing total utility."
