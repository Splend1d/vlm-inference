It is important for therapists to maintain their professional integrity and avoid conflicts of interest, so it is best to err on the side of caution when considering whether or not to see someone who may have had an impact on your life in the past. Additionally, discussing any potential conflicts with the client beforehand can help ensure that both parties feel comfortable and secure in the therapeutic process."
