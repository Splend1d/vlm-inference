The state police attributed the violence to greed and fear at the casinos. To prevent such violence, the state legislature passes a statute prohibiting all gambling at privately owned casinos in the state. Is this law likely to be held constitutional if most casinos in the state were owned by those from out-of-state?\n\nA. Yes, because the act was expressly authorized by the state legislature.\nB. Yes, but only if the local interest in safety outweighs the burden of interstate commerce.\nC. No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.\nD. No, because the statute violates the due process rights of the owners of the casinos.\n"

No, because out-of-state casinos are part of interstate commerce.\n\nThe constitutionally protected right against unreasonable search and seizure applies to both intrastate and interstate commerce. Therefore, any law that discriminates against out-of-state businesses based on their location is unconstitutional, regardless of whether the discrimination affects interstate commerce or not. In this case, the prohibition on gambling at privately owned casinos in the state would be unconstitutional because it targets out-of-state businesses."
