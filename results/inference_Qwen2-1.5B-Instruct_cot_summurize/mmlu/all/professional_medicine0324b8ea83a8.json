It can affect any part of the body but commonly affects the neck, shoulders, back, arms, hands, and legs.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of chronic achiness, stiffness, and fatigue support the diagnosis of MPS. Additionally, the physical examination findings of tender points in different muscle groups suggest that the pain is localized and may be due to inflammation or injury.\n\nRadiograph findings and laboratory studies are not typically diagnostic for MPS as they are often used to rule out other conditions. However, if these tests were performed and found to be normal, it would further support the diagnosis of MPS.\n\nOsteoarthritis is a joint disease characterized by wear and tear on the joints over time. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the spine and joints. Fibromyalgia is a condition characterized by widespread pain throughout the body, but there are no specific tender points noted in this case."
