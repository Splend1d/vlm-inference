As planned, the co-felon entered the bank while the defendant stationed herself outside as a lookout. The co-felon approached the bank teller, pointed her unloaded gun at him, and demanded themoney. While the teller was handing the money to the co-felon, the defendant got scared and fled. The teller, who had a weak heart started to feel faint. He handed over the money to the co-felon, and then clutched his chest and died. The co-felon was found not guilty by a jury in her trial, which preceded the defendant's trial. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for conspiracy and acquitted. Her acquittal most likely resulted because\n\nA. the defendant abandoned her participation in the crime.\nB. the teller's death was accidental.\nC. the co-felon was acquitted.\nD. the teller was not placed in apprehension of bodily harm.\n"
