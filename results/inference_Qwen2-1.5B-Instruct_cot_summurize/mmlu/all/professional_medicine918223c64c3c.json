The wife's gynecologist has reported that her anatomic and physiologic evaluation disclosed no abnormalities and that assessment of potential male factors is needed. The husband is 188 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall with fair skin and little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm are seen on semen analysis. Which of the following tests is most likely to establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility?\n\nA. Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes\nB. Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations\nC. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations\nD. Serum prolactin concentration\n"

Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations\n\nThese hormones are commonly measured as part of workup for male factor infertility, which can include issues related to reduced sperm production or function. A low level of these hormones may indicate a problem with the quality of the sperm. Other options like karyotyping, serum estrogen and testosterone levels, and serum prolactin concentration do not typically directly address the underlying cause of male factor infertility."
