It shows a lack of empathy and understanding for someone else's struggles and feelings. Therefore, this scenario is considered morally wrong. \n\nAnswer: A. Wrong, Wrong\n\nIt is important to remember that different people may have different interpretations of what constitutes \"morally wrong\" behavior, but generally speaking, actions that harm or exploit others, cause unnecessary suffering or pain, or violate their rights and dignity would be considered morally wrong."
