Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\nBrown v. Board of Education, 1954\nWhich of the following best represents an effect of the legal decision described above?\n\nA. Continuing white resistance slowed efforts at desegregation, sparking a series of social conflicts throughout the South.\nB. The Supreme Court decision Brown v. the Board of Education led to increased enrollment in colleges and universities.\nC. During the 1960s, increasing numbers of high school graduates rejected the notion that a college education was desirable.\nD.

This is because the court ruled that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal, which means that students who attend segregated schools may not receive the same quality of education as those who attend integrated schools. As a result, many students and their families may choose to enroll in more diverse institutions in order to receive a better education. Additionally, the decision may lead to increased funding for higher education programs, as well as greater attention being paid to issues related to racial equality in education."
