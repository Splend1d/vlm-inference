If the company issues more debt (in the form of equity), this will increase its total debt, making its total assets less liquid and reducing its ability to meet its financial obligations. As a result, this ratio will decrease.\n\nWorking capital ratio: This ratio shows how much of a company's current assets are used to finance its short-term liabilities. When the company issues more debt, it may use more of its current assets to pay off its debts, which will reduce its working capital. Therefore, this ratio will also decrease."
