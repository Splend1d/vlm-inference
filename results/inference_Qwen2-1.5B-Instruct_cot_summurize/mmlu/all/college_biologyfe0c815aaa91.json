High parental investment.\n\nRodents typically invest heavily in the care and development of their offspring, especially during the critical early stages of life when they are most vulnerable to predation and environmental stressors. This investment can take many forms, including increased feeding, grooming, and protection of the young. In this case, it's possible that the small number of offspring being produced by the rodents could be an indication of high parental investment due to the limited resources available for raising multiple young at once. Other characteristics listed (such as moderate sexual size dimorphism) may also be relevant depending on the specific species of rodent and its reproductive biology, but high parental investment is the key factor here."
