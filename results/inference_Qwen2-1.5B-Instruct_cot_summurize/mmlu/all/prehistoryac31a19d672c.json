Smith in 1958, humans began to domesticate plants and animals around 20,000 years ago, which is known as the Neolithic Revolution. This period is characterized by the development of agriculture and the beginning of sedentary lifestyles. Around 10,000-7000 years ago, the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer societies to settled agricultural communities took place. The final stage of this transition occurred around 3000-2000 years ago, with the rise of sedentary urban civilizations such as the Indus Valley Civilization in South Asia and the Maya civilization in Central America. \n\nThis chronological sequence corresponds to the three stages of the three-age system, each representing an important milestone in the development of human culture:\n\n1. Neolithic (around 20,000 BCE - 10,000 BCE): The development of agriculture and the establishment of settled communities.\n2. Chalcolithic (around 10,000 BCE - 6000 BCE): The transition from nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled agricultural communities.\n3. Copper Age (around 6000 BCE - 2000 BCE): The rise of sedentary urban civilizations such as the Indus Valley Civilization and the Maya civilization.\n\nTherefore, the three-age system best describes the chronological order of the emergence of human culture according to a predictable chronology of the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age."
