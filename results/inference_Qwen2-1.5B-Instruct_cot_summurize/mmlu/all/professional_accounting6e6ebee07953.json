An accountant performing the compilation of financial statements of a nonissuer is required to perform preliminary analytical procedures to identify accounts that may represent specific risks relevant to the engagement.\n\nAnalytical procedures involve using historical data, current information, and other sources to evaluate transactions and events for indications of unusual or irregular activity that might indicate fraud, error, or misstatement. The accountant should identify accounts where the balances appear to be unusually large, small, or inconsistent with the nature of the business. This can help uncover potential issues such as errors in accounting entries, overstatements of assets, understatements of liabilities, or manipulation of earnings. Analytical procedures also help in assessing the reliability of the financial information provided by the entity."
