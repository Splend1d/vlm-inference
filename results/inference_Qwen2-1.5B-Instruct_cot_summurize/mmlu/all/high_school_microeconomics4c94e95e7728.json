MP that first falls, but eventually rises, as output increases.\n\nThe Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns states that the marginal product (MP) of an additional unit of input decreases as more units of input are added to the production process. This means that while the total cost of producing one more unit of output may increase initially, the average cost per unit will decrease over time due to economies of scale and the ability to use inputs more efficiently with increased quantities. Therefore, MP first falls, then rises as output increases."
