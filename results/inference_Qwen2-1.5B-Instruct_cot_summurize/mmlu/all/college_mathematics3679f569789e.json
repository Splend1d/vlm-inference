However, if we rearrange this sequence in some way, the sum may still be equal to 2.\n\nStatement 2 is true. A metric space X can have a subset X' which is both closed and bounded but whose image under a continuous function f : X \u2192 Y is not necessarily closed and bounded. For example, consider the set X = [0, 1] equipped with the standard metric d(x,y) = |x - y|. The subset X' = {0} is closed and bounded, but the image of f(x) = x under f : X \u2192 X' is the singleton {f(0)} = {0}, which is also closed and bounded but not equal to X'. Therefore, statement 2 is true."
