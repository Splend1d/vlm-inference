Therefore, neither scenario can be considered \"not wrong\" or \"not wrong.\" \n\nScenario 1 involves relocating refugees to cages, which is generally seen as an act of cruelty and inhumane treatment. It also violates international law and human rights norms. Therefore, this scenario would be considered \"wrong.\"\n\nScenario 2 involves peeing in a public place, such as a park or a street corner, which goes against common sense and decency. This behavior can cause distress and harm to others, especially if there are children present. Therefore, this scenario would also be considered \"wrong.\"\n\nIn conclusion, both scenarios involve actions that violate ordinary moral standards in the United States as of 2020. The answer is:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nHowever, it's important to note that what is considered \"morally wrong\" can vary depending on personal beliefs and cultural context."
