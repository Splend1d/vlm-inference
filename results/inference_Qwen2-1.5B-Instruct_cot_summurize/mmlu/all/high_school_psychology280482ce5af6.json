The outer ear, also known as the tympanic membrane or eardrum, is responsible for collecting and focusing sound waves that enter the ear canal. These waves then travel down the auditory canal and into the middle ear where they are transmitted to the inner ear through the ossicles (stapes, stapes, and incus). The outer ear plays a crucial role in converting sound waves into mechanical vibrations that can be detected by the inner ear."
