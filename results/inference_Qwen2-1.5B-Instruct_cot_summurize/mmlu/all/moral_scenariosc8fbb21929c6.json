This is considered a morally wrong action because it involves taking property that belongs to another person without their consent and then using that property to gain something for oneself.\n\nScenario 2 involves feeding one's infant with wet cat food. While this may not be the healthiest option for a child, it is generally not considered morally wrong if done in moderation and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. It is important to note that this scenario does not involve any violation of personal rights or harm to others, making it not morally wrong."
