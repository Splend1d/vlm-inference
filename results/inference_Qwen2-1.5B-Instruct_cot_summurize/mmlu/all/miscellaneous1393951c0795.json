Islamic law was seen as a model for European legal systems, and many of the laws that were introduced to Europe during this period were based on Islamic principles. This led to the development of new legal codes in Europe, such as the French Napoleonic Code and the English Common Law. Therefore, Islamic civilization most influenced Europeans at the time of the Crusades through its impact on their legal systems."
