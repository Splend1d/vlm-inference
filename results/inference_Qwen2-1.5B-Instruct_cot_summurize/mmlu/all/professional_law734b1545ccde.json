At trial, the court has allowed the plaintiff to introduce the deposition testimony of a witness, now deceased, that he was with the plaintiff at the time of the incident. The defendant now seeks to impeach the testimony of the witness with his 13-year-old conviction for burglary (for which he served 18 months in prison) for breaking into the home of a neighbor while she was away and taking some of her valuable jewelry. Should the court allow evidence of the conviction?\n\nA. No, because the witness did not testify at trial.\nB. No, unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\nC. Yes, because prior convictions are probative to impeach the witness's character for truthfulness.\nD. Yes, because the crime involved an act of dishonesty.\n"

No, unless the court finds, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\n\nIn order to be admissible as impeachment evidence, the court must first determine whether the conviction is relevant to the case. In this case, the defendant is seeking to impeach the witness's credibility based on the fact that he committed a crime as a minor, specifically burglary. The court must consider whether the crime is sufficiently serious or significant enough to warrant exclusion under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nSpecifically, the court should evaluate whether the probative value of the conviction supports the relevance of the witness's testimony, considering any mitigating factors such as the length of imprisonment, the nature of the crime, and any other relevant information about the defendant's background and behavior. Additionally, the court should weigh the potential prejudice of allowing the evidence against the probative value it offers in impeaching the witness's character for truthfulness.\n\nIf the court determines that the probative value of the conviction is significantly outweighed by the prejudicial effect, the court may still exclude the evidence if the prosecution can show that there are no \"fundamental unfairnesses\" in admitting the evidence. However, this will depend on the unique facts and circumstances of the case, including the nature of the crime, the defendant's criminal history, and any other relevant factors."
