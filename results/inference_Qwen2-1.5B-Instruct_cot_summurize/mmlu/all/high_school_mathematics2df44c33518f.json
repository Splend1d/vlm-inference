If there is an even number of numbers, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nFirst, let's arrange Sarah's times in ascending order: 86, 88, 94, 96, 97.\n\nSince after her sixth try, her median time became 92 seconds, we know that the median must be one of these six times (either the second or third number).\n\nHowever, since the median has increased from 92 to 94, the median must have been either the fourth or fifth number before increasing to 94. This means that Sarah's sixth time must have been between 88 and 94.\n\nThe only number between 88 and 94 that is also a possible median value is 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{B}$."
