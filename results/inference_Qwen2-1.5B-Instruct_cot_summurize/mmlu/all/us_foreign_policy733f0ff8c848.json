While wealth and GDP can be indicators of a country's ability to develop and maintain a nuclear arsenal, they are not necessarily predictors of whether or not a particular state will acquire nuclear weapons. Other factors such as rivalry with other nuclear states, regime stability, and historical experiences with nuclear weapons can also play important roles in determining a state's decision to acquire nuclear capabilities. Therefore, receiving sensitive nuclear assistance, rivaling with a nuclear state, and having a regime type that aligns with the acquisition of nuclear weapons are all potential predictors of a state acquiring nuclear weapons, while wealth/gdp alone may not always be an accurate indicator."
