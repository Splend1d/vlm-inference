The K-means algorithm minimizes the within class variance for a given number of clusters, which is one of the criteria for determining its performance.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the K-means algorithm does not guarantee convergence to the global optimum if the initial cluster centers are chosen randomly or poorly. It may converge to a local minimum instead, depending on the initialization and the distribution of data points. Therefore, D is also correct in this context."
