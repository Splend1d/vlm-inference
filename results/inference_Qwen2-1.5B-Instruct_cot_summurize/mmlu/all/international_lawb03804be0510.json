When a state has been forewarned of an impending attack, it may assume that the UNSC has already given its approval for the use of armed force to protect itself from harm. This is known as the \"presumption of Security Council approval\" and is often invoked in situations where a state feels threatened or attacked without immediate action being taken by the international community."
