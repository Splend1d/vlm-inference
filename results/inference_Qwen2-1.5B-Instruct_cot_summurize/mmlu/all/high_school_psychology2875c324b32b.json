The parasympathetic nervous system resumes control and reverses the sympathetic responses.\n\nWhen the child is picked up, her mother releases tension in the muscles (sympathetic response), which helps calm her down. This is an example of how the body responds to stress or anxiety, where the sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for a fight-or-flight response. When the child is comforted, the parasympathetic nervous system takes over and helps the body relax by decreasing heart rate, slowing breathing, and reducing muscle tension. This is an example of the autonomic nervous system responding to changes in the environment or emotions."
