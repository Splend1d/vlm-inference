Direct manipulation involves applying force directly onto the affected area while maintaining good contact between the hands and the body. Indirect manipulation involves using the patient's own muscles and ligaments as a tool to achieve therapeutic effects. Mid manipulation involves using a combination of both direct and indirect techniques.\n\nIn this case, the patient has a history of breast cancer and has undergone radiation and chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoma to the bone. This suggests that she may have had previous trauma or injury to her spine. A mid velocity, mid amplitude technique would allow for gentle, controlled movement without causing excessive strain on the spine. It would also provide a safe and effective way to address her back pain. High velocity, low amplitude manipulation could cause more significant strain on the spine and may not be appropriate for this patient. Isotonic exercise therapy would involve physical activity without any manual manipulation, which may not be suitable for someone who needs to reduce their reliance on analgesics."
