Expression of the genes only when lactose is present.\n\nWhen the level of glucose is low and there is no lactose available, the repressor molecule binds to the operator region of the lac operon. This blocks transcription of the operon genes, leading to the repression of their expression.\n\nHowever, if lactose is introduced back into the system, the repressor molecules dissociate from the operator regions, allowing transcription of the operon genes to resume. As a result, the expression of the genes will be induced by the presence of lactose.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Expression of the genes only when lactose is present."
