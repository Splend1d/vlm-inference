In his defense, the defendant has testified that he had no intention of keeping the car but got caught up in marital problems and simply delayed returning it. The defendant calls a witness to testify that the defendant told him, during the two days, \"I'm going to return this car as soon as I work things out with my wife.\" Is the witness's testimony admissible?\n\nA. No, because it is a self-serving statement by an accused.\nB. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nC. Yes, as a prior consistent statement of the defendant.\nD. Yes, as a statement by the defendant of his then-existing state of mind.\n"
