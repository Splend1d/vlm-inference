The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.\n\nDuring an elastic collision, the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision. In this case, the two skaters have equal masses and velocities before the collision, so their total momentums before and after the collision will be equal as well. Therefore, the linear momentum of the system is conserved.\n\nHowever, if the skaters were not moving towards each other (i.e., the collision was not inelastic), then only the kinetic energy would be conserved since there would be no net force acting on the system. But since the skaters are moving towards each other, there is a net force that causes them to stick together, resulting in zero net force on the system. This means that only the kinetic energy is conserved."
