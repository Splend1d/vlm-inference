It argues that our actions should be motivated by a concern for others, rather than simply by self-interest. This approach to ethics suggests that we should consider the well-being of others when making decisions, rather than solely focusing on individual rights or duties. Additionally, it acknowledges the role of empathy and compassion in shaping our ethical behavior."
