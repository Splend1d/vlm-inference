After the second game of the season, the plaintiff was suddenly dismissed as the coach for undisclosed reasons. After the dismissal was made public, the local newspaper ran an article discussing the plaintiff's tenure as coach. The article, which was written by the sports editor, stated that \"The plaintiff was a bad role model and morally unfit for the coaching job. \"The plaintiff brought suit against the newspaper for defamation. At trial, the plaintiff called a player on the basketball team to testify that \"the plaintiff was a good role model and respected by the players. \" In presenting its evidence, the newspaper called a witness to testify. He proposes to testify that he saw the plaintiff give beer to players on three occasions after victories. Upon objection by the plaintiff's attorney, witness's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, for impeachment purposes only.\nB. admissible, as substantive evidence.\nC. inadmissible, because specific instances of conduct is an improper method of proving character.\nD. inadmissible to prove character, but admissible for the purpose of showing intent or common scheme.\n"

Specific incidents, such as giving beer to players on three occasions after victories, would not provide sufficient evidence of the individual's general reputation or moral fitness as a coach. Instead, the plaintiff should have presented evidence about the plaintiff's overall performance as a coach, including how they led the team, managed conflicts, and interacted with players off the court. This type of evidence would help to paint a more complete picture of the plaintiff's character and suitability for the coaching position."
