However, this is only possible if we can accurately predict what policies would lead to the greatest good for everyone involved. In reality, predicting the outcome of complex social interactions is very difficult, especially without any information about the intentions or motivations of others.\n\nTherefore, when people are presented with a set of rules, they may choose those that seem fair on the surface but ultimately lead to negative consequences for some members of society. This is why Rawls suggests that we should use a \"veil of ignorance\" before making decisions, where no one knows what kind of society they live in or who else lives there. Only then can we make choices that are truly impartial and just."
