Equity theory suggests that people feel motivated when they perceive that their rewards are fair and equal to others in their group. In this context, if the financial incentives provided to employees do not align with their perceived fairness, it may not increase their job motivation and satisfaction.\n\nExpectancy theory focuses on how individuals evaluate the likelihood of achieving certain outcomes based on their beliefs about the consequences of those actions. If the employee perceives that the financial incentives will lead to significant gains, it may motivate them more than if they believe there is no correlation between their performance and the reward.\n\nTwo-factor theory suggests that work has both physical demands and psychological aspects. The financial incentives alone might not be enough to address the psychological aspects of job satisfaction, such as recognition, meaning, and autonomy.\n\nIn summary, equity theory provides the most direct explanation for why the financial incentives did not increase job motivation and satisfaction among employees in this scenario."
