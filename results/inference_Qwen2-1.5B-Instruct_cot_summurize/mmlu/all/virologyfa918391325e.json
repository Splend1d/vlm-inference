Rebuilding scientific, medical, and nursing infrastructure and training staff: This involves investing in healthcare facilities, training medical professionals, and ensuring that they have access to the necessary resources and equipment to prevent and treat cases of Ebola effectively.\n\nB. Early and accurate diagnosis with molecular kits: This involves using advanced diagnostic tools such as molecular kits to identify and isolate infected individuals early on in the outbreak, which can help contain the spread of the virus before it becomes widespread.\n\nC. Developing effective vaccines: While developing a vaccine against Ebola may take time and require significant investment, it could provide a powerful tool for preventing future outbreaks by protecting those who are most at risk.\n\nD. Arranging rapid intervention into West Africa with EU and US army teams: While this approach could potentially lead to faster response times, it also carries significant political and logistical challenges. It's important to consider all options carefully and prioritize prevention efforts over reactive responses when dealing with infectious diseases like Ebola."
