This goes against the basic principle of respecting others' property and fair dealing.\nScenario 2 is not explicitly stated as morally wrong or not wrong, but drinking alcohol during halftime of a football game can be seen as irresponsible and dangerous behavior that could lead to harm to oneself or others. However, this behavior is generally considered acceptable under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
