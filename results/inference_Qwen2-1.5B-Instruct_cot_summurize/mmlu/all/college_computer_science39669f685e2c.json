In fact, the worst case scenario for hash table operations is O(n), where n is the size of the input data. This means that even though hash tables provide constant-time insertion, deletion, and search operations on average, they may require more than linear time when performing these operations on large datasets.\n\nFor problem C, which involves range search, a hash table could still be an effective solution, but only if the hash function provides good locality of reference properties. If the hash function does not distribute keys well across different buckets, the performance of range search may degrade significantly.\n\nFinally, for problem D, symbol table lookup, a hash table would not necessarily be the best choice since it depends on the specific requirements of the application. However, if the application supports direct access to symbols by their addresses, then a hash table can be an efficient way to map identifiers to addresses without requiring a separate symbol table."
