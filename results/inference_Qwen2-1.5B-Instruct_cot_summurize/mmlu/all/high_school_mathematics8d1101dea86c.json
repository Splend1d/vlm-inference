                    "text": " Let's denote the number of ants of Species A on Day 0 as $a$ and the number of ants of Species B as $b$. According to the problem, we have the following equations:\n\n1) $a + b = 30$ (The total number of ants on Day 0 is 30)\n\n2) $2^4a + 3^4b = 3281$ (The total number of ants after 5 days is 3281)\n\nWe can simplify equation 2) by dividing all terms by their greatest common divisor, which is 1.\n\nSo, we get:\n\n$16a + 81b = 3281$\n\nNow, let's solve this system of equations. We can start by solving equation 1) for $a$: \n\n$a = 30 - b$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $a$ into equation 2):\n\n$16(30 - b) + 81b = 3281$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$480 - 16b + 81b = 3281$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$495 = 3281 - 7b$\n\nSubtract 3281 from both sides:\n\n$-2786 = -7b$\n\nDivide by -7:\n\n$b = 398$\n\nNow, substitute $b = 398$ back into equation 1) to find $a$:\n\n$a + 398 = 30$\n\nSubtract 398 from both sides:\n\n$a = 30 - 398$\n\n$a = -368$\n\nHowever, since the number of ants cannot be negative, we must have made an error somewhere. Let's retrace our steps and check our work.\n\nUpon revisiting equation 2), we should notice that we divided by 1 instead of 16, leading to an incorrect simplification. Instead, we should divide by the GCD of 16 and 81, which is 1:\n\n$16a + 81b = 3281$\n\nDivide by 1:\n\n$16a + 81b = 3281$\n\nNow, let's correct our mistake and solve the system of equations again:\n\n1) $a + b = 30$\n2) $16a + 81b = 3281$\n\nMultiply equation 1) by 81:\n\n$81a + 81b = 2400$\n\nNow, subtract this new equation from equation 2:\n\n$(16a + 81b) - (81a + 81b) = 3281 - 2400$\n\n$80a = 881$\n\nDivide by 80:\n\n$a = \\frac{881}{80}$\n\n$a = 11.025$\n\nSince the number of ants must be a whole number, we must have made another mistake. Upon revisiting our calculations, we realize that we should not have multiplied equation 1) by 81. Instead, we should have added the equations directly without multiplying:\n\n$a + b = 30$\n$16a + 81b = 3281$\n\nAdd these equations:\n\n$a + b + 16a + 81b = 30 + 3281$\n\n$17a + 82b = 3311$\n\nNow, divide by 17:\n\n$a + \\frac{82b}{17} = 195.3529...$\n\nThis still doesn't make sense because the number of ants cannot be expressed as a fraction or decimal. Let's go back and double-check our calculations.\n\nUpon revisiting our work, we realize that we made a mistake when adding the equations directly. We should have first solved equation 1) for $a$, and then substituted this value into equation 2):\n\n$a + b = 30$\n$2^4a + 3^4b = 3281$\n\nSubstitute $a = 30 - b$ into equation 2):\n\n$16(30 - b) + 81b = 3281$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$480 - 16b + 81b = 3281$\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$495 = 3281 - 7b$\n\nSubtract 3281 from both sides:\n\n$-2786 = -7b$\n\nDivide by -7:\n\n$b = 398$\n\nNow, substitute $b = 398$ back into equation 1) to find $a$:\n\n$a + 398 ="
