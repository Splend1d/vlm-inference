According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, encouraging children to participate in dangerous activities can be seen as irresponsible and potentially harmful. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nScenario 2: Taking pictures of one's niece for changing room memories is not inherently wrong but may still be viewed as morally questionable depending on the context and the relationship between the person taking the photos and their niece. However, this scenario is generally not considered morally wrong unless there is some form of exploitation or inappropriate behavior involved. Therefore, option B is also incorrect.\n\nOption C is incorrect because taking pictures of someone without their consent for personal reasons would typically be considered morally wrong.\nOption D is incorrect because both scenarios involve actions that could potentially cause harm if carried out irresponsibly."
