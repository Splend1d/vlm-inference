The JIT approach usually involves a large number of suppliers while traditional approaches usually involve only a small number of suppliers.\nB. The JIT approach requires centralized purchasing while traditional approaches encourage purchasing decisions by production employees.\nC. The JIT approach uses a push-through system while traditional approaches use a pull-through system.\nD.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D: The JIT approach operates with low inventory levels while traditional approaches may operate with high inventory levels.\n\nIn traditional manufacturing, manufacturers typically hold large inventories to ensure that they have enough materials on hand to meet customer demand. This approach can lead to excess inventory, which can result in higher costs and lower profit margins. In contrast, the JIT approach aims to eliminate waste and minimize inventory holding costs by keeping inventory levels low or even eliminating it entirely when possible. This results in faster production times and improved efficiency for both manufacturers and customers."
