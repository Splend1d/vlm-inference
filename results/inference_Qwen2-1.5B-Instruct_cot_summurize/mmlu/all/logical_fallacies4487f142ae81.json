It seems like an attempt to make a conclusion based on incomplete information or a logical error in reasoning. Without more context or information about the specific situation or person being referred to, it's difficult to determine which category applies best. However, if someone denies they are a Communist while admitting to holding certain political beliefs (such as advocating for social justice), then the correct response would be:\n\nC. Denying the Antecedent\n\nThis option suggests that the statement \"he is not a Communist\" is being denied when in fact he may still hold some communist beliefs or principles.
