As heavier atoms have more protons than neutrons, they tend to be unstable and decay into lighter elements by emitting alpha particles or beta particles. This process continues until the nucleus reaches a stable state, which can be either a proton-proton chain reaction (like carbon and oxygen), a neutron capture reaction (like helium and neon), or a positron emission (like silicon).\n\nTherefore, the order of elements as they form around a star follows this pattern:\n\n1. Hydrogen (H)\n2. Helium (He)\n3. Carbon (C)\n4. Oxygen (O)\n5. Neon (Ne)\n6. Silicon (Si)\n7. Iron (Fe)\n\nNote that other answers like A, D, or C may also be possible if you consider additional steps or reactions beyond the primary nuclear fusion process, but the given options represent the standard order based on the current understanding of stellar evolution."
