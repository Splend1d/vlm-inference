The higher the armature resistance, the slower the motor or generator will run. This is because the armature resistance opposes the current flow through the motor or generator, increasing the losses and reducing the efficiency of the device. Therefore, the lower limit of the speed imposed by the armature resistance is the maximum speed that can be achieved with the motor or generator."
