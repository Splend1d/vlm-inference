They do not necessarily have a constant probability distribution or a constant autocorrelation function over time. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nOption A is incorrect because only having a constant mean does not guarantee that the process is weakly stationary.\nOption B is incorrect because only having a constant variance does not guarantee that the process is weakly stationary.\nOption C is correct because it includes all three necessary conditions for a process to be weakly stationary.\nOption D is incorrect because it includes all four necessary conditions for a process to be weakly stationary."
