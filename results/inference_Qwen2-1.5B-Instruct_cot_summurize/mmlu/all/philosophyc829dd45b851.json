He believed that justice serves as a means for individuals to resolve conflicts and maintain order within society. Therefore, while there may be some practical benefits to having a system of justice, such as preventing harm to others or maintaining social harmony, Hume did not believe that justice had inherent value beyond these functional purposes."
