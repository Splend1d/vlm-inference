Instead, they compete on price to sell their products. As a result, firms in perfect competition produce where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.\n\nIn oligopoly, there is some degree of rivalry among firms, but not enough to prevent them from forming cartels or monopolies. In this case, firms will produce where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.\n\nIn monopoly, one firm has complete control over the market, and it can set its own prices without facing any competition. Firms in monopolistic competition also face intense competition, but they may still be able to earn higher profits than firms in perfect competition because they can charge higher prices for their product.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I, II, III, and IV."
