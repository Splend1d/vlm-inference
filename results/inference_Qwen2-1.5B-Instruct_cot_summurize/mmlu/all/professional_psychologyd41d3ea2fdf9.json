Brief Reactive Psychosis\n\nBrief Reactive Psychosis is characterized by sudden onset of severe hallucinations or delusions, usually within a few days after an acute stressful event such as a serious illness, injury, or trauma. The symptoms may include auditory hallucinations (hearing voices), visual hallucinations (seeing things that are not there), delusions (believing false ideas that cause significant distress or impairment), and sometimes paranoid ideation (a fear of being betrayed). The episode typically lasts several weeks but can recur.\n\nIn this case, the patient's symptoms fit the criteria for Brief Reactive Psychosis due to the sudden onset of severe symptoms within the past six weeks, including delusions about receiving messages from aliens through the TV."
