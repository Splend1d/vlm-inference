                    "text": "The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is defined as the percentage of incident photons that are detected by the detector. In this case, the quantum efficiency is given as 0.1, which means that only 0.1% of the incident photons are detected.\n\nIf 100 photons are sent into the detector and one after the other, the number of photons detected by the detector would be 10 (since there are 100 photons in total). Therefore, the expected number of detections would be 10.\n\nHowever, since the quantum efficiency is only 0.1%, only 0.1% of the photons will actually be detected. This means that the actual number of detections would be less than 10. To find out how many, we can use the formula for the mean value of a binomial distribution:\n\nE(X) = n * p\n\nwhere E(X) is the expected value of X, n is the number of trials, and p is the probability of success on each trial. In this case, n=100 and p=0.1, so:\n\nE(X) = 10 * 0.1 = 1\n\nThis means that the expected number of detections is 1. However, since the quantum efficiency is only 0.1, only 0.1% of the photons will actually be detected. This means that the actual number of detections would be less than 1. Since we know that the actual number of detections is less than 1 but greater than 0, the closest answer to our calculation is B. an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3."
