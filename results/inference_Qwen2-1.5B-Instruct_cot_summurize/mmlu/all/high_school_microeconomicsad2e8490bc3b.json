                    "text": "The correct answer is D. I and III.\n\nIn perfect competition, there are many sellers and buyers who can freely enter and exit the market at any time without affecting the market price significantly. This means that the demand curve is perfectly elastic, meaning that an increase in price will result in a proportionate decrease in quantity demanded. The inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded makes it clear that price equals marginal revenue (MR).\n\nIn monopolistic competition, there are relatively few sellers but a large number of buyers. This results in a more complex demand curve where the elasticity decreases as prices rise. In this scenario, the demand curve is not perfectly elastic, so the price is not equal to marginal revenue. However, the price still exceeds marginal revenue because of the higher degree of differentiation and lower average total cost compared to perfect competition.\n\nIn monopoly, there is only one seller and no close substitutes. The supply curve is typically upward sloping due to the fixed costs associated with producing a single unit. The price is determined by the individual's willingness to pay for the product, which may be above the marginal revenue earned from each additional unit sold. Therefore, the price is greater than marginal revenue in a monopoly.\n\nSo, option D is the correct interpretation of why price equals marginal revenue under perfect competition, and why price is greater than marginal revenue under monopoly or imperfect competition."
