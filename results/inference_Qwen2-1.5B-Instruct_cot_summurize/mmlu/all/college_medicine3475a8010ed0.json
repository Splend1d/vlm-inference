                    "text": "The correct answer is C. H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which results from the crystalline framework that forms due to hydrogen bonds.\n\nWhen water (H2O) is at its solid phase, it forms a crystalline structure with hydrogen bonds between the molecules. This structure allows for a stable and dense state of water. However, when water is heated above its boiling point (100\u00b0C or 212\u00b0F), the hydrogen bonds break down, causing the water to vaporize and become a gas. As the temperature increases further, the vapor will continue to expand until it reaches the boiling point again, forming steam.\n\nTherefore, the negative slope of the liquid-liquid equilibrium line in the phase diagram for water represents the fact that as the temperature rises, the liquid-to-gas transition becomes more abrupt and less gradual. This is because the hydrogen bonds between water molecules weaken over time, leading to a faster transition from liquid to vapor at higher temperatures."
