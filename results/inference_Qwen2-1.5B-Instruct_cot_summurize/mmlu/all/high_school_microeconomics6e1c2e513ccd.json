This leads to a downward pressure on wages, which in turn encourages employers to offer more jobs to attract workers. As a result, the wage rate will tend to rise over time as competition between employers increases.\n\nEmployment in a perfectly competitive labor market is determined by supply and demand curves. When there are many employers willing to hire workers at a given wage level, the equilibrium wage can be expected to rise. Similarly, when there are many job seekers who are willing to accept lower wages than they previously sought, the equilibrium number of jobs can also be expected to increase. This means that employment would likely increase if the wage and employment were to shift from a monopsonistic to a perfectly competitive labor market."
