The marginal cost, average fixed cost, average variable cost, and average total cost curves will all shift upward.\n\nIf the annual price of capital increases, this means that the marginal product of capital decreases, which in turn leads to an increase in the marginal cost curve (MC). This is because firms need to pay more for each additional unit of capital they use, resulting in a higher MC.\n\nAt the same time, the average variable cost (AVC) curve shifts up as well due to the decrease in the marginal product of labor (MPL), which results in a lower AVC per unit of labor used. This is because firms must compensate workers with higher wages or benefits to make up for the decreased productivity from using less capital.\n\nTherefore, the average fixed cost (AFC) curve also shifts up as firms have to bear the increased costs of producing goods and services with fewer units of capital available. Finally, the average total cost (ATC) curve also shifts up as the marginal cost curve and AVC curve shift upwards, along with the AFC curve, leading to higher ATC overall."
