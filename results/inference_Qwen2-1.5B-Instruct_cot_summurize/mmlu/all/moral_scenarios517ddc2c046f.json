Therefore, the main character's action is considered morally wrong. The other scenario, driving very fast on a racetrack, is not necessarily morally wrong if done within legal limits and with proper caution. However, it could still be seen as reckless behavior that puts others at risk. So, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
