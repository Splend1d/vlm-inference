During REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, the brain switches from alpha waves to theta waves, which are associated with deep relaxation and dreaming. This is known as the paradoxical sleep phenomenon. People can often recall vivid dreams that occur during REM sleep. Therefore, option B is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect because it suggests that people try to increase REM sleep when they have been deprived of it, which is not true. Option D is partially correct, but it does not fully explain why REM sleep is considered paradoxical. The brain is indeed active during REM sleep, but the body is not paralyzed. Instead, the muscles are relaxed, allowing for better sleep quality."
