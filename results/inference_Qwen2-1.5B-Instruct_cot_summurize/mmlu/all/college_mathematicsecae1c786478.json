                    "text": "The answer is D. 37.\n\nTo see why this is so, let's consider the possible orders of elements in a group. By Lagrange's Theorem, if $H$ is a subgroup of order $n$, then $\\frac{|G|}{|H|}$ must divide $n$. In other words, the index of $H$ in $G$ divides $n$.\n\nGiven that $G$ has a subgroup of order 7 and no element (other than the identity) is its own inverse, we know that $|G|$ cannot be divisible by 7 (since the order of an element cannot be a divisor of the order of the group). Therefore, $|G|$ must have at least one prime factor greater than 7.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible orders of elements in $G$. Since $G$ has a subgroup of order 7, it must contain an element of order 7. Let $a \\in G$ be such an element. Then, since $a^6 = e$, where $e$ is the identity element, we know that $|G|$ is divisible by 7.\n\nHowever, we also know that $G$ has no element (other than the identity) that is its own inverse. This means that for every non-identity element $b \\in G$, there exists some $c \\in G$ such that $bc = e$. But this implies that $b^6 = e$, which contradicts our assumption that $|G|$ is divisible by 7.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that $|G|$ is a power of 7, i.e., $|G| = 7k$ for some integer $k > 1$. Since $G$ has a subgroup of order 7, we can write $G = H \\times K$, where $H$ is a cyclic group of order 7 generated by $a$ and $K$ is any subgroup of $G$. Since $|H| = |G|/|H| = 7$, we have $|K| = 7k - 7$. However, since $|K|$ must be a divisor of $|G|$, we must have $|K| = 7$ or $|K| = 14$. \n\nBut if $|K| = 7$, then $G$ would have to be abelian, which is not possible because it has a subgroup of order 7. So, we must have $|K| = 14$. Thus, $|G| = 7k = 98$, which gives us $k = 14$, and $|G| = 98$. However, this does not satisfy our condition that $G$ has a subgroup of order 7.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is $|G| = 37$, which corresponds to option D."
