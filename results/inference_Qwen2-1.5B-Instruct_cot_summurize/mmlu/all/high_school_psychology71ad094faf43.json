According to Cannon-Bard, emotions are experienced as bodily sensations or physiological responses to external stimuli, which can be either positive (like joy) or negative (like fear). In this case, Antoinette's heart racing was an emotional response to the sudden appearance of her friends, who were throwing a surprise party. The theory suggests that emotions arise from the interaction between the body and its environment, rather than simply being innate or universal feelings."
