HI would be the strongest acid.\n\nElectronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons towards itself. As you move down Group 17 (the halogens), the electronegativities increase from I- (most electronegative) to Xe (least electronegative). This trend correlates with increasing bond strengths because more electronegative atoms pull electrons away from the nucleus, creating stronger bonds between atoms.\n\nBond strength is also affected by electronegativity differences. For example, in the H-I bond, the electronegativity difference between hydrogen and iodine allows for strong bonding, making H-I a polar covalent bond. The same principle applies to other pairs within Group 17, where the electronegativity difference is large enough to create strong, polar bonds.\n\nTherefore, based on these principles, HI has the strongest bond strength among the options given, making it the most likely to form a strong acid."
