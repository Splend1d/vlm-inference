However, it is estimated that the total number of viral particles in a cubic meter of seawater is around 4 x 10^13.\nTherefore, if we assume that each milliliter of natural water contains a small fraction of these viral particles, then the number of viruses in a milliliter of natural water would be on the order of 4 x 10^7 or less.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. up to 250."
