Ecological assessment\n\nAn ecological assessment is an assessment method that uses primarily observational methods to examine and understand the physical and psychological variables that impact behavior in a given environment or setting. It involves observing individuals' interactions with their environment, social relationships, and other people's behaviors in order to gather information about how these factors influence behavior.\n\nFunctional behavioral assessments, work samples, norm-referenced tests, and ecological assessments are all types of assessments used to evaluate individual differences in behavior. However, ecological assessments are specifically designed for studying the environmental factors that affect behavior, making them the most appropriate answer for this question."
