Gender schema\n\nThe theory of gender-schema suggests that individuals develop their understanding of gender through socialization, which involves observing and imitating the behaviors of others in their social environment. According to this theory, parents who play more roughly with male children and are more protective of female children are likely modeling these behaviors on their own children, reinforcing the idea that boys should be rough and girls should be gentle.\n\nThis type of parenting style is often associated with masculine values and norms, such as toughness and independence, while female traits are emphasized as nurturing and empathetic. Therefore, it is consistent with the gender-schema perspective that parents who model certain behaviors may contribute to the development of specific gender roles for their children."
