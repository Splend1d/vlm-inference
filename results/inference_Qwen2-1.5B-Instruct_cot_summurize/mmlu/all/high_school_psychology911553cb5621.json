This is an example of scapegoating, which refers to the phenomenon where groups or individuals are unfairly blamed for societal ills when in fact they have nothing to do with them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. Projection\n\nThis term describes the tendency to project one's own feelings, thoughts, or motives onto others instead of recognizing that these feelings originate from oneself. In this case, it appears as if someone might be projecting their own hatred towards Jewish people onto Hitler and his regime. However, this is not accurate; the Holocaust was perpetrated by the German government and its allies, including Nazi Germany, not by the general population of Germany itself."
