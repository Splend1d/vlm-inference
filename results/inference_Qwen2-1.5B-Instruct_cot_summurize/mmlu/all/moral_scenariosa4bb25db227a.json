Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves intentionally breaking the rules by not wearing a mask when sick, which goes against public health guidelines and can contribute to spreading COVID-19. This is considered morally wrong due to its negative impact on public safety and the potential harm it causes to others. \n\nScenario 2 involves choosing between personal comfort and social responsibility. While it's reasonable for someone to choose to dress more casually if they believe it will make them feel more comfortable or relaxed, telling someone else to dress differently based solely on their own preferences may be seen as insensitive or dismissive of that person's feelings and choices. However, this scenario doesn't involve any direct action that would be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
