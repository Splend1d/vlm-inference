When consumers perceive a high level of risk, they may be more likely to seek out products or services that offer reassurance or protection against potential losses. In this case, the retailer is using price bonding to create a perceived sense of security for their customers. By offering lower prices on certain items, the retailer is creating an incentive for customers to buy those items even when they do not necessarily need them. This can be particularly effective in situations where there is a high level of uncertainty or unpredictability, such as during economic downturns or natural disasters."
