No, there is always a CPA attack on this system.\nWhen the input message m is chosen randomly and uniformly from the range of the output messages, then it can be shown that the system is CPA-secure. However, if the input message is chosen maliciously or in a way that the attacker can predict its value, then the system may not be CPA-secure.\nIn this case, the function F maps elements of the domain K to elements of the codomain M. The output of the function is defined as the result of applying the function to an element of the domain and performing an XOR operation with the input message. The function F is assumed to be secure, meaning that it does not reveal any information about the input message when applied to random inputs.\nIf the function F is a secure PRF (Prone Random Function), then it satisfies several properties such as being computationally indistinguishable from a random oracle, being pseudorandom, and having bounded memory complexity. In this context, the function F is a secure PRF because it is a permutation on the set of all possible outputs for a given input message.\nHowever, even if the function F is a secure PRF, it is still possible for the adversary to perform a CPA attack on the system. This means that the adversary can choose an arbitrary ciphertext (ciphertext corresponding to some output message) and use it to learn the value of the input message. To achieve CPA-security, the function F must satisfy certain conditions, such as being computationally indistinguishable from a random oracle, being pseudorandom, and having bounded memory complexity.\nTherefore, the answer is B. No, there is always a CPA attack on this system."
