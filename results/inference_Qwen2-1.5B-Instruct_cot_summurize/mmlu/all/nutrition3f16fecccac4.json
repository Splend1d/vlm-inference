Persons with type 1 diabetes rapidly develop chronic complications, while those with type 2 diabetes may require more frequent monitoring and adjustments to their treatment plan. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys its own insulin-producing cells, leading to a lack of insulin and high blood sugar levels. This condition requires immediate medical attention and often results in serious complications such as kidney disease, nerve damage, and cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is a more common condition that affects adults over age 45 and is characterized by an imbalance between insulin production and resistance. While some people with type 2 diabetes may need to take medication or make lifestyle changes, most do not require daily injections of insulin like those with type 1."
