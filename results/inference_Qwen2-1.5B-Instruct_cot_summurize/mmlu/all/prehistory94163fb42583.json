Therefore, option A (they raised livestock at the site, including cattle, sheep, and goats) is unlikely. Option C (they had no domesticated animals but hunted wild animals for meat) is also unlikely as there would be no evidence of hunting activities in the animal tooth analysis. Option B (they brought animals to the site from outside the region) is also unlikely given the lack of evidence of any external sources of resources being used by the people who built Stonehenge. Option D (they hunted antelope, gazelle, and bear) is possible if they were able to obtain these animals through hunting activities. However, this cannot be confirmed without further archaeological evidence."
