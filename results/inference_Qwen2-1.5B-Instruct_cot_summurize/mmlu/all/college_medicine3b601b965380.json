This strategy may prevent Karen from experiencing success, which could lead to feelings of failure and low self-esteem. Instead, Karen's therapist would likely encourage her to take small steps towards improvement, even if they are not perfect, and to celebrate each step forward as a victory. Seeking positive feedback from friends and putting in daily practice on tasks she wishes to improve on can also help build confidence and self-efficacy. Finding others her age and ability who excel at tasks she is interested in can provide motivation and support."
