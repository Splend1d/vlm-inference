It opens during diastole when the right atrium contracts to fill the ventricle with blood. This valve prevents blood from flowing backwards into the right atrium during the relaxation phase of the heartbeat. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the papillary muscles do not prevent the right atrioventricular valve from everting.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the right atrioventricular valve does not remain open during systole (the time of contraction).\n\nOption D is partially correct, but it is not the complete statement. The right atrioventricular valve is indeed responsible for preventing blood from flowing backward into the right atrium during the relaxation phase of the heartbeat, but it is not specifically mentioned in this option."
