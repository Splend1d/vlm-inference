A key step in the synthesis of glycogen is the formation of UDP-glucose.\n\nGlycogen is formed from UDP-glucose through a series of reactions that include phosphorylation, dehydration synthesis, and glucokinase activity. This process occurs in the liver and muscle cells during periods of fasting or low blood sugar levels. The resulting glycogen stores energy for use by the body when glucose supply is limited. \n\nOption B is incorrect because glycogen is not broken down into glucose 6-phosphate in the muscle in the fasting state; rather, it is converted back into glucose through gluconeogenesis.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because glycogen is primarily stored in muscles, but not only in the liver and brain.\n\nOption D is incorrect as well because glucagon does not directly increase the synthesis of glycogen; instead, it stimulates the breakdown of glycogen stores in the liver and muscles to release glucose into the bloodstream to counteract hypoglycemia."
