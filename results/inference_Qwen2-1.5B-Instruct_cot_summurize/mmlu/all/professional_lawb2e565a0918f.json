Under the Secretary's interpretation, the new brochures contained obscene photographs and sexually suggestive language. The Secretary was acting under authority given to him by Section 1123(b) of state statute, which provided:\"Whenever the Secretary of Commerce shall determine that a commercial mailing to residents of the state is inappropriate for minors, the Secretary shall have the authority to prohibit such mailing. \"The case reached the highest court in the state, which held that the statute was unconstitutional, being in violation of both the commerce clause and the supremacy clause. If this case is reviewed by the U. S. Supreme Court, it will reach that court\n\nA. by appeal.\nB. by certiorari.\nC. if five justices vote to review it.\nD. despite the doctrine of adequate and independent state grounds.\n"

The Court can grant certiorari based on various factors, including whether there is an adequate and independent state ground for the lower court's decision, but in this specific case, the state supreme court found the law unconstitutional due to the commerce clause and supremacy clause. Therefore, the U.S. Supreme Court would hear the case and make a ruling on the constitutionality of the law."
