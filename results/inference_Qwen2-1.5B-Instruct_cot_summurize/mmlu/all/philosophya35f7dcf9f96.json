We must first know whether something is right before we can know whether it conforms to God's will.\n\nAccording to Jeremy Bentham's philosophy, moral actions are those that promote happiness and prevent pain. He believed that laws should be based on what promotes the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Therefore, he argued that if an action is not morally right, then it cannot be a law because it would violate the principle of utility, which states that the best action is one that maximizes overall happiness.\n\nBentham believed that God does not interfere with human affairs, so there is no need to ask whether God's will aligns with our moral beliefs. He also believed in the separation of church and state, so he did not believe that religion should influence politics or society."
