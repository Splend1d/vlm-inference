In no-win situations therefore the adversary might calculate that temporary compliance is the best strategic option to buy time.\nB. Coercive diplomacy leaves too much room for compromise. Actors engaging in such behaviour are unlikely to perceive their vital interests as threatened and regard issues as zero-sum because they are aware that force will be used. As a consequence coercive diplomacy can lead to lengthy resolution discussions.\nC. The success ultimately rests on perceptual, psychological and emotional factors, giving rise to the risk that misperception or miscalculation will defeat even a well-executed strategy that otherwise meets all the requirements for success.\nD. The political scope for offering inducements can become unlimited. The problem becomes particularly underlined when the risk of terrorism, WMD or equal military capability comes into play. Inducements can appear to look like concessionary politics and blur the line of what constitutes a success defined as the fear of inescapable escalation.\n"

Psychological and emotional factors: The adversaries may not see the coercing state's actions as threatening and may view it as an opportunity to gain concessions rather than a threat.\n\n2. Perception and misperception: The adversary may have different perceptions of the situation based on incomplete information, leading to incorrect assumptions about the state's intentions and capabilities.\n\n3. Limited political scope: The coercing state has limited ability to offer inducements, which could potentially lead to concessions, as the perceived benefits may outweigh the risks.\n\n4. Risk of escalatory behavior: The coercing state may face pressure to escalate the conflict, leading to a potential cycle of escalation if the adversary perceives the threat.\n\n5. Uncertainty: The coercing state faces uncertainty regarding the outcome of negotiations due to the unpredictable nature of the adversary's reactions and countermeasures."
