Yes, the key is \\(k = m \\oplus c\\), where \\(\\oplus\\) represents the bitwise XOR operation.\n\nTo explain why this is true:\n\n- The message \\(m\\) contains the information needed to encrypt it using the given OTP cipher (c).\n- When we apply the XOR operation between \\(m\\) and \\(c\\), we essentially \"flip\" all the bits in \\(m\\) that correspond to 0s in \\(c\\) with bits in \\(c\\) that correspond to 1s in \\(m\\), effectively \"decrypting\" the message back to its original form.\n- Therefore, the result of the XOR operation is a binary string that contains all the 1s and 0s in \\(m\\) but flipped around the pattern found in \\(c\\).\n\nSo, when we take the XOR of \\(m\\) and \\(c\\), we get a new string of bits that tells us which bits in \\(m\\) were encrypted correctly by the OTP cipher, as well as which bits were not encrypted at all. This gives us a unique key that uniquely decrypts the message, since each bit flip corresponds to a different bit in \\(m\\) being encrypted or not.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer."
