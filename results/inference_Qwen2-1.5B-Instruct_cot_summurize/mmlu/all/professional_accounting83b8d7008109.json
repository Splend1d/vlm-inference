                    "text": "The amount that should be reported as cash in Rune's December 31 balance sheet is $10,000.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- The checkbook balance on December 31 is given as $10,000.\n- The check dated January 3 is listed as being held in the safe but not yet collected from the customer.\n- The check dated December 15 is listed as having been deposited into the checkbook but then returned because it was NSF (not sufficient funds).\n- The check dated January 2 was re-deposited on January 9 and cleared on January 9, so it has already been accounted for in the December 31 checkbook balance.\n\nTherefore, the only item left unaccounted for in the December 31 checkbook balance is the check dated December 15, which was not yet cleared when the December 31 balance sheet was prepared. Since it was re-deposited on January 9, it would have been included in the December 31 balance sheet if it had been cleared before January 9. However, since it was not cleared until after January 9, it does not need to be included in the balance sheet at all.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D) $10,000."
