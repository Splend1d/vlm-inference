This causes an increase in the angular momentum of the man-platform system.\n\nHowever, when the man brings his arms back to his side again, he is not changing the orientation of the moment arm of the man's arms relative to the pivot point of the platform. Therefore, this action does not change the angular momentum of the man-platform system.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the man catching a baseball thrown to him by a friend does not change the angular momentum of the man-platform system.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because the man thrusting his arms out away from his body changes the orientation of the moment arm of the man's arms relative to the pivot point of the platform, but bringing his arms back to his side does not change this orientation.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because the man jumping straight up in the air and landing back on the platform does not change the angular momentum of the man-platform system either."
