Incumbents have a great advantage over challengers because they are better known and can raise campaign funds more easily.\n\nIncumbency provides several advantages to incumbent candidates when running for reelection, such as name recognition, existing donor networks, and familiarity with local constituencies. These factors can make it difficult for challengers to gain traction in the primary or general elections. However, there have been exceptions where incumbent politicians have faced significant challenges in winning reelection (such as the 2018 midterms), so the statement does not necessarily apply to all cases."
