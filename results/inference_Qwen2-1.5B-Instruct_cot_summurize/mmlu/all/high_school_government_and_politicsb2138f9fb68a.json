For example, individuals who are financially stable may be more likely to support policies that prioritize economic growth and prosperity for their community, while those with lower incomes may be more inclined to vote for candidates who advocate for social programs or government assistance. Additionally, changes in the economy over time can shift a person's priorities and beliefs about what is most important in a society, which can influence their voting decisions."
