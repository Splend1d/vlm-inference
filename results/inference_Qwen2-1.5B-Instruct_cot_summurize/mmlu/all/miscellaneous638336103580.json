It was known for its anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic, and anti-elitist platform, which appealed to many Americans who felt marginalized by the growing influence of industrial capitalism and urbanization.\n\nThe party was founded in 1854 by Horace Greeley, a newspaper editor who had previously supported Abraham Lincoln's efforts to abolish slavery. The Know-Nothings' platform called for a return to traditional values and a rejection of what they saw as the corrupting influences of industrialism and urbanization.\n\nDespite their popularity among some segments of American society, the Know-Nothings faced significant opposition from both political parties and other groups. They eventually declined in influence after the end of the Civil War and were largely forgotten by the time of World War I."
