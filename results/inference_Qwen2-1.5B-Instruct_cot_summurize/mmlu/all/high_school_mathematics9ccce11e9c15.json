                    "text": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we know that Rowena takes 14 hours to paint the entire room alone. This means she paints at a rate of \\( \\frac{1}{14} \\) of the room per hour. Similarly, Ruby takes 6 hours to paint the entire room alone, which means she paints at a rate of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the room per hour.\n\nWhen Rowena paints for \\( x \\) hours, she paints \\( x \\times \\frac{1}{14} \\) of the room. When Ruby paints for \\( y \\) hours, she paints \\( y \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the room.\n\nThe total amount painted when both work together is given by the sum of their individual contributions:\n\\[ x \\times \\frac{1}{14} + y \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{x}{14} + \\frac{y}{6} \\]\n\nThis expression represents half of the room painted. Since this must equal the total area of the room (which is \\(1\\) since it's an imaginary concept), we have:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{14} + \\frac{y}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nNext, let's solve this equation for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nTo eliminate fractions, multiply every term by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which is \\(42\\):\n\\[ 42 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{x}{14} + \\frac{y}{6} \\right) = 42 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ 3x + 7y = 42 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find two solutions that satisfy this equation. Let's try different combinations:\n\n**Case 1:**\n- If \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = \\frac{42}{7} = 6 \\). However, this doesn't give us the correct ratio of \\( x : y \\).\n- If \\( x = 1 \\), then \\( y = \\frac{42 - 3}{7} = \\frac{39}{7} \\). This also gives us a fraction, not an integer.\n\n**Case 2:**\n- If \\( x = 2 \\), then \\( y = \\frac{42 - 6}{14} = \\frac{36}{4} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\). Again, this doesn't match our desired integer solution.\n\n**Case 3:**\n- If \\( x = 3 \\), then \\( y = \\frac{42 - 9}{3} = \\frac{33}{3} = 11 \\). This matches our desired integer solution because it's the only case where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers.\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair (\\(x, y)\\) that satisfies all conditions is:\n\\[ (3, 1) \\]\n\nSo, the answer is **D. (1,1)**."
