This means that households have more cash on hand than they would if they were earning higher interest rates, which would allow them to borrow more and stimulate economic growth through increased investment. As a result, the central bank may not be able to expand the money supply as much as it otherwise would, even if other factors like government spending or fiscal policy were favorable. Therefore, options A, B, and C do not limit the ability of a central bank to conduct expansionary monetary policy."
