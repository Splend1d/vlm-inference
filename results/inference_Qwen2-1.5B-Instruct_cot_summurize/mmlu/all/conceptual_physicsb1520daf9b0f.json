When light enters your eye, it's absorbed by the pigment in the cornea (the clear part of the front of your eye), which then reflects the colors back to your retina where they're processed into visual information that you interpret as color. In this case, the red light from the petals is absorbed by the cornea and then reflected out, so what you see is still essentially red."
