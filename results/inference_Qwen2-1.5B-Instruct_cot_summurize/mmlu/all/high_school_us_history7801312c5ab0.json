In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High\u2014the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be a hemisphere\u2014its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation a Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God's natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood\u2014of 'peace and good will amongst men.'\"\nJohn L. O'Sullivan, \"The Great Nation of Futurity,\" 1839\nWhich of the following changes in westward migration is most likely to have occurred in the 1840s?\n\nA. The number of pioneers headed for the Oregon territory decreased while the number headed for California greatly increased.\nB. The first great wave of migration ended, and the number of migrants remained extremely low until after the Civil War.\nC.

                    "text": "Based on the given text, the answer would be D. Large numbers of free blacks, unwelcome in the East, began to resettle in the West.\n\nThe text mentions that the \"nation of many nations\" is destined to manifest \"the excellence of divine principles.\" This suggests that the United States was envisioned as a place where people from different backgrounds could live together peacefully and freely, with opportunities for upward mobility regardless of their origin or status. This idea was reflected in the concept of Manifest Destiny, which promoted the idea of the expansion of the United States into the western territories.\n\nGiven this context, it is more likely that large numbers of free blacks, who were not welcome in the eastern United States due to slavery, would begin to settle in the West during the 1840s. The passage does not provide specific details about the migration patterns at that time, so we cannot determine the exact number of free blacks settling in the West, but it is clear that they were part of the broader movement towards the West that the text describes."
