The symptoms include numbness or weakness in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and little finger, as well as tingling or pain in the fingers. There is no correlation between paraesthesia (numbness) and the severity of the condition, so D is not true. Rheumatoid arthritis can cause swelling in the wrist, but it does not cause carpal tunnel syndrome. Compression of the ulnar nerve is another possible cause of carpal tunnel syndrome, but it is not always present."
