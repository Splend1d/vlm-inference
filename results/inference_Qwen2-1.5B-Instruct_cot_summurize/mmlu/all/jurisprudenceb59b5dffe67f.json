Human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life.\n\nJohn Finnis, an influential philosopher known for his work on natural law theory, rejects Hume's conception of practical reason because he believes that human reason plays a crucial role in determining what constitutes a worthwhile life. According to Finnis, while Hume posited that humans have a \"practical reason\" for acting according to certain principles (such as self-interest or the greatest good for the greatest number), this reasoning is flawed because it relies too heavily on empirical observation and ignores the role of moral intuition and emotional responses.\n\nFinnis argues that our practical reason must be grounded in an understanding of the nature of reality itself, which he calls \"natural law.\" He believes that natural law provides the foundation for all moral principles and that we can use reason to discern what those principles entail. This approach differs from Hume's view, which sees practical reason as primarily concerned with the consequences of actions rather than the underlying principles that motivate them.\n\nIn summary, Finnis' rejection of Hume's conception of practical reason stems from his belief that human reason has a more fundamental role to play in guiding our moral judgments and decisions."
