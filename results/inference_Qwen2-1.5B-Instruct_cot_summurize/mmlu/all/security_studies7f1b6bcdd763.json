Whilst pandemics present a direct risk to national security, they also have the potential to undermine wider international stability.\nC.

The existing mechanisms for monitoring and treating infectious diseases within the international system are capable of effectively containing pandemic outbreaks.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because while there are measures in place to monitor and treat infectious diseases, these systems can be overwhelmed by a global health crisis such as a pandemic. Additionally, the international response to pandemics has been criticized for being slow and ineffective at times, leading to significant loss of life and economic damage. Therefore, it is important to continue improving and strengthening the international response to pandemics."
