Oestrogen\n\nThe hormones that are most commonly associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer are estrogen and progesterone, both of which are produced by the ovaries. When these hormones reach high levels in the body, they can stimulate the development of abnormal cells in the lining of the uterus, leading to endometrial hyperplasia and possibly cancer.\n\nOestrogen is a key regulator of the menstrual cycle and plays a role in many aspects of female physiology, including bone density, muscle mass, and fat distribution. However, it has also been linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nInsulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is another hormone that has been implicated in the development of endometrial cancer. IGF-1 is involved in regulating metabolism and growth, and its overproduction or overactivity has been linked to several cancers, including breast and prostate cancer.\n\nThyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that regulates metabolism and growth. While it does not directly increase the risk of endometrial cancer, it may play a role in the overall health and well-being of women who have thyroid conditions.\n\nIn summary, the hormones that are thought to mediate the increased risk of endometrial cancer in obese individuals include estrogen and oestrogen."
