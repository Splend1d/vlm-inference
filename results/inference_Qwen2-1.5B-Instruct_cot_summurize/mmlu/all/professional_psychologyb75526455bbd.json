Therefore, psychologists should consider whether bartering could be clinically contraindicated before proceeding. Additionally, they should ensure that any bartered items or services do not exploit the client financially or emotionally. If these conditions are met, bartering can be seen as an appropriate way to provide psychological services while maintaining ethical standards."
