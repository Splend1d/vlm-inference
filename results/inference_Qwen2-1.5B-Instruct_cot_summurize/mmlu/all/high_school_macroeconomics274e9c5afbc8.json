It states that:\n\nQ = MV/P\n\nWhere:\n- Q is the quantity of goods and services demanded\n- M is the money supply (the total amount of money available in the economy)\n- V is the velocity of money (how quickly money is spent and saved over time)\n- P is the price level (the average price paid for a unit of a good or service)\n\nSo, the relationship between Q, M, V, and P is that the quantity demanded (Q) depends on the price level (P), the velocity of money (V), and the money supply (M). This equation allows economists to analyze the relationship between the economy's money supply, prices, and demand for goods and services."
