This means that if Homo naledi turns out to be a separate species from the two existing ones, it would challenge our understanding of the history and diversity of early human evolution. Additionally, the fact that Homo naledi fossils are found in an inaccessible cave in South Africa adds to the controversy because it suggests that they may not be representative of the wider range of early human fossils that we currently know about."
