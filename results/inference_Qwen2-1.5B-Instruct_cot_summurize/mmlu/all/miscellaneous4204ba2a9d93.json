He believed that all living beings have inherent value and should be treated with respect and kindness. As such, he is often depicted holding a loaf of bread in one hand and a lamb in the other, symbolizing his belief in the dignity and sanctity of all creatures.\n\nIn addition to his work with animals, Saint Francis also worked tirelessly to spread Christianity throughout Italy and Europe. He founded numerous monasteries and churches, and his teachings continue to inspire people around the world today."
