This is because research suggests that people tend to overestimate the happiness of others and underestimate their own happiness.\n\nThe statement \"In the United States, women's happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men\" is true. Women have made significant progress in terms of gender equality and have achieved higher levels of education and career success compared to men. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean that women are happier than men overall. There may be individual differences in happiness based on various factors such as age, socioeconomic status, and personal circumstances."
