Common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute in the jurisdiction. The purchase price was $50,000, of which the sister paid $10,000 and the brother paid $40,000. The sisterlater mortgaged her interest in the land. The brother then died testate, leaving his entire estate to a cousin. Thesister later paid off her mortgage debt, and the mortgage was released. At the present time, who owns the land?\n\nA. The answer depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien theory or the title theory ofmortgages.\nB. Title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\nC. Title is in the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common.\nD. Title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and thecousin having an 80% interest.\n"

Title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\n\nIn a joint tenancy, if one party dies, the surviving joint tenant automatically becomes the owner of the property. In this case, the sister survived her brother, so she became the sole owner of the property. Therefore, the answer is not C (the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common) because they would only own the property as tenants in common, not jointly. Similarly, the answer is not D (the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and the cousin having an 80% interest), because the sister owned the property outright before her death and the mortgage release did not change that ownership."
