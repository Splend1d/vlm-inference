Walzer, the only way to break out of the \"terrorist cycle\" is by using psychological rather than military tactics. This means that instead of resorting to violence or force, we should try to persuade others to see our perspective and understand our cause. By doing so, we can potentially change their minds and prevent them from becoming terrorists in the first place. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate answer."
