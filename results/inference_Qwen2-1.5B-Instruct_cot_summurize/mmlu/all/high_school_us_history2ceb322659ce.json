Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.\u2026 Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.\u2026 It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries.\u2026 Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work for all Americans again.\u2026 The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.\n\u2014Geraldine Ferraro, Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address, July 19, 1984\nThe ideas expressed in the passage above would most directly have strengthened which of the following during the 1980s?\n\nA.

Opposition to the administration's arms buildup\n\nThe passage discusses Geraldine Ferraro's acceptance speech for the vice presidential nomination in 1984, where she advocates for the need for the government to regulate corporations rather than individuals, as well as the importance of having women play a role in the success of the country. These issues align with the opposition to the administration's arms buildup, which was a significant concern at the time due to the Cold War tensions between the US and its allies. Deregulation efforts were also part of the broader economic reforms of the time, but they did not specifically address the concerns raised by Ferraro. Reforming the welfare system and supporting the administration's cold war policies were not mentioned in the text provided."
