Humans develop increasing abilities to think about moral choices, and our ability to think about the rights of others develops over time.\n\nAccording to Piaget, children go through different stages of cognitive development that correspond to their age and level of maturity. In the preoperational stage (ages 2-7), children use concrete objects and direct experience to understand concepts such as \"I\" and \"mine.\" However, they do not yet have the abstract thinking skills needed to understand the concept of property ownership or the idea of someone else having rights. \n\nIn contrast, the postoperational stage (ages 8-15) allows children to begin thinking abstractly about concepts like \"property\" and \"ownership,\" but they still rely heavily on concrete experiences and sensory input. The final stage, formal operational reasoning, allows children to reason abstractly about complex ideas without relying on concrete examples or sensory input.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: humans develop increasing abilities to think about moral choices, and our ability to think about the rights of others develops over time."
