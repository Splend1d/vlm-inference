The retailer stayed in possession and became the lessee for the next 25 years with monthly payments and various obligations regarding maintaining the property. The retailer had to pay most of the expenses on the property, and had options for further extensions but not to purchase the property back. Within a few years, lessee's business grew and he wanted to tear down one of the buildings and attach a new building to his store. The investor refused to consent. Lessee filed suit asking for an order compelling compliance. Will the court likely order the investor to comply with the lessor's demands?\n\nA. No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.\nB. Yes, the lessee will be able to make the improvements without the investor's consent but the improvements will belong to the investor.\nC. No, because in every sale-leaseback agreement, there is a clause guaranteeing that the lessee cannot make improvements without the written consent of the investor.\nD. Yes, because the lessee's equity interest surpasses the investor's interest, giving the lessee the right to make improvements.\n"

No, it will preclude the lessee from making such drastic changes without the investor's consent.\n\nIn a sale-leaseback arrangement, the lessee becomes the tenant of the property, paying rent to the landlord while retaining ownership rights. However, the lessee has certain obligations and restrictions placed upon them by the lease agreement, including limitations on alterations or improvements to the property. In this case, the lessee wants to build a new structure on the property, which goes against the terms of the lease.\n\nUnder the Sale-Leaseback Agreement, the lessee's equity interest does not exceed the landlord's interest, as the landlord retains title to the property. Therefore, the lessee's ability to make significant improvements would depend on the investor's consent. If the investor refuses to approve the lessee's plans, the lessee may face legal consequences for breaching the lease agreement. In this scenario, the court is likely to order the investor to comply with the lessee's demands if they do not provide written consent to the proposed improvements."
