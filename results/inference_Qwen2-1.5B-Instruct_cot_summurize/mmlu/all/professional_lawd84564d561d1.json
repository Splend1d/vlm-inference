After raking leaves on his property into a large pile, the landowner loaded the leaves into several large metal barrels so that he could burn the leaves. Before starting the fire, the landowner telephoned the local weather bureau to determine which direction the wind would be blowing. Because a highway was located on the southern edge of his property, he was aware that it would be unsafe to burn the leaves if the wind was blowing in that direction. The weather bureau, however, indicated that the wind would be gusting in a northerly direction. Shortly after the landowner set the leaves on fire, the wind current unexpectedly shifted and started gusting in a southerly direction. As a consequence, the smoke and ashes blew over the highway, resulting in poor visibility. Moments later, a motorist was driving his automobile on the highway in a westerly direction. The posted speed limit was 45 m. p. h. , although the driver was traveling about 55 m. p. h. The driver could not see the highway clearly and crashed his vehicle into a median strip. If the driver asserts a claim against the landowner, the most likely result is\n\nA. the landowner will prevail, because the driver was driving in excess of the speed limit.\nB. the landowner will prevail, if his decision to burn the leaves was reasonable under the circumstances.\nC. the driver will prevail, if the smoke from the burning leaves prevented him from clearly seeing the roadway.\nD. the driver will prevail, because the landowner will be strictly liable for causing the accident.\n"

However, the unexpected shift in wind direction when setting the leaves on fire caused the smoke and ashes to blow over the highway, leading to poor visibility and the crash of the motorist's vehicle. Therefore, the landowner may be held responsible for any injuries or damages caused by the accident due to their negligence in allowing the wind to change directions during the burning process."
