This means that $(x-2)^2$ should be present on the right-hand side. Therefore,\n\n\\[(x-2)^2 = 0\\]\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n\\[x - 2 = 0\\]\n\\[x = 2\\]\n\nSubstituting $x=2$ into either equation from above gives us the corresponding $y$-coordinate:\n\n\\[y_1 = 2^2 + 2*2 + 7 = 4 + 4 + 7 = 15\\]\n\nSo, the intersection point is $(2, 15)$.\n\nNow, comparing this to the given line $y_2 = 6x + b$, since the line intersects the parabola at only one point, the y-coordinate of the intersection point must also satisfy the line's equation. Substituting $x=2$ back in, we get:\n\n\\[y_2 = 6*2 + b = 12 + b\\]\n\nSince we know the parabola has an $y$-intercept of 7 (when $x=0$), and we've found our intersection point at $(2, 15)$, which satisfies the line equation when $x=2$, we can substitute these values into the line's equation to solve for $b$:\n\n\\[15 = 6*2 + b\\]\n\\[15 = 12 + b\\]\n\\[b = 15 - 12\\]\n\\[b = 3\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of $b$ is $\\boxed{3}$."
