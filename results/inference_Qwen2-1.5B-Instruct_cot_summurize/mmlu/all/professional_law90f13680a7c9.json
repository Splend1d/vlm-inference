Three tellers identified the defendant as the robber, a latent fingerprint found on the bank counter linked the defendant to the scene, and bank money had been found in the defendant's car. The police had arrested the defendant immediately after the robbery, as the defendant was driving away from the bank. the bank. When the prosecution rested its case, the judge directed the jury to return a verdict of guilty. The defense attorney did not object at the time. The jury withdrew, discussed the case, and agreed to a guilty verdict. The jury returned to the courtroom and announced the guilty verdict. The defense attorney then voiced an objection to the judge's having directed the verdict. The court overruled the objection and sentenced the defendant to 20 years in prison. On appeal, what should the appellate court do?\n\nA. Affirm the conviction, because the defense attorney failed to timely object to the judge's action.\nB. Affirm the conviction, because the prosecution presented both circumstantial and direct evidence conclusively establishing the defendant's guilt.\nC. Reverse the conviction, because the defense attorney's failure to timely object to the judge's action constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\nD. Reverse the conviction, because the judge's action in directing the verdict denied the defendant his constitutional right to a trial by jury.\n"

Reverse the conviction, because the judge's action in directing the verdict denied the defendant his constitutional right to a trial by jury.\n\nUnder the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the right to a trial by jury applies to all criminal cases where the defendant is tried \"by the jury.\" In this case, the jury convicted the defendant based on overwhelming evidence of guilt, but the judge improperly directed the verdict without allowing the defendant to present any evidence or argument. This violates the defendant's right to a fair trial under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Therefore, the appellate court should reverse the conviction."
