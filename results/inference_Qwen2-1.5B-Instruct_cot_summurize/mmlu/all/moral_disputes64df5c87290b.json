In this scenario, the patient may not be aware of what is happening and could potentially suffer more if they were to experience physical pain or discomfort during the process. Passive euthanasia, on the other hand, involves the physician ending the patient's life by means of an overdose of medication or another form of intervention. This type of euthanasia typically does not involve any conscious decision-making by the patient, and therefore may result in a lower level of suffering for the patient. However, it is important to note that both forms of euthanasia can have serious ethical implications and should only be performed under strict medical guidelines and with the informed consent of the patient."
