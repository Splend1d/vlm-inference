Students are taught individual letter sounds first, followed by letter combination sounds and the rules of putting these combinations together to make words.\n\nTraditional phonics instruction emphasizes the importance of teaching students how to identify and manipulate individual letters (phonemes) and their corresponding sounds, which is crucial for building a strong foundation in reading. This method involves breaking down words into their constituent sounds, often through the use of charts or visual aids, so that students can match each sound with its correct spelling pattern. Over time, this approach helps students develop the ability to read new words quickly and accurately, as well as improve their comprehension skills."
