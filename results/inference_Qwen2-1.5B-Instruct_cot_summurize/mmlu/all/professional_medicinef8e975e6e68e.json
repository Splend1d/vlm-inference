Aside from paraplegia, lower extremity muscle atrophy, and lower abdominal surgical scars, the physical examination discloses no abnormalities. He had an episode of anaphylaxis secondary to latex allergy during a previous operation for functional expansion of his bladder through a bowel anastomosis. Which of the following is most important to consider in the care of this patient?\n\nA. Administration of injectable medications with disposable syringes\nB.

These complications can be particularly dangerous for patients with compromised renal function due to their history of calcium oxalate kidney stones. Therefore, it is essential that the patient's healthcare team carefully assesses the risks and benefits of using rubber urethral catheters before proceeding with any procedures involving these devices."
