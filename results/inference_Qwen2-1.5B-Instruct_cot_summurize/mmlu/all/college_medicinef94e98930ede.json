An increase in the heterochromatin:euchromatin ratio leads to a decrease in gene expression because it increases the amount of DNA that is packaged into chromatin and therefore inaccessible for transcription. This process is known as \"heterochromatinization.\" \n\nHistone modification enzymes like histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in regulating gene expression by altering the chromatin structure. HATs add acetyl groups to histones, while HDACs remove or modify these groups.\n\nIn general, an increase in either type of histone modification enzyme would promote open chromatin and increased gene expression, rather than decreasing it. However, if the increase in histone modification occurs at sites where the gene is not actively transcribed, this could lead to a decrease in gene expression due to decreased accessibility of the DNA to transcription factors."
