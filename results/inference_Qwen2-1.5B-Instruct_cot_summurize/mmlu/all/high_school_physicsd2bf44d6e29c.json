The kinetic energy at the point where the stone hits the water will be equal to the potential energy it gains as it falls through the same distance in air (which we'll call h). We can use this to set up an equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mgh + \\frac{1}{2}mv'^2 \\]\n\nwhere v' is the velocity of the stone just before it hits the water, and v is its final velocity. Rearranging for v', we get:\n\n\\[ v' = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(gh)}{m}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values given: g=9.8 m/s\u00b2, h=4 meters, and m=30 kg, we get:\n\n\\[ v' = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(9.8)(4)}{30}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{78.4}{30}} = \\sqrt{2.616} \\approx 1.6\\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 50 m/s."
