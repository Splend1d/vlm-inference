Helium atom.\n\nWhile the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can provide approximate solutions for many physical systems, it cannot always give exact solutions due to the complexity and non-linearity of the equations involved. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the time-evolution of quantum mechanical systems, including atoms, molecules, and other particles. However, for certain systems, such as the hydrogen atom or the electron in an atom, the wavefunction may not be analytically tractable and must be determined numerically using numerical methods such as the finite element method or molecular dynamics simulations."
