Portfolio assessment\n\nPortfolio assessment involves collecting and reviewing a student's work over time, allowing teachers to see how their writing has developed from one point in the school year to another. This approach provides a comprehensive evaluation that takes into account the student's progress in developing various aspects of their writing, such as grammar, mechanics, vocabulary, and sentence structure. It also allows for feedback on specific areas where students may need additional support or attention."
