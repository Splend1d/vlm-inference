When anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) first arrived in the Middle East around 40,000-30,000 years ago, they encountered the ancestors of both Neandertals and Homo erectus. These early humans were similar to each other genetically but differed in their physical characteristics such as their size, shape, and behavior. The presence of these three groups of early humans suggests that the Middle East was a diverse and dynamic place during this time period."
