The primary purpose of the statute is to help alleviate the state's high rate of unemployment.

The statute will help racial minorities living in the state obtain gainful employment.\nB. The state has the highest unemployment rate in the country.\nC. If the state uses its own taxpayer funds to purchase construction materials, it is responsible for creating demand for the required labor.\nD. The statute was overwhelmingly adopted by the voters of the state.\n"

This argument suggests that the statute is designed to create jobs and stimulate economic activity within the state, which is consistent with the primary purpose of the statute mentioned in the question (to help alleviate the state's high rate of unemployment). \n\nOption A could also be considered, but it depends on how closely tied the racial minorities living in the state are to the construction industry. Option B does not directly relate to the purpose of the statute, while option D is more about the political process rather than the effectiveness of the statute itself."
