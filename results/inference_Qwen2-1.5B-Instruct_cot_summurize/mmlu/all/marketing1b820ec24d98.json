Competitor-oriented approach.\n\nIn this approach, companies analyze their competitors' pricing strategies and adjust their own prices accordingly to compete effectively in the market. This can involve setting prices that are higher or lower than those of competitors, or maintaining consistent pricing levels despite changes in competition. The goal is often to maximize profits by ensuring that prices are competitive enough to attract customers while also being profitable for the company."
