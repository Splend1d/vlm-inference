A formal process of planning to fill a role that will become vacant\n\nA succession plan is a formal process of planning to fill a role that will become vacant, typically within a company or organization. It involves identifying potential candidates who meet the qualifications and requirements for the position, evaluating their skills and experience, and selecting the most qualified candidate to take on the job when it becomes available. This can include developing training programs, providing ongoing support and guidance, and ensuring that the transition from one individual to another is smooth and successful. Succession planning helps ensure that the organization has a pipeline of talented individuals ready to step into leadership roles as needed."
