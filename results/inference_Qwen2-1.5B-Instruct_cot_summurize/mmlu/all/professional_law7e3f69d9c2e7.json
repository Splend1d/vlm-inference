The fact that the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note does not affect its priority as the bank's note is secured by a purchase-money mortgage, meaning it is superior to any other liens or encumbrances on the property, including the seller's note. Therefore, the bank's mortgage takes precedence over the seller's note."
