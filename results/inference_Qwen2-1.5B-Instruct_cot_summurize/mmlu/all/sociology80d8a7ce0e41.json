All of the above.\n\nMurray's concept of the \"underclass\" was based on the idea that some individuals or groups in society were socially disadvantaged and lacked access to resources and opportunities, often due to factors such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of education. He believed that these individuals were unable to rise out of their circumstances and become productive members of society, and that they should be considered a separate class from those who had more opportunities and resources.\nTherefore, Murray's view included all of the options listed: they were seen as having lower intelligence, immoral lifestyles, and excessive reliance on welfare benefits."
