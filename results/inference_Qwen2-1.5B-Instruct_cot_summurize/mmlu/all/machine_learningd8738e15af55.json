False, False\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect because it suggests that the SVM learning algorithm guarantees finding the globally optimal solution, which is not necessarily true. In fact, there can be multiple local optima for SVMs.\n\nStatement 2 is correct because mapping a perceptron from one space to another using a radial basis function (RBF) can potentially improve its classification performance, as RBFs allow the perceptron to learn more complex relationships between features and labels. However, it cannot guarantee better performance without additional assumptions or constraints on the problem at hand."
