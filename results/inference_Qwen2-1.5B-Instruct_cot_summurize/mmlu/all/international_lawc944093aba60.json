This concept was developed during World War II when many countries joined together to form the United Nations and pledged to defend each other if attacked.\n\nUnder collective security, states agree to come together as a group to take action against an attack or aggression from another country or group. This can include military intervention, economic sanctions, or diplomatic pressure. Collective security is based on the principle that stronger nations have a responsibility to protect weaker ones, and that any state that fails to do so will be held accountable for its actions.\n\nIt is important to note that collective security does not mean that all members of the group must be willing or able to use force to defend themselves. Instead, it requires cooperation and commitment among member states to address common threats."
