Testimony concerning subsequent repairs to the truck paid for by the trucking company where they have stipulated to ownership.\n\nThis piece of evidence is most likely to be admitted because it relates to the defendant's liability in the case. The court may consider this evidence to determine whether the defendant was negligent or reckless in causing the accident that resulted in the plaintiff's injuries. Additionally, if the defendant can prove that the repairs were necessary due to the damage caused by the accident, the court may also rule that the defendant should bear some responsibility for the plaintiff's damages."
