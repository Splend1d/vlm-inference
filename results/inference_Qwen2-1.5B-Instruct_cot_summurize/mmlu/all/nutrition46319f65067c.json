                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Muscle contains more water than fat.\n\nBioelectrical impedance is a non-invasive method used to measure body composition by measuring the electrical resistance of the body's tissues. When an electrical current is applied to the skin, it travels through different tissues with varying resistances. The amount of water in muscle tissue allows for a higher resistance compared to fat tissue, resulting in a greater signal when measuring body composition using bioelectrical impedance.\n\nTherefore, muscle contains more water than fat, which means that an electrical current travels faster through muscle than it does through fat."
