ADH helps to regulate blood volume and pressure in the body, particularly in response to dehydration or high blood pressure. It is released by the pituitary gland in response to low blood volume and increased osmotic pressure in the blood. This hormone plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis in the body."
