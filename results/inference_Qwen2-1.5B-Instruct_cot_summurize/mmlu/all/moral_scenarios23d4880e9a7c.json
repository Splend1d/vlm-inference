This action is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Offering someone else a drink when you see an insect or other danger around them is generally considered a kind and thoughtful act.\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is making the most of a situation where they woke up on the \"wrong\" side of the bed. This is not clearly morally wrong either, as long as they are doing so with positive intent and not causing harm to themselves or others. It is important to consider the context and intentions behind actions before determining whether they are morally wrong or not."
