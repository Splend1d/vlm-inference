Almost immediately, photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photons minus the work function of the metal.\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Almost immediately, photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photons minus the work function of the metal.\n\nIf the intensity of the light is increased, the number of photons hitting the surface per unit time increases. This means that more electrons will have enough energy to escape the surface and become photoelectrons. The kinetic energy of these electrons will therefore be greater than the energy of the incident photons, but less than the work function of the metal. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons will be approximately equal to the difference between the energy of the incident photons and the work function of the metal."
