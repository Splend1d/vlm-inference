It does not directly measure the absence of essential goods or services such as access to a bath or shower, housing with structural defects, or going without a week's holiday.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct because it refers to the lack of access to basic necessities like a bath or shower, which is an important component of Townsend's indicator of relative deprivation. Option B is also correct since it pertains to the structural deficiencies of housing, which can significantly impact an individual's ability to live comfortably and securely. Option D is correct because it refers to the lack of time for leisure activities, which is another aspect of Townsend's indicator that can contribute to feelings of deprivation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it is not one of the indicators used by Townsend and colleagues in their 1979 study to measure relative deprivation."
