Nitrogen's electronegativity value is less than that of phosphorus because nitrogen is larger, but greater than that of oxygen because nitrogen has a greater effective nuclear charge.\n\nElectronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons towards itself. It is generally higher in atoms with more protons or larger atomic size (radius). In this case, nitrogen has 7 protons and a radius of approximately 0.15 \u00c5, while phosphorus has 15 protons and a radius of approximately 0.12 \u00c5. Oxygen has 8 protons and a radius of approximately 0.13 \u00c5. \n\nTherefore, nitrogen has a higher atomic size and a greater effective nuclear charge compared to phosphorus and oxygen, which results in its lower electronegativity."
