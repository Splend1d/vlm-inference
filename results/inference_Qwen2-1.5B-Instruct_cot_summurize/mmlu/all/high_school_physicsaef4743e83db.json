Since the charges on each capacitor will distribute themselves evenly across the plates, the total charge on the combination will also be the sum of the charges on each individual capacitor. Similarly, the voltage across each capacitor will be the same because they are in parallel connection. Therefore, all three quantities - the charge stored on the capacitor, the voltage across the capacitor, and the capacitance of the capacitor - must be the same for both capacitors when they are connected in parallel."
