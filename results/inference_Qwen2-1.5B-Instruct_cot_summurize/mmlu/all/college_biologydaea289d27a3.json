Producing a hybrid cell\n\nHybrid cells, also known as chimeric cells or recombinant cells, are produced by introducing genetic material (e.g., DNA) into a non-viable cell. In this case, the genetic material is typically introduced through viral vectors like retroviruses, which can integrate into the host cell's genome.\n\nThe integration of foreign genetic material into the host cell's genome allows for the expression of genes from the donor organism, leading to the production of new proteins. This process can result in the creation of hybrid cells that exhibit characteristics of both the donor and recipient cells, such as altered growth properties, increased susceptibility to certain diseases, or the ability to express new proteins.\n\nIn the context of producing a fusion of mouse and human cell surfaces, the most likely technique would involve inserting a viral vector containing the necessary genetic material for surface protein integration into a normal cell. The resulting hybrid cell could then be used to study the dynamics of proteins on the plasma membrane, as described in your question."
