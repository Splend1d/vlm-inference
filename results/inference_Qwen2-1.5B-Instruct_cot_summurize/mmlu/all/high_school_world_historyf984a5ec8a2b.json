Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nMost classical empires shared which of the following traits?\n\nA. They required the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire.\nB. They provided state support of foreign religions to improve support of the government.\nC. They embarked on widespread public works projects to integrate their empires.\nD. They had government bureaucracies based on the merit principle.\n"

This means that they had systems in place to promote individuals based on their abilities and achievements rather than on their social status or wealth. This was often reflected in the structure of the government itself, such as through the appointment of officials based on their qualifications and expertise.\n\nIn contrast, some other traits mentioned in the passage (such as requiring cultural assimilation or providing state support of foreign religions) do not necessarily characterize all classical empires equally well. For example, while it's true that some classical empires did require the cultural assimilation of conquered peoples to limit diversity within the empire (as seen in the case of the Romans), this does not apply universally across all classical empires. Similarly, while it's true that some empires provided state support of foreign religions (e.g., the Greeks supported various forms of religion during their conquests), this also does not necessarily apply universally across all classical empires.\n\nOverall, the key trait that most classical empires shared was the existence of merit-based government bureaucracies."
