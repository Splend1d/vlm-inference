Inspiratory component louder and longer with a gap between inspiration and expiration.\n\nThis type of breathing pattern, also known as forced expiratory flow (FEF), is characterized by an inspiratory component that is louder and lasts for a longer duration than the expiration phase. The gap between expiration and inspiration is smaller in FEF compared to other types of breathing patterns such as normal or assisted expiration.\n\nIn contrast, bronchial breathing is characterized by a shorter gap between expiration and inspiration, making it more similar to normal or assisted expiration."
