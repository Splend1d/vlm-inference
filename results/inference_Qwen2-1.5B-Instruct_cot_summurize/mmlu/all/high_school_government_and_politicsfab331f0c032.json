They raise money to influence federal, state, and local elections\n\nPolitical Action Committees (PACs) are organizations that are created and funded by individuals or groups with the purpose of influencing political campaigns. They can support any candidate or issue they choose, as long as it does not violate laws against corruption or false advertising. PACs are not required to disclose their donors, but they must register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) if they have more than $10,000 in receipts from individuals or corporations. PACs are one of the few ways that ordinary citizens can directly influence politics, and they play an important role in shaping public policy."
