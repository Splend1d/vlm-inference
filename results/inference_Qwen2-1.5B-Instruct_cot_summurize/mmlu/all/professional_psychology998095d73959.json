In an approach-approach conflict, both parties involved want to achieve their own goal, but neither will compromise on their position. Therefore, they continue to push towards their respective goals, which can lead to prolonged oscillation and reduced attractiveness of the outcome approached. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that the conflict will continue indefinitely without resolution, which is not necessarily true in all cases.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because it suggests that the conflict will decrease in attraction, which may or may not be the case depending on the specific circumstances of the conflict.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because it suggests that the conflict will revert back in the opposite direction, which is not always the case either."
