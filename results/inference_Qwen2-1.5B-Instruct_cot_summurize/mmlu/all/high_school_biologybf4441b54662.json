These traits are not always linked directly to specific genes but can be influenced by many different genes in different ways.\n\nHeterozygous traits are those with two copies of a single gene, which means they inherit from both parents, so they have two alleles for each trait.\n\nPleiotropic traits refer to traits that are influenced by environmental factors as well as genetic factors, such as climate or diet, and do not necessarily involve multiple genes.\n\nBlended alleles refer to a situation where there is an overlap between the effects of two alleles at a particular locus on a given trait, leading to a new phenotype that is intermediate between the two original ones. This does not imply that these alleles are actually affecting the same trait."
