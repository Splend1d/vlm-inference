Using garden shears to cut down on your trellis could result in damage that you may not have intended to cause, and it goes against the principles of respecting others' property rights.

It's not harmful to anyone else and serves a practical purpose by helping you make informed purchasing decisions. So, the answer is:\n\nNot wrong, Not wrong"
