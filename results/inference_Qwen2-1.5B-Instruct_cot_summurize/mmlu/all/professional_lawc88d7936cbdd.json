This statement implies that the estate will automatically terminate if drugs are used on the property, which is not necessarily true under the conditions specified in the estate document. \n\nA fee simple determinable refers to a type of fee simple that allows the grantor to reclaim the property by exercising a right of reentry after a certain period of time, such as 10 years. In contrast, a fee simple subject to condition subsequent requires a reentry first before title can be terminated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A), and the other options are not applicable or incorrect based on the given information."
