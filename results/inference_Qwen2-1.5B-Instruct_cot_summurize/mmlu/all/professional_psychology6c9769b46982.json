In this case, it is important to respect the wishes of the deceased individual and their family. If the mother has not provided explicit consent for access to her daughter's records, it would not be appropriate to release any information without proper authorization. Additionally, releasing sensitive medical information can potentially cause harm to the family members involved, especially if the information could lead to negative consequences or stigma associated with the death. Therefore, it is essential to seek guidance from legal professionals or family advisors before making any decisions regarding the release of medical records."
