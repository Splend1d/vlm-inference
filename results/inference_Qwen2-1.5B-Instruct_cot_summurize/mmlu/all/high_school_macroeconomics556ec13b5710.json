Increase travel abroad.\n\nWhen the dollar depreciates, it becomes cheaper for foreigners to buy American goods and services, which can lead to an increase in tourism and travel expenses. This can also result in higher prices for foreign visitors who may choose to stay longer or spend more money on their trips. However, this does not necessarily mean that exports will increase as the same amount of dollars could be used to purchase fewer goods domestically if they become more expensive. The impact on a country's trade balance depends on other factors such as import and export volumes, exchange rates, and economic policies."
