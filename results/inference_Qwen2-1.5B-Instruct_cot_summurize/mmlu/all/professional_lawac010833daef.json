When a person is under guardianship, they are considered incapacitated and therefore cannot enter into legally binding contracts without the express consent of their guardian. In this case, the father's guardian had the authority to enter into the contract, but the father did not have the same authority. Therefore, the contract is voidable at the option of the father."
