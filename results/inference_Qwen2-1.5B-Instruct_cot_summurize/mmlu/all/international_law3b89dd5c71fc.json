They are peremptory norms of international law, from which no derogations are allowed and which can never be altered even with the consent of the States. The Jus Cogens are considered as \"absolute\" norms of international law that cannot be modified or overridden by any other legal norm or treaty.\nThese norms include the prohibition of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity, which are recognized as fundamental principles of international law. The Jus Cogens norms have been codified in the United Nations Charter and are considered to be part of the foundation of international law."
