The school psychologist has included achievement and aptitude scores as predictor variables for firstyear high school GPA in a regression analysis and is considering whether to also administer a school interest inventory and include those scores. The major concern of the school psychologist when making this decision should be which of the following?\n\nA. The intercorrelation of the aptitude and achievement test scores\nB. The degree to which the school interest inventory score raises the multiple correlation when it is included as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA\nC. The zero-order correlation of first-year high school GPA and the school interest inventory score\nD. The difference in the correlations of the school interest inventory scores with first-year high school GPA and the aptitude and achievement test scores with first-year high school GPA\n"

The school psychologist should consider whether including the school interest inventory score will raise the multiple correlation when it is added as a predictor variable of first-year high school GPA, compared to adding only the aptitude and achievement test scores. This is because the school interest inventory may provide additional information about the student's interests and abilities that can help explain their performance on other tests or measures of academic success. Including such an inventory may therefore improve the predictive power of the model and lead to better predictions of first-year high school GPA."
