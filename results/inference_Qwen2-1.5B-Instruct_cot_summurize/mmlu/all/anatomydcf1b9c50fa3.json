The most common cause of pernicious anemia is the autoimmune destruction of the parietal cells that secrete vitamin B-12 into the small intestine. Treatment for pernicious anemia typically involves regular injections of vitamin B-12 to replace the lost vitamin and prevent further complications. While other conditions such as Bell's palsy, Crohn's disease, and Graves' disease can affect vitamin B-12 levels or lead to deficiencies, they do not require injections of vitamin B-12 therapy."
