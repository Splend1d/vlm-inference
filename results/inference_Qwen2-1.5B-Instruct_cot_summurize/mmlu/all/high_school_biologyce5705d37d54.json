However, C is particularly relevant because it suggests that there may be a genetic drift effect at play in island populations, which could lead to speciation over time.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Birds can be found on islands located farther from the mainland than the birds' maximum nonstop flight distance."
