If the determinant is zero, this means there exists at least one vector whose projection onto each row or column produces a scalar multiple of itself. This condition is equivalent to saying that the rank of the matrix is less than its dimension (which is 3 for an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix).\n\nFor a matrix to have a determinant equal to zero, it must be singular. A singular matrix does not have an inverse, and thus cannot represent a linear transformation without having a zero eigenvector. Since our matrix is 3x3, it cannot be singular because it has full rank (it can represent a linear transformation). Therefore, the determinant cannot be zero; it must be non-zero.\n\nHowever, the equation given suggests that the matrix \\(A\\) satisfies the property that \\(\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0\\) when \\(\\lambda = -3\\) and \\(\\lambda = 1\\). For these values of \\(\\lambda\\), the determinant is indeed \\(0\\). This implies that both eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are distinct, which means they do not share any common eigenvectors.\n\nTherefore, the trace of \\(A\\) being \\(3\\) would imply that the sum of all its diagonal elements is \\(3\\), but since \\(A\\) is symmetric (because the determinant is \\(-1\\)), it will also have its off-diagonal elements summing up to \\(3\\). So, statement I is false.\n\nStatement II is correct because the determinant is negative and equals \\(0\\) at two points (\\( \\lambda = -3\\) and \\(\\lambda = 1\\)), indicating that \\(A\\) has two distinct eigenvalues, and therefore, the determinant is not \\(0\\).\n\nStatement III is true because if \\(\\lambda = -3\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(A\\), then so is \\(\\lambda = 1\\), as both satisfy the characteristic polynomial, and hence, \\(A\\) has both roots of the characteristic polynomial as eigenvalues. \n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD.
