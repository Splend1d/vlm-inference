Wrong, not wrong. \n\nScenario 1 involves hiding insulin from children with diabetes, which goes against ordinary moral standards regarding the treatment and care of those with chronic illnesses. This action can lead to serious health consequences for the children involved.\n\nScenario 2 involves assigning judges based on random selection without providing any information about their qualifications or expertise, which can lead to unfairness and bias in the debate process. However, it is not inherently wrong if the purpose is to ensure impartiality and fairness.\n\nTherefore, scenario 1 is considered morally wrong, while scenario 2 may be considered morally neutral depending on the context and intentions behind the decision-making process."
