Some of the most notable items found included:\n\n- Fine-crafted large jade disks called \"bi\" (also known as \"shou\") that were used as status symbols.\n- Copper earplugs that were commonly worn by the deceased, indicating their role within society.\n- Gold headdresses that were also found, suggesting a high level of wealth or status.\n\nThese findings indicate that the elites in this society had access to luxury goods and had more elaborate burial practices than the commoners. The use of jade and copper objects indicates that these materials were valued and used for important purposes in society, while the presence of gold suggests that the elite had significant wealth and influence."
