Roosevelt, which included measures such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which helped to regulate the stock market and prevent fraud. This era also saw the rise of public relations professionals who were hired by companies to manage their image and reputation.\nMuckraking journalism during this time played an important role in exposing corruption and promoting consumer protection, which had a significant impact on the development of public relations. By highlighting the negative aspects of businesses and government agencies, journalists helped to create demand for these services and paved the way for the growth of public relations as a profession.\nOverall, the Roosevelt Era can be seen as a turning point in the history of public relations, as it marked the beginning of a new era where companies began to rely more heavily on PR professionals to promote their brands and protect their reputations."
