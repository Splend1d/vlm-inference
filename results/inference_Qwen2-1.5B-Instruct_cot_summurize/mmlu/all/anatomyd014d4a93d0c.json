Space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity\n\nThis statement is correct because during the first two decades of life, the maxilla grows slowly, with most of its growth occurring between the ages of 10-20 years. During this time, the maxillary tuberosity (the bump on the back side of the maxilla) is resorbed, creating space for the eruption of the permanent molars.\n\nOption A is incorrect because pneumatisation of the developing maxillary sinus does not cease at puberty. It continues throughout childhood and adolescence. \n\nOption C is also incorrect because the zygomaticomaxillary sutures do not contribute to the increase in height and length of the maxilla. These sutures are responsible for connecting the upper jaw bones together and are present from birth.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the intermaxillary suture typically closes around six years postnatally, but it can take longer or even never close completely depending on factors such as genetics and oral hygiene."
