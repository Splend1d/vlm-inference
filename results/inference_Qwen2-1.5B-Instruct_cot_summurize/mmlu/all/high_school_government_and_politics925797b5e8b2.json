Federalism is a political philosophy that emphasizes the division of governmental powers among multiple levels of government, typically at the federal and state levels. It allows for different levels of government to have different responsibilities and competencies, with each level having some degree of autonomy and flexibility in its own governance.\n\nIn the context of American government, federalism has been a central feature since the Constitution was adopted in 1789. The Constitution established a system of three branches of government: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Each branch has its own set of powers and responsibilities, and they operate independently but also interact with one another. This system of federalism is designed to prevent any single branch from becoming too powerful or dominating the other branches.\n\nIn summary, the term \"federalism\" refers to the system of dividing and sharing power between the national and state governments as outlined by the Constitution of the United States."
