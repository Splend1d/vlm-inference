This property allows the brain to compensate for damage or injury by forming new neural connections and pathways that can help restore function.\n\nIn children with brain damage, brain plasticity may play an important role in allowing them to recover more quickly from injuries compared to adults. However, it is worth noting that the specific benefits of brain plasticity may vary depending on the type and extent of the damage. Additionally, other factors such as age, genetics, and individual differences also play a role in recovery outcomes."
