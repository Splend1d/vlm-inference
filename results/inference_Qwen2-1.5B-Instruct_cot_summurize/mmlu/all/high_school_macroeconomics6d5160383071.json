This means that one country can produce more of a good than it can consume domestically due to its comparative advantage, which allows it to sell excess production to the other country.\n\nTrade does not allow each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve; rather, it leads to economies of scale and higher productivity as firms compete with each other to become better at producing certain goods or services. Therefore, option B is incorrect. \n\nOption C is also incorrect because trade does not necessarily occur based solely on the principle of absolute advantage. Other factors such as technology, infrastructure, and market demand can also influence trade patterns. \n\nOption D is also incorrect because protectionist policies do not allow each nation to consume beyond the production possibility curve; instead, they restrict imports and export to protect domestic industries, leading to lower productivity and economic inefficiency."
