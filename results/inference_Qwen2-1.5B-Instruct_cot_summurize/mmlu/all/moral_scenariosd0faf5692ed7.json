This behavior goes against ethical principles such as compassion, empathy, and respect for life. Therefore, it can be considered morally wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 1 involves collecting someone's mail when they are not around, which is generally seen as a harmless act of kindness. However, if this action causes inconvenience or annoyance to others, it may still be considered morally questionable depending on the context and circumstances."
