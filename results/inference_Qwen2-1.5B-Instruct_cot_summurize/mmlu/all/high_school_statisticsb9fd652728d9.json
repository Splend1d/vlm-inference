The manager takes a random sample of 10 salespeople from each location independently and records the sales revenue generated by each person during the last four weeks. He decides to use a t-test to compare the mean sales revenue at the two locations. Which of the following assumptions is necessary for the validity of the t-test?\n\nA. The population standard deviations at both locations are equal.\nB. The population standard deviations at both locations are not equal.\nC.

This assumption is important because it allows us to use the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal if the population is normally distributed and the sample size is large enough (at least 30 in this case).\n\nTherefore, the presence or absence of a normal distribution among the sales records at each location is essential for the validity of the t-test. If the population distributions are not normally distributed, we may still be able to conduct a t-test using non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test, but they would not be valid for comparing means across groups."
