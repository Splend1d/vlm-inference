By 1920 that fear was beginning to recede and Addison's policy was being regarded as extravagant. An immediate victim of the new attitude was the Borough's Kingfield Street scheme, provisional plans for which were approved in September 1920. Much to the Council's surprise, the Government's Housing Board deferred the scheme, \"having regard to the Council's present commitments and the money available at the present time, and in May 1921 the Government announced a drastic curtailment of the housing programme, cutting the housing target by half.\n\u2014Excerpt from a work by English historian Hermione Hobhouse Public Housing in Poplar: The Inter-war Years, 1994\nWhich of the following is the best description of the plans being changed above?\n\nA. Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.\nB. Housing was a large part of the British budget.\nC. Workers were threatening communist revolution.\nD. The government Housing Board wanted to build more houses.\n"

The passage states that the government's Housing Board deferred the Kingfield Street scheme because it was not considered feasible given the council's current commitments and the limited funds available at the time. This suggests that there was a change in the government's priorities or goals regarding housing, rather than any changes in welfare programs or workers' attitudes towards communism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The government Housing Board wanted to build more houses."
