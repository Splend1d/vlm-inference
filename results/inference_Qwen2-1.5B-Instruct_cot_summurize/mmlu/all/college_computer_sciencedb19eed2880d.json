It is inherently nonassociative because there have to be upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers.\n\nFloating-point arithmetic does not require upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers, unlike fixed-point arithmetic where the range of representable values must be specified. In floating-point arithmetic, the size of numbers can vary depending on their precision requirements, but this is not necessarily related to the requirement for upper and lower bounds on the size of numbers. Therefore, option B is incorrect."
