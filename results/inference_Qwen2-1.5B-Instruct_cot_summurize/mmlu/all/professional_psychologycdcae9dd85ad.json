This allows him to continue seeing clients while also ensuring that he has access to additional support and expertise when needed.\n\nOption A is not appropriate because it suggests refusing to see clients who need help, which could result in them seeking care from unsuitable professionals.\n\nOption B is also not appropriate because it suggests limiting his treatment options to those he has experience with, which could limit the effectiveness of his practice.\n\nOption D is not appropriate because it suggests agreeing to see clients only during a crisis, which may not always be possible and could potentially lead to harm or neglect of other clients."
