The worker brought a federal diversity action against both the machine's manufacturer and the company responsible for the machine's maintenance. At trial, the worker submitted a proposed jury instruction on negligence. The court did not accept the proposed instruction and instead gave a negligence instruction that the worker's attorney believed was less favorable and legally incorrect. The attorney did not object to the negligence instruction before it was given. The jury returned a verdict for the defendants. The worker has moved for a new trial on the ground that the court's negligence instruction was improper. What argument has the best chance of persuading the court to grant the motion?\n\nA. Issues of law can be raised at any time.\nB. The court's negligence instruction was incorrect and the worker's objection to it was preserved when he submitted his it was preserved when he submitted his proposed negligence instruction.\nC. The court's negligence instruction was plain error that affected the worker's substantial rights.\nD. The need for a formal objection to a judicial ruling in order to preserve an argument has been eliminated in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n"

If the court accepts the proposed instruction, then the judge will give the instruction to the jury. If the court rejects the proposed instruction, the judge may give a different instruction or instruct the jury as the court sees fit. However, if the court gives a different instruction than what the parties had requested, it is considered a \"plain error\" and can affect the outcome of the case.\n\nIn this scenario, the worker's attorney submitted a proposed jury instruction on negligence, but the court rejected it and gave a different instruction. This constitutes a \"plain error,\" which can affect the worker's right to a fair trial and potentially result in a new trial.\n\nTherefore, option C is the best argument for granting the motion for a new trial based on the court's negligence instruction being plain error."
