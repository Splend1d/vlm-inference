This leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded of the good that is being replaced.\n\nAdditionally, income effects also play a role in explaining the downward-sloping demand curve. As income increases, consumers may choose to purchase more of a good if it becomes relatively cheaper relative to other goods they value. This results in an increase in the quantity demanded.\n\nTherefore, option A (substitution effects and income effects) correctly describes both factors that contribute to the downward-sloping demand curve."
