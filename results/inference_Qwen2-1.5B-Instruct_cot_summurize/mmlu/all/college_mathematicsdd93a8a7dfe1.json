This is because each angle at a point on the circumference of a circle subtends an arc of length 2\u03c0/9 radians (or approximately 63.45\u00b0), and there are only 9 such arcs around the circle.\n\nHowever, if we consider a polygon with n sides, it will have n-2 vertices. In this case, for a convex polygon with 10 sides, we would need to connect all these vertices to form a closed loop. The total number of segments between consecutive vertices would be 10 - 2 = 8. \n\nEach segment between consecutive vertices forms an angle of 180 degrees (or \u03c0 radians) with the adjacent segment. Therefore, the sum of the measures of these angles is equal to 8 * 180 = 1440 degrees.\n\nSince the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is given by the formula (n-2)*180 degrees, we have:\n\n(10-2)*180 = 1440 degrees\n\nSo, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon is 1440 / 180 = 8. However, this result assumes that the polygon is not self-intersecting, which is not necessarily true for all convex polygons. For example, a star polygon, such as a pentagram, has 5 sides but no self-intersections, so it could potentially have more than 8 acute angles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 4."
