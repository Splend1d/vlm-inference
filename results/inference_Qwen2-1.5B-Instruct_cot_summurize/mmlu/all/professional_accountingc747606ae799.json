Tracking the number of products reworked.\n\nRework refers to the process of correcting defects or errors on products after they have been produced, which can be done through inspection, reworking, or other corrective actions. By tracking the number of products reworked, you can measure the effectiveness of your internal failure cost management efforts and identify areas where additional improvement opportunities exist. This information can then be used to make strategic decisions about how best to allocate resources towards reducing failure rates and improving product quality. \n\nInspection of in-process goods and recording the number of products returned over time may provide insights into the overall performance of the production process, but it does not directly address the issue of internal failure costs. Similarly, tracking warranty expenses over time may indicate the extent of customer dissatisfaction with the product, but it does not necessarily correlate with the level of internal failure costs."
