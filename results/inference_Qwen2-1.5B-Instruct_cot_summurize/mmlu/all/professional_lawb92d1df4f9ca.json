Can the defense attorney ask her on cross examination about her habit of feeding the pigeons? The defense knows that she was cited several times for illegally feeding the pigeons. Defense counsel tries to ask, \"You have a longtime habit of feeding the pigeons, don't you? You have in fact been ticketed several times for feeding pigeons, haven't you, and yet you persisted in doing it, isn't that so?\" Will the trial court likely allow the witness to be questioned on these matters?\n\nA. No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant.\nB. No, because a witness can never be asked about personal prior bad acts.\nC. Yes, because the statement indicates that the witness' attention was always focused on feeding the pigeons.\nD. Yes, because feeding pigeons in the park and persisting in it after being ticketed may show an antisocial trait of the witness.\n"

No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant.\n\nThe defense's question is not relevant to the witness's testimony about the crime. The question does not inquire into any facts that are directly at issue in the case, such as the witness's ability to remember details of the crime or whether she saw the accused commit the act. Rather, it focuses on the witness's conduct unrelated to the crime, which could be considered prejudicial by suggesting that she had some sort of motive for lying to protect the accused.\n\nIt would also be improper to ask about the witness's past legal actions related to feeding pigeons if those actions do not bear upon her testimony as a witness in this particular case. It would not be fair to ask about something that is not germane to her testimony, such as the ticketing record or the reason why she continues to feed pigeons despite warnings from authorities.\n\nTherefore, the trial court should not allow the defense to ask the witness about her habit of feeding the pigeons and subsequent ticketing for illegal feeding."
