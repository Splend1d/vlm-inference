People with lactose intolerance have an enzyme deficiency that prevents them from breaking down this sugar properly in their intestines. This can lead to symptoms such as abdominal cramping, bloating, diarrhea, and gas.\n\nIn the case of the student visiting the university health center, it's possible that he may have experienced symptoms due to a lack of small intestinal lactase, which is responsible for breaking down lactose in the small intestine. Without sufficient lactase production, the student would not be able to digest the lactose in the milk, leading to symptoms similar to those described. \n\nOption A (bacterial and yeast overgrowth) and option D (lack of small intestinal sucrase-isomaltase) could also potentially contribute to these symptoms, but they are less likely based on the information provided. Option B (lack of pancreatic amylase) is not typically associated with lactose intolerance, although it is possible that a lack of pancreatic amylase could indirectly affect lactose digestion if other enzymes needed for proper digestion were also deficient or missing. However, without more specific information about the patient's overall health and digestive function, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the symptoms."
