Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements avoid problems such as generalization and the Premack principle.\n\nVariable ratio schedules of reinforcement allow for different amounts of reinforcement to be given at varying intervals, which can help prevent problems such as generalization (when behavior changes in response to other stimuli) and the Premack principle (which states that if a particular stimulus is used repeatedly to elicit a certain behavior, it will tend to produce that behavior more frequently). This can make the schedule more resistant to extinction, or the loss of the desired behavior over time."
