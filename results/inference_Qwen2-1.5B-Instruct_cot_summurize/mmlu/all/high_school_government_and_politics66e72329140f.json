The media to which the child is exposed\n\nResearch has shown that children are more likely to form their political views through exposure to media, particularly television and social media. Parents may influence their children's political views by discussing politics with them or providing them with information about different political perspectives. However, it is important for parents to be mindful of what they themselves are exposing their children to in terms of media consumption. Children should also have access to diverse sources of information and be encouraged to develop critical thinking skills to evaluate the validity of the information presented."
