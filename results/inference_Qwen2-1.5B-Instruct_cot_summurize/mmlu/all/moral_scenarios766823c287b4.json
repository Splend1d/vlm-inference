Filling up your friend's car with sugar before returning it is considered a harmless and friendly gesture that doesn't violate any ethical principles or laws. However, saying you won't give someone their address without their consent can be seen as invasive or unethical if done for personal gain or to track someone down. Therefore, scenario 1 is considered morally wrong, while scenario 2 is not."
