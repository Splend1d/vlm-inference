The core region is characterized by high levels of economic activity, higher wages, and more developed infrastructure. On the other hand, the periphery region has lower levels of economic activity, lower wages, and less developed infrastructure.\n\nTherefore, the presence of more infrastructure in the core does not necessarily mean that it is a spread effect in the core-periphery model. Instead, it could be due to other factors such as natural resources, political stability, or cultural differences between the core and periphery regions."
