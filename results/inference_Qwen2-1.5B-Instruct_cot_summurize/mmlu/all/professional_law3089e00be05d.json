The uncle knew that the teen had five license suspensions, several negligence lawsuits against him, multiple DUIs, and that he was an inveterate alcoholic. The teenager got into an accident while driving the car and was seriously injured. He filed a negligent entrustment claim against the uncle, claiming he owed him a duty not to give control of the vehicle to him. The uncle filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, asserting that there was no tort for first-party negligent entrustment. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. On appeal, will the court likely affirm the lower court decision?\n\nA. Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\nB. Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.\nC. No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\nD. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n"

No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n\nThe court will likely affirm the lower court's decision on this issue. Negligent entrustment occurs when one person voluntarily entrusts another with property or money, and the other person then causes harm to someone else as a result of their negligence. In order for a negligent entrant to be held responsible for any resulting damages, they must have known or should have known that the entrusted individual was incompetent.\n\nIn this case, the teenager was involved in an accident while driving the car that was entrusted to him by his uncle. However, it is unclear whether the uncle knew or should have known about the teenager's history of driving violations, including multiple licenses being suspended and numerous legal issues involving alcohol use. Therefore, the court may decide that the uncle did not owe the teenager a duty not to give control of the vehicle to him based on the facts presented in the case.\n\nAdditionally, public policy does not typically prohibit the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made. Public policy generally favors the protection of individuals' rights and interests, including those who are injured through the negligence of others. While public policy may limit the ability of the entrustee to recover damages from the entrustor, it does not necessarily dictate that the entrustor cannot be held strictly liable for injuries caused by the entrustee's negligence.\n\nTherefore, the court is more likely to find that the nephew owes a duty not to give control of the vehicle to his incompetent driver rather than that the nephew is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee. This means that the nephew would still potentially be liable under some circumstances, but not necessarily for all injuries sustained by the entrustee's incompetence."
