This causes the frequency of the particular allele to decrease over time.\n\nGene flow occurs when individuals move between populations, transferring alleles from one population to the other.\n\nDisruptive selection occurs when the environment selects for a particular trait, causing it to become more common within the population.\n\nDiscrete variation refers to the occurrence of different genotypes at different times during the evolution of a species.\n\nGiven this information, the most likely answer is B. gene flow."
