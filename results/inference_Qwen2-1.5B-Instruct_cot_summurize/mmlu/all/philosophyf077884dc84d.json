According to this view, one's prima facie duty arises when they see the rightness of an act or principle through introspection, without needing external proof or explicit instruction from others.\n\nIn other words, Ross suggests that one can infer the primafacie rightness of an act based on a general understanding of what actions are generally considered right or wrong, rather than relying solely on explicit moral instruction received during childhood. This approach emphasizes the role of reason and self-reflection in identifying and adhering to one's prima facie duties."
