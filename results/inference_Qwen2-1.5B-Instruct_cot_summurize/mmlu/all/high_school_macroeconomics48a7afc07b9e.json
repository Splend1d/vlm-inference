In economics, GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is calculated by adding together the value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a given period. The expenditure approach to GDP is used when measuring economic activity based on consumer spending, business investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports). Therefore, X in the equation GDP = C + I + G + X represents expenditures."
