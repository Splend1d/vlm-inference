The reserve requirement is the percentage of the deposited funds that must be held in reserves by the bank itself rather than being lent out. In this case, the reserve ratio is 10%, so for every $1 of deposits, the bank must hold $1 in reserves.\n\nLet's calculate how much money the new customer can borrow:\n\n- Deposit = $500\n- Reserve ratio = 10%\n- Reserves required = $500 * 10% = $50\n\nSo, the bank would lend out $500 - $50 = $450 to the new customer. This means the new customer can create $450 in additional money (the difference between their deposit and the amount they need to keep as reserves).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $4,500."
