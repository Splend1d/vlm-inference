The epidemiological evidence shows programmed differences in physiology are linked to events before birth and in early postnatal life.\n\nThis statement accurately reflects the current understanding of how early life experiences impact health. While it is true that some aspects of health, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, can be influenced by adult lifestyle choices, research has shown that there are specific physiological changes that occur during early development that can lead to these conditions if not properly supported or nurtured. These changes include hormonal imbalances, genetic predispositions, and immune system development. Therefore, the focus on maternal nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood is crucial for supporting healthy growth and development, which in turn can reduce the risk of future health problems."
