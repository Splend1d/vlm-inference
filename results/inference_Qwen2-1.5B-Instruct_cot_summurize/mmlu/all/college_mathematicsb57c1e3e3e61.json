In this case, we have to consider the absolute values of the endpoints of the intervals.\n\nFor option (I), the interval [-1, 3) includes both negative one and positive three, so it's not a valid interval because the power series would diverge at those points.\n\nFor option (II), the interval (-\u221e, 0] includes all real numbers except zero, but the power series would converge if x = 0. So, this interval is also invalid.\n\nFor option (III), the interval [2, 2] \u222a [3, 3] means that the series converges between 2 and 3 on both sides, which is valid since the power series will converge in these intervals due to the properties of the function f(x) = x^2 + 4 around x=2 and x=3.\n\nFor option (IV), the interval (-\u221e,\u221e) represents all real numbers without any restrictions, which means the power series would converge everywhere. This is valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) (II) and (III)"
