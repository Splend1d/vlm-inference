The formula for Q in terms of f and Q is:\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{f}{\\Delta f} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\Delta f \\) is the bandwidth of the resonator.\n\nGiven that the resonator bandwidth (\\( \\Delta f \\)) is 1.58 MHz, we can rearrange the formula to solve for Q:\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{\\Delta f}{f} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{1.58 \\text{ MHz}}{f} \\]\n\nTo find the resonant frequency \\( f \\), we need to know the value of \\( Q \\) or the relationship between \\( Q \\) and \\( f \\). However, without additional information about the specific resonator and its parameters, we cannot accurately calculate \\( f \\) from the given Q-factor. Therefore, we cannot determine the correct answer based on the information provided. \n\nIf you have more details about the resonator, such as its specific resonant frequency or other relevant parameters, please provide them so I can assist you further."
