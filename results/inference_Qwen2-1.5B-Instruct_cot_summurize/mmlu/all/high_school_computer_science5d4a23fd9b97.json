The program displays 10, and the programmer concludes that the program works as intended. Which of the following is true?\n\nA. The conclusion is correct; the program works as intended.\nB. The conclusion is incorrect; the program does not display the correct value for the test case [0, 1, 4, 5].\nC. The conclusion is incorrect; using the test case [0, 1, 4, 5] is not sufficient to conclude the program is correct.\nD.

Therefore, even if the first element of the list is 0, the program should still add up all the other elements in the list to get the correct result (which is 10). This is because the program simply iterates through each element in the list and adds it to a running total. So, the answer is D."
