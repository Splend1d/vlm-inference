After exhausting his appeals, he filed for post-conviction relief, alleging that he had been deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. He established that his counsel had not advised him of the benefits of plea bargaining, and had withheld several offers for guilty pleas from the government. The offers expired for lack of a response. The sentence he received was at least seven to eight years more than if he had entered a guilty plea. Will the court likely decide that the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel?\n\nA. Yes, because plea bargaining is a critical stage of a criminal case and an attorney who ignores that process is constitutionally ineffective.\nB. No, because plea bargaining is not a critical necessity in a criminal case and counsel has no duty to discuss such options with the defendant.\nC. When the defendant indicates he wants to fight the charges, there is no need for counsel to relay plea offers or discuss the options with him.\nD. Because this defendant was convicted at a fair trial he didn't lose any rights and was not prejudiced by his lawyer's mistakes.\n"

Yes, because plea bargaining is a critical stage of a criminal case and an attorney who ignores that process is constitutionally ineffective.\n\nWhen a defendant goes to trial and is convicted, they have the opportunity to appeal their conviction. In order to file for post-conviction relief, a defendant must show that they were denied the effective assistance of counsel during their trial. This can be done by showing that their attorney failed to advise them of the benefits of plea bargaining or made other errors that affected their defense.\n\nIn this scenario, the defendant's attorney failed to inform the defendant about the benefits of plea bargaining and withheld several offers for guilty pleas from the government. These omissions would have been crucial in negotiating a lesser sentence for the defendant. Additionally, the fact that the offers expired without a response means that the defendant may have missed out on potentially reducing their sentence even further.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the court will find that the defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to these errors in representation."
