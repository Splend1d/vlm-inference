Mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, 1-NN using unweighted Euclidean distance may be able to achieve better classification performance than in original space. This is because the mapping process introduces non-linear relationships between input features and output classes, which can lead to improved classification accuracy.\nStatement 2 is false. The VC dimension of a Perceptron is equal to the VC dimension of a simple linear SVM. The VC dimension is a measure of the complexity of a learning algorithm, and it represents the maximum number of data points that can be classified with certainty by the algorithm. In both cases, the VC dimension is equal to the number of training examples minus one, since each example is either correctly or incorrectly classified. Therefore, the VC dimensions of a Perceptron and a simple linear SVM are equal."
