Her son says that she repeats herself frequently and has been forgetting to take her routine medications.

Physical examination is within normal limits for her age. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 23/30. Laboratory studies, including serum vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations, are within normal limits. A CT scan of the head shows mild volume loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. \u03b2-Adrenergic agonist\nB. Cholinesterase inhibitor\nC. Dopamine agonist\nD. Prednisone\n"
