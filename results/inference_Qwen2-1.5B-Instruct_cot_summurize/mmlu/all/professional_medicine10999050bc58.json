P2 louder than A2\n\nP2 is the second heart sound heard during auscultation of the heart, while A2 is the first heart sound. In PAH, there can be an increase in the intensity or loudness of the P2 over the A2 due to increased venous return to the right atrium, which may contribute to right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. P2 louder than A2."
