The acceleration during this time is 6 m/s^2.\n\nThe formula for position as a function of time is:\n\n\\[x(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} v(t') dt'\\]\n\nWhere \\(v(t)\\) is the velocity function. Since the velocity is constant, we can use the average velocity between times \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\) to approximate the integral:\n\n\\[\\frac{v(t_2)-v(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}\\]\n\nFor the first part of the journey (from \\(t=0\\) to \\(t=1\\)), the average velocity is:\n\n\\[\\frac{24}{1-0}=24\\]\n\nSo, using the average velocity, we get:\n\n\\[x(1)=24 \\cdot 1=24\\] m\n\nAfter \\(t=1\\) s, the body accelerates with a negative acceleration, so its final velocity will be:\n\n\\[v(1+1)=24+6=30\\] m/s\n\nUsing the same method for the second part of the journey (from \\(t=1\\) to \\(t=11\\)), the average velocity would be:\n\n\\[\\frac{30-24}{1-1}=6\\]\n\nTherefore, the position after \\(t=1\\) s is:\n\n\\[x(11)=6 \\cdot 11=66\\] m\n\nSince we're asked about the position at \\(t=11\\) seconds, which is the point where the body is located when the acceleration is applied, we subtract the distance traveled by the body before the acceleration started:\n\n\\[66 - 24 = 42\\] m\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. -36m"
