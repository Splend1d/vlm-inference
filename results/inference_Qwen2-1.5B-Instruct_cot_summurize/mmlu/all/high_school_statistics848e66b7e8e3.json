                    "text": "To determine which statement is true about Mary and Pam's scores, we can compare their individual scores to the given information.\n\nGiven:\n- Mary scored at the 64th percentile, meaning she scored in the top 20%.\n- Pam scored at the 56th percentile, meaning she scored in the bottom 20%.\n\nThis means that for every 10 people out of the total number of people who took the test, there were 2 people like Mary (who scored in the top 20%) and 1 person like Pam (who scored in the bottom 20%).\n\nHowever, this doesn't directly tell us how many points apart Mary and Pam scored or if one scored \"eight more points\" than the other.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Mary scored eight more points than Pam.\n\nSince Mary is at the 64th percentile, it means her score was above 64%. If we assume that Pam's score was exactly at the 56th percentile, then she would have been in the bottom 20%, so her score could not be \"eight more points\" than Mary's since she is in the bottom 20%.\n\nB. Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's.\n\nIf we use the example from option A, where Mary scored 8% higher than Pam, but Pam scored exactly at the 56th percentile, then we're looking at an impossible scenario because the difference cannot exceed 20% (since only two people scored at the 20th percentile).\n\nC. Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.\n\nThe percentage of people who scored between Pam and Mary is calculated by subtracting the percentages of people who scored below them (Mary's percentile) and above them (Pam's percentile). This calculation involves finding the overlap between the two groups, which is 20% (from Mary's percentile) minus 20% (from Pam's percentile), resulting in 0% overlap.\n\nD. Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam.\n\nThis statement is based on the assumption that Mary and Pam are the only people with a score lower than the median score (the 50th percentile), but without any additional context or specific numbers provided, this statement seems to imply something beyond what is actually stated. It suggests that Mary and Pam are outliers among all students who took the test, which isn't necessarily accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely C. Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary. However, without further details or constraints, the exact interpretation may vary depending on the context of the question."
