Long conducted business on the Internet and had little contact with Frost. After Frost was declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding, Long placed an order with Grant Corp. on Frost's behalf. Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence. Will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?\n\nA. Yes, because Long's agency survived Frost's incompetence.\nB. Yes, because the order was valid regardless of Frost's incompetence.\nC. No, because Grant dealt only with Long.\nD. No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n"

No, because Long did not have authority to enter into the contract.\n\nUnder the law of agency, an agent has the authority to act within certain limits set by the principal. In this case, Frost had expressed authority to Long to place purchase orders with Frost's suppliers, but there is no evidence that Frost gave Long express authority to deal with third parties like Grant Corp. Therefore, Long did not have the authority to enter into the contract with Grant, even though he may have been acting as an agent of Frost under certain circumstances."
