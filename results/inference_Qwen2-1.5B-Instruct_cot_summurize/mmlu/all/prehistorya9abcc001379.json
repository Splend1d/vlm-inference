The Caral civilization flourished during the Early Intermediate Period (c. 3000-2100 BCE) and was located on the northern coast of what is now Peru. It is believed that the people of Caral had access to abundant resources such as salt, which they could extract from the ocean using boats called \"canoes.\" The use of canoes allowed them to explore new territories and bring back valuable goods like shells, which were used in various rituals and ceremonies.\n\nAdditionally, the Caral culture was known for its impressive architecture, including the construction of the Piramide Mayor, which was a monumental pyramid made of stone. However, it is not clear whether this structure played a significant role in the development of the society or if it was simply a reflection of their technological advancements."
