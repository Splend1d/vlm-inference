                    "text": "New polyomaviruses can be detailed using various methods, but shotgun sequencing is often the first choice for this purpose. This technique involves generating an extensive sequence of DNA or RNA from a sample and then comparing these sequences to existing databases to identify potential new viruses.\nShotgun sequencing has been used successfully to characterize new polyomaviruses, including those associated with infectious mononucleosis, hepatitis B, and other viral diseases. It provides a high-resolution view of the genome and allows researchers to identify new genetic variations that may not have previously been detected.\nIn addition to shotgun sequencing, cultivation in human neural cells is another method that can be used to study polyomaviruses. This approach involves growing cells in the presence of the virus to investigate its replication cycle and cellular interactions.\nDeep pyro sequencing (NGS) is also being increasingly used to analyze large datasets generated by shotgun sequencing. NGS is particularly useful for identifying novel genes and proteins involved in viral infection, as well as for studying the impact of different viral strains on host cells.\nFinally, monoclonal antibody techniques can be used to isolate specific viruses from samples and to study their biology and pathogenesis. These techniques involve using antibodies to capture and identify specific viral antigens or protein markers, which can provide valuable insights into the virus's structure, function, and potential targets for antiviral therapies."
