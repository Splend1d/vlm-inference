The exact percentage can vary widely, but typically ranges from about 1-3%.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, option C (About 10%) would be the most accurate answer. It's important to note that these percentages are approximate and may not accurately reflect your own experience with the weather and road conditions you encounter."
