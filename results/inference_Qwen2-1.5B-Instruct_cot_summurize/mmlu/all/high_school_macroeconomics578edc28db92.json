Frictional unemployment occurs when workers are actively seeking work, but they are not actively seeking jobs that pay more than their current job. In this case, the worker is quitting their current job to look for a new one at a competing grocery store, which suggests they are actively seeking employment. However, it's important to note that this type of unemployment is relatively uncommon and typically only lasts for a short period of time before the individual finds a job with higher wages or benefits."
