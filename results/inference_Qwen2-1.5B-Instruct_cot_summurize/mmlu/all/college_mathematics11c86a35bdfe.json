However, if we consider the full period of the sine function, we can say that the two functions will next intersect after completing one full cycle within their respective domains.\n\nGiven that the first intersection occurs at $x=0$, the second intersection will occur either before or after $2\\pi$. Since the graphs are symmetric about the line $y=x$, they will intersect again at an angle of $90^\\circ$ with respect to the original intersection point. Thus, the next intersection occurs at an angle of $180^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 90^\\circ$ or equivalently, at $x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThus, the smallest positive value of \\(a\\) is \\(0.5\\), making the correct answer B. \\(\u03c0\\)."
