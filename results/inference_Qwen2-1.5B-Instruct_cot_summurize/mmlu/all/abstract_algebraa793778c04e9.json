Since the identity element of the ring is also the unity of the subring, statement 1 is correct.\n\nStatement 2 is false.\nWhile every field is indeed an integral domain (meaning that for every pair of elements in the field, either both are zero or one is zero and the other is nonzero), not all fields are necessarily commutative rings. A commutative ring is a ring where the multiplication operation is commutative, meaning that a*b = b*a for all a and b in the ring. Therefore, while every field is an integral domain, not all fields are commutative rings. Hence, statement 2 is false."
