The supplier offered to do so at a price of $300 per motor (a total price of $90,000). The manufacturer's representative said, \"Deal.\" The next day the manufacturer's representative sent the supplier an unsigned note on company letterhead that stated, \"I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order.\" The manufacturer then sent catalogs to its regular customers advertising washing machines that included the specified motors. The manufacturer did not hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier called to say that it would be unable to supply the motors because it was no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Is the supplier's statute of frauds defense likely to succeed?\n\nA. No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.\nB. No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.\nD. Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.\n"

Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.\n\nAccording to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a written offer must include all essential terms to form a valid offer. In this case, the only essential term missing from the note was the quantity of the product being offered. Therefore, the note is considered incomplete and therefore unenforceable.\n\nAdditionally, if the note contained any other essential terms that were necessary to complete the offer, such as a place of delivery or payment terms, those terms would also need to be present for the offer to be valid. However, without any indication of quantity, the note cannot be considered a complete offer, which means it does not constitute a binding agreement between the parties.\n\nTherefore, the supplier's statute of frauds defense is likely to succeed based on the fact that the note was incomplete and did not contain the required quantity term."
