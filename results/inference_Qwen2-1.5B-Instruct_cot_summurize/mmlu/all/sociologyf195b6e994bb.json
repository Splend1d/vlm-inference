These norms can include things like what is considered polite behavior at a dinner party, what is appropriate attire for a job interview, or what is considered respectful language when interacting with someone from another cultural background.\n\nSocial norms are not necessarily created through creative activities like gardening or cooking, nor do they involve symbolic representations in the mass media. Religious beliefs may provide guidance on how the world should be, but they are not typically the basis for social norms. Instead, social norms are formed through a combination of laws, customs, traditions, and other forms of social regulation.\n\nIn summary, while some aspects of social norms (such as those related to personal conduct) may be influenced by creative activities or symbolic representations, it is the rules and expectations about interaction that regulate social life that define what is considered socially acceptable or not."
