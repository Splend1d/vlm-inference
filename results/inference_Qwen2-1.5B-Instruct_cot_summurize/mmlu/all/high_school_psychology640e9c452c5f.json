After serving 120 dinners, Tamika told her mother how happy she is that they can afford to buy delicious foods she loves. Tamika's increased perception that she is happy is best explained by applying which of the following theories?\n\nA. relative deprivation\nB. adaptation-level\nC. Yerkes-Dodson arousal\nD. diathesis-stress\n"

Relative deprivation refers to the feeling of inadequacy or unfairness when comparing oneself to others who have more resources or advantages. In this scenario, Tamika may be experiencing relative deprivation because she feels that she does not have enough money to afford the same level of comfort as those around her at the soup kitchen. This could lead to an increase in happiness due to the realization that she can still enjoy the things she loves despite her financial situation."
