The proposed statute's preamble recites that its provisions will ensure: \u0080\u0094 responsible insurance coverage for all those who do business with the state;an increased standard of living for the citizens who comprise the state's labor force; \u0080\u0094 the lowest possible expenditures by the state government; and \u0080\u0094 a beautiful, uniform aesthetic decor for all new state buildings. If the state statute is attacked as violating the commerce clause, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA. The statute is a valid exercise of the state's police power to legislate to protect the health, safety, morals, and welfare of its citizens.\nB. The statute falls within the reserved powers under the Tenth Amendment.\nC. The statute should be invalidated if there are nondiscriminatory reasonable alternatives available to serve legitimate local interests.\nD. The statute is a valid exercise of state action only if the federal government has not previously \"occupied the field\" in this area.\n"

The statute should be invalidated if there are nondiscriminatory reasonable alternatives available to serve legitimate local interests.\n\nThe Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from passing laws that regulate interstate commerce unless such laws serve a legitimate state interest. This means that states cannot pass laws that discriminate against out-of-state entities or impose undue burdens on interstate commerce. \n\nIn this case, the state statute requires construction companies to purchase insurance only from insurance companies chartered in the state and hire only citizens of the state for employment. These requirements would likely be considered discriminatory against out-of-state companies and residents of other states, as they could face higher costs and fewer job opportunities than their counterparts in the state. Additionally, the requirement to use adobe roofing would likely result in higher costs and reduced options for other materials. Therefore, these requirements would likely violate the Commerce Clause and be struck down as unconstitutional."
