However, I can offer some general guidance on this matter.\n\nIn general, privilege laws vary by jurisdiction, so it's important to consult with a lawyer who specializes in psychology to determine what the specific laws and rules are for your state/province. In many cases, the privilege law may cover certain types of communications between a psychologist and their clients, but there may be exceptions or limitations.\n\nIf divorce is not specifically covered under the privilege law, the best course of action would likely be to seek written permission from the client before testifying. This could involve sending a letter explaining the situation and asking for permission to testify. If the client refuses to give written permission, then it may be necessary to consider other options such as seeking immunity from litigation or making a determination about the usefulness of your testimony based on other factors. Ultimately, the decision should be made based on a careful evaluation of the circumstances and the potential impact on your client's case."
