It's important to note that portrayals of individuals based on their age or gender may not necessarily reflect accurate representations of real life, and there may be many factors beyond age and gender that contribute to how characters are portrayed in media. Additionally, it's possible that certain demographics may receive more attention or representation due to factors such as cultural bias or marketing strategies. Ultimately, it's up to viewers to critically evaluate the content they consume and seek out diverse perspectives and representation."
