He occasionally smokes marijuana. His temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F). There is no lymphadenopathy. Examination shows three sessile, flesh-colored lesions on the shaft of the penis that are 10 mm in diameter. On application of a dilute solution of acetic acid, the lesions turn white. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Oral acyclovir therapy\nB. Oral doxycycline therapy\nC. Intramuscular penicillin therapy\nD. Cryotherapy\n"

Treatment options include antiviral medications such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, which can be administered orally or topically.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Oral acyclovir therapy."
