In the post-9/11 reversion to traditional security thinking, environmental security as a concept is likely to enjoy continued attention from security analysts and policymakers.\nB. Increasing evidence of the negative effects of environmental insecurity may increasingly govern national security interests and behaviour. The relevance will increase until national unilateralist initiatives are taken to retain the social organization of the nation which may have the adverse affect of increasing the prospect of conflict.\nC. National security practices are the most effective means to achieving environmental security reforms to consolidate the socio-economic organizational base of the country against threat. The state on a practical level remains the most capable body - having the monopolization over the instruments of violence, and centralization of resources - to enter into trans-national agreements for the management of environmental constraints.\nD. The impact of environmental problems seems unlikely to diminish so that the relevance of environmental security for policy will likely increase, particularly multilateral action on common security concerns to achieve forms of social organization that are ecologically sustainable. In some sense, current practices of national security are an impediment to achieving environmental security for all people.\n"

This is because environmental degradation has far-reaching consequences for human well-being and can lead to conflicts between different groups within a society or even across borders.\n\nMultilateral organizations such as the United Nations and the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) are already working towards promoting sustainable development and reducing the impact of climate change. There is also a growing awareness among governments and businesses of the need to take action to address environmental issues, including investing in renewable energy sources and protecting natural habitats.\n\nIn conclusion, while traditional security concerns remain relevant, the importance of environmental security is likely to grow as we face the challenges posed by climate change and other environmental threats. Multilateral efforts to promote sustainable development and reduce the impact of environmental degradation will be essential in addressing these challenges and ensuring the long-term security of societies around the world."
