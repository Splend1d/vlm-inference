In both scenarios, the main character takes an action that may be considered unpleasant or annoying, but whether this constitutes a morally wrong act depends on the context and cultural norms of the situation.\nScenario 1 involves slapping a bug off one's head, which may be seen as rude or unnecessary depending on the social context. However, it is also possible that this action is considered acceptable under certain circumstances, such as if the person is allergic to bugs.\nScenario 2 involves tossing a ball to a girl while swimming at the lake, which may be seen as playful and harmless. Again, whether this action is morally wrong depends on the specific context and cultural norms of the situation.\nTherefore, without more information about the social context and cultural norms of each scenario, it is not possible to determine which one involves a morally wrong action. The correct answer would depend on additional context or clarification."
