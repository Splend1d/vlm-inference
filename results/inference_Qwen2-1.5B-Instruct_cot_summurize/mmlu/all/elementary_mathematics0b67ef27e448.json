In this case, the mean is $\\frac{1+3+3}{3}=2$.\n\nThe median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order from least to greatest. Here, the median is $3$. \n\nIf we add the number $6$, the new list becomes $1, 3, 3, 6$. When we arrange these numbers in order from least to greatest, we get $1, 3, 3, 6$. There are still three numbers in this list (one less than before), so the median remains at $3$.\n\nTherefore, adding the number $6$ does not change the mean or the median. The correct answer is D. the median would decrease."
