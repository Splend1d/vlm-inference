She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?\n\nA. Granulosa tumor\nB. Ovarian carcinoid\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\nD. Teratoma\n"

Teratoma\n\nThis term refers to an abnormal pregnancy that occurs when the fetus develops outside the uterus, typically in the fallopian tubes or ovary. In some cases, the teratomas can be benign (non-cancerous), while in others they may contain cancerous tissue. The specific type of teratoma will depend on the specific cells present.\n\nIn this case, the ultrasonography of the pelvis showing a 12-cm ovarian mass suggests it is likely a teratoma, which would explain why the patient has had increased facial hair growth, as well as the presence of clitoral enlargement and other symptoms associated with teratomas. \n\nIt's important to note that further evaluation by a healthcare professional experienced in gynecological and reproductive medicine would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and discuss appropriate treatment options."
