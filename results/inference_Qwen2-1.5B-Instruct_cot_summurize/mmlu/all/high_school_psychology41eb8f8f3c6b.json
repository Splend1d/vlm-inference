II and III only\n\nBoth Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans can image brain function, but they do so in different ways.\n\nMRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of soft tissues such as the brain and spinal cord. It is useful for detecting tumors, stroke, and other conditions that affect the brain.\n\nCT scans use X-rays and computer technology to create cross-sectional images of the body, including the brain. They are useful for detecting bleeding, swelling, and certain types of cancer.\n\nTherefore, the scans mentioned in your answer choice D (II and III only) are both MRI and CT scans, which can image brain function."
