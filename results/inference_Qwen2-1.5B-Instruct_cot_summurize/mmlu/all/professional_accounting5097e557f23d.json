Variable sampling.\n\nVariable sampling is used when an auditor wants to estimate a numerical measurement, such as the dollar value of inventory, by selecting items based on their characteristics or attributes rather than their presence in the sample. This method can be useful for estimating the total amount of inventory, which may not fit into a predefined size range like attribute sampling does."
