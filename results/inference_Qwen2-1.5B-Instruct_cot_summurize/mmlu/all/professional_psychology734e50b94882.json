There is a 1% chance that she will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis.\n\nIn statistics, a \"t-test\" is used to determine whether two groups (in this case, the results from the psychologist's data collection) have different means or average values. If the difference between the means is large enough, it is considered statistically significant and the null hypothesis, which states that there is no difference between the means, can be rejected. \n\nIf the null hypothesis is rejected, the researcher should state that there is evidence to suggest that the differences between the groups are not due to chance alone. However, if the null hypothesis is retained, it does not mean that there is no difference between the groups; it simply means that the sample size was small enough to not detect a difference. Therefore, it is possible to incorrectly retain the null hypothesis even when there is evidence for a difference in the population."
