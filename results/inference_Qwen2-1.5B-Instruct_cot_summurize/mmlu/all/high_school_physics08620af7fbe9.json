                    "text": "The block will reach the bottom of the ramp first.\n\nThis is because when a body slides down an incline without friction, its kinetic energy remains constant. However, when a body rolls down an incline without slipping (i.e., with zero net force along the direction of motion), its translational kinetic energy increases linearly with respect to time according to the formula $KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the velocity of the object at any given point in time.\n\nFor the sphere to roll down the inclined plane without slipping, there must be some external torque applied to it that causes it to accelerate and increase its rotational speed. This additional rotational kinetic energy contributes to the overall increase in the ball's total kinetic energy, which includes both its translational and rotational components.\n\nOn the other hand, the block slides down the incline without friction, meaning that no external forces act upon it perpendicular to its motion, such as gravity or friction. Therefore, the block's kinetic energy remains constant throughout its descent, regardless of how far it travels.\n\nIn summary, the sphere loses potential energy as it rolls down the inclined plane, while the block loses only gravitational potential energy. Since the block has less potential energy to start with than the sphere, it will have more kinetic energy by the time it reaches the bottom of the ramp compared to the sphere. As a result, the block will reach the bottom of the ramp before the sphere."
