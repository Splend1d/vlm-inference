Wait state clock cycles can be inserted between any two consecutive clock cycles or after the last clock cycle to ensure that data can be transferred from one device to another without waiting for the next clock cycle. \n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of insertions would be T3 before T4 to allow for the transfer of data between devices without waiting for the next clock cycle. This ensures that the bus cycle completes successfully within the allotted time frame."
