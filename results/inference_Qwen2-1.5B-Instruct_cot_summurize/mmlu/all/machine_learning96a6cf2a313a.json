All the examples that have a non-zero weight \\( \\alpha_k \\) in an SVM.\n\nIn Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a support vector is an example of data that has a non-zero weight coefficient (\\( \\alpha_k \\)) in the model. This means that this example is not simply a random point on the decision boundary, but rather it provides additional information or constraint that helps to separate the classes better. \n\nThe other options do not accurately describe what a support vector is:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because the support vectors themselves are not examples farthest from the decision boundary; instead, they are points used for training and evaluation.\n- Option B is also incorrect as it refers to all examples necessary to compute \\( f(x) \\) which is a different concept than what a support vector represents.\n- Option C is incorrect as the data centroid is not related to the support vectors in any way. It's more about clustering and grouping similar data points together."
