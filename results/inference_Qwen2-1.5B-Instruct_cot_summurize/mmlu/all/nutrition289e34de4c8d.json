While carbohydrates can provide energy for endurance exercises, excessive consumption of carbohydrates before or during an event can lead to a \"carb bomb\" effect, where the body stores excess carbohydrates as fat instead of using them for energy. This can result in a decrease in performance and increased risk of injury during the event. Therefore, it's important to avoid overconsumption of carbohydrates before endurance events."
