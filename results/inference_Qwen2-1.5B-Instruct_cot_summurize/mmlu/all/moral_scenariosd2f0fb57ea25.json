This action goes against the general consensus on smoking and its negative health effects. While it may not directly cause harm or death, smoking has been linked to numerous health problems including cancer, heart disease, and respiratory issues. Therefore, buying cigarettes for someone else who smokes is seen as morally wrong because it promotes harmful behavior.\nOn the other hand, Scenario 2: I drove above the speed limit to get to my nightcap is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Driving at a safe and legal speed is generally seen as acceptable behavior, especially if the driver is aware of their surroundings and is not breaking traffic laws. However, driving too fast can still be dangerous and increase the risk of accidents, so it's important to drive safely regardless of the situation."
