This can lead to situations where the price set by the monopolist is higher than the marginal cost of producing additional units, resulting in a situation known as \"price discrimination\" where some customers pay a higher price than others for the same product. This can be an issue if the monopolist sets the price too high, leading to a loss of demand and potentially causing the business to go out of business. In contrast, in a perfectly competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers who compete with each other based on supply and demand principles, leading to a more efficient allocation of resources and lower prices overall."
