The Inca Empire was highly centralized and hierarchical, with a strong emphasis on military strength and leadership. By waging war against other tribes and conquering territories, the Inca were able to create a strong army that could be used to maintain their control over their vast empire. This army was led by skilled commanders who were trained and selected through rigorous selection processes. Therefore, it is possible that the Inca saw warfare as an important way to identify and cultivate these leaders, as well as to maintain their power and authority."
