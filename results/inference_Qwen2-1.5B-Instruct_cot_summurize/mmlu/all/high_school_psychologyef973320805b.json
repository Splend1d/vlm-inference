The signals are transmitted by nerve impulses, which travel along axons in the neurons. In this case, the receptors receive the input signal, the afferent neuron carries it on its axon, the interneurons process and transmit it to the efferent neuron, which sends it to the muscle or gland responsible for the response. Finally, the effector performs the response."
