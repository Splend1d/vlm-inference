Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.\n\nJusticiability is the legal concept that determines whether a particular right can be enforced in court. It involves assessing whether there exists a \"justiciable\" issue, which means that it is within the jurisdiction of the court and has been brought before it for resolution. This includes determining whether the right at issue meets the criteria for being enforceable in law, such as having a clear legal basis and being capable of being resolved through judicial proceedings."
