Prior to the settlement date, the brother contacted the nephew, telling him that he would not perform his part of the agreement because the nephew could not convey a fee simple.

Denied, because under the Doctrine of Worthier Title, at the termination of the nephew's life estate, the grantor has a reversionary interest.\n\nIn Shelley's Case, the rule was abolished by statute in the jurisdiction described in the question. This means that the doctrine of Worthier Title does not apply, which states that if the grantor retains an interest in the property during the term of the life estate, it will revert back to the grantor upon the death of the life tenant.\n\nTherefore, even though the nephew may have intended to convey the property to his brother in fee simple absolute, the doctrine of Worthier Title prevents this from happening. The nephew's life estate will terminate upon his death, and the grantor will retain a reversionary interest in the property until the end of their own life."
