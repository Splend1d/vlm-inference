She also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the past 2 weeks and a 3-week history of vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination shows a nodular cervix with an irregular, friable posterior lip, and a rock-hard, irregular, immobile pelvic mass that extends across the pelvis. Examination of biopsy specimens from the cervix and anterior wall of the vagina show well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of this patient's disease?\n\nA. Inactivation of cellular p53\nB. Insertion of viral promotors adjacent to cellular growth factor genes\nC. Specialized transduction\nD. Transactivation of cellular growth factor genes by TAX\n"

HPV inserts its DNA into the host genome, causing transcription of viral oncogenes such as Tax, which then activate cellular growth factors. The resulting overexpression of these growth factors leads to uncontrolled cell division and tumor formation."
