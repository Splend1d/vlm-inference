In abstract algebra, the operation of taking an element of a group (here represented by \\(a\\)) and multiplying it by every element of its subgroup (\\(H\\)) results in the entire subgroup itself. Therefore, \\(aH\\) equals \\(Ha\\).\n\nStatement 2: \"If \\(H\\) is normal of \\(G\\), and \\(a\\) belongs to \\(G\\), then \\(ah = ha\\) for all \\(h\\) in \\(H\\).\"\nThis statement is also true. The term \"normal\" refers to the property that any element in \\(H\\) can be written as a product of elements from \\(H\\) with themselves. When combined with the property that multiplication within \\(H\\) commutes with addition within \\(G\\), we have \\(ah = ha\\).\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, making the correct answer:\n\nA. True, True"
