This process removes many more flakes than an Oldowan tool would require. Additionally, hand axes are often made by flint knapping rather than using flakes, which means that they don't have as many flakes as Oldowan tools. Finally, while Oldowan tools were generally simple and primitive in nature, hand axes were much more complex and sophisticated."
