Amnesic disorders can be associated with hypnotics and sedatives.\n\nThis is because hypnosis does not cause memory loss or amnesia, but rather it may temporarily reduce alertness and sensory perception. Similarly, sedatives do not cause amnesia either; they can help people sleep or relax but do not affect their ability to remember things. \n\nAnterograde amnesia (also known as retrograde amnesia) refers to a type of memory loss where one cannot form new memories. Confabulation, on the other hand, is when someone creates false memories or stories about themselves or others, which can be used to explain missing pieces of memory or to create false memories based on what they want to believe. These disorders can occur due to various factors including head injuries, strokes, diseases affecting the brain, or even certain medications."
