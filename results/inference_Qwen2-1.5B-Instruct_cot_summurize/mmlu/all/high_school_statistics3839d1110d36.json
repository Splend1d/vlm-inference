                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one.\n\nThis is because the expected value of a random variable, denoted by E(X), is defined as the sum of all possible values of X multiplied by their respective probabilities (p(x)). Therefore, if the probabilities of all possible values of X add up to 1, then the expected value will also be 1.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the expected value of a continuous random variable can be calculated using its integral rather than its product with its probability.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it states that the sum of all possible values of X is equal to one, which is not necessarily true for discrete distributions. For example, consider a fair coin flip, where the possible outcomes are heads or tails, and the probability of each outcome is 0.5. In this case, the sum of all possible values of X (heads or tails) is 1, but it is not equal to one.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the shape of the probability distribution does not determine whether the probabilities of all possible values of X add up to 1. It only determines the shape of the graph of the cumulative distribution function, which gives us information about the expected value and other properties of the random variable."
