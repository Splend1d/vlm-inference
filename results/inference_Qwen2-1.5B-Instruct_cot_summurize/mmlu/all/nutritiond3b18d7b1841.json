                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The migrating motor complex is chiefly responsible for peristaltic movement of food after a meal has been consumed.\n\nThe migrating motor complex (MMC) is a series of coordinated contractions that move food through the gastrointestinal tract. It occurs when a stretch of muscle fibers in the intestines contracts in response to electrical signals from sensory neurons located along the gut wall. These contractions help propel food down the digestive system, moving it through the stomach and small intestine into the large intestine where it is eventually eliminated as feces.\n\nWhen a meal is consumed, the MMC starts working immediately. This initial phase of digestion involves peristalsis, or the rhythmic contractions that push food through the stomach. As the food progresses through the stomach, the MMC continues to work, helping to break down food further and prepare it for absorption in the small intestine.\n\nIn contrast, the other options do not accurately describe how intestinal motility works:\n\n- B. The release of insulin after eating a meal will slow the emptying of the stomach: While insulin can lower blood sugar levels, it does not affect the rate at which the stomach empties.\n  \n- C. At the start of a meal, the stomach increases its \"tone\" in order to develop pressure which will lead to expulsion of its contents, via the pylorus: This is incorrect because the stomach does not expel its contents; instead, it secretes acid and enzymes that break down the food before being absorbed.\n\n- D. The presence of partially digested fat and starch in the duodenum, slows intestinal motility: This statement is also inaccurate, as the presence of undigested food in the duodenum can increase the overall speed of digestion rather than slowing it down."
