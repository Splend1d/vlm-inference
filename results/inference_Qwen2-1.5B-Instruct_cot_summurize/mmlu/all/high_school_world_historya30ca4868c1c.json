It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nThe views expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence of which of the following in Roman society?\n\nA. Disgust for barbarian peoples\nB. Concern about barbarian attacks\nC. Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy\nD. Maintenance of large armies\n"

                    "text": "Based on the excerpt provided by Tacitus, it seems that he is expressing a sense of resentment towards the neighboring tribes who attacked his people and drove them out. This could be interpreted as a sign of disdain or disgust towards barbarian peoples, particularly those who were perceived as inferior or less powerful. Therefore, option A (Disgust for barbarian peoples) is the most likely interpretation of Tacitus' views in this context.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Tacitus lived during the late Roman Empire, so his views may have been influenced by broader societal trends rather than specific events like the invasion of the Germanic tribes. Additionally, the passage does not provide enough context to definitively identify whether Tacitus was speaking out against any particular political or military strategy employed by Rome, such as maintaining large armies or responding to barbarian attacks.\n\nTherefore, without further context or analysis, option B (Concern about barbarian attacks) cannot be ruled out entirely based solely on the excerpt provided. However, option A would seem more likely given the language used in the excerpt.\n\nOption C (Absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy) is not supported by the information provided. Tacitus was a Roman senator and historian, not a Stoic philosopher, so there's no indication that Stoicism was absent among the aristocracy at the time. The passage itself does not mention Stoicism or its followers.\n\nOption D (Maintenance of large armies) is also not directly supported by the excerpt. While it's possible that Tacitus might have been critical of the maintenance of large armies, especially if they were seen as contributing to the decline of Roman power and influence, the excerpt does not specifically state that the army was too large or that it was maintained in an ineffective manner."
