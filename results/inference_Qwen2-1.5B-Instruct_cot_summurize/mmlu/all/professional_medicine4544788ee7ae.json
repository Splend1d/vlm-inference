The vaccine used to prevent polio is called IPV (Intradermal Polio Vaccine). Some people may experience mild side effects from receiving this vaccine, including redness, itching, or swelling at the injection site. However, these symptoms usually go away within a few days without any medical intervention. If someone experiences severe allergic reactions like hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the throat, tongue, face, or lips after receiving the vaccine, they should seek immediate medical attention."
