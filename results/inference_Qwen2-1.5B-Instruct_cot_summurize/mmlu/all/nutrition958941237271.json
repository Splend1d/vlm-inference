Suppression of milk production: Smoking can interfere with the body's ability to produce sufficient amounts of breast milk.\n2. Altering the composition of breast milk: Smoking can alter the nutritional content of breast milk, which may impact the health of the baby.\n3. Increasing the risk of early cessation of breastfeeding: Smoking during pregnancy or lactation increases the likelihood that a woman will stop breastfeeding before her baby is 6 months old.\n4. Increased risk of complications during breastfeeding: Smoking can increase the risk of infections, such as pneumonia, in both the mother and baby.\n5. Risk of premature birth and low birth weight: Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of preterm labor and low birth weight babies.\n6. Reduced effectiveness of vaccines: Smoking during pregnancy can also reduce the effectiveness of certain vaccines for the infant."
