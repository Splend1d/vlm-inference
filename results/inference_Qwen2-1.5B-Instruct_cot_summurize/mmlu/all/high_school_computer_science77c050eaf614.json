Scenario 1: Cars line up in a single lane at a car wash. As each driver reaches the entrance of the car wash, the driver gets out of the car. An automatic pulley moves the car through the car wash as the driver walks to the exit of the car wash to pay and pick up the car. Scenario 2: Contestants auditioning for a reality television talent show are assigned a unique numeric ID upon completing a registration form. Scenario 3: Tennis balls are sold in a cylindrical can that can hold a maximum of 3 balls, where each ball except the bottom one rests on top of the ball below it. The 3 balls are placed in the can one at a time through one opening at the top of the can. The 3 balls are removed from the can one at a time through the same opening. Which of the following shows the data structures that best model the scenarios? Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3\n\nA. Dictionary/map | Queue | Stack\nB. Dictionary/map | Stack | Queue\nC. Queue | Dictionary/map | Stack\nD. Stack | Queue | Dictionary/map\n"
