The contractor decided to submit a bid to do the construction. The contractor contacted all of the subcontractors she had worked with in the past, informed them of the specifics of the school construction project, and asked each to submit a bid for the work they would be requested to perform. An insulation company submitted a bid of $25,000 to do the required insulation work in the new school. Based on that and other subcontract bids, the contractor prepared a general bid and submitted it to the city. Three days after the contractor submitted the bid to the city, the insulation company notified the contractor that it had overbooked its workforce and would be unable to perform the insulation work. The next day, the city notified the contractor that she had won the bid to build the school. The contractor was forced to find another company to do the insulation work. The other company charged the contractor $30,000 to do the insulation. Which of the following arguments best supports the claim for $5,000 by the contractor against the insulation company?\n\nA. The contractor had made an offer to the insulation company that the latter accepted when it submitted its bid.\nB. The insulation company had made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city.\nC. The insulation company's bid was an offer that it was obligated to hold open, because the insulation company and the contractor were merchants.\nD. An option contract was created, because the contractor used the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city and notified the insulation company of that fact.\n"

The insulation company had made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city. When the contractor submitted its bid to the city, it considered the insulation company's bid as part of the overall package of services being offered for the construction of the school. Therefore, the contractor did not have any obligation to notify the insulation company about the use of its bid, and the insulation company did not have any obligation to continue to hold the bid open. As a result, the contractor should have been able to negotiate better terms or find another company willing to provide the insulation service at a lower price."
