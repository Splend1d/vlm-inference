When the driver could not produce a driver's license, the officer asked him if he minded if they searched the vehicle. The officer did not advise the driver that he had a right to refuse consent or that if he refused his decision would be honored, but there was nothing duplicitous or coercive in the officer's conduct. The driver smiled and said \"of course, no problem.\" The officer found stolen bank checks under the rear seat. In a later suppression motion, the driver claimed that his consent was not voluntary. What will the court most likely decide on that issue?\n\nA. The consent was voluntarily given and was not the result of coercion or duress.\nB. The consent was involuntary because it was the product of implied duress.\nC. The consent was involuntary because the officer did not advise the driver of his right to refuse.\nD. The consent became voluntary as a matter of law when the driver failed to produce a driver's license.\n"

The consent was voluntarily given and was not the result of coercion or duress.\n\nIn order for an individual to give informed consent to a search, they must have been fully aware of what is being searched for and why it is being searched for. If the officer did not inform the driver of their right to refuse or did not provide them with any information about the contents of the vehicle, then the driver may have felt coerced into giving consent. However, if the driver was fully informed and understood the nature of the search and the reason for it, then they may have given consent voluntarily. In this case, the court is likely to find that the consent was voluntary based on the fact that the driver agreed to the search without reservation and did not object to it."
