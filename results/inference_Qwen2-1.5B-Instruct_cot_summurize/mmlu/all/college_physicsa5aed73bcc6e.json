In this case, we want to find the value of R, which represents the resolving power of the spectrometer.\n\nGiven that the grating spectrometer can just barely resolve two wavelengths of 500 nm and 502 nm, respectively, we have:\n\nR = (500 nm) / (502 nm)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nR \u2248 0.987\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal, we get:\n\nR \u2248 0.987\n\nTo convert this to a whole number, we multiply by 1000 to get:\n\nR \u2248 987\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the given options. The closest option would be B. 250, but this is not an exact match for the calculated value of R. The correct answer is likely D. 10,000, since it matches the calculated value of R very closely. However, without more information or context about the actual value of R, it's impossible to determine which of the given options is the most accurate representation of the resolving power of the spectrometer."
