These sites date back thousands of years, making them some of the oldest known human settlements in the world.\n\nArchaeologists have characterized these sites as being part of an archaic state, which refers to a society with complex social structures and political organization but limited economic resources. The people who lived there likely had access to certain materials, such as stone, wood, and metal, but they did not have advanced technology or tools like those found in more developed societies.\n\nIt's important to note that the term \"archaic state\" is just one way of describing this type of society, and it may not be the only accurate characterization of their culture and society. However, it provides a useful starting point for understanding the nature of the societies that constructed these monumental structures."
