Physical examination shows a 4-cm, necrotizing wound with a purplish black discoloration over the heel. Crepitant bullae producing profuse amounts of serous drainage are seen. A Gram stain of a tissue biopsy specimen shows gram-positive rods. The causal organism most likely produces which of the following virulence factors?\n\nA. Fimbriae\nB. Pneumolysin\nC. Polysaccharide capsule\nD. \u03b1-Toxin\n"

One such toxin is \u03b1-toxin, which is highly potent and causes necrosis when it enters cells. This factor contributes to the necrotizing nature of the wound in this patient."
