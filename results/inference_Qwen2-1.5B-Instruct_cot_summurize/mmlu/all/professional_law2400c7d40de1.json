A senator, in his investigation of infiltration by antigovernment organizations of national labor unions, found a provision in a law passed by Congress that makes it a crime for a member of an antigovernment organization to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the president is dismissed from his position by the executive committee of the union. During a legislative hearing, the senator made derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization. In determining whether the president has a valid cause of action against the senator for defamation, which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of law?\n\nA. Congressional committees do not have the authority to violate a person's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. A congressman shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate made by him during a congressional hearing.\nC. The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.\nD. It is not a denial of due process or of First Amendment rights for a congressional investigative committee member to make such utterances.\n"

The constitutional requirement for actual malice must be proved by the party defamed in order to recover in a defamation suit.\n\nIn the context of defamation laws, \"actual malice\" refers to a higher standard of proof required than mere negligence. To prove defamation, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant acted with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth. If the defendant can show that they acted negligently (i.e., did not know the statement was false), then they cannot be held liable for defamation. This means that the senator making derogatory statements about the president's involvement in an antigovernment organization would need to meet the higher standard of proving actual malice in order to succeed in a defamation lawsuit."
