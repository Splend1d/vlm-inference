While it is generally accepted that a syllogism can only have a materially true conclusion if all its premises are also materially true, this does not necessarily mean that a formally valid syllogism must always produce a materially true conclusion.\nFor example, consider the following syllogism:\nPremise 1: All humans are mortal.\nPremise 2: Socrates is a human.\nConclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.\nIn this case, the conclusion is materially true because both premises are true (all humans are mortal and Socrates is a human). However, the syllogism itself is not formally valid since the first premise is false.\nTherefore, option B is not necessarily true. It is possible for a formally valid syllogism to have a materially untrue conclusion even if all its premises are true."
