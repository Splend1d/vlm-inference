At the grand jury, a witness was asked the following question by the prosecuting attorney: \"Is it not true that 20 minutes after the accident you told the police that the defendant's car went through the red light?\" He answered, \"Yes. \"The defendant was also subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. The defendant was represented by counsel at the grand jury hearing. During questioning he was shown the witness's statement from his testimony. No objection was made to the introduction of the witness's statement. At the defendant's trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce into evidence the witness's statement from the deposition taken at the grand jury hearing. The defendant's attorney objects to this proffer of evidence. The objection at trial will be\n\nA. granted, because the statement is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nB. granted, because the questioning of the witness was leading.\nC. denied, because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the witness's testimony was hearsay.\nD. denied, because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the questioning of the witness was leading.\n"

Denied, because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the witness's testimony was hearsay.\nIn order to determine whether the statement should be admitted as evidence, the court must first consider whether it falls under one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. In this case, the statement is an admission of guilt offered by the witness during cross-examination at the grand jury hearing. This type of statement is typically admissible if the witness testifies about something they knew or believed when they made the statement. However, in this situation, the witness testified that they heard the defendant say that the defendant's car went through the red light, which is a statement of fact rather than an admission of guilt. Therefore, the statement would likely fall outside of the hearsay exceptions and would need to be excluded. It is up to the defense attorney to make a showing that the statement is admissible, but the burden of proof lies on them. If the defense does not make such a showing, the statement may be excluded even if the prosecutor argues that it is relevant."
