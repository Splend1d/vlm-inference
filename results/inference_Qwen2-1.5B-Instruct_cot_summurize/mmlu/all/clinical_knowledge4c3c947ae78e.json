This can result in symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, anxiety, tremors, and hyperthyroidism (an excess of thyroid hormones).\n\nThe condition may also cause changes in the neck due to the enlargement of the thyroid gland itself. The term \"Derbyshire Neck\" refers to a condition where the neck becomes swollen and painful due to inflammation of the lymph nodes in the neck.\n\nIt is more common in women than men, but it is not specific to any particular gender.\n\nGraves' disease is now recognized as being more prevalent in younger individuals compared to previous generations. However, the exact prevalence varies by region and population, so this statement is not universally true across all populations.\n\nTherefore, options A through D are all true statements about Graves' disease."
