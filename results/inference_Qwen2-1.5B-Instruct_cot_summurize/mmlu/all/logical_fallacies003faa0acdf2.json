The first premise states that if P then Q, and the second premise states that Q. To prove the conclusion, we need to show that if P, then Q. \n\nTo do this, we can use the minor premise as follows:\n\nIf P (the antecedent), then Q (the conclusion). This means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. Since the minor premise is \"if P then Q,\" it is affirming the antecedent. Therefore, the conclusion must be true if the antecedent is true, which is what we want to prove. \n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer."
