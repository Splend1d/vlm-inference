I can understand only in human terms.\nAlbert Camus, \"The Myth of Sisyphus,\" 1955\nThe passage above is best seen as exemplifying which of the following intellectual trends?\n\nA. A postwar reassertion of traditional religious values\nB. An expression of patriotic pride thanks to victory in World War II\nC. A modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities\nD. An increased willingness to embrace radical Marxism\n"

A modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities\n\nThe quote from Albert Camus suggests a questioning of traditional religious values and an exploration of existential themes rather than a reaffirmation of traditional religious beliefs or a celebration of nationalistic pride after World War II. The passage also implies a rejection of Marxist ideas about revolutionary change. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C."
