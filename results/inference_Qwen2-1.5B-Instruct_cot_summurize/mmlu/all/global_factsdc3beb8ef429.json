According to the World Health Organization (WHO), floods caused an estimated 347,000 deaths worldwide between 1980 and 2015.\n\nEarthquakes were also a significant cause of death in the 20th century, but their number is not as high as that of floods. In fact, earthquakes accounted for around 36,000 deaths from 1980 to 2015.\n\nVolcanic activity and wildfires were also major causes of death in the 20th century, but they have declined significantly since the last major volcanic eruption occurred in 1980 and the last major wildfire in North America in 2018 respectively.\n\nTherefore, the answer to which of the following was responsible for the most death in the 20th century would be C. Wildfires."
