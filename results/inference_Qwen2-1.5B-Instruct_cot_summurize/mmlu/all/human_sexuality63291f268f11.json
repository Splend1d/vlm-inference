However, it's important to note that this statement may not always hold true in all situations or individuals.\n\nWhen considering the statement from the perspective of current research, there are several factors that could influence whether two people with different attitudes will like each other:\n\n1. Personality traits: People who share similar personality traits tend to have more compatible attitudes towards each other, which can lead to better compatibility and attraction.\n\n2. Communication styles: If two people communicate effectively and respect each other's opinions, they are likely to get along well together.\n\n3. Shared interests: People who share common interests are more likely to enjoy spending time together and feel closer to each other.\n\n4. Social context: The social context in which two people interact can also play a role in how they perceive each other. For example, if one person feels uncomfortable around someone else due to their appearance or mannerisms, they may not find them attractive.\n\nTherefore, while it's possible that \"opposites attract\" may be true for some individuals, it's not necessarily true for everyone. It ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and individual preferences of each person involved."
