The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\nB. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained.\n\nWhen a substance undergoes a phase change (such as melting or boiling), it absorbs or releases heat energy depending on whether the process occurs in the liquid or vapor state. In this case, the sample and the water both undergo a phase change from liquid to vapor. When the sample changes its phase, it absorbs heat energy from the surroundings, while the water does the opposite: it loses heat energy to the surroundings.\n\nSince the sample absorbed more heat energy than the water released, it lost the same amount of thermal energy as the water gained. This means that the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water, which is consistent with option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the sample lost more thermal energy than the water gained, which contradicts the given information.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because there is no evidence provided that the sample's temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the final temperature is not necessarily less than the average starting temperatures, but rather it depends on how much heat energy was exchanged between the sample and the water during the phase change. If the exchange of heat energy was small, the final temperature could still be close to the average starting temperature."
