The first part of the proposition states that for every apartment, there exists at least one large house that is larger than it. This means that there are some large houses that are bigger than some apartments. \n\nThe second part of the proposition states that if two large houses are compared, then the smaller one cannot be bigger than the larger one. In other words, no two large houses can have the same size. \n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that no large house is bigger than all apartments."
