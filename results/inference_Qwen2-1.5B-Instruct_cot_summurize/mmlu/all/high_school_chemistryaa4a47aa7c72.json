In this case, the reduction half-reaction is represented by the formation of Ag+ ions and the oxidation half-reaction is represented by the formation of Fe2+ ions.\nAccording to the overall balanced equation, increasing the concentration of either Fe2+ or Ag+ will shift the cell potential towards the right, resulting in an increase in the cell potential. Therefore, option A (increasing [Fe2+]) would cause an increase in potential in the voltaic cell described by the above reaction. Option B (adding more Fe(s)) would not change the cell potential as it does not affect the number of electrons transferred during the reaction. Option C (decreasing [Fe2+]) would decrease the cell potential as it shifts the equilibrium towards the left, resulting in a decrease in the cell potential. Option D (removing some Fe(s)) would also decrease the cell potential as it reduces the amount of Fe present, which can shift the equilibrium towards the left. However, since removing some Fe(s) is not specified in the question, it cannot be determined whether this would cause an increase or decrease in the cell potential."
