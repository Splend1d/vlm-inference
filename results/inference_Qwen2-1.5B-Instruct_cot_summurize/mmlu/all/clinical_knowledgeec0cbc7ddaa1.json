With an increasing number of repeated sprints the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines.\n\nThis statement is false because with repeated sprints, the body adapts to the increased demand for oxygen and energy by increasing the production of lactate. As a result, the rate of accumulation of lactate increases over time as the body becomes more efficient at using energy from lactate. Therefore, the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle decreases over time with an increasing number of repeated sprints."
