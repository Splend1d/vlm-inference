They engage with their customers by responding to comments, sharing user-generated content, and running contests and promotions. This approach helps them build a loyal customer base and maintain a positive reputation online.\n\nB. Coca-Cola, C. Whole Foods, and D. Red Bull may also have an active online presence, but they do not typically share as much interaction with their customers as Starbucks does. While they might post updates about their products or campaigns, they don't often interact directly with consumers like Starbucks does."
