Guard cell ..... regulation of transpiration rate\n\nThe function of guard cells is to regulate the movement of water and minerals in and out of the plant, which helps maintain water balance and prevent overwatering or under-watering. They do this by opening and closing their stomata (small pores on the surface of leaves) in response to changes in atmospheric pressure. This process helps regulate the amount of water that enters and exits the plant."
