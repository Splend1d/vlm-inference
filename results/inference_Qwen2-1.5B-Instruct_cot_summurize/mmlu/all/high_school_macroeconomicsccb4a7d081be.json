This is because an increase in demand for goods and services will drive up prices, while a decrease in supply will reduce output. The amount of output that can be produced with a given amount of resources (such as labor and capital) decreases when the money supply decreases, which leads to a reduction in overall economic activity. Therefore, option A (raising the price level and output in the economy) is correct."
