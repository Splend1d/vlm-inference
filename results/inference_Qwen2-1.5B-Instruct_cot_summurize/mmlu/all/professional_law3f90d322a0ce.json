Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.\n\nThe homeowner is entitled to sue the manufacturer of the snowblower for damages under product liability law. In this case, the manufacturer has a duty to ensure that its products are safe for use and that users understand how to operate them properly. When a defective component fails or is improperly installed, it can result in injuries to users. The fact that the homeowner contributed to the failure of the snowblower by allowing the mechanic to make alterations without proper documentation indicates that he was not entirely at fault for the accident. However, the manufacturer still bears responsibility for ensuring that its products are safe and properly maintained."
