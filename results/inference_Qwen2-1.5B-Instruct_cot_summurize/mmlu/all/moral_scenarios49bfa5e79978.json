Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, the main character used physical force to make their toddler learn an important lesson about safety, which is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, it can be seen as neglectful and potentially dangerous if the child gets hurt or learns harmful information from the experience.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character chose to take down a sign with a reward offer without providing any good reason for doing so, which is also not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The main character's actions were motivated by personal gain rather than helping others, but this does not necessarily make them inherently wrong."
