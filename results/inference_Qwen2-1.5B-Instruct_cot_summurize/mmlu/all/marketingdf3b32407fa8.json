Grouping people according to their psychological characteristics, values, and lifestyles.\n\nPsychographic segmentation is a method used by marketers to group consumers into segments based on shared values, attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, lifestyle, and personality traits. This approach involves analyzing individual consumer behavior, preferences, and attitudes rather than demographics or geographic location. It helps companies tailor their marketing strategies to specific groups, leading to better customer engagement and sales."
