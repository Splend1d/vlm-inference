Output must have increased proportionally more than population.\n\nThis is because if the standard of living improves, it typically means that there is an increase in both output (the amount of goods or services produced) and population. However, this does not necessarily mean that output has increased by a larger percentage compared to population. In fact, it could be possible for output to increase at a slower rate than population growth, resulting in an increase in the ratio of output to population.\n\nFor example, suppose the standard of living improves such that each person produces 10 units of output per hour instead of 5 units before. If the population also doubles, then the total output produced will still be 200 units per hour even though the number of people producing it has doubled from 100 to 200. This is because the output per person has increased by a smaller percentage relative to the increase in population size. Therefore, option D is the most accurate conclusion based on the information provided."
