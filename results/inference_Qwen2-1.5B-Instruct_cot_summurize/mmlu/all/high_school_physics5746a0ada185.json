The only forces acting on the Space Shuttle are its weight and the gravitational force of the Earth.\n\nThe weight of the Space Shuttle is equal to its mass times the acceleration due to gravity (\\(mg\\)), where \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth. We know the radius of the Earth is approximately 6400 km, but since the space shuttle is orbiting at an altitude of 300 km, we need to calculate the effective radius of the Earth from which the space shuttle experiences its gravity.\n\nLet's denote the effective radius as \\(R_{eff}\\). Since the space shuttle orbits at a height of \\(h = R - r_{Earth}\\) where \\(r_{Earth}\\) is the radius of the Earth, we have:\n\\[ h = R_{eff} - r_{Earth} \\]\n\\[ h = R - r_{Earth} \\]\n\\[ R_{eff} = R + h \\]\n\\[ R_{eff} = 6400 + 300 = 6700 \\text{ km} \\]\n\nNow, let's plug in the values into the equation for gravitational force:\n\n\\[ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{R_{eff}^2} \\]\n\\[ F = (6.674 \\times 10^{-11}) \\frac{(5.97 \\times 10^{24})(9.11 \\times 10^{24})}{(6700)^2} \\]\n\\[ F = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\frac{(5.97 \\times 10^{24})(9.11 \\times 10^{24})}{(6700)^2} \\approx 2.3 \\times 10^{-11} \\frac{(5.97)(9.11)}{6700^2} \\]\n\\[ F \\approx 1.3 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 1 \\]\n\\[ F \\approx 1.3 \\times 10^{-11} \\]\n\\[ F \\approx 1.3 \\times 10^{-4} \\] N\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity on Earth is approximately \\(g = 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2\\).\n\nComparing these values:\n\n- A. 4.9 m/s^2\n- B. 8.9 m/s^2\n- C. 9.8 m/s^2\n- D. 10.8 m/s^2\n\nGiven that \\(1.3 \\times 10^{-4} < g < 1.3 \\times 10^{-3}\\), we can conclude that the correct answer is **C. 9.8 m/s^2**."
