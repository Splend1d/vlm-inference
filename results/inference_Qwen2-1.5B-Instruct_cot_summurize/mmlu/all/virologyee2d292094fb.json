Transfusion blood is screened: This involves testing donated blood for the presence of the virus before it is used in transfusions. If the virus is found, it may be removed or treated before use.\n  B. Vaccine has been developed: The parvovirus vaccine has been developed and is widely available. Vaccination can help prevent infection with the virus and reduce its impact on human populations.\n  C. A range of new antivirals: There have been advances in developing new antiviral medications that target specific strains of the parvovirus. These medications can be used to treat individuals who become infected with the virus, either as part of an outbreak or in response to individual cases.\n  D. Social distancing: While social distancing measures can help reduce the spread of other viruses, they may not be effective against the parvovirus. However, following these measures can help reduce the risk of transmission and minimize the severity of any outbreaks.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, C, and D are all ways that the parvovirus family can be targeted for reduction in disease."
