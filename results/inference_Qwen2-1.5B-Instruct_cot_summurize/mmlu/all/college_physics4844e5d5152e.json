                    "text": "The energy of the photon emitted when a particle transitions between two states is given by Planck's equation:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s), \\( c \\) is the speed of light in a vacuum (3 x 10^8 m/s), and \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nIn this case, we have a transition from state \\( n_1 = 3 \\) to state \\( n_2 = 1 \\), which means that the difference in energy levels is \\( 2n_1 - 2n_2 \\).\n\nSince the electron is replaced by a positron, the original energy level was actually the ground state of the atom (n=1), so the energy difference is simply \\( 2(1) - 2(3) = -4 \\) eV. This means the energy of the photon emitted is equal to the negative of the energy difference, or +4 eV.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the energy of the photon as a decimal value, we need to convert the positive energy into a decimal. The energy of the photon is therefore +4 eV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 12.2 eV**."
