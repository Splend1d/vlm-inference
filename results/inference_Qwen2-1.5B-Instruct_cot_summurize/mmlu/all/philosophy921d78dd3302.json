Plato argues that the knowledge of the logos or rationale of an object is more valuable than simply knowing its classification or categorization by us humans. The logos of an object provides insight into its nature and purpose, which can be different from our human perspective. Knowing the logos allows us to understand the object on a deeper level and appreciate its significance beyond mere classification. Therefore, knowing the logos is more valuable than merely knowing the object based on our own classifications."
