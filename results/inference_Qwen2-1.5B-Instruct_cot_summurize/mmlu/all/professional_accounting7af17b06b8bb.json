User credential setup and control over the actions that employees can perform.\n\nIn an SaaS model, users typically have access to their own personal accounts and do not need to share passwords with others or manage multiple login credentials for different applications. However, this means that the company needs to establish strong user authentication and control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information and can perform specific tasks within the application. This can include features such as two-factor authentication, role-based access controls, and audit trails."
