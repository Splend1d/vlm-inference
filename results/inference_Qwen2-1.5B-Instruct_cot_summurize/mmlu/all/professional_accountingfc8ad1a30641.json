This includes verifying that the internal auditor has conducted appropriate tests of controls, analyzed risk factors, and reviewed other relevant information to support their conclusions.\n\nIf the internal auditor's reports do not accurately reflect the results of their work or if there are discrepancies between the internal auditor's report and the procedures performed, this could indicate that the internal auditor may not be objective. In such cases, the independent auditor would need to take steps to address any concerns about the independence of the internal auditor."
