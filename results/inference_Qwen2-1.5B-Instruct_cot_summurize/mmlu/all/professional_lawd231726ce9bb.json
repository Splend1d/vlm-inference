Fearing that the girl would beat out her daughter for the last cheerleading position, the mother decided to kill the girl. One night while the mother and her boyfriend were having dinner, the mother asked him to kill the girl. The mother handed her boyfriend a gun and gave him the home address where the girl lived. Unknown to the boyfriend, the mother gave him the wrong address. By mistake, the boyfriend went to the home of a family who lived across the street from the girl. The boyfriend rang the doorbell and a woman opened the door. The boyfriend asked the woman if her daughter was home. The woman called for her daughter to come to the front door. When she did so, the boyfriend shot and killed both the woman and her daughter. The mother should be found guilty for which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Conspiracy and voluntary manslaughter.\nB. Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.\nC. Solicitation and two counts of murder.\nD. Solicitation and attempted murder.\n"

Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.\n\nThe mother conspired with her boyfriend to commit murder by giving him the wrong address and allowing him to go to the wrong location, resulting in the accidental killing of the woman and her daughter. This constitutes an attempt to commit murder, which is a crime in itself. Additionally, the mother's actions constitute voluntary manslaughter since the death occurred during the commission of a felony (the attempted murder) and not as a result of provocation or self-defense. Therefore, the mother should be found guilty of conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder."
