The government charged the gun dealer and the friend with conspiracy to commit bank robbery. Can the charge of conspiracy to commit bank robbery be upheld against the gun dealer?\n\nA. Yes, he conspired to help the friend commit some unknown criminal act.\nB. Yes, he is held to the foreseeability that the friend was going to commit a crime.\nC. No, there was no agreement to conspire to rob a bank.\nD. No, a conspiracy would have required that the gun dealer go to the bank with the friend.\n"

Yes, he is held to the foreseeability that the friend was going to commit a crime.\n\nIn order for someone to be found guilty of conspiracy to commit bank robbery, they must have agreed or intended to join in an attempt to commit that offense. This can occur even if the individual does not participate in the actual commission of the crime. In this case, the gun dealer did not actually rob the bank himself; however, his actions were foreseeable consequences of the friend's actions, which led to the bank being robbed. Therefore, the government has sufficient evidence to prove the conspiracy charge."
