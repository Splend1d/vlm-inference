                    "text": "To find Aston's share of the ordinary income from AB Partnership, we first need to calculate his share of the total income before any deductions or adjustments.\n\nThe total income for the partnership includes both ordinary income and a long-term capital gain. The partnership had an ordinary income of $20,000 and a long-term capital gain of $12,000. So, the total income before any adjustments is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Income} = \\$20,000 + \\$12,000 = \\$32,000 \\]\n\nAston's basis in AB was $40,000. He received distributions of $5,000 during the year. Therefore, his adjusted basis (adjusted for distributions) would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Adjusted Basis} = \\$40,000 - \\$5,000 = \\$35,000 \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate Aston's share of the ordinary income by dividing the total income by the sum of their adjusted bases:\n\n\\[ \\text{Aston's Share of Ordinary Income} = \\frac{\\$32,000}{\\$35,000} = \\frac{32}{35} \\approx 0.915 \\]\n\nSince Aston's share must be a whole number, we round this down to the nearest whole number, which is 0. This means Aston's share of the ordinary income is $0, not $10,000 as stated in option A. \n\nHowever, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the provided options. According to the calculations above, Aston's share should be $0, but since the correct answer choice doesn't match with the calculated value ($0), I'll choose the closest one that matches Aston's share being $0, which is option D: $18,500. This aligns with Aston's adjusted basis minus distributions, considering his share of the income."
