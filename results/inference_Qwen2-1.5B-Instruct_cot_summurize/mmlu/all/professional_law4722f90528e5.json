An amendment to that act extends coverage to the states as employers. The federal district court allowed an injunction to prevent further discrimination but refused to allow money damages and legal fees against the state on the basis of 11th Amendment sovereign immunity. The plaintiffs appealed. What should the Court of Appeals decide based on the established jurisprudence regarding sovereign immunity?\n\nA. There is no sovereign immunity due to the First Amendment rights of the women to protest against discrimination.\nB. There is sovereign immunity that protects a state from any lawsuit by private citizens that the state does not authorize.\nC. There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.\nD. There is sovereign immunity under the Supremacy Clause and it would take a new constitutional amendment to abrogate the immunity granted to the states.\n"

There is no sovereign immunity where the federal law provides a remedy to women in a civil rights law intended to apply the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement rights against the states.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that the Eleventh Amendment provides a defense for states when they enter into contracts with the federal government or when they are sued by private parties. However, this defense does not apply if the federal statute at issue provides a private right of action directly enforceable against the state.\n\nIn this case, the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 does provide a private right of action directly enforceable against the state, which allows the women to sue the state for discrimination. Therefore, there is no sovereign immunity in this case, and the women can seek damages and legal fees from the state."
