There are objective principles for thought and action that are required for the good life.\n\nSocrates believed that appearances can deceive us about reality, but he also argued that there are objective principles that guide our actions and lead to the good life. These principles are not dependent on cultural differences or individual perceptions. They are based on reason and virtue, which are universal human values. Therefore, even if different societies may disagree on what constitutes the good life, it does not contradict the existence of these objective principles."
