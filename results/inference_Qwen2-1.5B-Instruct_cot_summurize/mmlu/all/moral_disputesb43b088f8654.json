Moral permissibility refers to the ethical considerations involved in doing something with respect to morality. Viability refers to whether or not an entity can exist or survive. \n\nIn summary, all three concepts - moral standing, moral permissibility, and viability - are necessary for an entity to have moral consideration in moral decision-making."
