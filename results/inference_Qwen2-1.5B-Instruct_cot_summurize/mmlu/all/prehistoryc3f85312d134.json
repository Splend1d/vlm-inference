This culture developed around 10,000 years ago and flourished until about 7500-6000 years ago. They were skilled hunters and gatherers who used stone tools to hunt animals and fish from lakes and rivers. The Maglemosian culture is considered one of the earliest examples of settled agriculture in Europe."
