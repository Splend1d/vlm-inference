This approach may increase aggression by making children feel that they must be aggressive in order to avoid punishment or negative consequences. It may also create a sense of fear and anxiety among children, which can further fuel their aggression. Exposure to a nonaggressive model, opportunities for catharsis, and social skills training are all more likely to reduce aggression in children by helping them learn healthy ways to deal with emotions and conflicts."
