The quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied of good X.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, firms in that industry set their prices based on supply and demand curves. When there is an excess demand for a product, the market will adjust by lowering prices to increase sales and bring back equilibrium. Similarly, when there is excess supply, prices rise until equilibrium is reached. This means that the quantity demanded always equals the quantity supplied, as each firm's actions are influenced by the decisions of others in the market."
