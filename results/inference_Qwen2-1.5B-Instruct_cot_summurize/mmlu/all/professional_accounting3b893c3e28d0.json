If Smith is actively involved in the rental real estate activities, he can only deduct up to 80% of his passive losses ($40,000) against his active income ($120,000). The remaining 20% of his passive losses would be carried forward and cannot be deducted until he's no longer actively participating in those activities or they cease to be passive.\n\nIn this case, since Smith is still actively involved in the rental real estate activities, he can only deduct 80% of his losses, which is $32,000 (since $40,000 * 0.8 = $32,000).\n\nTherefore, the maximum deduction for passive losses is $32,000."
