This can lead to the loss of microtubule stability and the formation of stress fibers or other structures.\n\nIn the context of neural development, exposure of neurons to cytochrome cB may cause the microspikes on the growth cone to undergo irreversible depolymerization, leading to the detachment of the growth cone from the axon. This process is thought to be important for the proper orientation and movement of the growth cone during neurite extension and branching processes."
