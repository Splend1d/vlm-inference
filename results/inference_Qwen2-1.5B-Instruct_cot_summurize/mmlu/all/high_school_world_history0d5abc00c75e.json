By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nAccording to this passage, why did the Chinese, despite inventing gunpowder, fail to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry?\n\nA. They were discouraged by Confucian traditionalism from doing so.\nB. They put too much faith in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces.\nC. They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\nD. They could not afford the initial expense of converting to a new military technology.\n"

They logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.\n\nBased on the information provided, the passage states that while China did invent gunpowder, they focused on improving horse archer units rather than developing advanced gunpowder weaponry. This suggests that they believed their current military tactics were sufficient to protect them from threats from steppe nomads, which were primarily mobile and had limited mobility themselves. Therefore, they did not see the need to invest in developing advanced gunpowder weapons, which would have required significant resources and expertise. Instead, they continued to refine and improve their existing horse archer units, which were already effective at combating the country's most dangerous enemies."
