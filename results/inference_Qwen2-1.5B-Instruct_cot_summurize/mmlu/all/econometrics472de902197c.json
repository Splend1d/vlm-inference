(-4.79,2.19). \n\nTo calculate the 95% (two-sided) confidence interval for the intercept term of the model, we need to use the formula:\n\nCI = estimate \u00b1 (t * SE)\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, estimate is the estimated value of the coefficient, t is the t-value corresponding to the desired level of significance and degrees of freedom, and SE is the standard error.\n\nIn this case, the estimated value of the intercept term is -0.36 and the standard error is 0.45. We can find the t-value using a t-distribution table or calculator with 1 degree of freedom at 95% significance level which gives us approximately 2.366. Then, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nCI = -0.36 \u00b1 (2.366 * 0.45)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nCI = (-0.36 + 1.13) or (-0.36 - 1.13) = (-1.49, 0.76)\n\nHowever, since we want a two-sided confidence interval, we take the positive and negative values of the calculated interval and combine them to get:\n\n(-1.49, 0.76)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. (-4.79, 2.19)."
