The stomata are typically found on the undersides of the leaves where they allow gas exchange with the surrounding water. However, in order for the leaves to remain submerged, there needs to be enough water conductive (xylem) cells present at the base of the leaf. This allows the water-lily to absorb water from the surrounding water column as it floats.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct, as the leaves of Nymphaea odorata will have stomata on the bottom surface and relatively many water-conducting (xylem) cells."
