Therefore, determining the evolutionary relatedness of different species based on the amino acid sequence of homologous proteins using silent mutations would be less accurate compared to determining relatedness based on the nucleotide sequences of homologous genes. \n\nGene duplications, translocation events that change gene sequences, and crossing-over can all lead to changes in the amino acid sequence of homologous proteins, which can affect their function and thus provide more information about their evolutionary relationships."
