                    "text": "To determine how much KOH is needed to neutralize the H3PO4, we first need to calculate the number of moles of KOH that can react with one mole of H3PO4. Then, we'll use the molarity of KOH to find out how much KOH is required for each mL of H3PO4.\n\nThe reaction between KOH and H3PO4 produces water and potassium phosphate (KH2PO4).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\\[ K_2O + H_3PO_4 \\rightarrow KH_2PO_4 + H_2O \\]\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of KOH reacts with 1 mole of H3PO4 to produce 1 mole of KH2PO4. Since we have 50.0 mL of H3PO4, we want to know how many moles of KOH will react with this volume.\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{V}{M} \\]\nwhere \\( V \\) is the volume in liters and \\( M \\) is the molarity.\n\nFor 50.0 mL of 0.150 M H3PO4:\n\\[ n = \\frac{50.0 \\text{ mL}}{0.150 \\text{ M}} = 333.33 \\text{ mol} \\]\n\nSince 1 mole of KOH reacts with 1 mole of H3PO4,\n\\[ n_{\\text{KOH}} = 333.33 \\text{ mol} \\times 1 = 333.33 \\text{ mol KOH} \\]\n\nNow, to find the amount of KOH required per mL of H3PO4, divide the total moles of KOH by the volume in liters:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles per mL} = \\frac{n_{\\text{KOH}}}{V_{\\text{H3PO4}}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{moles per mL} = \\frac{333.33 \\text{ mol}}{50.0 \\text{ mL}} = 6.667 \\text{ mol/L} \\]\n\nThis means that for every 6.67 mol of KOH, 1 mol of H3PO4 is neutralized.\n\nTo find how much KOH is needed to neutralize 50.0 mL of H3PO4, multiply the moles per mL by the volume in liters:\n\n\\[ \\text{mL of KOH} = \\text{moles per mL} \\times \\text{volume in L} \\]\n\\[ \\text{mL of KOH} = 6.67 \\text{ mol/L} \\times 0.500 \\text{ L} = 3.335 \\text{ mL} \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places gives us approximately 3.34 mL. However, since there's no option provided, we round down to 3.33 mL to match the closest answer choice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 27 mL."
