The pedestrian sued the occupants of all the rooms from which the chair might have been thrown. At trial, the pedestrian has been unable to offer any evidence as to the exact room from which the chair was thrown. The defendants have filed a motion for a directed verdict. Should the court grant the motion?\n\nA. No, because it is unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to prove which of the defendants caused the harm.\nB. No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\nC. Yes, because a plaintiff always has the burden to prove that a particular defendant's conduct was the factual cause of the plaintiff's physical harm.\nD. Yes, because the pedestrian has failed to offer evidence that the defendants jointly engaged in tortious conduct.\n"

No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\n\nUnder the doctrine of alternative liability, if multiple parties could be liable for the same injury or damage, and there is no evidence pointing towards one specific party, then each party may potentially be held liable. In this case, the pedestrian cannot provide evidence of which specific room the chair was thrown from, but the defendants can still be held liable under alternative liability principles.\n\nTherefore, even though the pedestrian has not proven the specific defendant responsible, they can still seek damages against the group of defendants who may have committed the tortious act together. This allows the doctrine of alternative liability to apply, making the defense of joint and several liability valid."
