Borrowers at fixed interest rates and those with savings earning fixed interest rates are directly affected by inflation because their interest rates increase as the cost of borrowing or saving increases. Restaurant owners may also be affected if they need to raise prices due to increased costs.\n\nIndividuals on fixed incomes are indirectly affected by inflation because their purchasing power decreases, which can lead to higher prices for goods and services. This means that they have less money to spend on necessities like food, housing, and healthcare.\n\nRestaurants may also be affected if they need to raise prices due to increased costs, but this option does not specifically mention them. Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer.\n\nSo, the most accurate answer is D. II, III, and IV only."
