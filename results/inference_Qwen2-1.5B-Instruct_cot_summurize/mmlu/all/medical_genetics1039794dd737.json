However, it is important to note that this does not mean that individuals with the \u03b54 allele will develop PDD; many people who carry this allele do not develop the condition.\n\nOther genes that have been implicated in the development of PDD include:\n\n- APP (amyloid precursor protein): This gene encodes the protein beta-amyloid, which is one of the main components of the plaques and tangles found in Alzheimer's disease.\n- PS1: The gene encoding presenilin 1, a key enzyme involved in the processing of amyloid precursor protein into beta-amyloid.\n- PS2: The gene encoding presenilin 2, another key enzyme involved in the processing of amyloid precursor protein into beta-amyloid.\n- TDP-43: This gene has been linked to the development of PDD through its role in neuronal function and metabolism.\n- NFE2L1: This gene has also been linked to PDD through its role in regulating neurogenesis and neuronal survival.\n\nIt is important to note that while these genes have been linked to an increased risk of developing PDD, they do not guarantee that someone will develop the condition. Other factors such as lifestyle, environment, and genetic predisposition play a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease."
