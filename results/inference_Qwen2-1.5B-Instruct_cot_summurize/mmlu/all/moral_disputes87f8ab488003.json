He suggests that there are three main sources of obligations:\n\n1. Rights - These are obligations imposed by law or social convention, such as contracts.\n2. Free-living commitments - These are obligations that arise from the voluntary agreement between parties, without any external force.\n3. Special relations - These are obligations that arise from relationships with specific individuals or entities, such as family members or employees.\n\nTherefore, option D (all of the above) is correct."
