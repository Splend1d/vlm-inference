In Marxist theory, the mode of production refers to the social relations that determine how goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed within a society. It includes factors such as the division of labor, capital accumulation, and the organization of production through factories and other industrial enterprises. The mode of production is seen as a central aspect of the capitalist system because it determines the structure of economic activity and the distribution of wealth and power."
