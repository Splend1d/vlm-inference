The car swerved out of control, jumped the curb, and crashed into a home. The defendant was arrested and charged with the separate crimes of larceny and malicious destruction of property. During the trial the judge instructed the jury that the theft of the car was sufficient evidence to satisfS' the malice requirement for the malicious destruction of property charge. The defendant's attorney has filed a motion objecting to the judge's jury instruction. The judge's instruction was\n\nA. correct, because malice can be inferred from the intent to steal.\nB. correct, because malicious destruction of property is a general intent crime.\nC. incorrect, because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property.\nD. incorrect, because malice requires a showing of recklessness.\n"

Incorrect, because larceny is not a lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property.\n\nMalicious destruction of property is a specific intent crime, meaning that the defendant must have intentionally destroyed someone else's property with the purpose of causing damage or injury. Larceny, on the other hand, is a general intent crime, which means that the defendant did not necessarily intend to destroy anyone else's property but rather took it with the intention of stealing it.\n\nIn this case, the defendant stole the car and then caused an accident while operating it within the posted speed limit. This behavior does not necessarily demonstrate that the defendant had the specific intent required for malicious destruction of property. Therefore, the judge's instruction may be considered incorrect if the intent to cause harm (malicious destruction) is not clearly established based solely on the fact that the car was stolen.\n\nHowever, without additional context about the specific circumstances of the case, it is difficult to determine whether the judge's instruction was correct or incorrect in this particular instance. It is important for the defense attorney to review the court's instructions carefully and argue against them if necessary."
