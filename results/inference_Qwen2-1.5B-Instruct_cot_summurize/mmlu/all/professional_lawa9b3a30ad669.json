Therefore, the creditor cannot sue the debtor for the amount of the discharge (in this case, $15,000) because the discharge has already occurred and the obligation has been extinguished.\n\nHowever, if the debtor were to successfully sue the person who had contracted to buy his house, then the creditor could potentially recover the remaining balance of the discharge ($5,000), plus any other damages or costs incurred as a result of the breach of contract. In this case, the creditor would not be entitled to recover the full $15,000 due to the discharge of the original debt, but rather only what was recovered from the sale of the house."
