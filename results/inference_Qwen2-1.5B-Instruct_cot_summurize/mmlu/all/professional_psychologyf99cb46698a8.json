Pay and other benefits were not adequately linked to team performance.\n\nResearch has shown that Total Quality Management (TQM) can be successful only if it is aligned with the goals of the organization and its employees. If the pay and other benefits offered to employees do not reflect their contributions to the team or the company's success, they may lose motivation and interest in contributing to TQM efforts. Therefore, it is important for organizations to provide fair compensation and benefits that are directly tied to employee performance and organizational success."
