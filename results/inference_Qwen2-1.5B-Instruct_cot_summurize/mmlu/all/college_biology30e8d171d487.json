These organic molecules provide the energy and building blocks necessary for the growth and development of an oak tree. The roots take up these organic molecules through a process called translocation, which involves the transport of nutrients from the soil into the plant. As the tree grows, it releases some of these nutrients back into the soil as part of its decomposition process, contributing to the overall dry mass of organic matter in the soil."
