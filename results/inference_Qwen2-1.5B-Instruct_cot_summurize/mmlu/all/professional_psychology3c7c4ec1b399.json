In this case, the standard error of measurement of 15 points means that if we take a sample of 100 people and measure their scores, we can expect that around 95 out of those 100 people's scores would fall within plus/minus 15 points of the average score.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation of the standard error of measurement is that it represents the variability of the scores within an individual's group. It does not imply anything about the reliability of the measurements or any other aspect of the data. The standard error of measurement is simply a way to estimate how spread out the scores are from the overall mean."
