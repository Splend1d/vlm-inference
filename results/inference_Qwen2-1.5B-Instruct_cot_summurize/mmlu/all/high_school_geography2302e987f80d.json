In stage 4, which marks the end of the traditional demographic transition phase, there is a significant increase in the proportion of people over the age of 60 compared to those under the age of 15. This is often accompanied by a decline in fertility rates and an aging population. The high sex ratio in this stage indicates that men outnumber women, which can lead to social and economic challenges such as gender discrimination and a shortage of marriageable men."
