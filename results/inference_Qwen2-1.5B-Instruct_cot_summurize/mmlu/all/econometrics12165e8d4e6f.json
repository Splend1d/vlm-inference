For an adequate model, the residual (hat) will be zero for all sample data points.\n\nIn the standard linear regression model, the equation takes the form:\n\ny = \u03b20 + \u03b21x + u\n\nwhere y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, and u is the error term. The parameter \u03b20 represents the intercept, while \u03b21 represents the slope of the line. The error term u is assumed to have a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance \u03c3\u00b2, where \u03c3\u00b2 is known as the variance of the error term.\n\nFor an adequate model, it is assumed that the error term u is uncorrelated with both the independent variable x and the dependent variable y. This means that there is no correlation between the residuals (u-hat) and either x or y. Therefore, for an adequate model, the residual (hat) will be zero for all sample data points."
