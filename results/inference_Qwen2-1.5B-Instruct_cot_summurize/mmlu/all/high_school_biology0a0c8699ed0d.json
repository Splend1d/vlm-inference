He argued that the more closely related two different organisms are, the more likely they share genetic similarities, which can lead to speciation through sexual reproduction or allopatric speciation if they are not close enough to form a single population.\n\nTherefore, the closer two organisms are related, the more recent their common ancestor, and the more likely they share genetic similarities, which is why the more closely related two different organisms are, the more similar their habitats are (A), the less similar their DNA sequences are (B), and the less likely they are to have the same genes in common (D)."
