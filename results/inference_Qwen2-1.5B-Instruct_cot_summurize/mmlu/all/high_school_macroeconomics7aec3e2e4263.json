The United States begins to export rice to eliminate a domestic surplus.\n\nWhen the world price of rice is lower than the domestic price, it means that there is excess supply in the international market and excess demand in the domestic market. In this case, the government may choose to encourage exports by offering financial incentives or other forms of support. This can help to reduce the domestic surplus by reducing the amount of rice being produced domestically.\n\nOn the other hand, if the world price of rice is higher than the domestic price, it means that there is excess demand in the international market and excess supply in the domestic market. In this case, the government may choose to discourage imports by imposing tariffs or other forms of protection. This can help to reduce the domestic surplus by reducing the amount of rice being imported into the country.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The United States begins to export rice to eliminate a domestic surplus."
