The State which persistently and publicly objects to the formation of a rule of customary law from its outset.\n\nPersistent objectors are states that actively oppose or resist the creation, recognition, or enforcement of certain rules or principles through their actions and statements. In the context of customary international law, persistent objectors are those states that have consistently opposed the formation of new rules on the basis of their own interests or positions.\n\nFor example, some states may argue that certain rules or practices should not be recognized as customary because they are based on historical agreements or traditions that were not universally accepted at the time. Other states may object to the application of certain rules or principles if they conflict with their domestic laws or interests.\n\nIn contrast, states that accept the formation of new rules on the basis of their own interests or positions are considered as parties to the rule of customary law. However, these states may still retain objections regarding the content or implementation of the rule."
