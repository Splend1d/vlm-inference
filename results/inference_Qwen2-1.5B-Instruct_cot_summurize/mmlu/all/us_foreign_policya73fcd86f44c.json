Both can be viewed as different means of achieving the same liberal ends\n\nExceptionalism is often associated with a belief in the uniqueness of one's own country or culture, and the idea that it has a special place in the world. This can lead to a desire for isolationism, which involves avoiding involvement in foreign affairs and maintaining a distance from other countries.\n\nOn the other hand, internationalism is the belief in the importance of working together with other nations to achieve common goals and promote peace and stability around the world. This can involve engaging in diplomacy, trade, and cooperation with other countries.\n\nWhile both exceptionalism and internationalism share a commitment to promoting liberal values and ideals, they may take different approaches to achieving those goals. Exceptionalists may prioritize their own cultural and national interests over global concerns, while internationalists may believe that the needs of the many outweigh the interests of the few.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to view exceptionalism and internationalism as different means of achieving the same liberal ends."
