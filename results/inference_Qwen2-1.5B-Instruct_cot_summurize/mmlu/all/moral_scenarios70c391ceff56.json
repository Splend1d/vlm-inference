This action aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn scenario 2, grabbing your puppy and leaving your Picasso is a morally questionable action because it prioritizes personal possessions over helping others or protecting them from harm. It also involves a violation of trust and can cause emotional distress for those you leave behind. Therefore, this action goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
