Pupillary dilatation and a medial strabismus\n\nThis is because the third cranial nerve, which supplies the muscles that control eye movement, is responsible for controlling pupil size and shape. If there is damage to this nerve, it can result in dilation (widening) of the pupils, which is also known as pupillary dilatation. This can lead to a medial strabismus, where the eye appears to move inward towards the midline of the face."
