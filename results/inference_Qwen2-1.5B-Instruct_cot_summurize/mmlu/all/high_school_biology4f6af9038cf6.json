Since then, most cells on Earth have internal organelles. Which of the following best summarizes an advantage of having internal membranes and organelles?\n\nA. DNA can reproduce more efficiently.\nB. Even though prokaryotes do not have mitochondria, they contain structures that carry out the same function.\nC. Organelles separate specific reactions in the cell and increase metabolic efficiency.\nD. Compartmentalization enables prokaryotes to reproduce more quickly.\n"

This compartmentalization allows for efficient use of cellular resources, such as energy production and waste removal, which ultimately leads to increased metabolic efficiency and overall cell function."
