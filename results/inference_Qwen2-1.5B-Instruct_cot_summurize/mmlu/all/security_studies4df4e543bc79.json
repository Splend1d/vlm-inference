Security studies theory refers to the historical systematic distinction between strategic studies and security studies and the interrelation between general International Relations (IR) theory, security studies, and security theory.\nB. The centre of the security studies debate has been to give form to policy questions - strategy, economy of defence, decision making - and to the systematic division of labour that has governed those distinctions.\nC. Security theory is a specific subset of security studies and one whose development has gone through distinctive phases and divided more strongly than comparable fields, often without mutual recognition.\nD. Security debates structured scholarship centred on offensive versus defensive realism, the relative importance of ideational variables and the role of power and institutions in orders and empires.\n"

Security studies theory refers to the history and structure of the field, with a focus on the relationship between general international relations theory, security studies, and security theory. It also includes the debate over whether security studies should be considered a distinct field or simply part of other disciplines such as political science or sociology. Additionally, it discusses the development of security theory as a specific subset of security studies and the different phases of its evolution."
