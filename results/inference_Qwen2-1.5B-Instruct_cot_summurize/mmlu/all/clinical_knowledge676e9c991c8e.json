A functioning nodule on isotope scanning may indicate that the nodule is actively secreting hormones, but it does not necessarily mean that the nodule is cancerous.\n\nLymph node enlargement is not necessarily indicative of a thyroid swelling, and an ultrasound of the swelling is not the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone. The best test for this purpose is an endocrinologist consultation with an ultrasound scan of the neck and a fine needle aspiration biopsy if necessary.\n\nTherefore, options B, C, and E are incorrect. Option A is also incorrect because thyroid swellings do not always elevate when swallowed."
