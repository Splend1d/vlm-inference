As they reached the car, a defendant, who was visibly intoxicated, emerged from behind a trash can and approached them. The defendant knocked the brother to the ground and hit him over the head with a trash can, causing the brother to lose consciousness. The defendant then forced the sister into the car and raped her. The defendant is charged with assault with intent to commit rape, based on his attack on the brother. The defendant's best defense would be which of the following statements?\n\nA. Although the sister was only 15 years old, she appeared to be 16 years old to a reasonable man.\nB. The defendant did not intend to rape the sister.\nC. The defendant's intoxication at the time negated the required general intent.\nD. It is impossible to prove that the defendant was the perpetrator because the parking lot was dimly lit.\n"

Although the sister was only 15 years old, she appeared to be 16 years old to a reasonable man.\n\nThe defendant's best defense in this situation might be that although the victim was underaged, they appeared to be an adult to a reasonable person due to their appearance. This could potentially make it more difficult for the prosecution to prove that the defendant intended to rape the sister. However, it is important to note that this is a complex case and there may be other factors at play as well."
