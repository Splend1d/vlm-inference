This is because older individuals are more likely to have underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to HIV infection and complications from the virus. Additionally, many older adults may not seek medical care or treatment for HIV/AIDS as frequently as younger individuals, leading to poorer outcomes if they do contract the virus."
