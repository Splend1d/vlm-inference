According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, intentionally alerting a TSA agent to someone they believe may be a terrorist without any evidence or reason is considered morally wrong. Taking a child's feet away from them to prevent them from dancing is also considered morally wrong, even if it is done with good intentions. Therefore, both scenarios involve actions that go against ordinary moral standards and therefore result in being classified as \"wrong\"."
