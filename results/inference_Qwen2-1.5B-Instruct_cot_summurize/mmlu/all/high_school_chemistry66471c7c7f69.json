                    "text": "The correct answer is B: Q must be close to 1.0 since there is one mole of gas on each side of the equation.\n\nExplanation:\nThe balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sulfur (S) and oxygen (O2) to form sulfur dioxide (SO2) is:\n\nS(s) + O2(g) \u2192 SO2(g)\n\nThis means that 1 mol of S reacts with 1 mol of O2 to produce 1 mol of SO2. The stoichiometry of the reaction indicates that both reactants will be consumed in the same amount as products, leading to a complete reaction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that either S(s) or O2(g) will be completely used up. This is not necessarily true; both reactants can be completely converted into products.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the reaction does not go to completion. While the reaction produces sulfur dioxide, it also consumes sulfur and oxygen, so the total number of moles of reactants and products remains constant.\n\nOption D is incorrect because adding more oxygen does not affect the equilibrium constant for this reaction. The equilibrium constant is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium, which remains unchanged regardless of the concentration of the added reactant."
