It uses empirical methods such as surveys, interviews, and observation to collect data about how people live their lives and interact with each other. Sociology aims to provide a deeper understanding of society by examining the relationships between individuals, groups, and institutions. While sociology does draw on personal experience and perspectives, it also draws on a wide range of research contexts to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the social world. Therefore, option C is correct."
