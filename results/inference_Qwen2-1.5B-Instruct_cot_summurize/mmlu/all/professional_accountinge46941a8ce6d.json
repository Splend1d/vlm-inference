Let's do that:\n\n\\[ P_5 = -\\frac{(1+r)^{-1}}{r} = -\\frac{1}{r^2} \\cdot (1 + r)^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{r^2} \\]\n\\[ P_{10} = -\\frac{(1+r)^{-10}}{r} = -\\frac{1}{r^{9}} \\cdot (1 + r)^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{r^{9}} \\]\n\nThe NPV (\\(N_PV\\)) is then:\n\n\\[ N_PV = -\\sum_{t=1}^{2} (-r)^t P_t = -\\left(-\\frac{1}{r^2} - \\frac{1}{r^{9}}\\right) \\]\n\n\\[ N_PV = \\frac{r^2 + r^{9}}{r^{10}} \\]\n\nNow, plug in the given values: \\(r = 1/10\\) or \\(0.1\\) (as the problem states the interest rate as 10%).\n\n\\[ N_PV = \\frac{0.1^2 + 0.1^{9}}{0.1^{10}} = \\frac{0.01 + 0.001}{0.01} = \\frac{1}{10} \\]\n\nTherefore, the project has a negative NPV of $0.1, which rounds to $0.01 when expressed as a percentage, or $1%. \n\nSo, the correct answer is **C. $3**."
