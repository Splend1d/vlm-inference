It is commonly used in molecular biology research to study the structure and function of genes, as well as to diagnose diseases such as HIV/AIDS and cancer. The technique involves the use of a pair of DNA primers (short RNA molecules) and a thermostable DNA polymerase enzyme to amplify a specific DNA sequence. This process can be repeated many times until the original DNA has been completely amplified."
