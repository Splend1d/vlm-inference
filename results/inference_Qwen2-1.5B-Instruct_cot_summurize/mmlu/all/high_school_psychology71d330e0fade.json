In this case, the person who has been sunbathing would have had their skin exposed to high temperatures for some time before entering the pool, so their skin temperature would have adjusted to match that of the surrounding environment. This is known as thermal equilibrium.\n\nHowever, the person who has been inside in the air conditioning would not have experienced any change in their skin temperature because their body temperature would have remained constant due to the controlled cooling provided by the air conditioning system. Therefore, when they entered the pool, their skin temperature would have returned to its normal range, which would be cooler than the pool's temperature. This is why the pool with water temperature of 82 degrees may feel cool to them but warm to someone who has been sunbathing."
