Selling under 10 units a year to Roberta is not necessarily indicative of the status of a merchant, but it could be one factor among many that may influence whether Wendy Wholesaler is considered a merchant or a casual party. Other factors such as holding oneself out as an expert in the goods sold to Roberta, dealing in the goods sold to Roberta, and being a wholesaler rather than a retailer may also be relevant. However, the most important factor would likely be the intention of Wendy to sell her goods to Roberta for profit."
