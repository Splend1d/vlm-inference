                    "text": "The most appropriate conclusion about the effect of regular exercise on the risk for hip fracture would be:\n\nD. Statistically significant overall increase in risk\n\nThis is because the relative risk ratio of 1.2 suggests that there is an increased risk of hip fractures among those who exercise regularly compared to those who do not exercise. This difference is statistically significant at the 0.01 level, which means it is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone. Therefore, we can conclude that regular exercise has a statistically significant impact on the risk of hip fractures."
