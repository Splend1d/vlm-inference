In order to ensure the availability of sites for the disposal of spent fuel from the nuclear power plant, the state refused to supply electric power to out- of-state purchasers residing in states that would not accept spent fuel from the plant for storage or disposal. Assume that no federal statute applies. Which of the following is the strongest argument that the state's action is constitutional?\n\nA. A state may condition the sale to out-of-state purchasers of any products produced in that state on the willingness of those purchasers to bear the fair share of the environmental costs of producing those products.\nB. The generation of electricity is intrastate by nature and therefore subject to plenary state control.\nC. The state itself owns and operates the power system, and therefore its refusal to supply power to out-of-state purchasers is not subject to the negative implications of the commerce clause.\nD. The state's action is rationally related to the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\n"

The state's action is rationally related to the health, safety, and welfare of state citizens.\n\nThis argument suggests that the state's decision to refuse to supply electric power to out-of-state purchasers is based on a legitimate concern for public health, safety, and welfare. By refusing to sell power to out-of-state purchasers, the state may be able to protect its own environment and workers from the potential risks associated with storing and disposing of spent fuel. Additionally, this argument acknowledges that the state has a responsibility to consider the impact of its actions on the broader community, even if those actions involve internal matters such as managing its own power system."
