Lists 3 and 4 only.\n\nProactive interference occurs when studying new information while recalling old information from memory, leading to decreased learning outcomes. In this scenario, you would want to study the information in list 1 first before moving on to list 2. This ensures that you have a strong foundation in list 1 before moving onto list 2, which can help prevent the negative effects of proactive interference.\n\nTherefore, if you were to start with list 3 or 4, you might recall information from list 1, making it more difficult to remember the information in list 2 later on. On the other hand, starting with list 1 allows you to build upon your knowledge without any potential for recall interference from previous studies."
