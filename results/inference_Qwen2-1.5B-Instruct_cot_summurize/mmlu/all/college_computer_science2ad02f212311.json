This allows for efficient allocation and deallocation of memory blocks. However, it can suffer from internal fragmentation if not properly managed, as different segments may be allocated to different processes, leading to wasted space. Virtual memory systems allow multiple physical pages to be mapped onto a single contiguous virtual address space, which can help mitigate this issue by allowing programs to access larger amounts of data than they can fit in their own segment boundaries."
