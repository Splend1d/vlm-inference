It emerged in the US and was exported to Europe. European security studies was \"theory has already been done\" kind of work.\nB. The think tanks became routine producers of narrow technical problem-solving succumbing to 'hectic empiricism': the internal logic of its key contribution (deterrence) broke down.\nC. Peace research developed on a parallel but separate track, and particularly the distinct critical branch was seen neither by its representatives nor by security studies as part of the latter.\nD. All of these options.\n"

                    "text": "The period of academic institutionalization of security studies can be assessed based on the following criteria:\n\n1. Emergence of specialized security studies: Security studies emerged as a distinct field of study with its own set of theories, methodologies, and practitioners. This is evident from the fact that it has its own journal, conferences, and publications.\n\n2. Development of think tanks: Think tanks have become a significant player in the field of security studies. They provide policy recommendations, conduct research, and offer expert opinions on security issues. Their work has contributed significantly to the development of security studies as an academic discipline.\n\n3. Shift towards narrow technical problem-solving: Security studies has shifted towards a narrower focus on specific problems such as terrorism, cyber warfare, and nuclear proliferation. This shift reflects the increasing importance of these issues in contemporary security policies.\n\n4. Breakdown of the internal logic of deterrence: Deterrence theory, which was once the cornerstone of security studies, has faced criticism for its inability to address complex security challenges. The internal logic of deterrence has broken down, leading to the emergence of new approaches such as preventive diplomacy and crisis management.\n\n5. Development of peace research: Peace research has developed separately from security studies, focusing on nonviolent conflict resolution and international cooperation. This has led to the creation of distinct branches within security studies, including peace studies and disarmament studies.\n\n6. Critique of security studies: Security studies has come under criticism for its narrow focus on military solutions and lack of attention to human rights and social justice issues. This critique has led to the emergence of alternative perspectives within security studies, such as critical security studies and post-colonial security studies.\n\nTherefore, all of the above options can be considered when assessing the period of academic institutionalization of security studies."
