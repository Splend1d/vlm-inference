In this case, the affixes \"-al\", \"ter-\", \"cy-\", and \"-tive\" combine to form prefixes like inter-, pre-, sub-, and trans-. These prefixes indicate relationships between different parts of the word.\n\nFor example, \"inter-\" means \"between\" or \"among\". \"Inter\" is an infix that combines with other suffixes to create new words. For instance, \"interconnect\" means \"to connect between\".\n\nTherefore, all these words have the same meaning - relating to the relationship between different elements within an environment (earth) or between various parts of the same element (environment). This is why the correct answer is C. earth; environment."
