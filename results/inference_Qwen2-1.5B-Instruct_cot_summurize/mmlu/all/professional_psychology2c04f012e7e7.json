Negative Reinforcement. \n\nNegative Reinforcement involves providing an unconditioned response (UR) as a consequence for an animal's behavior that is not immediately followed by an unconditioned stimulus (UCS). In the context of behavioral manipulation, time-outs can be used to decrease unwanted behaviors by removing the opportunity for those behaviors to occur. This type of reinforcement is effective because it reduces the likelihood of the behavior occurring again in the future."
