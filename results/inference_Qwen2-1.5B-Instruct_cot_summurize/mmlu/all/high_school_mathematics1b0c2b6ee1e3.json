This can be done using combinations since the order does not matter:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total arrangements} = \\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8!}{4!(8-4)!} = 70 \\]\n\nNext, we want to find the number of ways to arrange these balls such that there are an equal number of white and black balls in each group. Since there are 4 white balls and 4 black balls, we can think of arranging these balls as a balanced arrangement where half are white and half are black. The number of ways to do this is simply:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\binom{8}{4}}{2} = \\frac{70}{2} = 35 \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that all of the draws alternate colors is the ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total possible outcomes:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{alternate color}) = \\frac{35}{70} = \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{10}{7}} = \\frac{7}{10} \\cdot \\frac{7}{1} = \\frac{49}{10} = \\frac{49}{10} \\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction gives us:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{alternate color}) = \\frac{49}{10} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{10}{49}} = \\frac{49}{10} \\cdot \\frac{1}{49} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{10}{49}} = \\frac{49}{10} \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\( \\frac{1}{40} \\)."
