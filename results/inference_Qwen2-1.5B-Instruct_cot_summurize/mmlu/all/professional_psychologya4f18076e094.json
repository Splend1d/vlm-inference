Strong organizational cultures are those that promote collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement, which can lead to higher levels of job performance. However, it's important to note that organizational culture is not always positive or negative; it can also be neutral or even detrimental if it stifles creativity or fails to support employee well-being."
