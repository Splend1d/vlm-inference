Mergesort\n\nMergesort divides the input into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back together. The worst-case time complexity for Mergesort is O(n^2), because it involves nested loops that compare elements and swap them. However, on average, Mergesort performs well due to its divide-and-conquer approach.\n\nOn the other hand, Quicksort has an average-case time complexity of \u0398(n log n). It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around this pivot such that all elements less than the pivot are placed before it, and all greater elements are placed after it. This process is repeated recursively until each sub-array contains only one element or none at all. \n\nBubble sort, MergeSort, and Heapsort also have average-case time complexities of \u0398(n log n), while Bubblesort has a worst-case time complexity of \u0398(n^2).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Mergesort**."
