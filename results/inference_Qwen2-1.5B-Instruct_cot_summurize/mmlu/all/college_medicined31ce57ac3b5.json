The gustatory system is responsible for taste sensations, the olfactory system for smell, and the auditory system for sound. However, there are also chemoreceptors that can detect chemical stimuli without the involvement of the other senses. For example, the chemoreceptor in the ear detects changes in air pressure due to changes in concentration or temperature of the fluid in the middle ear, leading to changes in hearing sensitivity. Therefore, only I and III statements identify chemically-based sensory systems."
