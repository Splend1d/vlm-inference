This occurs when someone takes an opponent's argument out of context or with exaggerated details, creating a distorted image of the original argument. In this case, if the opponent does not take a specific position, you make an assumption about their position based on your own interpretation of what they might argue. This is a common fallacy because it misrepresents the opponent's argument and leads to an unjustified attack on them."
