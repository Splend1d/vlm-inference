                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Only ionizing groups on the enzyme participate in the reaction.\n\nAn enzyme's activity is typically regulated by its pKa (the pH at which 50% of the enzyme is in its unreacted form). This means that the enzyme has two active sites: one for the substrate to bind to, and another for the product to be formed. The enzyme's activity is highest when the pKa of the enzyme's active site matches the pH of the environment where the reaction takes place. If the pH is outside this range, the enzyme will not function properly, as the pKa may be too low or too high for the enzyme to have optimal activity.\n\nTherefore, if the enzyme's activity is constant over a broad range of pH values, it means that the enzyme can operate within its optimal pH range without losing activity. This is because the enzyme's active sites will remain functional even if the pH is outside the range of the enzyme's pKa. The pKa of the enzyme's active site will not change with changes in pH, so the enzyme's activity will remain constant regardless of the pH."
