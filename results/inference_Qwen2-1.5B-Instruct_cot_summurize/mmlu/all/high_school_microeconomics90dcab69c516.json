The student would not eat any more pizza: This statement does not hold true because the student ate three slices of pizza. \n\nB. The marginal utility of the 4th slice of pizza will be 0: This statement also does not hold true because the marginal utility of the fourth slice (which is the last slice) is not mentioned in the question. However, since we know that the marginal utility decreases as you consume more of an item, it's possible that the marginal utility of the fourth slice could be higher than zero or even negative if consuming additional slices leads to decreased satisfaction. \n\nC. The student should have stopped eating pizza after 2 slices: This statement does not necessarily hold true based on the given information. While the utility per slice decreases as you continue to eat, it doesn't mean stopping after two slices means the total utility is zero. It just means that after consuming two slices, the utility gained from the next slice would decrease significantly.\n\nD. The total utility this student received from eating pizza is 20 utils: This statement is correct. According to the problem, the utility gained from each slice increases until the fourth slice, at which point the utility starts decreasing. Therefore, the total utility received by the student is the sum of the utilities gained from each slice up to the fourth slice. Since the utility gained from the first slice is 10 utils, the utility gained from the second slice is 7 utils, and the utility gained from the third slice is 3 utils, the total utility received is 10 + 7 + 3 = 20 utils."
