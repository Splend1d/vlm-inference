It suggests that there may not always be a clear-cut right or wrong answer, but that certain actions are more likely to be morally justifiable because they are consistent with what society generally accepts as good behavior.\n\nTherefore, when someone acts according to a prima facie duty, it means that their action is considered right and appropriate within the context of the particular situation."
