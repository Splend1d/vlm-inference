The cranial nerves are a group of nerve fibers that supply sensory and motor functions to the head and neck. They include the oculomotor nerve (CN III), trigeminal nerve (CN V), facial nerve (CN VII), glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), and vagus nerve (CN X). The spinal nerves are a group of nerve fibers that provide sensory and motor functions to the body's muscles and other tissues. They include the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal spinal nerves. The autonomic ganglia are groups of nerve cells that control involuntary bodily functions such as heart rate, digestion, and respiration. They include the sympathetic ganglia and parasympathetic ganglia."
