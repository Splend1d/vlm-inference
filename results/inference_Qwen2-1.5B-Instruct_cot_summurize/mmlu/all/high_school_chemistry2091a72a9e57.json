Hydrogen bonding occurs when a hydrogen atom in a molecule forms a bond with an electronegative atom or group, such as oxygen or nitrogen, resulting in the formation of a polar covalent bond. In the case of CH3OH (methanol), it contains a hydroxyl group (-OH) that can interact with another hydroxyl group (-OH) on another molecule, forming a hydrogen bond.\n\nHowever, note that not all molecules have the ability to form hydrogen bonds, and some may not be able to do so under certain conditions. For example, if there is no sufficient energy available for the two atoms to repel each other, they will not form a hydrogen bond. Additionally, the strength of the hydrogen bond depends on various factors such as the nature of the atoms involved, the distance between them, and the temperature and pressure at which the reaction takes place."
