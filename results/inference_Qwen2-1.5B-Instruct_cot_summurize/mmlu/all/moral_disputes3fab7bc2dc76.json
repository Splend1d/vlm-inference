This means that Singer argues that it is morally wrong to treat one group of people (such as humans) differently than another (such as animals) because this would result in greater overall happiness or pleasure for those individuals who do not have the same rights and freedoms as those who do. Therefore, the principle of maximizing happiness is the only principle that logically leads to the conclusion that all animals are equal. The other options (the principle of minimizing suffering, the principle of double effect, etc.) may be relevant to understanding why treating animals with respect and compassion is important, but they do not directly lead to the conclusion that all animals are equal."
