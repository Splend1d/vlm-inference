We want to find the ratio of the forces acting on particle A (with charge q\u2081) to particle B (with charge q\u2082).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nF_A = k * (2Q * Q) / (4 m)^2\nF_B = k * (Q * Q) / (4 m)^2\n\nNow, let's calculate the ratios:\n\nF_A / F_B = (k * (2Q * Q)) / ((k * (Q * Q)) / (16 m\u00b2))\n= 2Q / Q\n= 2:1\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 1:02."
