C2H2(g) + 5N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + 5N2(g)\n\nThis equation shows a chemical reaction between hydrogen gas (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The reactants are gases, which means they are not in solution or suspension, so this reaction is considered a heterogeneous reaction.\n\nIn contrast, the other options are all examples of homogeneous reactions. A homogeneous reaction involves only one type of reactant and product, and both reactants and products are present in the same phase (gas, liquid, or solid).\n\nOption A is an example of a heterogeneous reaction because it involves gases (carbon monoxide and water vapor) and a liquid (carbon dioxide).\n\nOption B is also a heterogeneous reaction because it involves a liquid (ethanol) and a gas (oxygen).\n\nOption C is another example of a heterogeneous reaction because it involves a solid (copper) and a liquid (water).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. C2H2(g) + 5N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + 5N2(g)."
