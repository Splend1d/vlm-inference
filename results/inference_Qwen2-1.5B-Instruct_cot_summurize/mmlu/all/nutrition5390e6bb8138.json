However, generally speaking, it is recommended that women who are pregnant consume an extra 350 to 450 calories per day compared to their non-pregnant counterparts.\n\nDuring the first trimester (up until about 16 weeks), it's recommended that pregnant women consume approximately 950-1,300 calories per day. During the second trimester (around 17-28 weeks) it's recommended that they consume an additional 200-300 calories per day. Finally, during the third trimester (from around 29 weeks up until delivery) it's recommended that they consume an additional 200-300 calories per day.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C: An additional 200 kCal throughout pregnancy."
