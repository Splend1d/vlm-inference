Serving portions of mud pie to stuffed animals is considered morally wrong because it involves intentionally causing harm or discomfort to living beings. The second scenario, putting a fake diamond ring in a Tiffany box and telling your girlfriend it's real, while potentially deceitful, is not inherently wrong. However, if you did this with the intention of deceiving someone who trusts you, then it could be seen as morally wrong depending on the circumstances."
