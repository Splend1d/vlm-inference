Both adopt a liberal ideology.\n\nAmerican realism, while it shares some similarities with Critical Legal Studies in its focus on the law as an autonomous entity separate from society, does not share the same ideological leanings as CLS. While both movements may critique the law from within, they do so for different reasons and within distinct theoretical frameworks. \n\nCritique of Law: American realism critiques the law through its social context and argues that laws are not neutral but rather reflect power dynamics between different groups. It also questions the idea that law is self-contained or objective, suggesting that legal systems are shaped by societal values and norms.\n\nCLS: On the other hand, Critical Legal Studies adopts a more critical approach to law. Its focus is on how law operates in relation to broader social structures and power relations, challenging the notion that law is an independent and neutral institution. The movement emphasizes the role of law in reproducing inequalities and promoting inequality, arguing that legal institutions perpetuate these structures rather than addressing them directly.\n\nBoth movements seek to demystify the law by exposing its embeddedness in power structures and the ways in which law affects individuals' lives, but their approaches differ significantly. Thus, option C is inaccurate."
