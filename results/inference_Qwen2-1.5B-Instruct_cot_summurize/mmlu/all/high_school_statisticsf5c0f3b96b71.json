Use the 88 who did respond, using 120 as the sample size in the analysis.\n\nWhen conducting statistical analyses on a sample of data, it's important to consider the representativeness of the sample. In this case, we have a large population (all recent graduates) and a small sample size (only 120 responses). Using only 120 responses would limit our ability to draw conclusions about the entire population.\n\nOption A suggests using all 120 responses, which would give us an inaccurate picture of how many graduates did not respond. Option C suggests contacting non-respondents, but without additional information or context, it's unclear how effective this approach would be.\n\nOption D involves selecting additional respondents to replace non-respondents, which would likely increase the sample size but also introduces bias if the non-respondents are not representative of the overall population. This method could lead to incorrect conclusions about the sample's characteristics.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most appropriate choice for proceeding with the analysis given the constraints of having only 120 responses and wanting to maintain the representativeness of the sample."
