This means that there will be fewer entries in the page table for each page. This can lead to faster page replacement times as there will be fewer pages to replace.\n\nAn advantage of smaller pages is that they lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation. When a page is removed from memory, it must be replaced with another page, which may not be immediately available. Smaller pages allow for more efficient page replacement, as fewer pages need to be accessed during this process.\n\nNormaly, the dominant factor in disk access time is not dependent on page length, so longer pages can be used advantageously. Longer pages can provide better performance by allowing for more efficient page replacement and reducing the number of accesses required to find a particular page. However, it's worth noting that the actual impact of page length on disk access time depends on the specific hardware and software being used, and may vary depending on the workload and other factors."
