Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character is not doing anything that is clearly morally wrong because they were trying to help their spouse by providing them with a treat that might help them achieve their goals. This behavior is not inherently wrong and can be seen as a positive action.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is also not doing anything that is clearly morally wrong because they were not breaking any laws or regulations by bringing a weapon into the classroom. However, it is important to note that using a firearm for disciplinary purposes without proper training and supervision could potentially lead to harm to others, and this is generally considered a violation of safety protocols."
