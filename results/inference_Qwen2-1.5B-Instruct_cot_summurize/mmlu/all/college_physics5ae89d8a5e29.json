                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of the efficiency of a heat pump. The efficiency of a heat pump depends on the temperature difference between the indoor and outdoor environments. In this case, the outdoor environment has a temperature of -7\u00b0C (since it's colder than the indoor environment) while the indoor environment needs to reach 27\u00b0C.\n\nThe formula for calculating the efficiency of a heat pump is:\n\nEfficiency = \u0394T / T_in + \u0394T / T_out\n\nwhere \u0394T is the temperature difference between the indoor and outdoor environments, and T_in and T_out are the temperatures inside and outside the house respectively.\n\nIn this case, \u0394T = 27\u00b0C - (-7\u00b0C) = 34\u00b0C.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives us:\n\nEfficiency = 34\u00b0C / 27\u00b0C + 34\u00b0C / -7\u00b0C = 1.26 + (-4.58) = -3.32\n\nThis means that the heat pump is only about 96% efficient in transferring heat from the outdoor environment to the indoor environment.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much work must be supplied to the heat pump for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors. Since the heat pump is only about 96% efficient, it will actually transfer about 15,000 J * 0.96 = 14,400 J of heat to the outdoor environment.\n\nSince the efficiency of the heat pump is only 96%, the minimum amount of work required to supply this amount of energy is 14,400 J / 0.96 = 15,000 J.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 500 J."
