This is known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and is common in men over 50 years old. However, it's important to note that other factors such as smaller bladder size, kidney problems, or gallstones may also contribute to increased urinary frequency in older adults. Therefore, it's essential for older adults to monitor their urine output and consult with healthcare professionals if they experience significant changes in this area."
