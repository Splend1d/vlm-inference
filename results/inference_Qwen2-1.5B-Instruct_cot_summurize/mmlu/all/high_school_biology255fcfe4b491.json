Each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak as the drought persisted.\n\nDuring prolonged droughts, birds may evolve to adapt to their environment by changing various traits, including their beak size. In this case, if each bird's survival is dependent on the depth and strength of its beak, it can explain why some birds may have larger or stronger beaks compared to others. This could be due to natural selection favoring those individuals who are better adapted to their environment during the drought period. However, it does not necessarily mean that each bird evolved a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted."
