They plan to obtain and analyze the data from a sample of drivers. Which of the following is a true statement?\n\nA. A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to use systematic sampling on an available list of all AAA (Automobile Association of America) members in the city.\nB. A reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure would be to randomly choose families and include all drivers in each of these families in the sample.\nC. To determine the mean number of years between accidents, randomness in choosing a sample of drivers is not important as long as the sample size is very large.\nD.

The insurance company could also use stratified random sampling or cluster sampling to select a sample of drivers that better represents the population they are interested in studying.\n\nSystematic sampling may be appropriate if there is a specific reason for selecting a certain group of drivers, such as those who have had multiple accidents or those who are more likely to have accidents due to their driving behavior. However, this method requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that the sample is representative of the population being studied.\n\nUsing a family-based approach, where every driver in a family is selected, may also be appropriate depending on the context and goals of the study. But again, it depends on the specific circumstances of the study.\n\nIn summary, while systematic sampling is sometimes used, it's not always the best choice for this type of study, especially when the goal is to estimate the average number of years between accidents among all drivers in the city. Therefore, none of the given options accurately describe a reasonable time-and-cost-saving procedure for this study."
