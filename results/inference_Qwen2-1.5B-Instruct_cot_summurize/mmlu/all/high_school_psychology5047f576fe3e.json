A teacher has chemistry classes with the same number of students at 8:30 A.M. and 1:00 P.M., and volunteers to participate with her classes. A major problem in this study would be\n\nA. poor replication\nB. lack of a hypothesis\nC. confounding variables\nD. difficulty in obtaining informed consent\n"
