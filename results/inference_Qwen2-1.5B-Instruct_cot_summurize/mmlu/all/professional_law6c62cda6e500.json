The bar was crowded because a championship boxing match was being shown on the television sets in the bar, and many people had gone to the bar to watch it. During the second round of the boxing match, someone bumped into the customer, causing him to spill a drink on his pants. \"Hey, watch what you're doing, jerk!\" the customer said. The person who had bumped the customer was an employee of the bar hired as a bouncer to deal with unruly customers. Angered by the customer's statement, the employee immediately turned around and punched the customer in the mouth. If the customer asserts a battery claim against the owner of the bar, the customer will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because it was reasonably foreseeable that fights would occur in a crowd of people who were drinking a lot of alcohol.\nB. prevail, because the person who punched the customer was employed as a bouncer.\nC. not prevail, because the owner did not touch the customer.\nD. not prevail, because the owner should not be responsible for the intentional acts of the employee.\n"

Not prevail, because the owner should not be responsible for the intentional acts of the employee.\n\nIn order for the customer to prevail in a battery claim against the owner of the bar, the following must be true:\n\n1. The employee intentionally touched or struck the customer without their consent.\n2. The employee's actions were sufficiently deliberate and intended to cause harm to the customer.\n3. The customer was physically harmed as a result of the employee's actions.\n\nIf the employee's punch was accidental or due to negligence, the customer may still prevail if they can show that the employee knew or should have known about the risk of injury and chose to ignore it. However, if the employee acted intentionally and caused physical harm to the customer, the customer would likely prevail in a battery claim against the owner of the bar."
