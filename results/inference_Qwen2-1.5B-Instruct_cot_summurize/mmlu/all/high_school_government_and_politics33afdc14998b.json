The results of electoral college voting tend to distort the winner's margin of victory, when compared with the popular vote for president.\n\nThis is because the Electoral College consists of electors who represent each state and their number is determined by the population of each state. Therefore, it can be influenced by factors such as voter turnout, party affiliation, and demographic trends within each state, which may not always align with the overall national popular vote result. This is known as the \"winner-takes-all\" system, where the candidate who wins the majority of the electoral votes becomes the President regardless of how many people voted for them."
