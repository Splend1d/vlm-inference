The latching current, on the other hand, is the minimum current required to keep the SCR on after triggering.\n\nGiven that the latching current of an SCR is 20 mA, and assuming it's used as a switch, we can calculate the holding current by considering the difference between the latching current and the maximum possible current when the SCR is in its off state:\n\nHolding current = Latching current - Maximum off-state current\n\nSince the maximum off-state current for an SCR is approximately equal to the latching current (due to the nature of the device), we can say that the holding current is also 20 mA.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Option B. 40 mA**."
