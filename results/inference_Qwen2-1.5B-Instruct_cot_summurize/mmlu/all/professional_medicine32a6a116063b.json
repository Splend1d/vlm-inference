Neurologic examination shows weakness of the extensor and flexor muscles of the lower extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated. Sensation to vibration and position is decreased in all extremities, but the decrease is more prominent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. This patient most likely has a deficiency of which of the following vitamins?\n\nA. Vitamin B1 (thiamine)\nB. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)\nC. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)\nD. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)\n"

This vitamin plays a crucial role in the synthesis of myelin, which is essential for nerve function. A deficiency can lead to a variety of neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness, and loss of muscle tone. The patient's findings also support this diagnosis, including the exaggerated knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes seen with nerve damage. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)."
