This action goes against the principles of respect for human rights, equality, and non-maleficence. \n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, is not inherently wrong but can be seen as problematic depending on the context. It may be seen as a form of punishment or retribution if done with malicious intent or if the child's hunger is not being addressed through more appropriate means. However, from an ethical standpoint, it is generally considered acceptable to help alleviate someone else's suffering, such as by providing food or shelter. Therefore, while scenario 2 could potentially involve some wrongdoing, it would be less severe than scenario 1."
