                    "text": "To find the probability that at least one child develops a cavity by the age of 10, we can use the complementary probability approach: first calculate the probability that no child develops a cavity (i.e., all children remain healthy), and then subtract this from 1 to get the probability that at least one child develops a cavity.\n\nThe probability that a single child does not develop a cavity is $\\frac{5}{7}$ (since there are 5 healthy children out of 7). The probability that all 5 children do not develop cavities is $(\\frac{5}{7})^5$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one child develops a cavity is $1 - (\\frac{5}{7})^5$. This simplifies to:\n\n\\[1 - \\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^5 = 1 - \\frac{3125}{16807} = \\frac{16807 - 3125}{16807} = \\frac{16482}{16807}\\]\n\nThis fraction can be simplified further if desired, but for the purpose of selecting an answer choice, it's clear that the correct option is **D** \\(1 - P(X = 0)\\) because it directly calculates the complement of the given probability, which would give us the desired probability."
