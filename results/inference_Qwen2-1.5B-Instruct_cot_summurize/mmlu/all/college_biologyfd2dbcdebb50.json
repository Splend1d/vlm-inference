Occasionally the chromosome number of such a hybrid plant doubles spontaneously. Which of the following best describes the descendants of those plants with the double chromosome number?\n\nA. The plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants.\nB. The descendants would be at a selective advantage because of the increased ability to introgress.\nC. The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species.\nD. The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D: The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally.\n\nWhen two organisms, such as a hybrid plant with different chromosome numbers, mate, their gametes (sperm and egg) do not form due to differences in chromosome number. However, when these gametes come together, they can sometimes fuse and create zygotes that lack normal genetic material from both parents. These hybrids may not survive or develop properly, leading to reduced fertility and potentially even sterility.\n\nIf the resulting hybrid plant has an extra set of chromosomes, it will have an additional copy of each chromosome. This means that its DNA contains more information than what was originally present in its parents. If this occurs through spontaneous mutation or crossing over during meiosis, the offspring of these hybrids might have an even larger genetic load compared to the original parents.\n\nThis phenomenon allows for genetic variation within a population and can lead to beneficial traits being selected for by natural selection if they confer an advantage in a particular environment. However, if the extra chromosome(s) become deleterious, the offspring may suffer from severe reproductive problems, including sterility.\n\nIn summary, while the descendants of hybrids with the doubled chromosome number might not be immediately fertile, they can potentially regain the ability to reproduce sexually once the excess chromosomes are eliminated or balanced out. This process of balancing out chromosomal abnormalities in offspring is known as sex reversal, where the offspring's sex changes from female to male or vice versa."
