Saturn has a larger proportion of hydrogen and helium than Jupiter and is therefore less dense.\n\nSaturn, being one of the gas giants in our solar system, has a much lower density compared to Earth or other rocky planets. This is because it contains a high percentage of hydrogen and helium, which have lighter atomic masses than iron and other heavier elements found on Earth. The lighter elements tend to occupy a larger volume at a given density, leading to a relatively larger volume for a given amount of material.\n\nOn the other hand, Jupiter, also a gas giant, has a higher density due to its heavy composition with elements like hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. These heavier elements take up a larger space at the same density, resulting in a larger volume for the same amount of material. Therefore, even though Saturn is smaller in terms of mass, it has a significantly larger volume due to its lower density relative to Jupiter."
