When the crane was manufactured, some of the welding of its parts was done improperly. No one had ever noticed this manufacturing defect in the crane. The defect caused the crane to break and topple over. Part of the crane fell on the doctor's car. The doctor's car was completely destroyed. The car was valued at $35,000. The doctor had auto insurance, and the insurance company promptly paid the doctor $35,000 under the insurance policy. If the doctor brings suit against the manufacturer of the crane, will the doctor prevail?\n\nA. No, because the doctor had auto insurance, so she suffered no loss.\nB. No, because the manufacturer was unaware of the defect in the crane.\nC. Yes, because the manufacturer sold a product with a dangerous defect.\nD. Yes, because the manufacturer failed to inspect the crane adequately before selling it.\n"

If a defective product causes injury or damage, the manufacturer may be held liable for damages under consumer protection laws. In this case, the doctor's car was destroyed by a broken crane, which was likely due to a manufacturing defect. Therefore, the manufacturer may be responsible for the doctor's losses."
