Determine the cost per golf ball: The practice range charges $4.00 for a bucket of 40 golf balls.\n2. Calculate the cost per golf ball: Divide the total charge by the number of golf balls in the bucket to get the cost per golf ball.\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost per golf ball} = \\frac{\\$4.00}{40\\text{ golf balls}} = \\$0.10/\\text{golf ball} \\]\n\nNow, use this cost per golf ball to calculate the cost of a bucket with 100 golf balls:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of 100 golf balls} = 100\\text{ golf balls} \\times \\$0.10/\\text{golf ball} = \\$10.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(A) $10.00**."
