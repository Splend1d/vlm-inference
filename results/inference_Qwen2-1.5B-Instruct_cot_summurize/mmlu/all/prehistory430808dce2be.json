They also had larger brains compared to modern humans, with an average size that was about 10% greater than that of modern humans. Additionally, their skeletons contained more bones than those of modern humans, which may have contributed to their ability to withstand the harsh environmental conditions they lived in. Therefore, all of these characteristics make neandertals distinct from modern humans in terms of their physical features."
