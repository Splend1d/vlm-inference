The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been \"squatters\" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?\n\nA. Call her previous physician to obtain more history\nB. Order a chest x-ray\nC. Order a test for HIV antibody\nD. Repeat the PPD skin test\n"

Order a test for HIV antibody\n\nThe most appropriate step would be to order a test for HIV antibody, as the parents have reported that the child has never had any medical care in the past 2 years and has been living in squatter conditions, which could increase the risk of exposure to HIV. A chest x-ray may also be ordered if there are concerns about respiratory infection or other underlying conditions. However, it is important to note that a positive PPD skin test alone does not necessarily indicate an active infection with HIV, and further testing should be considered based on the results of the HIV antibody test."
