The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of such a solid is:\n\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\int_{a}^{b} (2y - x) dy \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the limits of integration and \\( y \\) ranges from \\( y_1 \\) to \\( y_2 \\). In this case, \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), \\( y_1 = 0 \\), and \\( y_2 = e^x \\).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the limits of integration:\n\n- When \\( y = 0 \\), \\( x = 0 \\)\n- When \\( y = e^x \\), \\( x = ln(e^x) = x \\)\n\nSo, \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\).\n\nNext, we need to determine the values of \\( y_1 \\) and \\( y_2 \\):\n\n- For \\( y_1 = 0 \\):\n\\[ y_1 = 0 \\]\n- For \\( y_2 = e^x \\):\n\\[ y_2 = e^x \\]\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the integral:\n\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{e^x} (2y - x) dy \\]\n\nTo evaluate this definite integral, we'll integrate with respect to \\( y \\) and then multiply by \\( 2\\pi \\) and divide by 2 to get the final answer in terms of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{e^x}(2y - x)dy \\right] \\]\n\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{2}[y^2 - xy]_{0}^{e^x} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ V = 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{2}[e^{2x} - xe^x] \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ V = \\pi [e^{2x} - xe^x] \\]\n\nWe don't have a calculator handy to directly compute the numerical value of this expression, but it looks like you've already found that the answer is closest to option C: \\( 2.427 \\).
