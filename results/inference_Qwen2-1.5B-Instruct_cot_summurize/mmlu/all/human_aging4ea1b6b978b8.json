All of the above.\n\nResearch has shown that there are significant gender differences in various aspects, including but not limited to hormones, risky behaviors, occupations, and smoking rates. These differences can be attributed to a combination of biological, social, and cultural factors. For example, women tend to have lower levels of testosterone than men, which may affect their risk for certain health conditions such as breast cancer. Additionally, men are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as alcohol and drug use, while women are more likely to choose careers in nursing or teaching. Finally, studies have found that smoking rates vary significantly between genders, with men being more likely to smoke compared to women."
