Greater acceptance of eclecticism\n\nSince the late 20th century, there has been a growing recognition that different therapeutic approaches can be effective for different individuals with different mental health issues. This shift towards an eclectic approach reflects a broader move away from a one-size-fits-all approach to therapy and towards a more personalized and flexible treatment plan. Eclectic therapy is characterized by the use of multiple therapeutic techniques and approaches, allowing therapists to adapt their methods based on the needs of each individual client."
