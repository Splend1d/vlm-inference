The leftward shift in AD in response to the rising interest rates from expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nThe crowding-out effect refers to the phenomenon where government spending leads to an increase in aggregate demand (AD), but at the same time, it reduces private investment, leading to a reduction in aggregate supply (AS). This is because when the government spends more, the price level rises, which makes goods and services less attractive to consumers who may then spend less on private investment, reducing the amount of private capital available for use by firms. Therefore, the government's spending does not have a direct positive impact on AD, but rather causes a reduction in AD."
