The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The investor entered into a leasehold agreement with a tenant, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: \"Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. \"After the tenant took possession and the investor accepted her rent payment for the first floor of the building, which of the following most accurately describes the legal relationship between the parties?\n\nA. A tenancy at will was created.\nB. A periodic tenancy from month-to-month was created.\nC. A periodic tenancy from year-to-year was created.\nD. The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.\n"

The tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term.\n\nIn this scenario, the investor has leased the first floor of his building to the tenant for an initial period of three years. The lease provides for monthly payments of $1,000 for the first floor, but does not specify whether it is a fixed-term or periodic tenancy. However, the fact that the lease specifies an annual rental amount of $12,000 suggests that the landlord (the investor) reserves the right to receive the full amount each year.\n\nUnder the law, if the landlord reserves the right to receive a specific amount every year, then the lease is considered a periodic tenancy from year-to-year, rather than a tenancy at will. In this case, the tenant's lease is for a specified number of years, which is greater than one year, so it becomes a periodic tenancy from year-to-year.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the legal relationship between the parties is that the tenant's equitable three-year term became a legal three-year term."
