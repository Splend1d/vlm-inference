This is considered an act of kindness and compassion towards the animal.\nIn contrast, the main character in scenario 2 did something that could be considered morally wrong. By helping their brother who is struggling with drug addiction, they may have contributed to his problem by enabling him to continue using drugs. Additionally, finding a rehabilitation center for their brother may not necessarily solve the underlying issue of drug use, but rather just provide temporary relief. Therefore, the main character in scenario 2 did something that could be seen as morally wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
