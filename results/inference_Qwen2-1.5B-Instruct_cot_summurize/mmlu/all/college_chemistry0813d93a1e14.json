                    "text": "The correct answer is C: Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nOptical isomerism refers to the phenomenon where molecules exhibit different optical properties depending on their orientation in solution, such as their ability to absorb light or emit it in certain directions. In complex systems with achiral (non-chiral) ligands, the presence of multiple ligands does not necessarily lead to the formation of chiral centers that would result in optical isomerism. However, in linear complexes, the arrangement of ligands along the axis of rotation leads to the formation of a net chirality due to the spatial distribution of the ligand pairs and their orientations relative to each other. This means that even in linear complexes, the presence of two different ligands can give rise to optical isomerism. Therefore, option C is the correct statement."
