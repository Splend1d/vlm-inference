Illicit Cash Flow: Ashford argues that illicit cash flows from rich countries to tax havens exceed aid to the world's poor, which undermines efforts to address poverty and inequality around the globe.\n\n2. Neoliberal Economic Policies: Ashford also contends that neoliberal economic policies have had mixed and at worst adverse impacts on the economic and social rights of the world's poor, particularly in developing countries.\n\n3. Pressing Political and Economic Advantages: Finally, Ashford highlights how wealthy nations use their political and economic power to secure unfair trade agreements with poor countries, further exacerbating the inequalities between rich and poor nations.\n\nTherefore, option D (all of the above) accurately reflects Ashford's argument against the violation of the rights of the world's poor by global social institutions."
