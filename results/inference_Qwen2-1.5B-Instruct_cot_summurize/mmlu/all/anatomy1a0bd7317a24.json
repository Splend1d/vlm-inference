Mucous membranes\n\nMucous membranes, such as those found around the eyes and mouth, play a crucial role in protecting the body from harmful bacteria by trapping them and preventing them from entering the bloodstream. Additionally, the immune system can also recognize and fight off certain types of bacteria through the production of antibodies. However, hair in the nose is not part of the human body's defense mechanism against environmental bacteria."
