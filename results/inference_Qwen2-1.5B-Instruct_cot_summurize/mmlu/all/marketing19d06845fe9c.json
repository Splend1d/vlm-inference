Time utility.\n\nTime utility refers to how efficiently resources (such as labor, materials, and capital) can be used based on their availability and the timing of production versus consumption. In other words, it's about the optimal use of time for resource allocation and scheduling. \n\nOwnership utility refers to how much control individuals have over the ownership of goods or assets. It involves factors such as property rights, legal systems, and economic incentives.\n\nAccessibility refers to the ease with which people can access goods or services, which can impact both the demand for those goods and the efficiency of production and distribution processes.\n\nInformation utility refers to how easily information can be accessed and utilized, which can impact decision-making processes and innovation."
