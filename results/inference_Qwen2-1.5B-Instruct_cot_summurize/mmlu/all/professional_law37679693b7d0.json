She claimed that the owner had sexually harassed her and then caused her wrongful termination. A jury returned a verdict of $100,000 for the former employee. Two weeks after the court entered judgment on the verdict, the employer filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. Rule 12(b)(6), claiming that it did not have at least 15 employees as required by the definition of an \"employer\" under the civil rights statute. The employer claimed that there was therefore no federal subject-matter jurisdiction. The lower court agreed, dismissed the case and voided the judgment. On appeal to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, will the appellate court likely uphold the lower court's decision?\n\nA. Yes, because a challenge to jurisdiction can be made at any time, even after judgment has been entered, and here the jurisdictional requirement was missing.\nB. Yes, because an appellate court has no authority to reverse a lower court's finding that there was no subject-matter jurisdiction.\nC. No, because a judgment entered on a jury verdict can never be changed or attacked after a judgment is entered.\nD. No, because this is a challenge to the existence of a cause of action, i.e., the failure to state a claim, which does not go to jurisdiction and cannot be raised post-judgment.\n"

No, because this is a challenge to the existence of a cause of action, i.e., the failure to state a claim, which does not go to jurisdiction and cannot be raised post-judgment.\n\nIn general, if a party challenges the existence of a cause of action after a final judgment, the appellate court will generally uphold the lower court's decision unless there is clear error in the application of law or fact. In this case, the issue is whether the plaintiff had sufficient evidence to support their claim of sexual harassment and wrongful termination, and whether they could establish a viable claim based on those facts.\n\nIf the appellate court finds that the plaintiff did not have sufficient evidence to support their claims, or if they cannot prove a viable claim based on the evidence presented, then the court may affirm the lower court's decision upholding the dismissal of the case. However, if the appellate court determines that there was insufficient evidence to support the plaintiff's claims or that the plaintiff cannot prove a viable claim based on the evidence presented, then the court may reverse the lower court's decision and allow the case to proceed to trial."
