However, based on Kant's philosophy, he believed that morality should be based on reason and duty rather than emotional desires or societal norms. Therefore, it would be incorrect to say that any of these activities would be morally permissible according to Kant's views. \n\nKant believed that moral actions should be performed out of duty and self-interest, rather than for pleasure or reward. He also believed that individuals have a responsibility to act according to their own rational capacities and not let their emotions lead them astray. Therefore, even if an individual finds themselves tempted by certain behaviors, they should still strive to act according to their own rational capacities and avoid acting immorally."
