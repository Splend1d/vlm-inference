However, according to the World Bank, as of 2021, only about 3% of the country's population has access to electricity. Therefore, based on this information from 2021, it seems unlikely that the percentage of the population with access to electricity would have increased by more than a few percentage points since then. It is possible that the situation may have improved slightly over time, but without specific data for 2016, it is difficult to say exactly how much."
