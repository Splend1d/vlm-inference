(I \u2261 ~H) \u2192 ~(~I \u2261 H)\n\nNow, let's fill in the truth table with the possible values of I and H:\n\n|  I   | H   | ~I | ~H |\n|-----|----|---|---|\n| T   | F | F | T  |\n| T   | T | T | T  |\n| F   | F | T | F  |\n| F   | T | T | F  |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that:\n\n- When I = T and H = F, both propositions are true.\n- When I = T and H = T, only proposition I is true.\n\nThus, the two propositions are not logically equivalent because their truth tables show different behaviors when either I or H is true. They are also not contradictory because one of them always evaluates to true, while the other always evaluates to false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent."
