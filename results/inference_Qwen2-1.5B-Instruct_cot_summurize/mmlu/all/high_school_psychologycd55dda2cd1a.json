Reliability refers to how consistent a test or measure is over time and across different people who take it. By comparing the scores from the first administration with those from the second administration, Jupiter can assess whether the score distributions have remained stable or if there have been any changes in the level of perfectionism among the students. This could indicate that the new version of the test is more valid and reliable than the old one."
