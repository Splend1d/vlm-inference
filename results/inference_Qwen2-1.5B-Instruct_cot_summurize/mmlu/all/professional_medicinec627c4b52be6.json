He does not think the symptoms are problematic, but his wife is concerned because he sometimes falls asleep on the sofa early in the evening when guests are present. He also once fell asleep while driving at night and drove off the road, narrowly avoiding injury. His wife says that he has always snored loudly, and over the past year, he has had episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 105 kg (231 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2 . His pulse is 76/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 150/76 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. 24-Hour ambulatory ECG monitoring\nB. Multiple sleep latency test\nC. Polysomnography\nD. CT scan of the head\n"

It records brain waves, eye movements, and respiration during sleep to assess whether there are pauses in breathing, low oxygen levels, or abnormal movement patterns. Other tests like 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring, multiple sleep latency test, and CT scan of the head may be used as part of the diagnostic workup, but they are less specific than polysomnography."
