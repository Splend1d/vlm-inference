If the Durbin-Watson statistic has a value close to zero, it suggests that there may not be any serial correlation between the residuals of the model and the original dependent variable.\n\nHowever, if we consider the first-order autocorrelation coefficient, which measures the correlation between the dependent variable at time t and the dependent variable at time t-1, then it would be more appropriate to say that the value of this coefficient is close to zero when the Durbin-Watson statistic is close to zero. This is because the presence of serial correlation can cause the values of the residuals to move around in a pattern, making them less predictable over time, which is reflected by a low Durbin-Watson statistic.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Close to zero."
