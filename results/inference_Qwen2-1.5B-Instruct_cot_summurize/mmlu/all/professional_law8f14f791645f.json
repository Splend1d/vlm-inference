Not prevail, if the operator of the subway was not negligent in making the stop.\n\nThe law typically holds that passengers on public transportation owe a lower duty of care to others than they would owe to themselves or other passengers. This is known as the \"public policy exception.\" The exception allows a passenger's negligence to be considered in determining whether their conduct contributed to the accident, but not necessarily the cause of the accident itself. In this case, the sudden stop may have been caused by the operator, but the commuter cannot hold the operator liable for the resident's injury under the public policy exception. Therefore, the commuter will not likely prevail in the claim against the subway company."
