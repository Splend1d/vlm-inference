Down syndrome\n\nAlpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are typically higher in pregnant women with normal pregnancy outcomes compared to those with abnormalities such as Down syndrome, exomphalos, or neural tube defects. This is because AFP is produced by the placenta and helps to monitor fetal development. Therefore, if the maternal serum level of AFP is lower than average in a woman who has Down syndrome, it suggests that there may be an issue with fetal development or growth."
