All of the above.\n\nBrandt argues that whether a moral code is \"ideal\" depends on several factors including the complexity of the rules, how many people might violate them, and the costs associated with the restrictions placed upon individuals by the code. Therefore, options A and B can be considered as aspects of an ideal moral code, while option C is also relevant since it relates to the potential consequences of following or not following such a code."
