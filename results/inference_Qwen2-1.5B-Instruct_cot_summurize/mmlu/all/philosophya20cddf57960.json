Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it implies that everyone's actions are always either merciful or just, which is not necessarily true. \n\nOption B is also incorrect because it suggests that the primary purpose of human existence is to think and know rather than to act and do. This is a misinterpretation of Socratic philosophy, which emphasizes practical wisdom over mere abstract reasoning.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that we can only refer to how people characterize actions without knowing why such actions should be characterized that way, which contradicts Socratic philosophy's emphasis on understanding the underlying reasons behind our actions."
