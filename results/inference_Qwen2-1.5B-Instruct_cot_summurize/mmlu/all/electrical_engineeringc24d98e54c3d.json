This means that each digit in hexadecimal corresponds to exactly 4 bits when converted to binary.\n\nFor example, the hexadecimal number A (which represents the decimal number 10) would be represented as 0001 in binary. Similarly, the hexadecimal number F (which represents the decimal number 15) would be represented as 1110 in binary.\n\nTherefore, for each hexadecimal digit, there will be 8 bits when converting it to binary."
