Is the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination proper?\n\nA. No, because the witness's character for truthfulness cannot be attacked by specific instances of conduct.\nB. No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is collateral and ambiguous.\nC. Yes, as impeachment for bias and interest.\nD. Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n"

Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.\n\nPrior inconsistent statements refer to statements made by a witness at different times or under different circumstances that are inconsistent with each other. In this case, the witness has testified that the defendant made the statement in question shortly after his arrest, but later denied making it during the police interview. This inconsistency could be used to impeach the witness's credibility and suggest that she may not be truthful. Therefore, the prosecutor can ask questions related to the inconsistency to test the witness's credibility and reliability."
