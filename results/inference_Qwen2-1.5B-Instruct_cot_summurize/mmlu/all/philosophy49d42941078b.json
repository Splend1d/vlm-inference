In his view, each individual has a right to their own life and property, and it is only through the consent of all individuals that these rights can be protected. If an individual violates this right by treating another person as a mere means or tool for their own benefit, then they have committed injustice. This is because the individual's actions would undermine the collective good and violate the moral principles that govern human behavior in a just society."
