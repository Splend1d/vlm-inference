A cycle is a sequence of one or more distinct elements in which each element occurs exactly once, with no repetition. Therefore, not all permutations are cycles (e.g., permutations like (1,2)(3) are not cycles), but every cycle is indeed a permutation. So, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
