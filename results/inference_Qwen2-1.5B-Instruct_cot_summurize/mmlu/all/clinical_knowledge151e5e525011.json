However, as the heart relaxes between beats, the aorta and other arteries also relax, which helps to maintain blood pressure and ensure that the blood flows smoothly through the system. This process is known as arterial relaxation and is facilitated by the elasticity of the arterial walls. The elasticity of the arteries allows them to return to their original shape after they contract, which helps to maintain blood flow and prevent blood from pooling in the veins."
