Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\\[\\binom{15}{5} = \\frac{15!}{5!(15-5)!} = \\frac{15!}{5!10!}.\\]\nSimplifying the factorials, we get:\n\\[\\binom{15}{5} = \\frac{15\\times14\\times13\\times12\\times11}{5\\times4\\times3\\times2\\times1} = 3003.\\]\nSo there are 3003 different possible committees of 5 people that can be chosen from a group of 15 people.\nThe answer is: D. 3,003"
