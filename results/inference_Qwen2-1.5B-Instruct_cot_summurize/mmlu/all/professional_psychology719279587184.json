They are based on homogeneity of variance\n\nParametric statistical tests assume that the data comes from a normally distributed population with equal variances across groups (homogeneity of variance). This assumption is often violated in real-world datasets, especially when dealing with small samples or non-normally distributed data.\n\nNon-parametric tests, on the other hand, do not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data and are more robust to violations of these assumptions. However, they may not always have the same level of power as parametric tests when dealing with small samples or non-normally distributed data."
