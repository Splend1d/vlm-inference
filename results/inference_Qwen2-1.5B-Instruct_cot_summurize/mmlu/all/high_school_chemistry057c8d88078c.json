In sp2 hybridized orbitals, one electron is added to each orbital, resulting in two bonding pairs and one lone pair on the central atom.\n\nLooking at the given molecules:\n\n- CO2 has 2 valence electrons per carbon atom. The outermost shell of each carbon atom is filled with 4 electrons (1s\u00b2), leaving 6 electrons that can form either 2 bonding pairs or 1 lone pair. This configuration is typical of sp2 hybridization.\n  \n- CO32- also has 2 valence electrons per carbon atom, but since it is a coordinate covalent compound (CO3^2-) where each oxygen atom is bonded to three carbon atoms via triple bonds, it does not have any lone pairs. Thus, it would be sp2 hybridized as well.\n\n- NO2- has 2 valence electrons per nitrogen atom, with one electron added to each nitrogen orbital. Since no lone pairs are present, this is an example of sp2 hybridization.\n\n- NO3- has 2 valence electrons per nitrogen atom, and one electron added to each nitrogen orbital. However, there is only 1 electron added to each orbital, making them more like sp3 hybridized orbitals instead of sp2. \n\nTherefore, among the options provided, only CO2, CO32-, and NO2- show sp2 hybridization around the central atom. The correct answer is A. CO2 and CO32-."
