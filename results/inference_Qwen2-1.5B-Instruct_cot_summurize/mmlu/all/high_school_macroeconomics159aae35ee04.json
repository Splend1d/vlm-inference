We can do this by subtracting the base value ($200) from the current value ($400): \n\n$400 - $200 = $200\n\nThis means that the cost of the basket of goods and services has increased by $200 over the course of one period. To find the percentage increase, we divide the amount of change by the original value (in this case, $200) and multiply by 100:\n\n($200 / $200) * 100 = 100%\n\nTherefore, the consumer price index has risen 100% from the base period to the current period. This means that the new value ($400) represents a 100% increase from the old value ($200), not a 5% increase."
