This is supported by the discovery of cat bones in prehistoric sites where cows were kept, indicating that cats may have been introduced into domesticated herds at this time. Additionally, the presence of cats in ancient Egyptian tombs and burial sites indicates that they were already being kept as pets during this period. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
