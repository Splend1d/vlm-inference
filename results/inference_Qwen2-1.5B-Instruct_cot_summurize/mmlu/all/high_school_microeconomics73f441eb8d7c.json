A single firm in the industry.\n\nMonopoly occurs when there is only one seller in an industry, which means that they have complete control over the price and quantity of their product or service. This can lead to market power and pricing power, as well as other characteristics such as high prices, low competition, and strong barriers to entry. In contrast, perfect elasticity of demand (where the quantity demanded is perfectly inelastic) would mean that changes in price do not affect demand at all, while weak barriers to entry would make it difficult for new firms to enter the market and compete with existing ones."
