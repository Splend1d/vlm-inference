An auditor may need to review the issuer's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ensure that all required information about the stock options, including the number of shares granted, the exercise price, and any vesting requirements, was accurately reported. This is important because it helps to ensure that the options are being treated consistently with GAAP accounting standards and that there are no errors or omissions in the financial statements related to the stock options."
