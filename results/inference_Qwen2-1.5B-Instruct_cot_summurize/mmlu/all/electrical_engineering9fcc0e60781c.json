The atomic number represents the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, which corresponds to the number of electrons in the outermost shell of the atom. Therefore, the number of rings in the Bohr model of any element is determined by its atomic number. \n\nOption A, column number on the periodic table, refers to the position of an element in the periodic table based on its electron configuration. Option B, atomic mass, refers to the average mass of all atoms of a particular element. Option C, row number on the periodic table, refers to the position of an element in the periodic table based on its position relative to other elements with similar electronegativity."
