The demand curve for a product is not necessarily a single continuous function; it may have segments or peaks that represent different levels of willingness to pay for the same quantity of the good. Therefore, option D is incorrect. \n\nOption A is also incorrect because there can be multiple price leaders in a market, and they may lead to different price points depending on their influence over consumers.\n\nOption B is partially correct but incomplete. While it's true that the demand curve for a product does not necessarily have all the market share equally distributed among all buyers, there can still be some degree of concentration at certain price points where the demand curve intersects with supply curves. This means that there are relatively equal shares of the market at those price points.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because it implies that the price is always higher than the marginal cost of production, which is not necessarily true. In many markets, prices can be influenced by factors such as advertising, competition, and government regulations, which can result in lower prices even when marginal costs are high."
