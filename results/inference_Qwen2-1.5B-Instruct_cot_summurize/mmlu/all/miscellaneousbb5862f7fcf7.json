I respect you as a person with your own ideas and feelings. \n\nActive listening involves paying close attention to what someone else is saying without interrupting or formulating your response while they are speaking. It requires empathy and understanding, which can be difficult for young children to demonstrate fully. A good example of active listening would involve a teacher acknowledging the student's perspective, showing interest in their feelings and thoughts, and responding thoughtfully rather than immediately offering solutions or advice. This shows that the teacher values the student's opinions and takes them seriously."
