It is typically administered as a single dose injection and is highly effective in preventing infection with the virus.\nThe YF vaccine is based on a live, attenuated strain of the virus that has been genetically modified so that it cannot cause disease in humans. This modification makes the vaccine safe and effective while still providing protection against the disease.\nThe vaccine is typically given as a series of three doses over several weeks, usually starting at age 9 months or older. The first dose is typically given in two parts, with the second part being given later. After receiving the first dose, the immune system produces antibodies that will protect against future infections with the virus.\nOverall, the YF vaccine is an important tool in preventing Yellow Fever, which can be deadly if left untreated. It is recommended for anyone traveling to areas where the virus is present, including those who have close contact with infected individuals."
