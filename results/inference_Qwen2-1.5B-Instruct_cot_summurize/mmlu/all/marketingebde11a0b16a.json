This type of marketing allows businesses to reach customers who are more likely to be interested in their products or services, resulting in higher conversion rates and increased sales.\n\nWhile some people may have excess disposable income, not all potential buyers will be receptive to microtargeted ads. Additionally, not everyone falls into one of the other categories (ages, attitudes, etc.), so targeting them would not necessarily increase the effectiveness of the ad campaign. Therefore, C) sharing similar attitudes and behaviors is the most relevant option for this question."
