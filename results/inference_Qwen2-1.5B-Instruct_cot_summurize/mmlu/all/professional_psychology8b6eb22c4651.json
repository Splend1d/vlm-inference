However, it also acknowledges that therapists may need to \"emerge\" from this state in order to gain perspective and avoid becoming overly defensive or dismissive of the client's experiences. Therefore, therapists who are in the immersion-emersion stage may be most successful in working with clients from an ethnic/racial minority group if they are able to maintain this level of empathy and understanding while also learning and growing through the process of \"emerging.\""
