It also plays a role in the autonomic nervous system, controlling involuntary functions such as heart rate, digestion, and blood pressure.\n\nThe hypoglossal nerve is responsible for transmitting taste sensations from the tongue to the brain. It does not play a role in accompanying the oesophagus through the diaphragm.\n\nTherefore, the vagus nerve is the only structure mentioned in the options that can accompany the oesophagus through the diaphragm."
