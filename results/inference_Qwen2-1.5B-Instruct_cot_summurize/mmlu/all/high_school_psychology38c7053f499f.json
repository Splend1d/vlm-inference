This behavior is called imprinting and is a form of animal learning where an animal learns to associate a specific stimulus with a particular reward or benefit, typically leading to a strong emotional bond between the animal and that stimulus. In this case, the moving object (the mother) becomes the primary caregiver and source of safety and food for the goslings."
