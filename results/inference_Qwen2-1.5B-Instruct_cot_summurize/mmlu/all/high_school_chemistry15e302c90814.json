We want to find the number of half-lives required.\n\nLet's plug in the values into the formula:\n\n1.0 * 10^-6 = 10.0 * (2^(n/2)) / 1\n\nWhere n is the number of half-lives required. \n\nSolving for n gives us:\n\n(10.0 * 10^-6) = 10.0 * (2^(n/2))\n10^-5 = 2^(n/2)\n\nNow, we can solve for n using logarithms:\n\nlog(10^-5) = log(2^(n/2))\n-5 = (n/2)*log(2)\n-10 = n*ln(2)\nn = -10 / ln(2)\n\nUsing a calculator, we get:\n\nn \u2248 -10 / 0.693147\nn \u2248 13.01\n\nSince the number of half-lives must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 13.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 13."
