The key features that distinguish socio-economic accounts of US Cold War foreign policy include:\n\n  A. A focus on class and economic interests: These accounts view the US as an imperial power with a capitalist system, and argue that its foreign policy was motivated by the desire to maintain and expand this system.\n  B. An emphasis on liberal ideology: These accounts also emphasize the importance of liberal values such as democracy, human rights, and freedom of speech, which were seen as essential for maintaining stability and prosperity in the world.\n  C. A focus on language and culture: These accounts often use cultural analysis to explain US actions abroad, arguing that the US used its dominance in language and culture to promote its own interests.\n\nTherefore, all of the options listed (A, B, and C) are correct in distinguishing socio-economic accounts of US Cold War foreign policy from other approaches."
