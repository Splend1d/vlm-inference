This can lead to higher consumption spending and potentially stimulate economic growth by increasing demand for goods and services. However, this could also result in an increase in aggregate demand that exceeds the current level of production capacity, leading to inflation if supply cannot keep up with demand. Inflation may be more pronounced if households decide to spend their additional income on non-essential items rather than saving or investing. Therefore, while unemployment might fall initially due to increased consumer spending, it's possible that inflation would rise over time as the economy tries to adjust to the new levels of demand and supply."
