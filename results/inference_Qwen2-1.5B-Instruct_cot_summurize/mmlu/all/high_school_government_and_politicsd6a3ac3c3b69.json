Congress grants money to states, provided that certain criteria are met.\n\nIndividual entitlements refer to the rights or benefits granted by the government to individuals based on their status as citizens. In this context, Congress is responsible for providing funding to the states in order to support specific programs or services that benefit all citizens, regardless of their individual circumstances. The criteria for receiving these funds may vary depending on the program, but they typically involve factors such as population size, poverty rates, or other demographic characteristics. Therefore, option D is the most accurate description of individual entitlements in this context."
