The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage.\n\nThis statement is not true because in early embryonic development, the presence of yolk sacs (or yolk) can actually promote and facilitate cleavage by providing nutrients for the developing embryo. However, this effect is limited to the early stages of development when the yolk sac is still present. As the embryo grows, the yolk sac begins to degenerate and disappear, which can disrupt cleavage processes."
