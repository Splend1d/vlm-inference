As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?\n\nA. He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\nB. He intended only to wound the friend.\nC. He was unaware of the elements of malice.\nD. The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. He intended to kill the friend and not the daughter.\n\nThis is because the defendant's intent to kill his friend rather than his daughter is key to establishing the crime of first-degree murder. If he had intended to kill his daughter instead, then it would not have been murder but rather manslaughter or even attempted murder. Additionally, the fact that the bullet missed the friend does not absolve the defendant of the charge since it still constitutes an unlawful and intentional killing of a human being."
