Therefore, we can set up the equation for the hydrogen ion concentration as follows:\n\n\\[pH = -\\log[H^+] = -\\log(1) = 0\\]\n\nThis means that there are no hydrogen ions present, which implies that the solution is completely neutralized by the base, and therefore its pH is 7.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the pH of a solution made by dissolving 0.0300 mol of sodium ethanoate in enough water to make 50 mL of solution. To find the pH of this solution, we would need to use the specific molarity of sodium ethanoate to determine the hydrogen ion concentration (\\(H^+\\)), and then apply the above formula to find the pH.\n\nTo do this, we first convert the given volume of sodium ethanoate to moles:\n\\[0.050 \\text{ L} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{1000 \\text{ mL}} \\times \\frac{0.0300 \\text{ mol Na_2CO_3}}{1 \\text{ mol Na_2CO_3}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ mol Na_2CO_3}\\]\n\nNext, we use the solubility product constant for sodium ethanoate (\\(K_{sp}\\)) to find the number of moles of sodium ethanoate that dissociates into hydrogen ions:\n\\[[Na^+][OH^-] = K_{sp} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-5}\\]\n\\[1.8 \\times 10^{-5} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}[Na^+][OH^-]\\]\n\\[1.8 \\times 10^{-5} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}[Na^+][5.7 \\times 10^{-5}]\\]\n\\[Na^+ = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the hydrogen ion concentration (\\(H^+\\)):\n\\[H^+ = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-5}}{3.0 \\times 10^{-5}} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\]\n\nFinally, we can calculate the pH:\n\\[pH = -\\log[H^+] = -\\log(6.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 4.74\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 4.74."
