Doing so helps them avoid punishment.\n\nDuring the second stage of Kohlberg's preconventional level of moral development, children often obey rules because they fear negative consequences such as getting in trouble or being punished. This is known as the \"do not do X because Y\" approach to morality. Children may also believe that following rules is a way to gain approval from others or to be rewarded in some way. However, these reasons for following rules are not based on personal duty or need, but rather on avoiding negative outcomes. Therefore, option A (feeling a personal duty) is incorrect, option B (everyone else is doing it) is partially correct but does not fully explain the reason for following rules during this stage, and option D (satisfying personal needs) is not relevant to the explanation given in the question."
