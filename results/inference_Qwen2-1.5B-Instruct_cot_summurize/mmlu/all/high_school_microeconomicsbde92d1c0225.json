Increasing total utility at an increasing rate as consumption rises.\n\nThe demand curve describes the relationship between the quantity demanded and the price of a good or service. It shows how much of the good people are willing to buy at different prices, assuming they have income to spend on it. \n\nAs the price increases, consumers will only be willing to pay more for a unit of the good if the marginal utility (the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit) exceeds the price. This leads to a downward-sloping demand curve, with the quantity demanded falling as the price rises.\n\nOn the other hand, when the price falls, consumers will be willing to pay less for each unit of the good if the marginal utility still exceeds the price. This results in an upward-sloping demand curve, with the quantity demanded rising as the price decreases. \n\nSo, option D correctly describes the theory behind the demand curve, which states that the quantity demanded will increase at an increasing rate as the price rises."
