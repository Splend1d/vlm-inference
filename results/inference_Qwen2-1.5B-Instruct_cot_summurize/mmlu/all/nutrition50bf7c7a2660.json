However, it's important to note that individual outcomes may vary and there is no specific percentage reduction mentioned in your question. \n\nIn general, studies have shown that bariatric surgery leads to a 30%-60% reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes over time (1). Therefore, option C) approximately 50% seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide more personalized advice based on an individual's medical history and potential risks associated with bariatric surgery."
