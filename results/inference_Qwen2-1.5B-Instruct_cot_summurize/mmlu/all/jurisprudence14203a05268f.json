The law dictates what moral values should affect our ethical behavior.\n\nIn this argument, Dworkin argues that the law is not just an instrument for enforcing moral rules but also has the power to shape and guide people's moral beliefs and behaviors. He suggests that when the law is applied consistently and fairly, it can help to establish or reinforce certain moral principles and values, even if those principles and values themselves may be controversial or difficult to define. Therefore, while the law does not dictate moral values directly, it can have a significant impact on how individuals understand and apply these values in their daily lives."
