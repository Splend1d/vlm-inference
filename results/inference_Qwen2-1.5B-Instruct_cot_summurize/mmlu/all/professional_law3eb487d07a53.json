He was speeding down a center city street, veering from lane to lane, when he lost control of his car while going over a slick puddle of water. Without realizing it, he drove his car onto the sidewalk and killed two persons. What common law crime most appropriately fits the man's situation?\n\nA. Felony murder in that he killed someone while committing the felony of driving under the influence.\nB. Voluntary manslaughter because it was an intentional killing done while acting recklessly or impulsively.\nC. Involuntary manslaughter in that it was a killing committed while engaging in reckless activity but without the intent to kill.\nD. First degree murder because the act of driving under the influence is legally presumed to involve premeditation and specific intent.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Involuntary manslaughter in that it was a killing committed while engaging in reckless activity but without the intent to kill.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter occurs when a person acts recklessly or impulsively with the intent not to cause death or serious harm, but nevertheless causes death or serious harm as a result of their actions. This can occur in situations where someone drives under the influence of alcohol or drugs, causing them to lose control of their vehicle and hit another person or object, resulting in death or injury.\n\nFelony murder does not apply because the man did not intentionally kill anyone during the incident. Voluntary manslaughter also does not apply because the man did not have the intent to kill. First-degree murder is only applicable if the man had the specific intent to kill someone, which he did not. Therefore, the appropriate common law crime for this scenario is involuntary manslaughter."
