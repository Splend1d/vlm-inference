Therefore, these investments are classified as available-for-sale securities, which means they are reported in the balance sheet under current assets rather than on the income statement. This classification changes the nature of the transaction from an asset acquisition to an equity investment, but does not affect the cash flow statement.\n\nSimilarly, when Verity Co. purchased $50,000 of U.S. Treasury bills, these are considered cash equivalents and therefore are also classified as current assets in the balance sheet. They do not change the nature of the transaction from an asset acquisition to an equity investment.\n\nTherefore, when Verity Co. reports its cash flow statement, it will show no net cash use related to these transactions because all the money was invested in assets (bonds and Treasury bills) and has been recognized in the balance sheet under current assets. The only difference would be that the total assets increased by the purchase price ($200,000 + $50,000 = $250,000), but this increase is not reflected in the cash flow statement since it is already accounted for in the balance sheet under current assets."
