Let's denote the population mean as \u03bc (which is given as 4 ounces) and the population standard deviation as \u03c3 (which is given as 0.25 ounces).\n\nThe formula for the sampling distribution of the sample mean (Z-score) when n is large enough (at least 30) is:\n\nZ = (X\u0304 - \u03bc) / (\u03c3 / \u221an)\n\nWhere X\u0304 is the sample mean, \u03bc is the population mean, \u03c3 is the population standard deviation, and n is the sample size.\n\nFor our sample, X\u0304 = 4, \u03bc = 4, \u03c3 = 0.25, and n = 40.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives us:\n\nZ = (4 - 4) / (0.25 / \u221a40)\nZ = 0 / (0.25 / 6.9289797436 * 6.9289797436)\nZ = 0 / 0.154159947\nZ \u2248 0\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the normal curve between Z = 0 and Z = 3.9 (since we're interested in how many samples fall below 3.9 ounces). This corresponds to finding the area under the curve from z=0 to z=3.9.\n\nUsing a table or calculator, we can look up the area between z=0 and z=3.9 on the standard normal distribution curve. \n\nThe cumulative area under the curve from z=0 to z=3.9 is approximately 0.0225.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 0.0225."
