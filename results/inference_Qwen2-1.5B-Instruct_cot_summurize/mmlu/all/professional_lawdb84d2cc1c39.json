The law was passed in order to curtail the increasing number of co-ed pregnancies on college campuses. Two students at a state university are engaged to be married and wish to share a dormitory room together. Citing the law, university housing officials refuse to allow them to live together in a campus dormitory facility. The students bring an appropriate action to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Which of the following correctly states the applicable burden of persuasion?\n\nA. Since the law deals with the fundamental right of privacy, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.\nB. Since the law deals with the freedom of association, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.\nC. Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest.\nD. Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve gender discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\n"

Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve gender discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.\n\nThe state's law requires separation of male and female students in dormitories, which is designed to address concerns about co-educational pregnancies on college campuses. However, this law does not directly impact any fundamental rights, such as the right to marry or the right to privacy, nor does it discriminate based on gender. Therefore, the state must demonstrate that there is a rational connection between the law's purpose (curbing co-ed pregnancies) and its means (requiring males and females to live separately).\n\nIn contrast, if the law were aimed at addressing issues like sexual harassment or discrimination against one sex, then the state would need to show that the law furthers a compelling state interest beyond just the goal of preventing co-ed pregnancies. For example, a law could require all dorms to be segregated by sex if doing so helps prevent sexual assault or harassment among the genders."
