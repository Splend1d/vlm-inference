Action and movement\n\nGesture drawing, also known as gestural or spontaneous drawing, involves using motion and action to create an image rather than relying on precise lines and shapes. The artist draws with their hands, fingers, or body, often moving in a fluid manner that mimics the movement of objects or figures being drawn. This technique allows for greater freedom of expression and spontaneity in the creation of art."
