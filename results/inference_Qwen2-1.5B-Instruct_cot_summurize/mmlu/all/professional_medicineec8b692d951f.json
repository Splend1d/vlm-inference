He has no history of similar symptoms. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. He is alert. His pulse is 80/min and irregular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 170/90 mm Hg. He follows commands but has nonfluent aphasia. There is moderate weakness and decreased sensation of the right upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Babinski sign is present on the right. His serum glucose concentration is 162 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. Carotid duplex ultrasonography\nB. CT scan of the head\nC. EEG\nD. Lumbar puncture\n"

EEG\n\nAn EEG (Electroencephalogram) can help diagnose disorders affecting brain function, including strokes, seizures, and neurological conditions like epilepsy or Parkinson's disease. The patient's symptoms suggest a potential neurological disorder, which an EEG can help confirm or rule out. \n\nThe other options listed do not seem relevant based on the information provided: carotid duplex ultrasonography, CT scan of the head, and lumbar puncture. These tests might be useful if the initial assessment does not provide enough evidence for the specific diagnosis, but they do not specifically address the given symptoms. An EEG seems the best course of action considering the clinical presentation and available diagnostic tools."
