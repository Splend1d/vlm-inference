The American Atheism Association (AAA) has put together a broadcast segment about atheism, rejecting all religions, but four of the five Texarkana stations have declined to air the segment because they believe it would violate the statute. AAA has filed suit against the state, challenging the constitutionality of the statute. What is the strongest argument AAA can make in support of striking down the Equal Rights for All Religions statute?\n\nA. The First Amendment prohibits government interference with freedom of the press.\nB. The fact that the statute involves only broadcast media and not print media is an Equal Protection violation.\nC. The First Amendment prohibits government interference with the free exercise of religion.\nD. The statute is not narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest.\n"

The statute is not narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest.\n\nThe Equal Rights for All Religions statute aims to ensure equal airtime for religious viewpoints by limiting the amount of time Christian segments receive over other religions. However, this approach may be insufficient if there are not enough religious perspectives available or if certain groups feel their views are unfairly marginalized. Therefore, the statute could potentially be challenged as being overly broad and not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest."
