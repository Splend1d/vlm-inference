                    "text": " Let's denote the original number of pins in each pile as $x$. According to the problem, John divided these piles into two equal parts and then gave half of one third of one pile to his brother. This means he gave away $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{x}{6}$ pins.\n\nAfter giving away this amount, John was left with 66 pins. So we can write the equation: $x - \\frac{x}{6} = 66$.\n\nTo simplify the equation, we can multiply every term by 6 to get rid of the fraction: $6x - x = 66 \\times 6$, which simplifies to $5x = 396$.\n\nFinally, to solve for $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by 5: $x = \\frac{396}{5} = 79.2$.\n\nHowever, the number of pins must be a whole number, so there must have been an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nUpon revisiting the problem, we realize that when we wrote down the equation $6x - x = 66 \\times 6$, we made a mistake. When we subtracted $x$ from $6x$, we should not have gotten $5x$. Instead, we should have multiplied $x$ by 5 to get $5x$.\n\nLet's correct this and try again:\n\nFrom the problem, we know that John gave away $\\frac{x}{6}$ pins, leaving him with 66 pins.
