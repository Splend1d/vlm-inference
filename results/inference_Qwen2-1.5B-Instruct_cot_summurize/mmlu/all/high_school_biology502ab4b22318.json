One major difference is that RNA viruses lack the enzyme DNA polymerase, which is responsible for synthesizing new strands of DNA during replication. Instead, they rely on reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that can synthesize RNA from a template strand of DNA or RNA.\n\nReverse transcriptase has no proofreading function, meaning it cannot correct errors in the synthesized RNA molecule before using it as a template for further replication. This can result in mutations in the RNA viral genome, making it more susceptible to genetic drift and evolution over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication."
