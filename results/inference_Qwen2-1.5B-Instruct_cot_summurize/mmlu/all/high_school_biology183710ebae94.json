The dead zones result from the rapid growth of photosynthetic phytoplankton (algal blooms) and their subsequent decay by oxygen-depleting microbes in the water column. Which of the following factors most likely triggers the algal blooms and the associated dead zones?\n\nA. A decrease in the light level in surface waters as day length starts to shorten after the summer solstice\nB. Increased predation by marine larvae and other zooplankton during the summer months\nC. A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus\nD. Decreased competition from other marine phytoplankton during the summer months\n"

                    "text": "The answer is C: A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients stimulate the growth of algae, leading to an increase in phytoplankton populations. As the algae grow, they produce more oxygen through photosynthesis, which can lead to hypoxia or \"dead zones\" where oxygen levels are too low for marine life to survive. This process is known as eutrophication. Therefore, it is the nutrient inputs that trigger the algal blooms and associated dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico."
