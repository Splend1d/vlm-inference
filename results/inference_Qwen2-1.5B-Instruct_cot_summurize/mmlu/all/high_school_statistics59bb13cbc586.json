A higher standard deviation means that the data points are more spread out and have a wider range.\n\nIn this case, Mr. Bee's class had a standard deviation of 11.2, which is lower than Mr. Em's class with a standard deviation of 5.6. This suggests that Mr. Bee's class has fewer students who scored above or below their respective means, indicating less heterogeneity in their performance compared to Mr. Em's class.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Mr. Bee's class is less heterogeneous than Mr. Em's."
