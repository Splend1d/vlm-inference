Assign numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 to successfully selling a policy to a customer and numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 to failing to sell a policy to a customer.\n\nThis scheme allows for an accurate representation of the probability distribution of successful sales outcomes, as well as the failure rates of each potential customer. By using this method, the insurance agent can simulate the scenario of contacting different numbers of customers and see how many contacts it takes on average to achieve a certain level of success (in this case, selling at least one policy).\n\nOption A assigns numbers that may not accurately reflect the probabilities of successful or unsuccessful sales. Option B assigns numbers that may be too simple and not reflective enough of the actual sales process. Option C does not assign any numbers at all, which would make it impossible to simulate the situation. Option D provides a more realistic and effective way to simulate the sales process."
