Sleep apnea\n\nSleep apnea is a condition in which an individual's breathing becomes irregular or stops briefly during sleep, causing them to wake up multiple times per hour. This can be caused by a blockage in the airway, such as a collapsed lung or tonsil, and can lead to symptoms such as snoring, daytime fatigue, and impaired cognition.\n\nObesity can increase the risk of developing sleep apnea because it can cause the airway to become narrower and less flexible, making it harder for air to flow through. Additionally, obesity can lead to weight gain, which can further exacerbate the condition by putting additional pressure on the airway.\n\nTherefore, if an obese individual has a breathing-related sleep disorder, they are most likely suffering from sleep apnea."
