Exclusive breastfeeding: All infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life.\n2. Introduction of solids: Solid foods should be introduced to infants between four and six months of age, starting with purees or mashed fruits and vegetables, followed by bread, cereal, and eventually solid meats and vegetables.\n3. Use of cow's milk: Cow's milk is not recommended for use after six months of age because it can lead to allergic reactions in some infants.\n4. Bottle feeding: While bottle-feeding may be used when formula is necessary, it is generally not recommended as an alternative to breastfeeding.\n\nIt is important to note that these recommendations are based on evidence-based research and guidelines developed by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). It is always best to consult with a healthcare provider before making any changes to your child's diet or feeding practices."
