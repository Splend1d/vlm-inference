The United States became a creditor country and financial center, with European war spending boosting the US economy.\n\nDuring World War I, the United States entered into the war as an ally of Britain and France, which was seen as a threat by Germany. As a result, the United States was heavily involved in the war effort, providing troops, equipment, and resources to both sides. This increased American involvement in the global economy and helped to boost the US economy during this time period.\n\nIn addition, the war also had a significant impact on the balance of power in Europe. The loss of European colonies and territories due to the war led to a decline in European influence over global affairs. The United States emerged as a major player in international affairs and helped to shape the post-war world order.\n\nOverall, World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States by increasing American involvement in the global economy and helping to establish the US as a dominant force in international politics."
