A state law was subsequently passed requiring the city to prepare a general plan governing both land use and open-space development. The city's plan, with new density requirements, effectively limited development of the five-acre lot to a total of one to five single family residences. The partnership sued the city, asking for a declaratory judgment that the city had taken its property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The partnership lost at the local and appellate levels. The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case \u0080\u0094 what did it decide?\n\nA. This was illegal spot zoning that was unconstitutional.\nB. This was an unlawful taking without prior notice and therefore unconstitutional.\nC. The ordinance allows for up to five residences and therefore it is constitutional.\nD. The law was a violation of the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n"

The ordinance allows for up to five residences and therefore it is constitutional.\n\nIn this scenario, the partnership bought five acres of land with the expectation that they would develop it into a mixed-use community with single-family homes. However, the city's new general plan imposed stricter density restrictions on the development, limiting the number of single-family homes to no more than five. \n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, when the government takes private property for public use, it must provide just compensation. In this case, the city has not provided just compensation because the new density requirements limit the number of homes allowed on the property, which would have been part of the original purchase agreement. Therefore, the court ruled that the city's action was unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.\n\nHowever, the city argues that the new density regulations do not violate the Fifth Amendment because the partnership still owns the land. They claim that the partnership can negotiate with the city to reduce the number of homes allowed on the property if they want to maintain their investment. This argument is based on the idea that the partnership can renegotiate the terms of their contract after the fact, but the Supreme Court rejected this argument as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The ordinance allows for up to five residences and therefore it is constitutional."
