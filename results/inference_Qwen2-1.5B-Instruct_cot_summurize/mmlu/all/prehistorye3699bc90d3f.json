It can provide information about the environment in which the artifacts were created, such as the soil type, water sources, and other natural resources available at the time. This information can help archaeologists understand the cultural practices and social interactions that took place during the time period when the artifacts were produced. Trace element analysis can also be used to identify the source of raw materials used in the production of artifacts, such as metals or ceramics. However, it cannot directly determine the morphology or age of an artifact or ecofact, nor can it reveal the wear patterns on tools."
