It can not be applied to non-differentiable functions: The grid search method requires that the function being optimized has a differentiable derivative. If the function is non-differentiable, it cannot be optimized using the grid search method.\n\n2. B. It can not be applied to non-continuous functions: Similarly, if the function being optimized is discontinuous, the grid search method may fail as well.\n\n3. C. It is hard to implement: Implementing the grid search method can be difficult and time-consuming, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex models.\n\n4. D. It runs reasonably slow for multiple linear regression: In cases where the number of features is high, the grid search method may take longer to run compared to other methods like random search or Bayesian optimization. However, this issue is more pronounced in cases where the model being optimized is a linear regression model rather than a non-linear one."
