Bias increase; Variance decrease.\n\nWhen adding $\\ell_2$ regularization to a linear regression model, the goal is to prevent the model from fitting too closely to the training data by introducing a penalty term that encourages smaller weight values. This can be represented mathematically as:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( w_i - b \\right)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^d w_j^2 $$\n\nwhere $w_i$ represents the weight for feature $i$, $b$ is the bias term, $n$ is the number of samples, $d$ is the number of features (or dimensions), and $\\lambda$ is the regularization parameter.\n\nAs $\\lambda$ increases, the regularization term becomes more important, which means the contribution of each feature to the loss function decreases. This results in a reduction in the magnitude of the coefficients $w_i$ and an increase in the variance of the model, because fewer features are being used to make predictions. However, this also leads to an increase in the bias of the model, as the overall effect on the loss function is not negated by the regularization."
