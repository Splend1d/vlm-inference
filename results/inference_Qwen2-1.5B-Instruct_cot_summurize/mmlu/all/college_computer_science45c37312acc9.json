This is because if we consider any path in the graph, it will have an odd number of edges (since there are no self-loops). Therefore, the sum of the degrees of the endpoints of this path plus the degree of the central node in the path is even. Since every edge connects two nodes, the total number of edges in the graph is also even, making the sum of the degrees even. Thus, I must be true.\n\nII. The number of edges in a connected, undirected graph is greater than or equal to the number of vertices minus one. This follows from the fact that every edge connects two distinct vertices, so the maximum number of edges possible in a complete graph (where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge) is one less than the number of vertices. However, since our graph is not complete, we can add additional edges without violating this condition. Therefore, II must be true.\n\nIII. A connected, undirected graph cannot have more than one vertex with degree 1. This is because a graph with multiple vertices of degree 1 would be disconnected, contradicting the assumption that the graph is connected. Thus, III must be false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answers are I and II."
