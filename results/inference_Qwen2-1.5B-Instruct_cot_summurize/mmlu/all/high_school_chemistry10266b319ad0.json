The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 37 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample lost more heat energy than the water gained because the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did.\nB. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperatures; therefore the equilibrium constant must be less than 1.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the heat capacity of the sample must be greater than the heat capacity of the water.\nD. Even though the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained to obey the law of conservation of energy.\n"

In this case, the initial condition for the system consists of a 25 g sample at 95\u00b0C and 100 g of water at 26\u00b0C. The final condition consists of the combined system at 37\u00b0C. Therefore, the total energy before the changes (heat exchanged between the two systems) must equal the total energy after the changes.\n\nSince the sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, it means that the sample absorbed more heat energy than the water released. However, since both systems had the same mass, the amount of heat energy they exchanged must have been equal. Therefore, the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained to obey the law of conservation of energy."
