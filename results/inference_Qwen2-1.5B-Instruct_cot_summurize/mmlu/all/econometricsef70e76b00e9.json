The test statistic for the Dickey-Fuller test is obtained by calculating the difference between the observed autocorrelation function and the theoretical autoregressive model.\n\nIn general, the Dickey-Fuller test statistic is more negative (i.e., bigger in absolute value) for larger sample sizes. This is because as the sample size increases, the test statistic becomes more sensitive to changes in the autocorrelation structure of the data.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. More negative (i.e., bigger in absolute value) for a 10% size of test than a 5% test."
