Type I muscle fibers are also known as type 1 or white muscle fibers and they are primarily responsible for endurance activities such as running, cycling, and swimming. These muscles are characterized by their high levels of oxidative metabolism and slow contraction speed. They contain more mitochondria than other muscle types, which allows them to generate large amounts of energy during prolonged exercise."
