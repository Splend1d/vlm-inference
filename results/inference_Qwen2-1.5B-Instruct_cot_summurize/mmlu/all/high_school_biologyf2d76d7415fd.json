Chemiosmosis is the process by which electrons are transferred from protons to oxygen molecules, which ultimately leads to ATP production. This process occurs primarily in mitochondria, but also indirectly through the electron transport chain in chloroplasts. The nucleus plays a role in regulating gene expression that is essential for the overall functioning of cells, but it does not directly participate in chemiosmosis."
