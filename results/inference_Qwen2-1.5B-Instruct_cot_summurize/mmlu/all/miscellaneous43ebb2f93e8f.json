The value proposition refers to the unique benefits, features, and advantages that differentiate one product from another. A strong value proposition can help a company stand out in a crowded marketplace and attract customers who are willing to pay more for the perceived superior quality or experience. In contrast, poorly differentiated products may not have a clear value proposition and may struggle to compete on price alone."
