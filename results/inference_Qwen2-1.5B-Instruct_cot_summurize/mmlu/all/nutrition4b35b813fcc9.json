In nitrogen equilibrium, the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is equal to the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.\n\nNitrogen balance refers to the comparison between the amount of nitrogen in the body and the amount of nitrogen lost through urine or other ways. In an equilibrium state, the body has enough nitrogen to replace what it uses, so the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites (such as urea) is equal to the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds. This means that neither nitrogenous metabolites nor proteins are being lost from the body."
