It can also refer to countries that are perceived as being hostile towards the United States or its allies.\n\nSo the answer would be A. States aligned with the USSR during the Cold War. This is because the Soviet Union was a major player in world politics during the Cold War and many of its satellites (countries such as Cuba, Vietnam, and Afghanistan) were seen as rogue states due to their alignment with the Soviet Union and their involvement in various conflicts."
