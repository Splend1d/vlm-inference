This fear is often associated with concerns about international relations and the potential for other countries to use cooperation against one's own interests, rather than being genuinely committed to collaboration. However, it is not necessarily a valid reason for governments to remain non-aligned or hesitant to fully embrace liberal principles and practices. Other reasons such as the dominance of Western ideologies, the enforcement of certain values that are not shared by all political regimes, and the threat of state security could also be valid reasons for reluctance to fully join the liberalist camp."
