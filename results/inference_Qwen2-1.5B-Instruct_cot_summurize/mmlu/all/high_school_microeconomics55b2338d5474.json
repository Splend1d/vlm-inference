However, as a monopoly approaches perfect competition, it will eventually enter into a long-run equilibrium with many other firms selling at the market price. At this point, any short-run profit made by the monopolist will disappear as new firms enter the market and compete on price, leading to zero or negative profits for the monopolist over the long run. This is known as the \"law of one price\" in economics."
