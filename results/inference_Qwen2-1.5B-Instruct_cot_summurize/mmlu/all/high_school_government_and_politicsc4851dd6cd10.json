Separation of powers\n\nIf the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were to issue, enforce, and adjudicate all disputes regarding a new regulation, it would violate the principle of separation of powers because this action would involve multiple branches of government in making decisions that affect environmental regulations. The EPA is an executive branch agency, while Congress and the courts are legislative and judicial branches respectively. If the EPA had unchecked authority over these matters, it could potentially become too powerful and infringe upon the autonomy of other branches of government. This could lead to violations of due process rights and the rule of law, as well as conflicts with state and local laws. Therefore, the proper balance between the three branches of government must be maintained for the stability and effectiveness of our democracy."
