The pH scale ranges from 0 (extremely acidic) to 14 (extremely basic), with 7 being neutral. The pH values given for Lake A and Lake B indicate that they have high levels of acidity compared to their respective pH scales, indicating that they are highly acidic. \n\nThe pH of a solution increases as the hydrogen ion concentration decreases, which means that a higher pH indicates a lower concentration of hydrogen ions. Since Lake B has a lower pH than Lake A, it must be more acidic than Lake A, making it an alkaline lake relative to its own pH level. \n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer."
