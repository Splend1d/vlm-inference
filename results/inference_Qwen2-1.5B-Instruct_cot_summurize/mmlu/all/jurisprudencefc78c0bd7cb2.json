It is represented by the positivist view of law as developed by HLA Hart.\n\nPositivism is a branch of jurisprudence that emphasizes the objective, empirical study of law as it exists in society and its relationship to other social institutions. This approach contrasts with interpretivism, which focuses on the meaning of legal texts and their interpretation within a particular context. The positivist view holds that law is essentially a set of rules that exist independently of human will or intention, and that courts should apply these rules to resolve disputes. According to this perspective, the validity of a law is determined solely by its content and the consequences it has for society, rather than by any underlying moral or political principles."
