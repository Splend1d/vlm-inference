A concave production possibility frontier.\n\nThe law of increasing costs suggests that the marginal cost (MC) increases as output increases, which means that the slope of the production function becomes steeper and more negative, resulting in a concave shape for the production possibility frontier. This is because the total cost of producing additional units of output increases with each unit produced, so the opportunity cost of producing one more unit also increases. As a result, the opportunity cost of producing an extra unit of output starts to outweigh its own cost, leading to a decrease in the quantity of output that can be produced at each level of input."
