Therefore, running a deficit can help stimulate economic activity by increasing government spending on infrastructure, education, healthcare, etc., thereby creating jobs and boosting consumer confidence. This can in turn lead to an increase in tax revenues as more people start working again and earn higher wages. Additionally, a deficit can help stabilize the value of the currency if the government uses it to fund large-scale public works projects or other initiatives that boost the economy. However, it's important to note that running a deficit should be done carefully and only when necessary, as excessive deficits can lead to high levels of debt and reduce future borrowing capacity."
