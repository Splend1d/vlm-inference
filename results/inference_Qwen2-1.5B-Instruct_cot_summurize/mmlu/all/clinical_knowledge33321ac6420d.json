                    "text": "The correct answer is D. An ulnar nerve palsy is an example of a lower motor neuron lesion. A lower motor neuron lesion typically affects the neurons that control voluntary muscles, such as those in the arms and legs. This can result in decreased muscle strength, weakness, and atrophy. The symptoms of a lower motor neuron lesion may include:\n\n  * Decreased muscle tone or hypertonia (muscle stiffness)\n  * Weakness or paralysis of affected muscles\n  * Muscle wasting (atrophy) and loss of sensation (paresthesia)\n  * Sensory changes, such as numbness or tingling\n\nIt's important to note that not all lower motor neuron lesions lead to fasciculations (fasciculation is a group of involuntary movements that occur in response to sensory input). Some patients with a lower motor neuron lesion may have normal or even enhanced reflexes.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth mentioning that other factors can contribute to the development of fasciculations, including certain medications, nerve damage, and underlying medical conditions. Therefore, while fasciculations may be less common in a lower motor neuron lesion compared to other types of motor neuron disease, they can still occur in this condition."
