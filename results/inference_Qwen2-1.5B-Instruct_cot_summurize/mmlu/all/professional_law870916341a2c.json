The security guard, having already graduated from a program in his former state, wishes to work again as a private security guard. He began to advertise his services but was informed by the state that he must cease and desist from working as a private security guard until he complied with state law and graduated from an in-state program. The security guard challenges the constitutionality of the licensing statute on grounds that it violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA. The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the state does not have a compelling state interest in enacting such legislation.\nB. The security guard has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security violates his rights of due process.\nC.

The state has the burden of persuasion to show that the denial of a license to work in private security does not violate the petitioner's rights of due process.\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals against being deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. This means that any law or action taken by the government must be fair and reasonable, and cannot be arbitrary or capricious. In this case, the state requires security guards who want to practice private security to complete a program within the state, which could potentially limit their ability to provide services to clients if they do not comply.\n\nThe security guard bears the burden of persuasion in challenging the constitutionality of the licensing statute. They must show that there is no legitimate state interest behind the requirement for graduation from an in-state program, and that the statute fails to serve that interest. If the state can demonstrate a compelling state interest in regulating private security, then it may be able to justify the licensing requirement.\n\nTherefore, the state must bear the burden of proving that the denial of a license to work in private security does not violate the petitioner's rights of due process."
