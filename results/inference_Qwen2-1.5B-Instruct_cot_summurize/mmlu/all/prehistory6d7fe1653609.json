They instead built large earthen mounds called \"pit houses\" and constructed irrigation systems to cultivate crops such as corn, beans, and squash. The Hohokam also had a complex social hierarchy and developed advanced agricultural techniques for growing various crops.\n\nAs for the steppyramids, these structures are associated with the Olmec civilization in Mexico, not with the Hohokam. The Olmecs were a pre-Columbian civilization that flourished in Central America around 1300 BCE-400 CE."
