If both parents have 4 chromosomes, then the total number of offspring will be 8^2 = 64.\nIn this case, the offspring will have 2 copies of each chromosome pair, so they will have 4x2=8 chromosomes in total. Therefore, the number of offspring will be 8^2=64.\nTo find the frequency of AABBCC individuals, we need to divide the number of offspring by the total number of possible combinations of parents, which is 2^4 = 16.\nTherefore, the frequency of AABBCC individuals is 64/16 = 1.0/64.\nThe correct answer is A. 1.0/64."
