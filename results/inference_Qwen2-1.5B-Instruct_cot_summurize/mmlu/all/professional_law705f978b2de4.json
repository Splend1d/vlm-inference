Voluntary manslaughter occurs when a person intentionally causes the death of another person while committing an unlawful act that is inherently dangerous to such other person's life. Involuntary manslaughter occurs when a person unintentionally causes the death of another person due to recklessness or negligence.\n\nIn this case, the police officer used his service revolver to shoot at the pavement, which he intended to scare the man. However, one of the bullets ricocheted off the sidewalk and struck the man, causing his death. This is considered murder because the police officer acted intentionally and recklessly by firing the gun without aiming at the man, resulting in his death. Therefore, the correct answer is D. murder."
