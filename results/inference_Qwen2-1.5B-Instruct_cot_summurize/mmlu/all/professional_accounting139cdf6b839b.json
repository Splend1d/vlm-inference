Accountants typically do not make inquiries of management as part of their review of financial statements for a nonissuer. Instead, they focus on analyzing financial data, comparing it with prior periods, and assessing the overall financial health of the entity. Making inquiries of management may be more relevant if the entity is a public company subject to SEC reporting requirements."
