This suggests that the Maya had their own distinct cultural and artistic traditions, which allowed them to create complex and elaborate structures that have stood the test of time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. It confirms that the Olmec, who built most of the Maya monuments, were not the sole inspiration for the development of monumental architecture among the Maya."
