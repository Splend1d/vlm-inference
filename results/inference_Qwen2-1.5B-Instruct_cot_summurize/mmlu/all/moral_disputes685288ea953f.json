However, this argument overlooks the fact that all humans, including embryos, are capable of experiencing pain, suffering, and other forms of emotional distress.\n\nFurthermore, the idea that embryos lack the ability to exercise higher mental capacities is contradicted by the evidence from neuroscience and developmental psychology. For example, studies have shown that embryos can experience various types of pain, such as discomfort during implantation or when being moved, and that they can exhibit signs of distress, such as crying or wriggling.\n\nIn addition, research has also demonstrated that embryos can learn and adapt to their environment through mechanisms such as reflexes and motor learning. This suggests that embryos are capable of developing certain forms of intelligence and problem-solving skills.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. To have killed an embryo that developed into you would have been the same thing as killing you. This statement acknowledges the reality of the existence of embryos and their capacity for development and evolution."
