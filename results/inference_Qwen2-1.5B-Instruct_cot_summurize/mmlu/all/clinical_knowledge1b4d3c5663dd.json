One in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care.\n\nInformal caregivers, also known as unpaid family members or volunteers, play an essential role in supporting older adults who require assistance with daily activities, such as bathing, dressing, and medication management. According to the National Institute on Aging, one in six individuals aged 65 years and older provides some form of informal caregiving (e.g., helping with daily living activities) in the United States. This statistic highlights the importance of understanding and addressing the needs of informal caregivers in healthcare settings."
