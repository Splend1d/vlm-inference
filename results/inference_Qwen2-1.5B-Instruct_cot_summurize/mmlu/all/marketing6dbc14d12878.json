Product lifecycle.\n\nIn general, product lifecycle refers to the process by which a new product or service goes from being invented or developed to being discarded or replaced. This can include stages such as conception, design, testing, manufacturing, distribution, and disposal. The product lifecycle can be divided into different stages based on their time duration, including introduction, growth, maturity, decline, and recovery.\n\nIt's worth noting that this model doesn't necessarily apply to all types of products or services, but it provides a useful framework for understanding how businesses and organizations develop and manage their offerings over time."
