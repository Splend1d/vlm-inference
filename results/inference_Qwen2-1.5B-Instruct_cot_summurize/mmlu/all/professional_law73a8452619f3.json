The leasehold agreement between property owner and shopkeeper provided that the latter was not permitted \"to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an \u0080\u0098A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. \" One month later, the shopkeeper leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The shopkeeper-corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the shopkeeper. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide \"by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper. \"One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a non-profit organization for the balance of the term of the corporation \u0080\u0094shopkeeper lease. The non-profit organization took possession of the said premises the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation \u0080\u0094nonprofit leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Neither privily of estate nor privily of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.\n\nIn this scenario, there are three legal relationships between the various parties: privity of estate, privity of contract, and privity of lease.\n\n1. Privity of Estate: This refers to the mutual rights and duties between two parties who share common ownership or control over real property. In this case, the property owner owns the building, while the shopkeeper leases it to the corporation. Therefore, there is no privity of estate between the property owner and the corporation because they do not share any common ownership or control over the property.\n\n2. Privity of Contract: This refers to the mutual rights and duties between two parties who enter into a contract with each other. In this case, the shopkeeper and the corporation entered into a contract for the lease of the building, which includes the stipulation that the corporation must have an A credit rating. Since the corporation does not have the required credit rating, there is no privity of contract between the shopkeeper and the corporation.\n\n3. Privity of Lease: This refers to the mutual rights and duties between two parties who lease a property together. In this case, the shopkeeper and the corporation entered into a lease agreement for the use of the building, which includes the stipulation that the corporation must have an A credit rating. Since the corporation does not have the required credit rating, there is no privity of lease between the shopkeeper and the corporation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Neither privily of estate nor privily of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization."
