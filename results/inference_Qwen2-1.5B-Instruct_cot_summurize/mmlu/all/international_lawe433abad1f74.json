An internationally wrongful conduct consists of an action or omission attributable to the State, which constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\n\nInternationally wrongful conduct refers to any act or omission by a state that violates an international legal obligation owed to another state or to the international community as a whole. This can include actions such as aggression, espionage, torture, and war crimes.\n\nIt is important to note that the concept of internationally wrongful conduct is subject to interpretation and varies depending on the specific context and jurisdiction involved. Additionally, some states may argue that certain acts or omissions do not constitute internationally wrongful conduct if they were necessary for self-defense or other legitimate reasons."
