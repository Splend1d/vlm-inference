This suggests that the Mesolithic people had a greater degree of mobility and access to resources, which allowed them to travel longer distances to acquire goods. In contrast, the Upper Paleolithic people may have been more sedentary and limited their travel to nearby areas or resources.\n\nAdditionally, the Upper Paleolithic period saw a decline in the use of barter systems and an increase in the use of monetary systems. The Mesolithic period, on the other hand, likely continued to use barter systems as a means of exchanging goods and services.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. in the Mesolithic, goods traveled farther and more goods were exchanged."
