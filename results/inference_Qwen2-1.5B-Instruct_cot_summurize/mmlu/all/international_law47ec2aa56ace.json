R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nHumanitarian intervention is a term used to describe military action taken by one country or group of countries to assist another country that is suffering from an internal conflict or natural disaster. This intervention may involve sending troops, providing aid, or taking other measures to help the affected population.\n\nResponsibility to Protect (R2P), on the other hand, is a concept introduced by the United Nations in 1995. It states that all states have a responsibility to protect their populations from mass atrocities such as genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The principle is based on the idea that if a state fails to take reasonable steps to prevent these atrocities, the international community has a responsibility to intervene.\n\nWhile R2P can lead to humanitarian intervention, it also allows for a more nuanced approach to intervention than simply calling for military action. For example, R2P requires a clear understanding of the situation on the ground and a willingness to work with local governments and organizations to address the root causes of the conflict. It also recognizes the importance of diplomatic efforts and peaceful solutions before resorting to military action.\n\nTherefore, while humanitarian intervention involves military action, R2P requires a broader range of actions and considerations beyond just military intervention."
