The bonds linking the monomers of starch differ in shape from the bonds linking the monomers of cellulose.\n\nStarch and cellulose are both complex carbohydrates that are made up of long chains of glucose monomers (simple sugars). However, the way that these sugar chains are arranged within the molecule determines their properties and functions.\n\nIn starch, the sugar chains are arranged in a linear or branched structure, which allows for a high degree of flexibility and resilience. This makes it easier for enzymes to break down the starch into its individual glucose units, leading to digestion.\n\nOn the other hand, cellulose is arranged in a crystalline structure with alternating strands of glucose and fructose monomers. These sugar chains are too rigid to be easily broken down by digestive enzymes, making them resistant to digestion. \n\nTherefore, the difference in the arrangement of sugar chains between starch and cellulose is what enables one to digest starch but not cellulose."
