The errors in the regression model are normally distributed with constant variance.\n2. There is no perfect multicollinearity among the independent variables.\n3. There is no heteroskedasticity, which means that the variance of the errors is constant across all values of the independent variable.\n4. The relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable is linear.\n\nIf any of these assumptions are violated, it can lead to incorrect parameter estimates, standard error estimates, distributional assumptions for the test statistics, and conclusions about the strength of the relationships between the dependent and independent variables. Therefore, options D is correct."
