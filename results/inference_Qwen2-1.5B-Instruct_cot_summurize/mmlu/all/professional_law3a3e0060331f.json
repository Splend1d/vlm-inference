At trial, the plaintiff was asked questions on direct examination about the days on which she had observed large amounts of dust in the air and how long the condition had lasted. She testified that she could not remember the specific times, but that she maintained a diary in which she had accurately recorded this information on a daily basis. When her attorney sought to refresh her recollection with her diary, she still could not remember. The plaintiff's attorney seeks to have the information in the diary admitted at trial. Is the information admissible?\n\nA. No, because reviewing it did not refresh the plaintiff's recollection.\nB. No, unless it is offered by the defendant.\nC. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed the option of reading it into evidence or having the diary received as an exhibit.\nD. Yes, and the plaintiff should be allowed to read the diary into evidence.\n"

In this case, the diary would likely be relevant to show the frequency and duration of the exposure to air pollution over time. It would also be relevant to show that the plaintiff had kept accurate records of her observations. Therefore, the information in the diary may be admissible at trial. However, whether the plaintiff should be allowed to read the diary into evidence or have it received as an exhibit is a matter for the court to decide based on its discretion."
