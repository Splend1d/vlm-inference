The viability of the CWC and BCW providing a concrete basis in international law to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is dubious. The Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent the illicit trade in materials relating to chemical and nuclear weapons is an equally piecemeal pursuit. Whilst they may serve some utility as a framework for diplomatic exchanges, they are essentially toothless bodies lacking the political will to establish an authority with the powers to police the control and use of these weapons.\nB. The International Non-proliferation Regime has been rendered effectively defunct in the post-Cold War climate. State actors seeking to develop their own weapons capabilities have de-stabilized norms governing the use and control of WMD. This has been evidenced by severe splits in the body following the 1998 Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing and the withdrawal of great power support following the US Senate's decision not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\nC. Contemporary concern has been pacified by the fact that WMD threat has greatly diminished with the end of the Cold War. A number of deployed Soviet (Russian) and strategic warheads and US tactical nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from service thereby removing the threat of total war by massive nuclear exchange.\nD. WMD terrorism poses a security threat that is not easily met by today's policy community or military establishments. The second strike rule is virtually obsolete because of the difficulty of locating such groups and deterrence is an unviable strategy given that objective of attacks are frequently politically, ideologically or religiously motivated.\n"

The viability of the CWC and BCW provides a foundation in international law to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, but it remains questionable whether this can be achieved effectively. The Proliferation Security Initiative serves as a framework for diplomatic exchanges, but lacks the necessary political will to enforce its goals.\n\nB. The International Non-proliferation Regime has faced significant challenges since the end of the Cold War, particularly after the 1998 Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests and the withdrawal of great-power support following the US Senate's decision not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\nC. Contemporary concerns over WMD threats have largely subsided due to the withdrawal of deployed Soviet/Russian and US tactical nuclear weapons, which reduced the possibility of total war by massive nuclear exchange.\n\nD. The threat posed by WMD terrorism is complex and multifaceted, and requires a combination of military and non-military strategies to address. The second strike rule is no longer applicable due to technological advancements and the difficulty of locating such groups. Deterrence against WMD attacks is also an unviable strategy due to the lack of clear objectives and the political, ideological, or religious motivations behind terrorist attacks."
