This type of negotiation allows for a more personal and open exchange of ideas, as well as the ability to build relationships and trust between the parties involved.\n\nIn contrast, indirect diplomacy involves negotiations conducted through intermediaries such as diplomats, ambassadors, or international organizations. While this approach can be effective in some cases, it may not always provide the same level of personal interaction and understanding as direct diplomacy."
