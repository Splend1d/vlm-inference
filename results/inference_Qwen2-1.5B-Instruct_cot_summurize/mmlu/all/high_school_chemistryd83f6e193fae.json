This means that the unknown gas must be moving at a slower rate to allow helium to pass through with such ease.\n\nLooking at the options provided, we can see that only option B (CH4) has a carbon atom count of four. All other options have five or more carbon atoms, which would make them less likely candidates for gases that move quickly through a pinhole.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the most likely answer is:\n\nB. CH4"
