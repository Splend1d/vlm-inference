Therefore, it is important for women to receive adequate nutrition during this time to support their developing baby.\n\nOption A is not necessarily true - while it is true that the embryo is vulnerable to external factors in the early stages of pregnancy, there are also other factors that can affect a woman's health at this time, such as stress or certain medical conditions.\n\nOption C is partially true - interventions in late pregnancy may still be effective if they are timely and appropriate. However, it is generally best to start prenatal care as soon as possible after conception.\n\nOption D is not necessarily true - while all of these options are relevant to prenatal care, not all of them apply equally to all situations. For example, option B applies only to pregnancies where the mother is aware of her pregnancy, while options A and C apply to all pregnancies regardless of whether the mother is aware of her pregnancy."
