This approach emphasizes the importance of balancing short-term profits with long-term sustainability and social responsibility.\n\nAccording to this model:\n\n- Organizations should focus on creating value for themselves, but not at the expense of others.\n- They should aim to maximize their financial returns without compromising their ethical standards or harming the environment.\n- The organization should engage in responsible business practices that align with societal expectations and legal requirements.\n- It should consider the broader impacts of its actions on the community, including environmental sustainability, employee welfare, and customer satisfaction.\n- The organization should be transparent about its operations and decision-making processes, ensuring accountability and trust from all stakeholders.\n\nTherefore, option C (\"That it is in an organization's own best interest to act in an ethical way\") is correct according to the enlightened self-interest model of CSR."
