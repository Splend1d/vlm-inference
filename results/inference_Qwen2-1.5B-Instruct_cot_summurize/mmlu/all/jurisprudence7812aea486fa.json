To examine the central questions of legal and political philosophy. \n\nLon Fuller's hypothetical case of the Speluncean Explorers was intended to explore the philosophical issues surrounding the concept of \"legal necessity,\" which refers to the idea that certain actions may be necessary for the survival or well-being of individuals or groups, even if those actions are immoral or against the law. In this case, the explorers had to resort to cannibalism because they were starving and there was no other way to obtain food. Fuller's goal was to examine the ethical and moral implications of such actions from a legal and political perspective."
