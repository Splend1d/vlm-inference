It is the end result that all delimitations of areas of continental shelf and EEZ should achieve, after, however, drawing a provisional 'equidistance line' and adjusting the zone in the light of the relevant circumstances and the proportionality test.\nD.

In the context of maritime delimitation, an equitable result may involve considering various factors such as historical usage, geographical proximity, economic interests, and other considerations that might affect the balance of rights between parties.\n\nIn summary, the 'equitable result' in the law and practice of maritime delimitation refers to the decision by a judge or arbitrator that takes into account fairness, equity, and other considerations to determine the most appropriate boundary for a maritime area."
