An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon.\n\nAn abdominal mass can be caused by various conditions, including an aortic aneurysm (option A), an enlarged kidney (option B), a large mass arising out of the pelvis and causing urinary tract obstruction (option C), or faecal loading of the colon (option D). \n\nHowever, an indentible mass is not typically associated with any of these conditions. Rather, it is more commonly seen in individuals with certain types of cancer, such as diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel disease. In this case, the mass may be indented because of the presence of inflamed tissue or bleeding within the colon. \n\nIt's important to note that abdominal masses should be evaluated by a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."
