Being exposed to bright light during the later part of the day can help regulate our body's natural sleep-wake cycle and promote better quality sleep. This is known as the \"light-dark\" theory of sleep, which suggests that exposure to light before bedtime helps regulate our internal clock and prepares us for sleep.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this effect may vary from person to person and there are other factors such as stress, caffeine intake, and room temperature that can also affect our ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. It's always best to establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine to improve overall sleep quality."
