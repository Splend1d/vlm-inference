Here is a breakdown of each category:\n\nA. Question marks: These SBU have high risks but also significant opportunities for growth.\n\nB. Quick winners: These SBU show rapid growth and strong profitability potential.\n\nC. Charging bulls: These SBU are characterized by low growth but high profitability and are seen as investments rather than businesses.\n\nD. Cash outs: These SBU show signs of declining profitability or growth and may be at risk of being divested to reduce losses.\n\nSo in summary, the categories are:\n- Quick winners\n- Question marks \n- Charging bulls \n- Cash out\n\nThese categories can help organizations identify where they should focus their resources and attention."
