However, since we're looking for the probability that a customer does NOT request a tire replacement given they requested an oil change, it's essentially asking what part of the 20% that don't request a tire replacement overlaps with those who request an oil change.\n\nGiven the overlap between those who request both services, which is 10%, we subtract this from the 20% to get the portion that doesn't request a tire replacement:\n\n\\[20\\% - 10\\% = 10\\%\\]\n\nSo, the probability that a customer requesting an oil change does not request a tire replacement is 10%. The correct answer is C. 0.7."
