Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $60,000.\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe company made a prepayment of $90,000 for services that will be performed evenly over a six-month period from November 1, year 1, through April 30, year 2. This means that the amount paid is spread out over the full six months of service provision.\n\nIn year 1, the company did not record any additional journal entries to reflect this prepayment. Therefore, it has already recorded the entire $90,000 as an expense in October, year 1.\n\nTo adjust for the prepayment, the company would debit prepaid services (which represents the unearned portion of the total cost) and credit services expense (for the earned portion). In this case, the company would credit $60,000 (half of $90,000) because the services were only partially performed during the first six months of the year.\n\nTherefore, the correct adjusting journal entry is:\n\nDebit prepaid services and credit services expense for $60,000."
