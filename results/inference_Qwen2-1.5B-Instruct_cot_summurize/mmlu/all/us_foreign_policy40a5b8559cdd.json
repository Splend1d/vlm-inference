The Presidency welcomed the influence of Congress\n\nUnder George H.W. Bush, there was a strong emphasis on bipartisanship and cooperation between the two branches of government. This is evident in his administration's approach to foreign policy, where he worked closely with Congress to pass legislation that supported American interests abroad.\n\nBill Clinton, on the other hand, inherited an environment where the federal government had become more interventionist and bureaucratic. He sought to reverse this trend by reducing the size and scope of government. This led to a shift in power dynamics, with Congress becoming more influential in shaping domestic policies, particularly those related to spending and taxation.\n\nTherefore, while there may have been some instances where Congress exerted greater influence over foreign policy during the presidency of George H.W. Bush, overall the relationship between the two branches remained one of cooperative governance rather than an all-out contest for power."
