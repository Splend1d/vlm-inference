We respect the dignity of human life. \n\nNathanson's argument against the death penalty is based on the belief that it does not provide an appropriate response to the crime committed, and that it violates the inherent worth and dignity of all individuals. He believes that the death penalty fails to adequately address the underlying causes of crime and does not serve as a deterrent. Therefore, abolishing the death penalty would be seen as a step towards respecting the dignity of human life."
