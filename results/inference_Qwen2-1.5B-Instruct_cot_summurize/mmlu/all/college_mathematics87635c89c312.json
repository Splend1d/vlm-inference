                    "text": "To determine the number of non-isomorphic trees with 5 vertices, we can use Euler's formula for planar graphs:\n\nV - E + F = 2\n\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor a tree (a connected graph without cycles), every vertex has exactly two neighbors. So, if there are 5 vertices, each must have exactly 3 neighbors. However, since it's stated that the tree is connected, this means all vertices must be adjacent to each other. This implies that all vertices are part of the same cycle.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible ways to arrange these 5 vertices into a cycle: C_5 or C_4, where C represents a cycle.\n\n- If we choose C_5, then we need to choose 4 out of the 5 edges from this cycle to form the remaining edge of the tree. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient \"5 choose 4\", which is 5.\n- If we choose C_4, then we don't need to add any new edges to the cycle. We simply select 4 out of the 5 edges directly from the cycle. The number of ways to do this is also given by the binomial coefficient \"5 choose 4\", which is 5.\n\nTherefore, in total, there are \\(5 + 5 = 10\\) non-isomorphic trees with 5 vertices. \n\nSo, the answer is **B. 2**."
