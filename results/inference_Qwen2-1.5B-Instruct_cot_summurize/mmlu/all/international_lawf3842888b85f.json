The appointment process for arbitrators in international arbitration typically involves a selection process where the parties nominate candidates and then propose them to the relevant institution or organization that administers the arbitration. Once nominated, the arbitrator is usually selected based on their expertise, experience, and qualifications. It's important to note that this process can vary depending on the type of arbitration and the rules of the specific institution administering it."
