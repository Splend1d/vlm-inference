Identify and document the nonconformity, then send the goods back right away.\n\nThe UCC provides that a buyer may reject nonconforming goods within 10 days after receipt. If the buyer decides to return the goods, it is important to identify and document any defects or discrepancies in the goods. Once the goods have been returned, the buyer should send them back immediately to the seller. The seller must either provide a refund or replace the goods within 30 days. If the seller fails to do so, the buyer can seek remedies through the courts."
