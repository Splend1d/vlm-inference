Wearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves and keeping all acetone containers closed.\n\nWearing goggles and nitrile-type gloves will protect the student from any splashes or spills of the acetone. Keeping all acetone containers closed will prevent any accidental exposure to the solvent. If the acetone does catch fire, wearing fire-retardant gloves can help contain the flames and keep the fire from spreading. However, this is not necessary if the student is using a fume hood to control the flow of the acetone vapor. \n\nPutting the chamber in a closed, darkened cabinet is not a safe practice as it may trap the acetone inside and increase the risk of inhalation or burns."
