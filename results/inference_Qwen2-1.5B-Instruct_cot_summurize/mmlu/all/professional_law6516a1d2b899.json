On that form, a notice appeared in bold letters: \"TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website.\" She did not access the terms, which she could have done by clicking a conspicuous link. She started an account and paid $50 for a credit report. For the next 6 months, her credit card was automatically billed $50, without notice, except that she received email notice that the report was available at the site. The terms and conditions provided that she authorized the charges, unless she notified the company otherwise in advance. Which party will likely prevail on the issue of whether she was bound to pay for the 6 months until she canceled?\n\nA. The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.\nB. The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.\nC. The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.\nD. The company will prevail because any mention of terms and conditions is enough to put the prospective member on notice of contract terms.\n"

This means that the woman would have had to actively search for the terms and conditions if she wanted to know about them, rather than simply reading through the terms as part of the registration process. Additionally, the fact that the terms and conditions were in bold text and were located near the end of the registration form suggests that they were designed to be prominent and easy to find. This makes it more likely that the woman would have read them carefully and understood their implications before agreeing to the contract."
