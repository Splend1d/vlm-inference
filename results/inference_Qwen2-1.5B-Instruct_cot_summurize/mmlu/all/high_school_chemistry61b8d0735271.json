However, if we assume that the reaction occurs under standard conditions (room temperature and pressure), the reaction would produce RbBr (RbBr is a salt composed of Rubidium and Bromide).\n\nGiven that you have 1.0 g of rubidium and 1.0 g of bromine, this means you would start with 2 moles of Rb and 2 moles of Br. Under standard conditions, these reactants would form 2 moles of RbBr.\n\nTherefore, the substance that would be left in measurable amounts (more than 0.10 mg) after the reaction is RbBr.\n\nSo the answer is A. RbBr only."
