Large-scale deforestation of the Amazon or Congo basin tropical forests\n\nLarge-scale deforestation has a significant impact on biodiversity, as it leads to the loss of habitat for countless species of plants and animals. This can result in a decline in the number of individuals of each species, which can ultimately lead to their extinction if the population continues to decrease. Additionally, deforestation can also disrupt ecosystems by changing the balance of species that live within them, potentially leading to changes in weather patterns, soil fertility, and other environmental factors that affect biodiversity."
