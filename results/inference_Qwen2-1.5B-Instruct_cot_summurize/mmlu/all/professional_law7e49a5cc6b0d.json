The hospital negligently misidentified the husband's body and sent it to be cremated. When she was informed of the hospital's mistake, the widow suffered serious emotional distress. She has sued the hospital. Is the hospital likely to be held liable to the widow?\n\nA. No, because the widow did not witness the cremation.\nB. No, because the widow was never in any danger of bodily harm.\nC. Yes, because hospitals are strictly liable if they do not properly dispose of corpses.\nD. Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because the negligent handling of the husband's body was especially likely to cause his widow serious emotional distress.\n\nWhile it is true that the hospital is only liable for damages if it caused the injury or death of a person, it is also true that hospitals have a duty to properly handle and dispose of bodies in a way that minimizes the risk of causing harm or distress to others. In this case, the hospital negligently identified the wrong husband's body and sent it to be cremated instead of burying it. This could have caused significant emotional distress to the widow who would have been notified of the error after the fact.\n\nTherefore, the hospital is likely to be held liable to the widow based on the principle of strict liability, which applies when there is a clear causal link between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff's injuries or damages."
