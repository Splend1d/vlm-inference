To raise this additional money, the city instructs the assessment office to raise all appraised house values by $5,000.

The formula for the standard deviation is:\n\n\\[ \\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\mu)^2}{N} \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\sigma^2 \\) is the new variance, \\( x_i \\) is the individual value, \\(\\mu\\) is the new mean, and \\( N \\) is the number of values.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sum of squared deviations from the new mean:\n\n\\[ S = \\sum (x_i - \\mu)^2 \\]\n\\[ S = \\sum ((x_i - 130,000))^2 \\]\n\nSince there are \\( N \\) houses, \\( N = 100 \\) because it's given that there were originally 100 houses in the city.\n\nWe don't know the exact values for \\( x_i \\), but we can assume they're normally distributed around the new mean. For simplicity, let's say \\( x_i \\) represents the original value minus the new mean ($130,000 - 125,000$). So, \\( x_i = 5000 \\).\n\nThen, we'll plug these into our formula:\n\n\\[ S = 100 \\times (5000)^2 = 100 \\times 2500000 = 25,000,000 \\]\n\nNext, we divide by \\( N \\):\n\n\\[ \\sigma^2 = \\frac{S}{N} = \\frac{25,000,000}{100} = 250,000 \\]\n\nFinally, we take the square root to get the new standard deviation:\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\sqrt{250,000} = 5000 \\]\n\nSo, the answer is B. $25,300."
