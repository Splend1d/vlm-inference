Pith; primary xylem; secondary xylem; vascular cambium; secondary phloem; primary phloem; cortex.\n\nIn this scenario, the stem-boring beetle's larvae first consume the pith layer of the wood, which is the innermost part of the tree. The pith layer contains water and nutrients and serves as a source for the plant during times when sunlight is scarce or unavailable.\n\nNext, the larvae then move on to the primary xylem layer, which carries water and minerals from the roots to the leaves. This layer is made up of long, narrow tubes called tracheids, which allow for efficient transport of fluids.\n\nAfter consuming the xylem, the larvae enter the secondary xylem layer, which also transports water and minerals but is less dense than the primary xylem. It consists of smaller tubes called fibers, which are more tightly packed together.\n\nAs the larvae progress further, they reach the vascular cambium layer, which is where new cells are formed within the wood to replace old ones. These cells grow rapidly and contribute to the growth of the tree.\n\nFinally, the larvae reach the secondary phloem layer, which transports sugars and other organic compounds from the leaves back to the roots. This layer is composed of larger vessels filled with sap.\n\nThroughout this process, the larvae encounter the various layers of the wood, including the pith, xylem, and phloem, before reaching the outermost layers, such as the bark and the cuticle."
