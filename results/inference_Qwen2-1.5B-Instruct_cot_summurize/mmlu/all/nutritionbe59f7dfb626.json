Absorption of fatty acids in the intestine occurs mainly through FABP and FAT/CD36 transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum\nB. After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system.\nC. The products of partial digestion of triglycerides (triacylglycerols) can form mixed micelles with pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids and this increases absorption\nD.

These proteins are highly specific for fatty acids and play a crucial role in the process of lipid metabolism.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nB. MCT do not enter the lymphatic system; they are absorbed directly into the bloodstream or enter the liver via the portal vein.\n\nC. Mixed micelles formed between triacylglycerols and pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids do not increase absorption; instead, these structures enhance lipoprotein lipase activity to break down triacylglycerols into monoglycerides and free fatty acids.\n\nD. Triglycerides do not need to be emulsified or digested; they are primarily hydrolyzed by lipases in the small intestine. However, they require bile salts for their final digestion in the large intestine."
