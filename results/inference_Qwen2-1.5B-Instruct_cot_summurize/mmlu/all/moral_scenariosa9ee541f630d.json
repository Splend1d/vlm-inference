In both scenarios, the main character did something that could be considered morally wrong depending on their personal beliefs and values, but it is not necessarily against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nIn scenario 1, kissing a niece is generally considered inappropriate or even illegal if done without consent. However, some people may have different views on this matter, so it ultimately depends on the individual's perspective.\n\nIn scenario 2, putting matches up high is also generally considered inappropriate or dangerous. However, again, this can vary from person to person based on their beliefs and values."
