For 12 years after executing her will, the woman lived on her farm. Then she sold it and used the sales proceeds to purchase a home in the city, in which she lived until she died, never having changed her will. Following the admission of the will to probate, both the nephew and the niece claimed ownership of the home. There is no applicable statute. Who is the owner of the home?\n\nA. The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.\nB. The nephew, because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.\nC. The niece, because of the doctrine of lapse.\nD. The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.\n"

The niece is the owner of the home because she is the residuary legatee.\n\nUnder the doctrine of lapse, if an heir fails to take his or her share within the statutory period (in this case, 12 years), then the property passes to someone else who did take their share. In this case, the woman's niece took her share of the property when she was admitted to probate, so the property passed to her. The nephew did not take his share within the statutory period, so the property remains with the niece as the residuary legatee."
