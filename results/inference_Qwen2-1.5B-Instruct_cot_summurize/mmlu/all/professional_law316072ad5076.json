While they were watching the movie, freezing rain fell outside, coating everything with a thin layer of very slippery ice. When the movie ended, one of the man's guests slipped on the ice as soon as he took a step out of the door and onto the front stoop of the man's house. Which of the following would best describe the duty of care owed by the man to his guest?\n\nA. No duty of care.\nB. A duty to inspect the premises for unknown dangers and disclose their existence to others.\nC. A duty to warn of any known dangerous condition on the premises.\nD. An absolute duty of care.\n"

A duty to warn of any known dangerous condition on the premises.\n\nThe duty of care in this scenario is typically understood as a legal obligation to take reasonable precautions to avoid causing harm to another person. In this case, the man owes a duty to his friend to warn him of the dangerous condition (the icy conditions) that could cause harm if not properly addressed. The other options do not apply because there is no evidence that the man was aware of or responsible for any known dangers before the accident occurred."
