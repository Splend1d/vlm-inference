An anchor is used to secure a vessel to the bottom of a body of water, such as a harbor or a mooring basin. It provides stability and prevents the ship from drifting away or being blown off course by strong winds or currents. The anchor can also be used to move a vessel along a coastline or into a port, allowing it to be safely docked."
