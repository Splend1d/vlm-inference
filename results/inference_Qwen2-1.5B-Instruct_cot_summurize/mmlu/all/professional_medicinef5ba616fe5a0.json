The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?\n\nA. Decreased absorption of codeine\nB. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine\nC. Deficiency of \u03ba receptors\nD. Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine\n"

Codeine is a weak opioid that binds to mu (\u03ba) receptors in the brain and spinal cord, but it can also bind to other proteins in the body, such as albumin or transferrin, which can increase its plasma concentration and reduce its analgesic effects. This phenomenon is known as opiate resistance or drug-drug interactions, and it can occur when multiple drugs interact with each other at the same time. In this case, the patient's codeine may be bound to albumin or transferrin, reducing its effectiveness as an analgesic."
