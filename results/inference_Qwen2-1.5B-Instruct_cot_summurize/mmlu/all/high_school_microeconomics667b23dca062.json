This could lead to more time spent on tasks other than pie-making and potentially result in fewer pies being made. As a result, there may be an increased need for additional workers or overtime hours to compensate for the reduced productivity caused by the gossiping. \n\nOption A (the price of apple peelers/corers rising) does not directly affect the demand for labor in this scenario since it pertains to equipment rather than human labor. Option C (a sale on ovens) also does not have a direct impact on labor demand as it relates to kitchen appliances rather than the production process itself. Finally, option D (a new study revealing that apples increase your risk of cancer) does not seem relevant to the context provided, although it might indirectly influence consumer behavior related to purchasing apple products if it affects the taste or health perception of consumers."
