Therefore, these two statements are not logically equivalent because they have different truth values under the same set of conditions.\n\nHowever, we cannot determine whether these two statements are contradictory based on the truth table alone. We need to consider the definitions of logical equivalence, contradiction, consistency, and inconsistency in logic.\n\n- **Logical Equivalence**: Two statements A and B are said to be logically equivalent if they have the same truth value for all possible truth values of their variables. The truth table above shows that the first statement is not logically equivalent to the second one since they have different truth values for some combinations of their variables.\n- **Contradiction**: Two statements A and B are said to be contradictory if their truth values are opposite for all possible truth values of their variables. The truth table above does not show any direct relationship between the truth values of C and D, so we cannot conclude that these two statements are contradictory.\n- **Consistency**: Two statements A and B are said to be consistent if they have the same truth value for all possible truth values of their variables. From the truth table above, we can see that the first statement has the same truth value as the second one for all possible truth values of its variables, so these two statements are consistent.\n- **Inconsistency**: Two statements A and B are said to be inconsistent if they do not have the same truth value for at least one combination of their variables. Since the truth table above shows that the first statement has a different truth value than the second one for some combinations of their variables, these two statements are inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent**."
