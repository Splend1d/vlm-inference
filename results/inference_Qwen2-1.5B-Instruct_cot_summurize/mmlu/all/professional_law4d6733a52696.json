He decided to just park along the road next to the store, even though there was not really a lane or space there intended for parking. The driver pulled his car as far off the roadway as he could and figured that it would be fine because he would only be in the store for a few minutes. While the driver was in the store, a car driven by a woman approached the spot where the driver had left his car. When the woman saw the driver's car and realized it was partially obstructing the road, she tried to avoid hitting it but crashed into it. The accident caused $5,000 worth of damage to the driver's car and $1,000 worth of damage to the woman's car. Assume that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules and that the woman had the last clear chance to avoid the collision. How much, if anything, could the driver recover in a lawsuit against the woman for negligence?\n\nA. $5,000, or the full amount of damages to his car.\nB. $4,000, or the full amount of his damages, minus the woman's damages.\nC. $2,500, or half of his damages.\nD. Nothing, because the driver was contributorily negligent for parking his car so that part of it stuck out into the street.\n"

Nothing, because the driver was contributorily negligent for parking his car so that part of it stuck out into the street.\n\nThe driver parked his car too close to the road, causing a collision with another vehicle. This is considered an act of negligence on his part, since he should have known better and avoided the situation altogether. Contributory negligence means that if the plaintiff (in this case, the driver) was also at fault for their own injuries, then they can't recover any damages from the defendant (in this case, the other driver). In this scenario, the driver contributed to the accident by being too close to the road, so they cannot recover any damages from the other driver."
