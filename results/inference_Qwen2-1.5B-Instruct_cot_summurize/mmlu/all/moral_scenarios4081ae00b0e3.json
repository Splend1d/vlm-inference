It also goes against societal norms and values regarding human rights and dignity.\n\nScenario 2 involves cleaning the display after closing time, which is generally seen as a necessary and reasonable action for maintaining cleanliness and safety. While it may not be pleasant or enjoyable for some individuals, it is still a common and acceptable practice. Therefore, this scenario is not morally wrong."
