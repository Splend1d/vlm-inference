Woman as 'victim' is, and continues to be, an important narrative of war stories. In 1990 an estimated 90% of war casualties were civilian, the majority women and children. Reports that women are the primary casualties of war has contributed to the enduring perception that women are dependent on men for protection, and that men are responsible for sacrificing their own well bring for the protection of women and the state (often confused with one another through propaganda and imagery).\nB. The role of men as intrinsically heroic has been marginalized as the traumas of war, desertion, and conscription become more apparent. When imagining victims, there is no longer a gender divide. Instead, there is a growing perception that those who fight are courageous and heroic, whilst those who do not take on female characteristics.\nC. Increasing awareness regarding the barbaric nature of warfare and the problems of trauma in war has led to a reversal in the belief that the idea of war is a natural place for males. In contemporary societies across the globe, men are regarded as the victims of gender stereotypes that coerce them into violent behaviour as 'protectors' or aggressors on behalf of the state.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Women as 'victim' is an important narrative in war stories, but it perpetuates the stereotype that women are less capable than men due to their dependence on men for protection. This can lead to a lack of understanding about the complexities of gender dynamics in conflict.\n\nB. The role of men as intrinsically heroic has been marginalized because of the recognition of the traumatic experiences of war and the fact that many men choose not to participate in combat. This leads to a broader view of masculinity that emphasizes bravery over aggression.\n\nC. Awareness of the barbarity of warfare and the issues of post-traumatic stress disorder have shifted perceptions of gender roles in conflict. Men are now seen as victims of societal expectations that force them into violent behavior as protectors or aggressors on behalf of the state.\n\nD. All of these options address the ways in which the concept of \"victim\" influences gender security by challenging traditional notions of gender roles and reinforcing the importance of recognizing the complex dynamics of violence and gender identity in conflict."
