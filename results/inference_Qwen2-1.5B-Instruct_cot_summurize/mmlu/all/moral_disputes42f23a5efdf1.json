You do not have the right to refuse a legitimate marriage proposal.\n\nWellman's argument suggests that a state has a duty to protect its citizens from harm, but this does not necessarily mean that it should always allow individuals to refuse certain types of proposals. For example, a state may have a moral obligation to prevent violence or exploitation in marriages, so it could choose to exclude people who pose a threat to their partners.\n\nHowever, it is not accurate to say that the state can never exclude anyone, regardless of whether they pose a risk to themselves or others. In some cases, such as in cases of forced marriage or domestic abuse, the state may have a legal duty to intervene and protect individuals from harm.\n\nIt is also not accurate to suggest that marital relationships are different from other forms of social relationships, such as friendships or romantic relationships. All relationships involve some level of commitment and trust, and the state has a responsibility to ensure that these relationships are healthy and respectful.\n\nFinally, while it is true that refusing to marry someone cannot itself cause harm, it is still important for states to consider the broader implications of their actions and to take into account the potential consequences of their decisions. This includes considering how their policies might impact vulnerable populations, such as those who are already marginalized or oppressed."
