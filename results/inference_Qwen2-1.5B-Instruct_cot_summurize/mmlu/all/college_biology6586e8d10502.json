Therefore, option A is incorrect. \n\nOption B is correct because introns are indeed non-coding regions of DNA that do not code for proteins.\n\nOption C is correct because introns are found interspersed with exons on a region of DNA that codes for a polypeptide chain.\n\nOption D is incorrect because introns are indeed excised from the primary transcript before it gains a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A)tail. However, this statement does not fully describe the process, which includes additional steps like splicing and transcriptional elongation."
