Therefore, the best way to prove a theory that there is an attractive force between all objects is by repeating the experiment many times under consistent conditions and comparing the results with those from previous experiments.\n\nIt is not necessary for the first experiment to be successful in order to prove the theory correct; rather, it should be one of many experiments conducted over a period of time to establish the consistency of the results.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: when you and many others have tested the hypothesis."
