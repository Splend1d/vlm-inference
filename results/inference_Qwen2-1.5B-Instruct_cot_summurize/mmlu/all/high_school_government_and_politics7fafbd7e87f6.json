Therefore, option A (reviewing a lower court decision) is correct. Option B (rendering a decision on a case) is incorrect because a writ of certiorari does not indicate that the Supreme Court has made a final decision on any particular case. Option C (deciding not to hear an appeal) is also incorrect because a writ of certiorari can be used to request review of a lower court's decision, which means the Supreme Court would still have the opportunity to hear an appeal if it chooses to do so. Option D (recess until the end of the calendar year) is also incorrect because the Supreme Court does not take recess during its sessions."
