Joint profit maximization costs society consumer surplus as the price rises above competitive levels.\n\nThe government discourages collusion between large firms in the same industry because it can lead to joint profit maximization, which means that the firms will produce more than they would individually, resulting in higher prices for consumers and lower profits for those who participate in the collusion. This is because the firms may engage in predatory pricing, lowering their prices below the cost of production to drive out competitors and gain market share. However, this strategy also leads to higher prices for consumers, as the collusion reduces competition and drives up the overall price level. As a result, the government may discourage such collusion by imposing regulations or antitrust laws that prevent monopolistic practices and promote competition among firms in the industry."
