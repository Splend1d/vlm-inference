I and III only.\n\nOligopoly refers to a market structure where there are relatively few sellers, typically between two and twenty-five, and formidable barriers to entry. In an oligopolistic market, each seller has some control over its own price because it can influence demand by changing output or advertising. However, since there are so few sellers in most oligopolistic markets, firms have little ability to set prices independently of one another. This means that the overall market price is determined by the intersection of supply and demand curves for the industry as a whole, which is often referred to as the \"market-clearing\" price. Therefore, option D is correct. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while barriers to entry may be significant in some oligopolistic markets, they do not necessarily determine the shape of the supply curve. Option B is also incorrect because in an oligopoly, the market price does indeed equal marginal revenue (MR), but this does not mean that MR equals P. Option C is also incorrect because although there are relatively few sellers in an oligopoly, there are still many buyers who can enter the market if they choose to do so."
