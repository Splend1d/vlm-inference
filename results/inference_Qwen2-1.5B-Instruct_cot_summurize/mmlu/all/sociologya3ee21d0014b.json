Prior to the Industrial Revolution, families were typically larger and more extended than they are today. This meant that there were multiple generations living together and many other relatives who were involved in the care and support of children. As society became more urbanized and industrialized, the need for larger households decreased, leading to a decline in the size and complexity of traditional nuclear families. However, this does not mean that the nuclear family has completely disappeared; it remains an important institution in many cultures around the world."
