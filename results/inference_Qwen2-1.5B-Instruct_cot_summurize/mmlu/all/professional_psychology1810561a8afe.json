This is because when we study something that is related to what we have already learned, our brains create new connections between the two concepts, which helps in improving retention and recall of the information. On the other hand, sleeping and exercising may also improve mental function but they do not directly affect the retention of the learned material. Studying an unrelated subject can actually interfere with the retention of the learned material as it creates new neural pathways that compete with the old ones for resources."
