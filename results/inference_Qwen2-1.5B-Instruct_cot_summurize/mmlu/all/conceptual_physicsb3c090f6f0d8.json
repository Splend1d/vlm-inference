However, when this atom loses an electron to become an ion, its atomic number decreases by one.\n\nTherefore, if the original element emitted one alpha particle and then lost an electron, its atomic number would decrease from 7 (for carbon) to 6 (for nitrogen). This corresponds to a change of -2 on the periodic table."
