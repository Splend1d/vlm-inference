Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?\" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial.

However, in this case, there is no evidence that the pedestrian is reliable or trustworthy, nor can we identify who they are. Therefore, the statement cannot be used against the defendant."
