Therefore, combining multiple drugs that target different stages of the viral life cycle can be more effective than using just one drug. Additionally, combining drugs with different mechanisms of action can help to prevent the development of resistance to those drugs, as well as reduce the risk of side effects from multiple medications. Finally, combining drugs can also provide additional benefits, such as reducing the risk of opportunistic infections caused by the presence of other viruses or bacteria."
