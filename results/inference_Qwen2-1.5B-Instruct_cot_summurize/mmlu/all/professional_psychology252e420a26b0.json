Secondary prevention refers to interventions that aim to reduce the severity of existing mental health problems, rather than preventing them from occurring altogether or attempting to address underlying issues that may contribute to the problem. Examples of secondary prevention strategies include providing education and resources for individuals who have already experienced mental health challenges, offering support groups for people with mental health conditions, and developing programs to improve access to mental health services."
