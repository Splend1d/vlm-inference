The lunar maria, also known as mare (Latin for \"sea\") or marina in Greek, are large areas of dark terrain that cover about 25% of the Moon's surface. They were formed by the impact of meteorites and asteroids over billions of years, leaving behind craters filled with water ice and other materials. The maria are divided into three main types: lava plains, which consist of smooth surfaces covered with dark lava flows; volcanic plains, which have similar features to lava plains but are often less extensive; and dark regions, which contain dark volcanic rocks and ash that were once part of the Moon's interior."
