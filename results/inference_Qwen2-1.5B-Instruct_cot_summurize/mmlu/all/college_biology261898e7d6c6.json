This can disrupt the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which is the steady-state model of population genetics that assumes that allele frequencies remain constant over time and space. Gene flow can cause alleles to spread into new populations, leading to changes in allele frequencies that may not be predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg model.\n\nIn contrast, A, B, and C are all incorrect because they do not accurately describe the effects of gene flow on the metapoplation. Gene flow does not necessarily result in an increase in genetic homogeneity (A), nor does it always increase the rate of deleterious mutations (B). Speciation is also not directly related to gene flow (C), although it could potentially occur if the metapoplation contains populations that diverge from each other due to isolation."
