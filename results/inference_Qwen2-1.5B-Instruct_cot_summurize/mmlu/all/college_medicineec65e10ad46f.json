When the muscle cell contracts, the ATP molecules are used to generate energy, which requires the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. This release of calcium ions causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to contract, which in turn releases more ATP molecules. \n\nAs the ATP molecules are released, they bind to ADP molecules, forming adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During this process, the release of calcium ions also releases hydrogen ions, which can cause the production of lactic acid. Lactic acid is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism and is formed when oxygen is not available for respiration. \n\nIn order for the hydrogen ions to diffuse out of the muscle cell, they must be transported through a protein transporter molecule called Na+/H+ exchanger. The Na+/H+ exchanger is responsible for moving sodium ions into the muscle cell and hydrogen ions out of the muscle cell. As a result, the muscle cell becomes negatively charged, allowing the Na+/H+ exchanger to move sodium ions into the cell while hydrogen ions move out of the cell. \n\nThe movement of hydrogen ions out of the muscle cell is facilitated by the proton pump, which uses ATP as a\u80fd\u6e90\u6765\u9a71\u52a8\u6c22\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u3002\u5728\u808c\u8089\u7ec6\u80de\u5185\uff0c\u5f53\u808c\u8089\u6536\u7f29\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8eATP\u7684\u91ca\u653e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9499\u79bb\u5b50\u4ece\u808c\u6d46\u7f51\u91ca\u653e\u5230\u80de\u8d28\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9499\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u91ca\u653e\u4f1a\u4fc3\u4f7f\u808c\u6d46\u7f51\u6536\u7f29\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4f7f\u66f4\u591a\u7684ATP\u5206\u5b50\u91ca\u653e\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9bATP\u5206\u5b50\u4e0eADP\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210ATP\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9499\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u91ca\u653e\u4e5f\u91ca\u653e\u4e86\u6c22\u79bb\u5b50\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u4e73\u9178\u3002\u4e73\u9178\u662f\u65e0\u6c27\u4ee3\u8c22\u7684\u526f\u4ea7\u7269\uff0c\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u6c27\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u5c06\u6c22\u79bb\u5b50\u4ece\u808c\u8089\u7ec6\u80de\u6269\u6563\u51fa\u53bb\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5fc5\u987b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNa+/H+\u5916\u6392\u6cf5\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8fd0\u8f93\u5668\u3002Na+/H+\u5916\u6392\u6cf5\u8d1f\u8d23\u5c06\u94a0\u79bb\u5b50\u8fd0\u5165\u808c\u8089\u7ec6\u80de\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u6c22\u79bb\u5b50\u4ece\u808c\u8089\u7ec6\u80de\u4e2d\u6392\u51fa\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u808c\u8089\u7ec6\u80de\u53d8\u5f97\u5e26\u8d1f\u7535\u8377\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u5f97Na+/H+\u5916\u6392\u6cf5\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u94a0\u79bb\u5b50\u8fd0\u5165\u7ec6\u80de\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u52a8\u6c22\u79bb\u5b50\u4ece\u7ec6\u80de\u4e2d\u6392\u51fa\u3002"
