The first verse mentions the prohibition against engaging in activities such as drinking alcohol and playing games of chance, which are seen as sinful and immoral by Muslims. The second verse suggests that during the springtime (when flowers bloom), one should consume alcoholic beverages, which is another aspect of Islamic social norms.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to both verses would be C. religious regulation of personal behavior in Islamic society. However, without additional context or specific questions related to the verses, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer."
