These early apes ranged from small primates like monkeys and lemurs to large mammals like gorillas and chimpanzees. Additionally, these early apes were found across a wide range of habitats, including forests, savannas, and grasslands, making them more widespread than today's apes. Finally, some of these early apes were indeed larger than today's apes, with some species reaching up to 1 meter (3 feet) in height. Therefore, all of the options listed are true."
