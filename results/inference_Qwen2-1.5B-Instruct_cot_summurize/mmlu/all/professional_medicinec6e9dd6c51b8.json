This condition occurs when there is a displacement or shifting of the soft tissue around the vertebral column, which can cause pressure on nearby nerves and tissues. It can lead to lower back pain, numbness, and weakness in the legs. In this case, the patient may have experienced a herniated disc causing nerve compression."
