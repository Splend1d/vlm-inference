This could be due to a mismatch between what an individual believes about themselves and how they actually behave.\n\nThe second statement is also true because it indicates that individuals may feel more positive about themselves if they associate or identify with others who have achieved success. This can lead to a sense of validation and increased self-esteem.\n\nThe third statement is partially true but not entirely accurate. While people may tend to attribute their successes to dispositional factors and failures to situational factors, there is no single factor that determines success or failure. Success often depends on a combination of personal qualities, skills, opportunities, and luck.\n\nFinally, the fourth statement is also true because it suggests that individuals can infer their own attitudes and emotions by observing their own behaviors and the circumstances in which those behaviors occur. This process is known as introspection and is a fundamental aspect of human cognition."
