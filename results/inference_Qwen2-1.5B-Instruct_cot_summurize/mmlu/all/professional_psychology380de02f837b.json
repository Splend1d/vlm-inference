In general, it is important for researchers to obtain informed consent from participants before any study begins, which includes providing clear information about the purpose of the study, the methods used, the procedures involved, and the potential risks and benefits. This information should be presented in an understandable manner that allows individuals to make an informed decision about whether or not to participate.\n\nIn some cases, it may be necessary to informally debrief participants about the true purpose of the study if they express concern or discomfort with participating. However, this should only be done after obtaining written consent from all participants and ensuring that their safety and well-being are not at risk. It is also important to provide debriefing materials and resources for participants who need additional support or guidance after completing the study.\n\nIn summary, the prospective value of a study depends on its purpose, the degree of deception involved, and the willingness of participants to participate. It is essential for researchers to obtain informed consent and provide appropriate debriefing for all participants, even those who choose to withdraw from the study voluntarily."
