The azimuth of the NCP is the angular distance from the North Pole. \n\nTo determine your latitude, you need to know the direction and distance of the North Celestial Pole (NCP) in the sky. You can use a compass or a GPS device to measure the azimuth of the NCP, which is the angle between the North Pole and the position of the NCP on the horizon.\n\nOnce you have measured the azimuth of the NCP, you can convert it into degrees by multiplying it by 15/360, where 15 represents the number of degrees in one hour, and 360 represents the total number of degrees in a circle. This will give you the latitude of your location in degrees.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not B, C, or D."
