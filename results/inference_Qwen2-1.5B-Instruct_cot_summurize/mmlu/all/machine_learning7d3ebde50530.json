The more complex the function, the higher the number of iterations required for convergence.\n\nHowever, the complexity of gradient descent can also depend on other factors such as the regularization term used, the type of optimization problem being solved, etc. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact computational complexity without knowing these additional details.\n\nIn summary, while gradient descent is typically considered to have a linear complexity with respect to the number of data points (N), its complexity may vary depending on various factors."
