After the builder had spent $9,000 framing the greenhouse and an additional $1,000 for materials not yet incorporated into the greenhouse, the homeowner wrongfully ordered the builder to stop work. The builder then resold the unused materials that he had already purchased for the greenhouse to another contractor for $1,000. At the time the homeowner stopped the work, it would have cost the builder an additional $5,000 to complete the project. The an additional $5,000 to complete the project. The partially built greenhouse increased the value of the homeowner's property by $3,000. In a suit by the builder against the homeowner, how much is the builder likely to recover?\n\nA. $3,000, the increase in the value of the homeowner's property.\nB. $10,000, the total cost expended by the builder at the time of the breach.\nC. $14,000, the total cost expended by the builder ($10,000) plus the builder's expected profit ($5,000), minus the loss avoided by the resale of the unused materials ($1,000).\nD. $15,000, the contract price ($20,000) minus the costs saved by the breach ($5,000).\n"

However, these amounts do not fully account for the builder's losses or the value of the partially completed greenhouse. The value of the partially completed greenhouse was increased by $3,000 due to its presence on the property. Therefore, the builder is entitled to recover the full value of the partially completed greenhouse, which is $14,000 (the increase in value plus the cost of the materials used).\n\nIt is important to note that this calculation assumes that the builder would have been able to complete the project without the homeowner's breach. If the homeowner had continued with the construction, the builder would have faced additional expenses, such as labor and materials needed to complete the project. Additionally, the builder may have incurred additional liability if the homeowner had caused damage during the construction process."
