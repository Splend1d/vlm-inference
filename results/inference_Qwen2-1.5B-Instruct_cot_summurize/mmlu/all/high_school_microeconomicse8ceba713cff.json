This occurs when the marginal cost (MC) is equal to the price (P), which means that producing additional units of output does not add any more cost than producing fewer units already produced. At this point, the firm has reached its most efficient production level and can continue to produce at the same level without increasing costs. Therefore, the LRAC curve intersects the SRAC curve at the minimum of the SRAC curve."
