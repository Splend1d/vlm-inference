MERS-CoV primarily spreads through contact with the respiratory secretions of infected individuals, particularly those who show severe clinical symptoms. This means that the virus can be transmitted from an infected person's nose or throat to another person through close contact, such as touching the face or sharing personal items like utensils or towels. However, there is no evidence that MERS-CoV can spread through aerosol droplets or bat reservoirs."
