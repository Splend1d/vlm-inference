His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows clear ear canals and intact tympanic membranes; a brown, irregular mass is visualized behind the tympanic membrane. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?\n\nA. Epithelial tissue proliferation\nB. Lingual papillae loss\nC. Middle ear effusion\nD. Midface hypoplasia\n"

This condition occurs when there is an accumulation of fluid or pus in the middle ear space, which can cause pressure to build up and lead to hearing loss. It is important to note that this condition should be evaluated by a healthcare professional as it may require medical treatment."
