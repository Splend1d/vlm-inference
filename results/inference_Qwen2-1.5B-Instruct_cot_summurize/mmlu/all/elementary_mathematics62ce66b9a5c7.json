The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\n\nThis statement is not entirely correct because it implies that the value of the digit in the tenths place (4) is 1/10 the value of the digit in the hundreds place (4). However, this relationship is not necessarily accurate since the tenths place can be larger or smaller than the hundreds place based on the position of the decimal point.\n\nFor example:\n- If the distance were represented as 44.44 meters, then the value of the digit in the tenths place would indeed be 1/10 of the value in the hundreds place.\n- But if the distance were represented as 444.44 meters, then the value of the digit in the tenths place would be 10 times greater than the value in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is **D. The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place**."
