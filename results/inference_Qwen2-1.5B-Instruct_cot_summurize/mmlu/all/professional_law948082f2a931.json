After performing the gardening services, the homeowner paid him $100. The gardener, who speaks only English, contends that the homeowner, who speaks only Japanese, originally agreed to pay him $200 for the work. When the parties entered into their agreement, the gardener was accompanied by his friend, who is now deceased, who spoke both English and Japanese. This jurisdiction has a typical Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the gardener now seeks to testify to the terms of his agreement with the homeowner as communicated to him by his friend. Upon objection by the homeowner's attorney, the gardener's proposed testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.\nB. admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act.\nC. inadmissible, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\nD. inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.\n"

Inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the gardener is seeking to introduce his friend's testimony about the terms of the contract. However, under the Dead Man's Statute, if the friend died before the trial, any statement made by the friend would be inadmissible as evidence of the terms of the contract between the gardener and the homeowner.\n\nTo overcome the prohibition of the Dead Man's Statute, the gardener must establish that he accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract. This means that the gardener must show that he had some way of knowing or proving that his friend was acting on behalf of the homeowner when they were speaking about the contract terms.\n\nIf the gardener can demonstrate that he had knowledge or proof that his friend acted on behalf of the homeowner, then the court may consider the friend's testimony as an admission by a party-opponent, which would allow the testimony to be admitted. Otherwise, the testimony will be inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute."
