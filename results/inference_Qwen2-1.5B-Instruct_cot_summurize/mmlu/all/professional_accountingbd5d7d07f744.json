As a $180000 debit to insurance expense a $120000 credit to prepaid asset and $60000 credit to retained earnings.\n\nExplanation: When a company changes its accounting method from the cash basis to the accrual basis, it affects both the income statement (P&L) and the balance sheet (assets & liabilities). The change in accounting method impacts the income statement by adjusting the expenses recognized over time rather than all at once.\n\nIn this case, Bailey Co. has changed its accounting method from the cash basis to the accrual basis. This means that the insurance expense should be recognized over the life of the policy rather than being paid immediately upon purchase.\n\nTherefore, in the current year, Bailey Co. would record an expense of $180,000 for the insurance policy. To reflect this change on their income statement, they would recognize the full amount of the expense as an expense in the period in which the policy was purchased, January. This would result in a debit to insurance expense of $180,000.\n\nFor the balance sheet, the change in accounting method will affect the assets and liabilities. Since Bailey Co. has chosen the accrual basis, they must recognize the insurance expense over the term of the policy, not immediately. Therefore, they will need to adjust the prepaid asset account to reflect the cost of the policy. The $120,000 represents the cost of the policy, while the $60,000 represents the remaining liability after deducting the prepaid asset. These amounts are then credited to retained earnings, since they represent costs that have been incurred but not yet recognized in revenue or expenses. This adjustment results in a $120,000 credit to prepaid asset and a $60,000 credit to retained earnings. Finally, the $180,000 insurance expense is added back to the prepaid asset to create a net prepaid asset of $30,000, which is then subtracted from the total liability to arrive at a liability of $150,000. This leaves a liability of $120,000, which is the difference between the total liability and the prepaid asset."
