That the actual forelimbs of these mammals do not seem to be optimally arranged is because\n\nA. natural selection has not had sufficient time to create the optimal design in each case, but will do so given enough time.\nB. natural selection operates in ways that are beyond the capability of the human mind to comprehend.\nC. in many cases, phenotype is not merely determined by genotype, but by the environment as well.\nD. natural selection is generally limited to modifying structures that were present in previous generations and in previous species.\n"

This means that natural selection only modifies existing structures, rather than creating new ones from scratch. Therefore, it is not possible for an engineer to design a new structure that is better suited for a mammal's forelimb based solely on their own knowledge or imagination. Instead, they would need to study the anatomy and physiology of different mammals and use that information to make modifications to existing structures."
