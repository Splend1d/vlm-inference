This includes things like music, film, television, literature, fashion, and other forms of art and entertainment that are marketed and sold on a large scale. The idea is that these industries have become so dominant that they now dominate the economy and shape public life in ways that are often not in line with traditional notions of what constitutes good or bad taste or what should be valued. Therefore, the correct answer would be B. the way in which cultural products were bought and sold for profit."
