Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?\n\nA. Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting\nB. Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy\nC. Do endotracheal intubation\nD. Do upper endoscopy\n"

Do endotracheal intubation\n\nEndotracheal intubation can help ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation while also facilitating access to the respiratory system for further evaluation or intervention. It may be necessary if the patient is not responding adequately to intravenous fluids or other interventions. However, it should only be considered as a last resort after considering all other potential causes of the symptoms and ensuring that other treatments have been tried first."
