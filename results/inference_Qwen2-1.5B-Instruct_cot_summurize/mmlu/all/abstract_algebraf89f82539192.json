                    "text": "The statement about linear independence within a basis can be true or false depending on the specific vector space being considered. \n\nFor example, consider the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with standard basis $\\{e_1,e_2,e_3\\}$ (where $e_1=(1,0,0)$, $e_2=(0,1,0)$, and $e_3=(0,0,1)$). The vectors $e_1$ and $e_2$ are linearly independent, but they do not span $\\mathbb{R}^3$. So, while $e_1$ and $e_2$ are linearly independent, they are not contained in a basis.\n\nOn the other hand, if we consider the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^4$ with standard basis $\\{e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4\\}$ (where $e_1=(1,0,0,0)$, $e_2=(0,1,0,0)$, $e_3=(0,0,1,0)$, and $e_4=(0,0,0,1)$), then it's easy to see that any two vectors from this basis must be linearly dependent because their coordinates sum up to zero, so they cannot span $\\mathbb{R}^4$ as a vector space.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2 is also false because the definition of a basis states that it contains a spanning set, which means that every element of the vector space can be written as a linear combination of the elements of the basis. However, if you have two different bases for the same vector space, there may exist some vectors that are only linearly dependent between them. For instance, if you take two different bases for $\\mathbb{R}^n$, you will find that some vectors are only linearly dependent between them, making the number of vectors in one basis smaller than the other.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. False, False"
