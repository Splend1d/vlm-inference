However, if someone were to intentionally harm themselves or others while skateboarding, that would be considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves feeding a kitten with wet cat food, which is not inherently harmful but may lead to digestive issues if not done correctly. Again, this action could potentially cause harm if it is done recklessly or without proper care for the kitten's health."
