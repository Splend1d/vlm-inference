The speed of sound and temperature are not needed for this calculation as they do not affect the volume of air consumed directly. We will also ignore any variation in oxygen uptake over time due to changes in metabolism or other factors since these would not significantly change the amount of air consumed.\n\n\\[ \\text{Energy expenditure} = 15,000 \\, \\text{mL} \\times 29.9 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 343 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Energy expenditure} = 15,000 \\, \\text{mL} \\times 29.9 \\times 343 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 1 \\, \\text{s}^{-2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Energy expenditure} = 798,300,000 \\, \\text{J/mol} \\]\n\nConverting to kilojoules gives:\n\n\\[ \\text{Energy expenditure} = 798,300,000 \\, \\text{J/mol} \\div 4.184 \\, \\text{kJ/J} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Energy expenditure} = 184,500,000 \\, \\text{kJ/mol} \\]\n\nTherefore, the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake of 3.0 L/min for 5 minutes of exercise results in an estimated energy expenditure of approximately 184,500,000 kJ. This corresponds to option D. 500 kJ."
