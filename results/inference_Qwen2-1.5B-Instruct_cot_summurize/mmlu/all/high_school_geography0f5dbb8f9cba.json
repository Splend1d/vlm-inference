The fall of the Soviet Union and the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe led to a period of political instability, economic uncertainty, and ethnic conflict. This was characterized by civil wars, revolutions, and conflicts between different ethnic groups. The end of the Cold War also paved the way for the rise of new authoritarian regimes in some parts of Eastern Europe, which further fueled tensions and conflict. Therefore, it was the end of the Cold War that greatly destabilized Eastern Europe and led to ethnic conflict."
