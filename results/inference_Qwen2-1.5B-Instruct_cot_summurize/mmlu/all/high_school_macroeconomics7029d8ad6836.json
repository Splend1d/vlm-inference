Encourage borrowing by depository institutions so that the money supply may expand.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve (FED) lowers the discount rate, it signals to depository institutions that they can borrow funds at a lower cost. This means that depository institutions will have more money available to lend out, which can stimulate economic growth and increase the money supply. The FED's goal is to promote economic stability and growth, and lowering the discount rate is one way to do this."
