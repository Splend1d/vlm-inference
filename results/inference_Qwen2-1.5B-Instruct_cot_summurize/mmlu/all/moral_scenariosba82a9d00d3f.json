However, this action is not illegal and can be forgiven if the relationship between the parties is good and both parties agree that it was acceptable.\n\nScenario 2 involves pressuring someone else into doing something against their will, which is also considered morally wrong. This action can have serious consequences, including physical harm or emotional trauma, so it is not something that should be done lightly. \n\nTherefore, neither scenario is entirely right or completely wrong, but one is more morally questionable than the other."
