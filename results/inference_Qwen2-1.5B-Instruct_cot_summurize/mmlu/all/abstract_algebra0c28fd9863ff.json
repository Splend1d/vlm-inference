Since the orders of any two distinct prime factors must be coprime (they have no common divisors other than 1), and the order of 7 is 7, it follows that every group of order 42 can indeed have a normal subgroup of order 7. This statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: \"Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.\"\n\nGiven the same prime factorization of 42 as before, this statement is also true because:\n\n- The order of 7 in a group of order 42 would allow for exactly one subgroup of order 7.\n- The order of 8 divides 42, so there must exist at least one subgroup of order 8.\n- However, since the only divisor of 42 that is greater than 7 is 8 itself, the existence of a normal subgroup of order 8 means that every subgroup of order 8 is also normal, making the statement true.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is A. True, True."
