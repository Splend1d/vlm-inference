Thousands of Americans became incensed and objected to this type of unsolicited advertising. A group of people started a nationwide campaign against the use of condoms. This new organization also started a strong lobbying movement to have Congress pass legislation prohibiting the distribution of condoms by using the U. S. postal system. Assume that the lobbying effort was successful, and Congress passed a law prohibiting any unsolicited advertising for condoms to be distributed through the U. S. postal system. The foundation has challenged the constitutionality of this federal statute. The best argument against the constitutionality of this law is which of the following?\n\nA. The statute is invalid because it violates the First Amendment protection of commercial free speech.\nB. The statute is invalid because it unduly burdens interstate commerce.\nC. The statute is invalid because it violates the Fifth Amendment right of privacy.\nD. The statute is invalid because it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The First Amendment protects individuals' rights to engage in lawful commercial activities such as distributing products or services without interference.\n\nTherefore, if the statute were upheld, it would likely be seen as limiting the freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment, particularly where the government seeks to restrict speech on matters of public concern, such as health information. This could potentially lead to a challenge based on the First Amendment."
