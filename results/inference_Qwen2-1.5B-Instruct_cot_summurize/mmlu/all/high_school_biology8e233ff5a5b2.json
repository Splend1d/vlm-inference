However, if there are large changes in population size or genetic drift, the allele frequency can fluctuate over time. In this case, we don't have enough information about the specific conditions under which the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (e.g., whether the population is small, has low mutation rates, etc.) to accurately predict how the allele frequency will change after 500 years."
