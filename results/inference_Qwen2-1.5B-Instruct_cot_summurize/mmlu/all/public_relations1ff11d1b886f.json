However, the most specific answer would depend on the context and purpose of the research being conducted. For example, if the goal is to analyze existing data or information about a particular topic, then secondary research may be appropriate. If the goal is to gather new data through surveys or observations, then primary research would be more appropriate. Ultimately, the type of research that involves secondary research will depend on the specific needs and goals of the researcher or organization conducting the study."
