In Europe, many cities have a central business district (CBD) that serves as the heart of the city and is surrounded by a network of roads and streets that connect it to other parts of the city. These roads often run in a grid pattern or are arranged in a circular shape around the CBD, creating a residential spine that extends outward from the center of the city. This type of urban layout is characteristic of European cities such as Paris, London, and Berlin."
