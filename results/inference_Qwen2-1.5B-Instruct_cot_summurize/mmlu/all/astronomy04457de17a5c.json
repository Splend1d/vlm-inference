A molten metallic core: The core of a terrestrial planet must be composed primarily of iron or other heavy metals, as these materials can generate significant magnetic fields.\n\n2. A stable atmospheric environment: A terrestrial planet must have an atmosphere that is stable enough to prevent it from collapsing in on itself due to gravitational forces. This requires that the planet's atmosphere has a high pressure and low temperature, which helps to keep the core hot and stable.\n\n3. A relatively slow rotation rate: While faster rotation rates can increase the amount of time for magnetic field generation, they also increase the likelihood of the planet being destroyed by tidal forces. Therefore, a relatively slow rotation rate is preferred for terrestrial planets.\n\n4. An appropriate mass-to-radius ratio: Terrestrial planets must have a mass-to-radius ratio between 0.5 and 1.0 to form stable planetary orbits around their stars. This allows them to retain a solid surface while still allowing their cores to expand into magma oceans."
