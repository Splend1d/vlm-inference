Auditor suspects that management fraud has occurred during the year.\n\nStratification refers to dividing a population into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as age or income level, in order to more accurately assess the risks and outcomes of the audit procedures. In this case, the auditor is considering whether there was management fraud during the year, which suggests that they may want to stratify the population to identify any potential fraudulent activities within the company. \n\nOption B (desired assessed level of control risk being less than the prior year) does not necessarily require stratification because it pertains to assessing the overall risk of misstatement rather than identifying specific areas where fraud might occur. Option C (technique to be used is attribute sampling) also does not require stratification because attribute sampling involves selecting items from the population based on their attributes, without regard to group membership. \n\nOption D (giving greater representation to large recorded amounts) may involve stratifying the population to ensure that larger transactions are included in the sample, but this is not necessarily required by the concept of stratification."
