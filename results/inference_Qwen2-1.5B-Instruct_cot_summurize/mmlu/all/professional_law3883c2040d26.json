The vintner sold the vineyard to a husband and wife as tenants in common, who did not record the warranty deed by which the vintner conveyed the vineyard to them. The husband subsequently sold and conveyed his undivided one-half interest in the vineyard to a friend. The friend promptly recorded his deed. Some time later, the vintner purported to convey the vineyard to a farmer, for valuable consideration. The farmer, who had no actual knowledge of any previous conveyances of the vineyard, recorded her deed. The jurisdiction maintains alphabetical grantor and grantee indices. The applicable recording statute provides, \"Every conveyance of real property is void as against any subsequent purchaser of the same property (or any part thereof) in good faith and for a valuable consideration, whose conveyance is first duly recorded. \" None of the various grantees of the vineyard has entered into possession in a manner that would put anyone on inquiry notice as to their interest therein. Who owns the vineyard?\n\nA. The friend, because he recorded his deed before the farmer recorded.\nB. The friend and the wife, because the friend's deed would put the farmer on inquiry notice as to the wife's interest in the vineyard.\nC. The farmer, because the husband \u0080\u0094friend deed is outside the farmer's chain of title.\nD. The friend and the farmer, as tenants in common.\n"

The farmer, because the husband and wife's deed is outside the farmer's chain of title.\n\nExplanation: \n- The vintner originally owned the vineyard in fee simple absolute.\n- She sold it to the husband and wife, who were tenants in common.\n- The husband then sold his undivided one-half interest to his friend.\n- The friend recorded his deed within 12 months of the sale to the husband and wife.\n- The farmer purchased the husband's undivided one-half interest from his friend after 6 months of the sale to the husband and wife.\n- The farmer recorded his deed within 12 months of purchasing the undivided one-half interest from his friend.\n\nThe only person who has recorded a valid deed conveying an interest in the vineyard is the friend. Therefore, the friend is now the owner of the vineyard. The other options do not provide sufficient evidence to establish ownership based on recording or other legal procedures."
