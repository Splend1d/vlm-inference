If the fulcrum were moved away from the boy, the force acting on the girl (and thus the seesaw) would increase, making the boy more likely to tip over. Similarly, if the fulcrum were moved closer to the boy, the force acting on the girl would decrease, making the boy less likely to tip over. Therefore, moving the fulcrum would only balance the see-saw if the forces acting on both girls were equal at all times, which is not guaranteed."
