Knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.\n\nSocrates argues that there are certain things that we cannot know with certainty, such as the essence or nature of justice. However, this does not mean that we cannot have any knowledge about these things. In fact, by acknowledging our ignorance, we can still make rational judgments based on available information and evidence.\n\nFurthermore, Socrates' method of questioning others about their beliefs and ideas is not necessarily unjustified. It may lead us to recognize our own ignorance and seek out new knowledge, rather than dismissing it outright. Ultimately, the question of whether or not knowledge of the essences of things is possible depends on one's philosophical perspective and understanding of the nature of knowledge. Some philosophers argue that knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, while others believe that it is possible through reflection and inquiry."
