The following conveyances, each by a general warranty deed, take place in the order listed: An artist conveys to a bartender; the developer conveys to the artist; the artist conveys to a counselor; the bartender conveys to a dentist; the counselor conveys to an engineer. No deed was recorded until after the artist-to- counselor deed was executed and then before the execution of any other deed, the order of recording was as follows: developer to artist; artist to bartender; artist to counselor. The bartender-to-dentist deed and counselor-to- engineer deed were each recorded immediately after their respective executions.

Since the artist is now the new owner, they can transfer ownership to the counselor. However, since the artist transferred ownership to the bartender first, the bartender cannot transfer ownership to the counselor directly. Therefore, the counselor must acquire ownership through the bartender's deed from the developer. \n\nSince the bartender's deed was recorded last, they are the owners of the land. As the owner, they have the right to transfer ownership to others, including the engineer. Therefore, the owner of the parcel of land in a notice jurisdiction is the counselor."
