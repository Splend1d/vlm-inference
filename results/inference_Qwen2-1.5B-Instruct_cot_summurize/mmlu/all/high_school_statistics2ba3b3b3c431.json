She plans a middle school experiment in which an SRS of 30 eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours of reading per week, an SRS of 30 seventh graders will be assigned two extra hours of reading per week, and an SRS of 30 sixth graders with no extra assigned reading will be a control group. After one school year, the mean GPAs from each group will be compared. Is this a good experimental design?\n\nA. Yes.\nB. No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\nC. No, because without blinding, there is a strong chance of a placebo effect.\nD. No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\n"

No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n- A. Yes: This option suggests that the design would prove causality between reading and GPA, which is not supported by the information provided.\n\n- C. No, because there is a strong chance of a placebo effect: This option assumes that the extra reading sessions could have a placebo effect on student performance, but the original study does not provide evidence to support such a claim.\n\n- D. No, because grade level is a lurking variable: This option argues that grade level should not be considered as a factor when evaluating the effectiveness of the extra reading sessions, but the original study does not mention any differences in reading ability among the three groups."
