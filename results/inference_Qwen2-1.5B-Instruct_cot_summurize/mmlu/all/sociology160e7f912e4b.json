Therefore, option A is correct. \n\nRegarding B, they did not specifically argue that racism in schools undermined the move towards equality of opportunity for children from ethnic minorities. Instead, they suggested that social inequality played a role in limiting educational opportunities for children from minority groups.\n\nAs for C, while school character can play a role in determining educational success, it cannot be solely credited with explaining all factors contributing to educational outcomes. Other factors such as access to resources, teacher quality, and family support also play important roles.\n\nOption D suggests that gender differences in educational achievement could be explained by inequalities of class rather than ethnic background. However, this does not fully capture the complexity of the issue. It's true that some studies have found gender differences in academic performance, but these findings often involve complex interplay between various factors like socioeconomic status, access to resources, and individual differences. Gender differences in education are influenced by multiple factors including cultural norms, historical context, and socio-economic conditions. So, option D might be partially accurate, but it doesn't capture the full picture of the issue."
