Financial policies advocated by the World Bank and IMF were readily adopted by developing countries that sought to bring their economic development into line with wealthier nations. The IFIs focus has been on achieving human security and the promotion of development at a societal level.\nB. Through the implementation of specific financial policies adopted at the bequest of global financial institutions, many developing countries have gained economic prosperity and the correlating levels of human security.\nC. The World Bank and IMF tend to operate in an economic arena that includes only major financial institutions and wealthy states; coupled with a respect for sovereignty, the scope of such institutions does not reach to interference in national politics.\nD. IFIs identified the economic failings of developing countries as being the result of political problems. Thus, IFIs adopted an approach that involved political and economic restructuring of these states, coercing governments into the adoption of specific financial policies designed to promote debt repayment and economic development.\n"

Thus, IFIs adopted an approach that involved political and economic restructuring of these states, coercing governments into the adoption of specific financial policies designed to promote debt repayment and economic development.\n\nThe World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were established after World War II to provide emergency assistance to countries facing economic crises and to help them achieve economic stability and growth. They have since evolved into global institutions that work towards poverty reduction, sustainable development, and reducing inequality around the world. \n\nWhile they have played a significant role in promoting economic development and helping poor countries manage their economies, there have also been criticisms of their policies and practices. Some argue that they can sometimes become too focused on macroeconomic objectives and overlook the needs of individual citizens and communities. Others criticize their role in imposing austerity measures or engaging in debt relief without adequate safeguards to protect vulnerable populations. Overall, while the IFIs have had some success in promoting economic development, they face ongoing debates about how best to support poorer countries."
