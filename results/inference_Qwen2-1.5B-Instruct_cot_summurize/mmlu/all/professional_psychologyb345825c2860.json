Cognitive dissonance theory predicts that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment, while self-perception theory predicts that participants in the $20.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment.\nB.

Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $20.00 condition.\nD.

In the case of the experiment, if the participant believes that the experiment is dull but receives $1.00 instead of $20.00, they may feel uncomfortable because they have contradicted themselves by receiving less money than they thought the experiment was worth. This discomfort could lead them to change their belief about the value of the experiment, even though it is actually not as interesting as they originally believed.\n\nSelf-perception theory suggests that our perception of ourselves is influenced by how we perceive others' perceptions of us. In this scenario, the participant may believe that they are being dishonest by telling others that the experiment is interesting when it is not, so they may try to make up for this perceived dishonesty by giving the other person more money. However, the participant's actual behavior may still be consistent with their belief that the experiment is boring, so they may still receive the same level of satisfaction from the experiment as they would have received had they told the truth.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory both predict that participants in the $1.00 condition will subsequently report greater liking for the dull experiment than will those in the $20.00 condition."
