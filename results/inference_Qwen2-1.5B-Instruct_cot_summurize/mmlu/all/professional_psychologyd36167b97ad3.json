This is because therapy can help individuals overcome these underlying issues and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\nB. Dependency: Dependency on therapy can sometimes lead to a negative outcome, as it may indicate that the individual is not taking responsibility for their own recovery.\nC. Strong reinforcement of symptoms: If an individual's therapist reinforces their symptoms, this can create a cycle of negative behavior and discourage progress.\nD. Misery: While some individuals may find comfort in expressing their feelings through therapy, others may experience relief from the pain and discomfort they feel before therapy begins. However, if the focus remains on suffering rather than healing, it can be detrimental to the therapeutic process."
