According to John Locke's theory of social contract, when people agree to form a society and establish a government, they enter into a contractual agreement with each other. In this agreement, individuals give up some of their rights in exchange for protection from harm and the opportunity to participate in the governance of the state. One of the key principles of the social contract is that individuals have the right to live without fear and oppression, but they also have the duty to obey the laws and regulations established by the government. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the majority to determine the course of action for the society as a whole."
