It also contributes to habitat destruction and biodiversity loss, which can have long-term negative impacts on ecosystems and human societies. Therefore, option B, \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" is incorrect. \n\nIn contrast, scenario 1 does not involve any clear violation of moral standards, as locking the front door before leaving is a reasonable precautionary measure to ensure the safety and security of the property. Additionally, making leather from endangered species may be seen as unethical by some people due to concerns about animal welfare and environmental impact, but it is still considered legal in many countries where it is practiced. Therefore, option C, \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" is correct."
