In an oligopoly, there are few sellers and buyers who can easily enter or exit the market due to high barriers to entry and exit. This means that firms cannot set prices above marginal cost, which results in price-taking behavior. Therefore, the industry will tend to operate at its marginal cost, resulting in normal profits in the long run. Collusive behavior (such as price fixing) is not common in oligopolies because it requires collusion among many firms, which is difficult to achieve in a competitive market. Additionally, barriers to entry and exit make it difficult for new firms to enter the market and compete with existing firms, further reinforcing price-taking behavior."
