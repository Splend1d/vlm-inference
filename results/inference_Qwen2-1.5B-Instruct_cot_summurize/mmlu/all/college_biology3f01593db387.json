Air does not provide more physical support than water, it can actually exert less pressure on an object and therefore offer less resistance to motion.\n2. Air contains oxygen (O2) in concentrations that are slightly lower than those found in human blood, but this difference is not significant enough to cause any noticeable differences in breathing or metabolism.\n3. Air offers no resistance to motion in general, unless there is a wind blowing against the object being moved.\n4. Air has low thermal inertia, meaning it tends to change temperature quickly in response to changes in its surroundings. This property is useful for maintaining temperatures within living organisms, but it is not relevant to comparing air and water."
