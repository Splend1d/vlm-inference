Christianity and Buddhism.\n\nUniversalizing religions aim to spread their beliefs and practices to other cultures, while also integrating with existing cultural traditions. Christianity has had a significant impact on many cultures around the world through its missionary efforts and by adapting its teachings to fit local contexts. Buddhism, on the other hand, has also been influential in spreading its philosophy and practice to different parts of the world, often through translation of texts and the establishment of Buddhist monasteries and centers of study. Both religions have helped to create new forms of spirituality and belief systems that have become part of global culture."
