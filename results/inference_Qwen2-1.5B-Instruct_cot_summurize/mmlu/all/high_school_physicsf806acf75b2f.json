Adjust the length of a pipe placed near the string so that resonances are heard. Measure the difference between the pipe lengths for consecutive resonances; this is half the wavelength.\n\nThis method allows you to measure the wavelength accurately because the wavelength of a sound wave is directly proportional to the distance between two adjacent nodes or antinodes, which can be measured using the pipe. By adjusting the length of the pipe and hearing the resonance at each point, you can calculate the wavelength by dividing the change in pipe length by 2 (since there are two nodes/antinodes per unit length)."
