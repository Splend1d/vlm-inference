H2O exchanges with CO2 at equal rates.\n\nUnder normal daytime environmental conditions, stomata in plants open up, allowing for gas exchange between the inside of the leaf (where water is present) and the outside air (which contains oxygen and carbon dioxide). This process involves the diffusion of gases across the surface of the stomata, which is why H2O and CO2 exchange occur at similar rates within the leaf. The rate of diffusion depends on factors like the concentration difference between the interior of the leaf and the external atmosphere, as well as the size and shape of the stomatal pores."
