Since the question asks for the probability of rolling a \"three,\" we need to calculate the fraction of the total possible outcomes that result in a three.\n\nSince there are only two favorable outcomes (rolling a one or a three) out of six possible outcomes, the probability of rolling a three is:\n\n$$\\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}.$$\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $\\frac{1}{3}$"
