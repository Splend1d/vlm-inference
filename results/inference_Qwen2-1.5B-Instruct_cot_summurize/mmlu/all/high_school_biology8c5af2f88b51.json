The resulting pre-mRNA is then processed further into mature mRNA by additional enzymes like spliceosomes or endoproteases. During this process, both a 5\u2032 cap (a small sequence at the beginning of the mRNA) and a poly-A tail (a long sequence attached to the 3\u2032 end of the mRNA) are often added.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most accurate description of what happens to the preRNA during RNA processing."
