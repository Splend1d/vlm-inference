Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n\nThis diagnosis is supported by the presence of symptoms such as a pounding heart, poor sleep, and a generalized feeling of restlessness, which are characteristic of GAD. Additionally, the patient's worry about adapting to increased responsibilities at work and their use of sick leave indicate persistent anxiety rather than acute stress. \n\nIt is important to note that while the patient may be experiencing some of the typical symptoms of GAD (such as excessive worry, fearfulness, or restlessness), they also have other contributing factors like relocation and the onset of symptoms over a relatively short period of time. It would be beneficial for the healthcare provider to consider these additional factors when making a diagnosis."
