The Supreme Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and federal laws, and it has the power to review decisions made by lower courts and state governments. It also plays an important role in shaping public policy through its rulings on constitutional issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and gun control. While the court may sometimes decide whether to hear certain cases, it ultimately makes decisions based on a majority vote among its nine justices."
