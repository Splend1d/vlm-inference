Therefore, if there exists at least one non-zero vector that cannot be expressed as such a linear combination, they must be linearly independent.\n\nStatement 2: If $V = \\text{span}(v_1, ..., v_k)$ and ${v_1, ..., v_k}$ are linearly independent, then $\\dim(V) = k$.\nThis statement is also true. Since the set of vectors ${v_1, ..., v_k}$ is linearly independent, it means that no single vector in this set can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. This implies that the set spans all of $\\mathbb{R}^k$, which means that the dimension of the space spanned by these vectors is exactly $k$."
