The homeowner then gives an investor a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the investor to the homeowner in the amount of $80,000. The friend then records his mortgage. The homeowner then gives a bank a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the bank to the homeowner in the amount of $50,000. The investor then records. The bank then records. The homeowner lost his job and was unable to pay the mortgages on the property.

In this case, the friend's mortgage was recorded before the other mortgages, so it has priority over the others. Therefore, the friend should receive the full amount of the mortgage, which is $80,000.0.\n\nThe other mortgages, including the ones given by the homeowner to the investor and the bank, are not considered valid since they were not recorded. As a result, the investor would only be entitled to half of the mortgage (which is $40,000) and the bank would be entitled to nothing."
