The other proteins listed - NPC1L1, LDL receptor, and ABCG5/ABCG8 - all play important roles in cholesterol metabolism. NPC1L1 is involved in cholesterol esterification, while LDL receptor binds to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and regulates its clearance from the blood. ABCG5/ABCG8 are both involved in bile acid synthesis and secretion, respectively."
