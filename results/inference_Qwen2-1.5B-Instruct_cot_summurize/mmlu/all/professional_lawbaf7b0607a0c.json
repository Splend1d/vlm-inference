Yes, for the deaths of both the manager and the clerk.\n\nFelony murder occurs when a person commits a felony (such as robbery) that results in the death of another person during the commission of the felony. In this case, the man entered the store with a gun and intended to rob it, which qualifies as a felony under California law. However, he failed to activate the safety lock, which would have prevented the gun from firing. As a result, the man's actions were not only criminal, but they also led to the death of the store manager.\n\nAdditionally, the fear caused by the man's behavior ultimately resulted in the death of the clerk. While the man may not have been directly responsible for the death of the clerk, his actions were still part of the same scheme to commit the felony of robbery. Therefore, the man can be charged with felony murder for the death of the clerk.\n\nIt is important to note that while the man committed a crime that resulted in the death of someone else, he did not commit the specific act that caused the death of the clerk. Therefore, even though he is guilty of felony murder, he cannot be held criminally liable for the death of the clerk."
