Avoid observer bias and sampling variation\n\nA double-blind or double-masked study aims to reduce bias in the study by ensuring that neither the participants nor the researchers know who they are being tested against, which helps to eliminate biases due to observer bias and sampling variation. This type of study allows for more accurate and reliable results by reducing confounding factors that could otherwise affect the outcome of the study."
