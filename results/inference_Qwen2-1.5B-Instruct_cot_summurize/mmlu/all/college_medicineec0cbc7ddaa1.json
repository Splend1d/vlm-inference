In fact, muscle lactate accumulation starts as soon as muscle cells begin to use glucose for energy during intense exercise, and it can continue even after the muscles have started to use oxygen for energy. The amount of lactate produced also depends on factors such as the intensity of the exercise, duration of the exercise, and the individual's fitness level. Therefore, all of the other statements are true."
