This is because the newspaper must be authenticated before it can be offered as evidence. The certification must be provided by an employee of the newspaper who can attest to the newspaper's authenticity and the accuracy of the information contained within it. Without this certification, the newspaper cannot be considered authentic and therefore cannot be used as evidence."
