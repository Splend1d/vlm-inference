The complementary color is the color opposite to another color on the color wheel, which means it has the same hue but different saturation levels and luminance values. In this case, blue and cyan have the same hue (blue) but differ in saturation level and luminance value, making them complementary colors. Yellow, magenta, and white are not complementary colors because they all share the same hue with blue."
