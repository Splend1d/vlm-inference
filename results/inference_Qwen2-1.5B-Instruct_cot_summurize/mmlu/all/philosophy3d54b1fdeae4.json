It involves treating individuals equally according to their actions and contributions to society, rather than based on their social status or wealth.\n\nIn Ross's view, justice is not just about following laws or adhering to contracts and promises; it also includes considering the consequences of one's actions on others and ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. This means that justice should not be limited to punishment for criminal behavior but also extends to addressing social inequalities and promoting equality for all members of society.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C: when the distribution of happiness is in accordance with merit. Justice is about promoting fair and equitable outcomes for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances."
