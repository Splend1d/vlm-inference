An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is a breach of peace and committed in arresting party's presence.\n\nIn this situation, an officer cannot make an arrest based on a violation of the arrestee's right to peaceably assemble or meet with others, as this would constitute a breach of peace. However, if the arrestee commits another crime during the arrest, such as assault or battery, then the arrestee can be charged with a different offense than the original arrest."
