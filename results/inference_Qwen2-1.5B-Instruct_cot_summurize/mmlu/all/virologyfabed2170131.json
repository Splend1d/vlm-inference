This process involves snatching lipids and other components from the host cell's membrane. The viral genome encodes specific sequences that guide the viral protein synthesis necessary for forming the capsid. Assembly can also involve random interactions between viral and cellular proteins, but this is not as crucial as the snatching of cellular components mentioned above."
