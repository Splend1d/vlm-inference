Kangaroo rats are known for their ability to conserve water by concentrating urine, and this is due in part to the fact that their kidneys have long loops of Henle that allow them to concentrate urine more effectively than humans do. This is because the loops of Henle are responsible for reabsorbing salt and other solutes from the filtrate (the fluid produced by the kidneys) before it reaches the collecting ducts. By lengthening these loops, kangaroo rats can increase the amount of salt and other solutes they retain in their urine, allowing them to excrete large amounts of water while still maintaining adequate hydration."
