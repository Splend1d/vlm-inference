Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a \"unique German path.\" And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the \"normal path.\"\nHeinrich August Winkler, Germany: The Long Road West, Volume 1, 2006\nFrom this passage, one may infer that\n\nA. the notion of a unique German path in history has never been the prevailing public opinion in Germany\nB. Winkler advocates a Marxist view of German history\nC. there has been a longstanding debate in Germany about the existence of a unique German path in history\nD. the question of a unique German path in history has been answered once and for all\n"
