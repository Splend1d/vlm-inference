The purchase of bonds\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) can use monetary policy tools such as adjusting interest rates, buying or selling bonds, and changing reserve requirements to help address economic downturns. In a recession, the Fed may choose to lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, which can stimulate economic growth. They could also buy bonds to inject liquidity into the financial system and prevent banks from tightening credit, which would further discourage lending and investment.\n\nOption A (decrease in taxes), B (increase in government spending), and C (increase in the discount rate) are not typically used to counter a recession by the Fed. Decreasing taxes can lead to higher spending and consumption but is not an effective tool for stimulating economic activity during a recession. Increasing government spending without adequate fiscal discipline can result in budget deficits that harm future generations. And increasing the discount rate (the interest rate at which the Fed lends money to commercial banks) can cause a recession by making it more expensive for banks to borrow money, reducing lending and investment."
