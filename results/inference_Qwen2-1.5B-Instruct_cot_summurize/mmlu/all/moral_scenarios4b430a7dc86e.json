In scenario 1, the character was trying to make the zoo fundraiser more interesting by letting out the animals without permission, but it's important to note that this action is illegal and could cause harm to the animals and other people present. Therefore, while the character may have been motivated by good intentions, their actions were still clearly morally wrong.\nIn scenario 2, the character did not do anything illegal or harmful. Copying someone else's work without permission is considered plagiarism, but it is not necessarily morally wrong if done with good intent and for a good reason. However, since the character did not actually plagiarize, they would be considered not wrong in this case."
