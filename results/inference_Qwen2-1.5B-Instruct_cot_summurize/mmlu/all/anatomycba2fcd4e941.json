The vagus nerve is the largest cranial nerve and is responsible for transmitting sensory and motor signals to the digestive, respiratory, and parasympathetic nervous systems. \n\nThe internal laryngeal nerve is the afferent limb of the gag reflex, which is a defensive response to foreign objects or irritants in the mouth or throat. When a foreign object is ingested, the gag reflex causes the muscles in the neck to contract, resulting in a sensation of choking and an urge to spit out the object. This reflex helps protect the respiratory system from injury caused by foreign objects in the mouth or throat."
