Reserving a hotel room by e-mailing a credit card number to a hotel\n\nThis activity poses the greatest personal cybersecurity risk because it involves sharing sensitive financial information, such as a credit card number, over an unsecured email connection. This can make the information vulnerable to interception and theft by cybercriminals who may have access to the email server or other compromised systems. It is important to use strong, unique passwords for each online account and to avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources."
