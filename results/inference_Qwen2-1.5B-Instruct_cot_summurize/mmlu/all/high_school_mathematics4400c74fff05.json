Therefore, $x^2 > 0$, which implies $x \\neq 0$. So, the domain of $h(x)$ is $(-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the intervals between these two points to determine the width of the domain.\n\nFrom $-\\infty$ to 0: This interval does not contribute to the domain because it is empty.\nFrom 0 to $\\infty$: This interval contributes to the domain because it contains all positive and negative values of $x$ except for 0.\n\nTherefore, the domain of $h(x)$ is the union of the intervals from $-\\infty$ to 0 and from 0 to $\\infty$. This means the domain is an interval of length 1.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(A) 7}}$."
