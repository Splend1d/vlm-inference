The registrar decides to take a random sample of 150 students from the current directory of students and determine the number of students with the correct addresses on record. He then uses this information to construct a 95 percent confidence interval. Which of the following statements must be true?\n\nA. The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\nB. Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.\nC.

The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.\n\nThis statement is true because when constructing a 95% confidence interval, we aim to estimate the population parameter (in this case, the proportion of students with the correct address) with a margin of error equal to 2 standard errors away from the point estimate. This means that the confidence interval should contain the true population proportion with 95% confidence, which implies that it will include the true value most of the time. So, if the sample proportion is within the confidence interval, it indicates that the true proportion is also likely to be within the confidence interval, as long as the sample size is large enough to ensure statistical significance."
