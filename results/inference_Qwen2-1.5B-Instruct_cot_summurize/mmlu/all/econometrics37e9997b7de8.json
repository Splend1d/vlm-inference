A logarithmic functional form can help stabilize the variance of the residuals if they are highly skewed or have heavy tails. Adding lags of the variables on the right-hand side of the regression model can also help by accounting for potential serial correlation between the errors. Estimating the model in first-differenced form may also help to reduce heteroskedasticity, which is another common cause of residual non-normality. Removing large outliers from the data can improve the homogeneity of the residuals but does not necessarily fix the underlying issue of residual non-normality."
