I, II, and IV.\n\nThis is because in a height-balanced binary search tree (a type of AVL tree), the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node can be at most 1. This means that the average case for searching an element in the tree is also log(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Additionally, the worst-case scenario for searching an element in the tree is O(h) where h is the height of the tree, which is also log(n). Finally, the best-case scenario occurs when the tree is balanced, which happens with probability 1/n^2, so the expected search time is proportional to log(n).\n\nTherefore, all four statements are true of such a tree."
