Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nNonsampling risk refers to the inherent uncertainties or limitations associated with the use of statistical sampling methods. It occurs when the auditor's selection process is flawed, leading to incorrect conclusions based on the sample data rather than the entire population. This risk cannot be eliminated entirely through proper planning and execution of the sampling procedure."
