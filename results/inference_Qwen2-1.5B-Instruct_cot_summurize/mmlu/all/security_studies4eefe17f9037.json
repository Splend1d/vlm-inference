It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations.\nB. Social constructivists reject the foundations of realism upon which military security studies are based; in rejecting the empirical basis of security studies, the social constructivist approach becomes inadequate in its attempts to formulate military security theory.\nC. Social constructivism is based on philosophical ideas that directly contradict the foundations of military-centred theory. The tendency is for social constructivists to dismiss military endeavours as clumsy and as being detrimental to human security.\nD. In order to study military security, analysts must adopt a realist lens. However, this can later be combined with other approaches, including social constructivism, in order to consider the security of different referent objects such as the environment or human security.\n"

Military security is often seen as a manifestation of these social constructs, and social constructivists argue that it is important to take into account the cultural and social factors that influence military decision-making and outcomes. By adopting a social constructivist perspective, analysts can gain a deeper understanding of how military security is shaped by societal norms, values, and beliefs. This can help inform policy decisions and improve the effectiveness of military operations."
