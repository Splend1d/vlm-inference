When cortisol levels rise during a stressful event, it signals the hypothalamus to reduce the release of CRF ( Corticotropin-releasing hormone ). This inhibits further release of CRF and cortisol from the pituitary gland, leading to the suppression of the stress response. \n\nOption A (Constriction of blood flow to the adrenal gland) would also be part of the stress response but not specifically related to the negative feedback loop of cortisol.\n\nOption B (Exhaustion of the body's store of CRF) does not directly affect cortisol levels or the negative feedback loop.\n\nOption D (Release of CRF-inhibitory factor) would lead to an increase in CRF production, increasing the stress response rather than suppressing it."
