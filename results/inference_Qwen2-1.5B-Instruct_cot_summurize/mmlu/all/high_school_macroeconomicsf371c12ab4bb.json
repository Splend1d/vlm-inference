The curve shows that as the government attempts to lower unemployment by increasing monetary policy (e.g., lowering interest rates), it can lead to higher inflation. Conversely, if the government tries to lower inflation by reducing monetary policy, it may lead to higher unemployment. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Inflation and Unemployment."
