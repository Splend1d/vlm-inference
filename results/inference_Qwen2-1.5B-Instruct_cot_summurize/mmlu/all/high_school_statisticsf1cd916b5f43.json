A completely randomized design with nine treatment groups\n\nThis means that every combination of temperature level, type of pan, and oven type will be tested exactly once, resulting in a total of 9 treatment groups. This allows for each treatment group to receive an equal number of replicates, which is important for statistical power and validity."
