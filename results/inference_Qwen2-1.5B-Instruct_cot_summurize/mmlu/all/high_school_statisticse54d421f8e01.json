The percentages provided only tell us that 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds and 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds.\n\nTo find the mean (\u03bc), we need at least one piece of data that can be used to calculate it from the known percentage of vehicles exceeding specific weight limits. However, with just the given percentages, we cannot determine either the mean or the standard deviation directly.\n\nIf you have additional information such as the median, mode, or any other descriptive statistics available, please provide them so I can assist you further. Otherwise, based solely on the percentages given, there's insufficient data to make an accurate determination."
