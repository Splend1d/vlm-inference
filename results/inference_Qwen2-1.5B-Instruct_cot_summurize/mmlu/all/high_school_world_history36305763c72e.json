They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.\nWhen the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.\"\nRalph Fitch, an account of his travels to the Far East, 1599 C.E.\nThe description in the second paragraph of the procedures that Portuguese and other foreigners followed when trading in China supports which of the following inferences about trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty?\n\nA. The Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise.\nB. The Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly to limit contact with foreigners and ease collection of taxes.\nC. The Ming Dynasty was too busy battling pirates along its coast to pay any attention to regular merchant activity.\nD. The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the Ming Dynasty did not actively seek to regulate trade or limit contact with foreigners as suggested by option B. Instead, the passage describes how Portuguese merchants were required to follow specific procedures such as entering their names in a book, staying within a certain area during the day, and leaving their names visible at night to avoid being imprisoned. These procedures suggest that the Ming Dynasty did not place restrictions on foreign trade or commerce.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The Ming Dynasty only allowed Portugal to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year."
