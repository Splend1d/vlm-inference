Thereafter, the skier sued the ski resort alleging negligent maintenance of the ski lift machinery. The ski resort's skier's attorney took a discovery deposition of a witness who was seated behind the skier at the time of the accident. The witness died shortly after the deposition. At trial, the skier offers the witness's deposition testimony into evidence. Upon objection by the ski resort's attorney, the deposition is\n\nA. admissible as former testimony.\nB. admissible, provided that the witness's statements are more probative on the point than any other evidence the skier can procure through reasonable efforts and that the skier has given the ski resort reasonable notice that she would offer the deposition.\nC. inadmissible, because it violates the ski resort's right to confront the witnesses against itself.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

This rule provides that prior testimony is generally admissible only if it is relevant and its probative value substantially outweighs its potential prejudicial effect. In this case, the skier's attorney is offering the witness's deposition testimony into evidence, which would be relevant to the question of whether the ski lift had been negligently maintained before the accident.\n\nHowever, the court will consider several factors when determining whether the testimony should be admitted:\n\n1. Whether the testimony is more probative on the issue than any other evidence the party can obtain through reasonable efforts;\n2. Whether the opposing party has had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness;\n3. Whether there is any indication that the witness is unavailable; and\n4. Whether the witness's statement is subject to impeachment.\n\nIn this case, the skier has given the ski resort reasonable notice that they would offer the witness's deposition, so the court will likely determine that the testimony is admissible based on the fourth factor mentioned above. However, it is ultimately up to the court to make this determination based on all of the circumstances of the case."
