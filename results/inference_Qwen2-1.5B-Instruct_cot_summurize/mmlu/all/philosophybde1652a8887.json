What is due to factors beyond their control.\n\nAccording to Nagel's argument, moral assessment should take into account the consequences of an individual's actions on others. However, if the action affects only oneself, then it does not have any external consequences and thus cannot be evaluated from a moral standpoint. Therefore, it is plausible that prior to reflection, people cannot be morally assessed for actions that affect only themselves."
