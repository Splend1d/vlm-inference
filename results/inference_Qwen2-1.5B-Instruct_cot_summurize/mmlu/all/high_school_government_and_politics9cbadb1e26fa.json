Although the Constitution empowers the federal government to regulate international trade, states may establish boycotts of goods imported from countries that use child labor.\nB. While the Congress creates laws, and the executive branch enacts and enforces those laws, only the Supreme Court may decide which laws and executive actions are unconstitutional.\nC. The Fifth Amendment guarantees that an individual may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process, and this protection provides a legal justification for those who do not wish to serve on a jury.\nD. The Bill of Rights articulates certain rights in order to protect individuals from the federal government, and the Fourteenth Amendment extends most of those rights to protect individuals from the state governments as well.\n"
