This phenomenon is known as the \"anxiety advantage,\" where individuals with high levels of anxiety may perform better on tasks requiring attention or memory skills, such as math problems or puzzles. However, this advantage typically disappears once anxiety reaches moderate levels or above.\n\nIt's important to note that not all individuals experience this benefit from anxiety. Some people with high levels of anxiety may find it challenging to focus, leading to lower academic performance. Therefore, while some anxiety can be beneficial, there is a point at which it becomes detrimental.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between achievement and anxiety in schoolchildren is complex and depends on individual differences and the level of anxiety experienced by each child."
