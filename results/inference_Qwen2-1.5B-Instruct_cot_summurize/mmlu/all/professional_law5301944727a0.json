One day that employee came uninvited into the owner's office brandishing a loaded shotgun, approached the owner's desk and raised the weapon. The owner, however, was secretly waiting for the opportunity. As the employee began to press on the trigger, the owner pulled a gun from her drawer and killed him. The owner admitted she felt malice toward her enemy. The authorities charged her with murder. Can she be convicted?\n\nA. No, because she acted in self-defense.\nB. No, because these facts constitute justifiable homicide.\nC. Yes, because she had been lying in wait for the victim.\nD. Yes, because the owner cannot claim self-defense when her motive is evil.\n"

Yes, because the owner cannot claim self-defense when her motive is evil.\n\nIn order to be found guilty of murder, the owner must have committed the act with the intent to kill or cause serious bodily harm, not simply to defend herself or another person. In this case, the owner had already expressed feelings of hatred towards her former employee, which would suggest an evil motive rather than self-defense.\n\nFurthermore, the use of a loaded firearm by the owner could also raise questions about whether she had intended to use it for defense, given the circumstances. If the owner genuinely believed that her actions were necessary to protect herself, she might not have committed murder.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the owner cannot be convicted of murder under any of the options listed."
