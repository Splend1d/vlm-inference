He believed that individuals should be treated as ends in themselves, rather than merely means to an end. In other words, he believed that people should be respected as autonomous beings who have rights and dignity, regardless of their physical appearance or gender identity.\n\nWhile Kant did not explicitly state that sexual objectification harms humanity, his views suggest that it does. He believed that treating people solely based on their physical attributes was unjust and led to harmful consequences, such as discrimination and inequality.\n\nIn contrast, Papadaki may argue that sexual objectification can enhance humanity by promoting healthy relationships between individuals and increasing personal fulfillment and happiness. However, this perspective may conflict with Kant's views on respect for autonomy and human dignity. It would be best to consult Papadaki's own arguments or quotes to determine her exact position on this issue."
