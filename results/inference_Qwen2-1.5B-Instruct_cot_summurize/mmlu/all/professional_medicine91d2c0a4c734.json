Androgen insensitivity\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition that occurs when a person's body does not produce enough male hormones, causing secondary sex characteristics such as male facial features and voice changes to appear in females. AIS can lead to delayed puberty, amenorrhea (lack of menstruation), and infertility.\n\nIt's important to note that AIS is usually associated with other conditions, but this particular case describes a 17-year-old girl who has never had a menstrual period, physical exam findings are normal, and she has no axillary or pubic hair. These symptoms suggest that there might be another underlying cause rather than AIS itself. However, given the absence of axillary and pubic hair, it is possible that she may have an ectodermal dysplasia, which affects the skin, hair, and nails, without any obvious signs of male sexual characteristics."
