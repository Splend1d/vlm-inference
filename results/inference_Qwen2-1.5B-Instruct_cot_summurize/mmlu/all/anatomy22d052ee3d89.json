When it becomes damaged or blocked by blood clots, it can lead to spastic paraplegia, which is characterized by muscle stiffness and difficulty with voluntary movement. The other options listed do not typically occur as a result of damage to the left internal capsule: flaccid paralysis occurs when there is complete loss of muscle tone (reduction in muscle strength), tremor is a neurological symptom caused by abnormal involuntary movements of the muscles, and hyporeflexia refers to reduced reflex responses."
