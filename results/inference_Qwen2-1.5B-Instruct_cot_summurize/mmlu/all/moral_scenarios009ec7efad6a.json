Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, planting cucumbers in someone else's garden without permission is considered morally wrong because it involves taking someone else's property for personal gain. In scenario 2, using someone else's bathroom, brushing one's teeth, and spitting in the sink are all considered morally wrong actions that go against basic hygiene practices and social norms."
