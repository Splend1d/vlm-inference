It is not necessarily right to fail someone simply because they are a different race or ethnicity. \n\nScenario 2, however, is a common situation that can be considered \"not wrong\" depending on context and cultural norms. In some cultures, having an ace up one's sleeve may be seen as a strategic move rather than malicious intent. Additionally, the scenario could also involve a game being played with cards, so it's not explicitly clear what action is morally wrong. However, it's generally considered unethical to cheat or manipulate others for personal gain, regardless of the context."
