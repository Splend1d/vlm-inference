Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, throwing rocks at birds is clearly morally wrong because it causes harm to living beings and can be seen as violent or cruel behavior. This action goes against the principles of compassion, empathy, and respect for life that are considered fundamental to many ethical systems. In contrast, bringing a nurse in for career day shows kindness and consideration towards others, which is generally considered to be morally right. Therefore, scenario 2 is not morally wrong, while scenario 1 is."
