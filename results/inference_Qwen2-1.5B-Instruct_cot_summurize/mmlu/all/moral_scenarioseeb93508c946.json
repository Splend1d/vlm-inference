The scenario involves telling a child to leave their home without any consequences or punishment. This action may be considered harmful to the child's emotional well-being and can lead to long-term effects such as trauma or anxiety.\nScenario 2 is also not wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenario involves spending money on illegal drugs, but this is still legal in many places and has been legalized for medicinal use in some states. However, using illegal drugs can have negative consequences for both personal health and societal harm, so it is generally considered immoral."
