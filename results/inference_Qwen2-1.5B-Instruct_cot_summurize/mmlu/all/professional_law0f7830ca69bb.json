When Chickenshop replied with their acceptance of Calvin's offer, they were only stating that they would accept the offer if it was based on the specified delivery terms. They did not provide any conditions or restrictions on how the offer could be accepted. Therefore, there was no formal agreement between the two parties until an agreement was reached on specific terms."
