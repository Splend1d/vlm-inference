However, it is not clear how these isotopic ratios would have affected the development or collapse of civilization in the Indus Valley.\n\nIt's possible that changes in rainfall and temperature could have influenced the growth and survival of certain species of gastropods, but this would not necessarily indicate any significant impact on the development or collapse of civilization. Similarly, while increased precipitation and monsoon activity could potentially lead to more frequent flooding events, this would not be directly related to the collapse of civilization in the Indus Valley.\n\nTherefore, without further information about the specific isotopic ratios observed in the gastropod shells from the Indus Valley, it is difficult to determine whether they played a role in the development or collapse of civilization there."
