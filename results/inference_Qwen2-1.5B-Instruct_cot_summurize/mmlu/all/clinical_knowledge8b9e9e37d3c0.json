Health care staff should consider using other methods such as physical examination, observation, and other diagnostic tools to assess the intensity of the patient's pain before prescribing or administering pain relief medications. Additionally, self-reporting of pain can be influenced by factors such as medication side effects, mood, and cultural beliefs about pain management. Therefore, health care staff must take these factors into account when making treatment decisions for patients with chronic pain."
