The ulnar nerve can be affected by a fracture of the spiral groove of the humerus, which can lead to loss of sensation over the medial half of the hand and medial one and a half digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand.\n\nThe ulnar nerve is responsible for supplying sensory and motor innervation to the posterior three-finger area of the hand (the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and ring finger). When there is damage to the ulnar nerve, it can result in numbness or weakness in these areas.\n\nThe ulnar nerve is also responsible for producing the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, which helps to extend the fingers when they are at rest. Damage to the ulnar nerve can affect this function as well.\n\nIt is important to note that while the ulnar nerve can be affected by fractures of the spiral groove of the humerus, other factors such as trauma, infections, and degenerative changes can also contribute to its dysfunction. Therefore, the diagnosis of ulnar nerve palsy requires careful evaluation by a healthcare professional."
