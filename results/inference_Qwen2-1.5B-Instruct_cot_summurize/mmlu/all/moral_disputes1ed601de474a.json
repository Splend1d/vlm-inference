If they accept the latter option, then they cannot justify the practice of euthanasia on the basis of respecting individual autonomy. If they reject the former option, then they must acknowledge that some people may be unable to exercise their autonomy when faced with unbearable suffering and pain. This raises difficult moral questions about what constitutes an appropriate level of autonomy and how it should be balanced against the rights of others."
