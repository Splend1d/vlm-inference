The trace period allows for the consolidation of the association between the CS and US, making it more likely that the association will be retained over time. Delaying the presentation of the CS after the US can also increase the likelihood of classical conditioning, but the effect may not be as strong as with a trace period. Simultaneous presentations have been shown to be less effective in producing classical conditioning compared to either delay or trace periods. Backward presentations of the CS before the US can also lead to classical conditioning, but again, this is less common than with a trace period."
