                    "text": "To determine which costs are related to the total cost of making pizzas for Mr. Hamm, we need to consider the different components of the total cost:\n\n1. **Total Fixed Costs**: These are the expenses that do not change regardless of production volume. In this case, they might include rent, utilities, insurance, and other fixed costs.\n\n2. **Total Variable Costs**: These are the expenses directly proportional to output or quantity produced. In the context of pizza-making, it would be the cost of ingredients (sauce, flour, yeast, etc.) multiplied by the number of pizzas made.\n\n3. **Marginal Cost**: This is the additional cost incurred when producing one more unit of a good or service. It's calculated as the derivative of total cost with respect to the number of units produced.\n\nGiven that Mr. Hamm places $0.45 worth of sauce on each pizza, and he has to make 10 pizzas to cover the cost of the sauce, this represents a marginal cost.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the options provided:\n\n- **I. Total Fixed Costs** - These are typically associated with the initial setup of the business, including equipment, staff salaries, and overhead expenses.\n  \n- **II. Total Variable Costs** - As mentioned above, these represent the direct costs of ingredients and labor per pizza.\n\n- **III. Marginal Cost** - Since the question specifically asks about the cost of sauce ($0.45), it aligns with the marginal cost calculation.\n\n- **IV. Total Costs** - This includes all costs up to the point where variable costs start to exceed fixed costs.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the correct answer is **III. Marginal Cost**, as it accurately reflects the cost associated with adding one more pizza to the order. The other options are either irrelevant or not applicable here due to the focus on the cost of sauce."
