They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.\"\nJohn Kerry, 1971\nThe conflict described above is most likely a result of which of the following doctrines?\n\nA. Imperialism\nB. Containment\nC. Big-stick diplomacy\nD. Isolationism\n"
