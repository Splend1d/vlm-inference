For example, low intake of fruits and vegetables may increase the risk of iodine deficiency if they do not contain enough iodine, while inadequate sunlight exposure may also be a risk factor if people are living in areas with limited sun exposure or if they have access to iodized salt. Additionally, some populations may have difficulty obtaining adequate amounts of iodine from their diet due to cultural or economic reasons. It's always best to consult with a healthcare provider or nutritionist to determine the best way to ensure adequate iodine intake in your particular situation."
