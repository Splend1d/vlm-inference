This phenomenon is known as the \"apparent length contraction\" or \"time dilation.\" The effect is due to the Doppler effect and is calculated using the Lorentz transformation equations.\n\nIn this case, the observer at rest measures the speed of the moving object relative to their own velocity. If the observed speed is greater than that of light (which is about 300,000 km/s), then the apparent length of the object will be shorter in the direction perpendicular to its motion. This is because the time dilation effect means that the same amount of time passes for the object as for the observer at rest, but the observer at rest sees the object move faster in the direction perpendicular to its motion.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer."
