It suspended further immigration from Europe and introduced a quota system that limited immigration to the country. The act also made it illegal for employers to hire or recruit undocumented workers. However, the most notable aspect of the act was its emphasis on promoting family reunification through the admission of immediate relatives of existing residents in the United States.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer."
