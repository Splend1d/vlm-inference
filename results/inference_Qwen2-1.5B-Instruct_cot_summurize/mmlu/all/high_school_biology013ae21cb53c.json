In this case, brightly colored peacocks may be more attractive to mates and therefore mate more frequently than their drab counterparts. Sexual selection is a form of natural selection where traits that are advantageous for reproduction in one species become more common in that species due to increased reproductive success associated with them. \n\nArtificial selection occurs when humans selectively breed animals for desirable characteristics, while directional selection occurs when environmental factors cause certain traits to become more or less common over time without any deliberate breeding.\n\nStabilizing selection is a type of natural selection where populations evolve slowly over long periods of time without significant changes in the frequency of different genetic types within the population. It does not describe mating behavior."
