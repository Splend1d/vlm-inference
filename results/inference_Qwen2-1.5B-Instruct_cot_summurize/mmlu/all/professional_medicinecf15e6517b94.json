He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily and has consumed six 12-oz bottles of beer on weekend nights during the past 30 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 1.5-cm mass on the apex of the tongue. Further evaluation of the mass confirms squamous cell carcinoma. It is most appropriate to evaluate which of the following lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient?\n\nA. Inferior deep cervical\nB. Parotid\nC. Retropharyngeal\nD. Submental\n"

Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue can spread to the neck, specifically the inferior deep cervical lymph nodes, as it is a common site of origin for squamous cell carcinomas. The other options listed (parotid, retropharyngeal, submental) are not typically associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue or its spread."
