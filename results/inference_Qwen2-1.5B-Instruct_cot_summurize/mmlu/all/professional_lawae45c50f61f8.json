The man decided to surprise the friend with some fireworks, so he purchased some fireworks and hid them under his friend's chair on the friend's porch. That evening, the friend went outside to smoke and dropped his unfinished cigarette next to his chair on the porch. The cigarette ignited the fireworks, and the fireworks immediately exploded, causing extensive damage to the friend and to his cabin. The man was arrested and is being prosecuted for arson. Will the man be found guilty of arson?\n\nA. No, because the man never intended to hurt the friend.\nB. No, because the man did not intend to burn down the cabin and was not guilty of wanton and willful misconduct.\nC. Yes, because the man indirectly set fire to the friend's cabin.\nD. Yes, because the injury to the friend and to his cabin was the natural result of the man's actions.\n"

Yes, because the injury to the friend and to his cabin was the natural result of the man's actions.\n\nArson refers to the act of intentionally setting fire to property with the intent to cause damage or destruction. In this case, the man lit fireworks that were hidden under his friend's chair, which caused an explosion and significant damage to both the friend and his cabin. While it may not have been his direct intention to harm the friend, the result of his actions was to cause injury and damage to the cabin. Therefore, the man can be held liable for arson."
