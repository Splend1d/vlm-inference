City residents have recently complained that the surfers are creating a public nuisance by littering the beaches, harassing sunbathers, and injuring swimmers with their surfboards. As a consequence, the city adopted an ordinance prohibiting all surfing on its beaches. The newly enacted ordinance further prohibited the sale of surfboards within the city's limits. An out of state surfboard manufacturer had planned to sell a new line of fiberglass surfboards in the city in the upcoming year. This is now precluded by the recently adopted measure. If the manufacturer seeks to enjoin application of the city ordinance, which of the following is the WEAKEST defense for the city?\n\nA. There is no case or controversy.\nB. The manufacturer's case is moot.\nC. The manufacturer lacks standing.\nD. The case is not ripe.\n"

In this situation, the city has already enacted an ordinance that prohibits surfing on its beaches, which includes the sale of surfboards within the city's limits. Therefore, there is a case or controversy at hand, and the case is not ripe for review because it is too early to determine whether the ordinance will actually be enforced or what effect it will have on the manufacturer's business. Additionally, the city's ordinance may also apply to other businesses that sell surfboards, such as online retailers, so the case could potentially involve multiple parties and additional issues."
