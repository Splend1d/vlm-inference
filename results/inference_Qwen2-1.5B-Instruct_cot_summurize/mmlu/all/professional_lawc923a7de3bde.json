For 15 years, a commercial fisherman had kept a daily log of the water level at his dock on the riverbank opposite the land in order to forecast fishing conditions. The plaintiff hired a draftsman to graph the data from the fisherman's logs for use as a trial exhibit. At trial, the fisherman testified to the care with which he had made the measurements and recorded them in his logs, which had been made available for the defendant's inspection. The draftsman then testified to the manner in which he had prepared the graphs. With this foundation, are the graphs admissible?\n\nA. No, because they are hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because they violate the \"best evidence\" rule.\nC. Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\nD. Yes, as the draftsman's expert opinion of the water levels.\n"

Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\n\nSummary: In a case involving changes in the water level over time, the plaintiff presented summary graphs based on a commercial fisherman's daily log, which was used as an exhibit. The court ruled that these graphs were admissible as summaries of voluminous business records. This ruling supports the notion that graphs derived from business records can be considered relevant evidence if they are properly authenticated and reliable. However, it is crucial to note that the court's decision does not necessarily extend to all types of summaries or whether such summaries can be used as direct evidence."
