Therefore, option A is correct. \n\nOption B is also incorrect because there was an increase in the defense trade during the 20th century. This can be seen through various sources such as historical records, statistical data, and expert opinions.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because it contradicts the information given in question. The arms trade has decreased in recent years due to various factors such as international agreements, economic sanctions, and changes in military strategy.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because there has been a significant growth in the number and variety of weapons traded throughout history, including in the 20th century. However, this growth may have slowed down or even reversed in some cases due to technological advancements, changing geopolitical dynamics, and other factors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
