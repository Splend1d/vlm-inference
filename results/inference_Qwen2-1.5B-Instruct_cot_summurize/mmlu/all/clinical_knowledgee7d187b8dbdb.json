A positive Babinski reflex is indeed the same as a normal flexor response in the assessment of the plantar reflex.\n\nB. An extensor plantar response can indicate a lower motor neuron lesion, but it's not exclusive to this condition and could also be seen in certain conditions such as neuropathy or muscle atrophy.\n\nC. The root value of the ankle reflex is typically around T7-T9, with the exact location varying depending on the individual and their anatomy.\n\nD. The root value of the knee reflex is typically around S1-S3, with the exact location also varying based on factors like age, sex, and specific neurological condition. However, for an accurate assessment, it should be noted that there may be some variability due to differences in anatomy between individuals."
