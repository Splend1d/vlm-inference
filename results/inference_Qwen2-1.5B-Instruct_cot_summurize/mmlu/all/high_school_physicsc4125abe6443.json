Which of the following statements correctly describes a possible outcome of this reaction and why it would occur?\n\nA. Conservation of mass indicates that if a single new particle were created in the reaction, it must have a total mass equal to the combined masses of the electron and positron.\nB. Conservation of charge indicates that all new particles created in the reaction would have no electric charge.\nC. Conservation of momentum indicates that two identical gamma rays moving off in opposite directions could be created.\nD. Conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind.\n"

Conservation of energy indicates that the antimatter positron could annihilate into energy, leaving the stationary electron behind.\n\nThis happens because when an antiparticle (an object with the same mass but opposite charge) collides with a regular particle, it can transfer some of its mass-energy to the regular particle. In this case, the positron colliding with the electron transfers some of its rest mass to the electron, causing both particles to move away from each other at high speeds. The positron loses most of its mass, while the electron gains enough energy to escape from the nucleus and become a free electron."
