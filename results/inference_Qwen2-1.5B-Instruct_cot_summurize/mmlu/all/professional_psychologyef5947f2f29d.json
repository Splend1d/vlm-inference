However, it is important to note that this does not mean that they cannot have personal relationships or friendships outside of these professional boundaries. \n\nIn some cases, it may be appropriate for psychologists to limit their interactions with former therapy clients during a specific period after the termination of therapy, such as one year. This can help ensure that any potential conflicts or misunderstandings do not arise. However, this decision should be made on a case-by-case basis based on individual circumstances and values.\n\nUltimately, the key consideration is whether the relationship between the psychologist and the former therapy client is appropriate and respectful, even if it involves personal connections beyond the therapeutic context. It is also important to consider the impact of such relationships on both parties involved and to seek guidance from ethical standards and guidelines if necessary."
