The period of time to respond to a price change is short.\n\nWhen a product has a shorter response time, consumers will be more sensitive to changes in its price. This means that an increase or decrease in the price of the product will cause a larger percentage change in the quantity demanded. As a result, the price elasticity of demand for this product will be greater than if the response time were longer.\n\nPrice elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to changes in its price. It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demanded by the percentage change in price. A positive price elasticity indicates that as the price increases, the quantity demanded also increases; conversely, a negative price elasticity indicates that as prices increase, quantities demanded fall."
