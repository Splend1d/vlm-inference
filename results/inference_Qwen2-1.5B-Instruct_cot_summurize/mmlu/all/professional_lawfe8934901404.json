On June 1, the collector sent the 11th antique toy to the expert with a signed note that read: \"Here is another toy for you to restore. As with all prior jobs, I will pay $500 for the work, but no more.\" On June 4, after receipt of the collector's June 1 note and the toy, the expert began restoring the toy. On June 6, the collector unexpectedly died. On June 7, unaware of the collector's death, the expert sent the collector a note that stated that the restoration work had begun on June 4. The following day, the expert learned of the collector's death. Does a contract exist that binds the expert and the collector's estate?\n\nA. No, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.\nB. No, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.\nC. Yes, because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death.\nD. Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n"

Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.\n\nWhen the collector sends the note to the expert on June 1, it is an acceptance of the offer to restore the toy. However, on June 4, the expert sends the collector a new note stating that the restoration work has already started. This new note is not part of the original offer made by the expert, as it arrives after the collector's death. Therefore, there is no binding contract between the expert and the collector's estate based solely on the expert's June 4 note."
