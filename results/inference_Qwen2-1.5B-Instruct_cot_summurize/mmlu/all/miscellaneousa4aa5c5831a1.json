Which of the following makes the same logical mistake as above?\n\nA. Literature and art are not worthy of attention. Modernization must relies on science and technology, so science and technology are worthy of our attention. But literature and art are not science and technology.\nB. Non-university can also become an outstanding talent. Gorky, Edison, Faraday, Franklin, etc. have not attended college, but they have all become outstanding talents.\nC. The earth is a sphere, which can be proved from the fact that when we stand at a height and watch the sailing boat in the sea, we always see the mast first and then the hull. The reason for this is because the earth is a sphere.\nD. I saw them coming out of this chemical plant several times before I realized that this young man who was eager to help patients was originally a worker in this chemical plant.\n"

In other words, the person argues against the idea presented by the person being attacked rather than considering the validity of the argument itself.\n\nThe sentences provided do not contain any logical mistakes that align with the concept of ad hominem. However, it's worth noting that these statements themselves may be flawed due to factual errors or incorrect premises. For example, statement B assumes without evidence that Gorky, Edison, Faraday, Franklin, and others did not attend university simply because they were not listed among those mentioned. Similarly, statement C might be based on a misinterpretation of the observation about the mast and hull being seen first, which depends on the observer's perspective."
