The United States has comparative advantage in salmon production, and Peru has comparative advantage in anchovy production.\n\nRelative opportunity costs refer to the trade-off between two goods or services that can be produced by a country using its resources. In this scenario, the United States is trading salmon for anchovies. Therefore, the United States has a comparative advantage in producing salmon because it can produce more of it with less input than Peru can produce with the same amount of inputs used by Peru.\n\nPeru, on the other hand, has a comparative advantage in producing anchovies because it can produce more of them with less input than the United States can produce with the same amount of inputs used by the United States.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The United States has comparative advantage in salmon production, and Peru has comparative advantage in anchovy production."
