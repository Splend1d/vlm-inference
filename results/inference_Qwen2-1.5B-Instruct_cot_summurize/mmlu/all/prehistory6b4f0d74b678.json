This is because the society was likely organized around a system of meritocracy, where individuals were rewarded based on their skills and accomplishments rather than their\u51fa\u8eab or social status. The lack of social stratification would mean that there was little room for inequality within the community. However, it's important to note that this is an educated guess based on available evidence and may not be entirely accurate."
