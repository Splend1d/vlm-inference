The global political arena is dominated by a paradigm of human-security which promotes human security based on core assumptions of what it is to be secure, and which transcend cultural or political diversity.\nB. Despite the inclusion of a diverse range of political actors, whose cultural, ethical and religious values are often at odds with one another, there exists a general consensus amongst all states that humanitarian intervention is sometimes justified.\nC. The diversity of states, in terms of their cultural, political, ideological and religious values, results in a global system characterised by radical disagreements on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity there exist rules of engagement that prohibit interference in the sovereign state, such as humanitarian intervention.\nD. Within the contemporary global arena there are a number of radically different views on how states should govern themselves and each other.

The diversity of states, in terms of their cultural, political, ideological, and religious values, results in a global system characterized by radical disagreements on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity, there exist rules of engagement that prohibit interference in the sovereign state, such as humanitarian intervention.\n\nThis answer acknowledges the fact that the global political arena is indeed dominated by a paradigm of human-security that emphasizes the importance of protecting human rights and promoting peace, but also recognizes that this paradigm can lead to conflicts between different cultural, political, and ideological values. Therefore, it suggests that humanitarian intervention may sometimes be necessary to address these conflicts and promote stability. However, it also notes that there is a need for rules of engagement to prevent interference in the sovereignty of individual states. This approach balances the need for international cooperation and protection of human rights with the respect for national sovereignty and the diversity of cultural, political, and ideological values within each country."
