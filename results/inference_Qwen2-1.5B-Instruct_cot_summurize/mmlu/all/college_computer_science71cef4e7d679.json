Two relationships arise: (1) the instance relationship, between an object and the class of which that object is a member, and (2) the subclass relationship, between a class and the superclass from which that class inherits properties. In such a language, when a message is sent to an object requesting execution of one of its methods (procedures), the method is located by following\n\nA. one instance link and then zero or more subclass links\nB. one or more instance links and then one or more subclass links\nC. one or more instance links\nD. one subclass link and then one or more instance links\n"

One or more instance links and then one or more subclass links.\n\nIn object-oriented programming, messages are passed through instances of classes. When a message is sent to an object, it first looks for the appropriate instance link that points to the actual object. Once the object is found, the message is forwarded to the method specified in the object's constructor or through other means of accessing the object's attributes and methods.\n\nIf the object is not an instance of the desired class, the message must be sent to the object's superclass instead. The superclass has a special method called `__init__`, which can be used as a placeholder for any necessary initialization code before the object is instantiated. This method is called whenever an instance of the superclass is created, regardless of whether it is being instantiated using inheritance or instantiation from a base class.\n\nTherefore, when a message is sent to an object, the method is located by following one or more instance links, and then one or more subclass links, depending on whether the object is an instance of the desired class or not."
