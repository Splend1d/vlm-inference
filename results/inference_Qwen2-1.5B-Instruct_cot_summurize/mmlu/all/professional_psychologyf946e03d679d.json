Other substances that can cause withdrawal delirium include benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium) and clonazepam (Klonopin), as well as sedative-hypnotics like barbiturates, which are commonly used in the treatment of insomnia. However, these types of drugs are not typically associated with withdrawal delirium when they are stopped abruptly or rapidly."
