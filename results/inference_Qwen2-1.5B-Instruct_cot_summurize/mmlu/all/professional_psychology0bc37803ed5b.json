It has asymmetrical frequency distributions\n\nA skewed distribution refers to a distribution in which the shape of the frequency distribution does not have an equal spread around its central value or average. The term \"skewed\" means that the distribution is either left-skewed or right-skewed. \n\nLeft-skewed distributions tend to have more values on one side of their central point than on the other side. Right-skewed distributions have more values on the right side.\n\nIn contrast, a normal distribution (bell-shaped curve) is symmetric around its center."
