The prism bends the light in such a way that the violet and blue light bend more than the other colors because they have shorter wavelengths. This is why you might see the sky appear blue when looking up during sunrise or sunset, as the blue light is scattered by the atmosphere and refracted by the prism. Red light, on the other hand, does not bend as much and therefore appears yellow or orange when viewed from above the horizon due to scattering by air molecules."
