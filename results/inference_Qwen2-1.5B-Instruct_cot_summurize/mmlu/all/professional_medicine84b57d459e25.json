His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an S4. While undergoing an ECG, the patient says that he feels the chest pain returning. The most appropriate immediate treatment is a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action?\n\nA. Increases cAMP concentration\nB. Increases nitric oxide concentration\nC. Inhibits potassium flux\nD. Inhibits sodium flux\n"

Increases nitric oxide concentration.\n\nNitric oxide (NO) has been shown to relax smooth muscle in the walls of blood vessels, leading to vasodilation and increased blood flow. This can help reduce symptoms of angina, which is the chest pain you described. \n\nTherefore, the drug with this mechanism of action would be one that increases nitric oxide production. Answer B is the only option that fits this description."
