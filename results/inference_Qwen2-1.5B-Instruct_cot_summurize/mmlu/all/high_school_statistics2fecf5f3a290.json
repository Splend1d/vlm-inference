Because a sample statistic is used to estimate a population parameter.\n\nSampling error, also known as sampling variability or estimation error, refers to the difference between the value of a parameter estimated from a sample and the true value of that parameter. It can occur due to several reasons:\n\n  * A biased interviewer may introduce bias into the sample, leading to an inaccurate estimate of the population parameter.\n  * Randomness in the selection of the sample may not be present, leading to variations in the results.\n  * The size of the sample may be too small, which can result in unreliable estimates.\n  * Human judgement may play a role in choosing the sample, potentially introducing subjective biases.\n\nHowever, option B (because a sample statistic is used to estimate a population parameter) is the most accurate statement regarding sampling error."
