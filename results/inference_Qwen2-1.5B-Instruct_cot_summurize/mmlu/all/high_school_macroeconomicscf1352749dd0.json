This activity is considered an economic activity because it generates income for the builders and provides a service to the community.\n\nOption A, where a mechanic fixes his own car, does not generate income or create value that can be counted towards GDP. Option B, where a stay-at-home dad provides childcare, also does not generate income or create value that can be counted towards GDP. Option C, where a worker donates money to charity, is also not an economic activity as it does not generate income or provide a service.\n\nOption D, where high school students build homes for the homeless, creates jobs and generates revenue from sales of materials used in construction, which can then be counted towards GDP."
