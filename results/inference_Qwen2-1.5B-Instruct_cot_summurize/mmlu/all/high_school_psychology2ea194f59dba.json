This type of parenting is known to promote positive behaviors, such as responsibility, independence, and self-discipline, which can lead to better outcomes for children's development and well-being. In contrast, authoritarian parenting may result in children feeling overwhelmed or controlled, whereas permissive parenting can encourage poor decision-making and lack of discipline. Consistent and supportive parenting is generally associated with greater resilience and success in life."
