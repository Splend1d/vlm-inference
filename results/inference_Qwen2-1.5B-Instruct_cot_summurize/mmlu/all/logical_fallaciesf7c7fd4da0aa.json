This means that if the premises are true (i.e., if the major premise and the minor premise are both true), then the conclusion must also be true. The conclusion in this case would be \"the conclusion must affirm the consequent.\"\n\nFor example:\n\nPremise 1: All men are mortal.\nPremise 2: Socrates is a man.\nConclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.\n\nSince Premise 2 is true, we know that Socrates is a man. Since all men are mortal, we know that Socrates is mortal as well. Therefore, the conclusion must affirm the consequent, which in this case is \"Socrates is mortal.\""
