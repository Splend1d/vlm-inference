It does not claim that wrongdoers deserve to be punished, nor does it believe that specific punishments are justified solely based on their overall intrinsic value. Instead, the retributive approach emphasizes the importance of rehabilitation and deterrence as well as the moral responsibility of individuals for their actions.\n\nTherefore, options A and B are correct, while option C is incorrect because the retributive theory supports the idea that punishment should fit the crime. Option D is also incorrect because the retributive theory suggests that the death penalty may be morally justified in certain cases of murder, such as when the victim was killed in self-defense or in a situation where the perpetrator acted with extreme premeditation."
