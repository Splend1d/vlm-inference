This gives us the total amount of money collected from selling all the tickets. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it multiplies 30 by 10 raised to the power of 1, not by 10^3.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it multiplies 30 by 10 raised to the power of 3, not by 10^3.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it multiplies 6 by 5 and then by 10 raised to the power of 2, not by 10^3."
