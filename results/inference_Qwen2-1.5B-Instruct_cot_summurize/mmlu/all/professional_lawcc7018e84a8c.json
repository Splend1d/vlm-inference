A passenger in the struck vehicle had a rare medical condition that made her highly vulnerable to any slight physical impact or intrusion. The minimal impact caused the passenger to lightly bump her shoulder against the door, which triggered her rare immunosuppressant disease to surface. The passenger became permanently incapacitated from the impact. She sued the negligent motorist for all of her injuries. A physician submitted a report stating that the collision was a substantial factor in causing the disability. Has the plaintiff stated a claim for relief under prevailing legal principles?\n\nA. Yes, because in the law of negligence the defendant takes the plaintiff \"as he finds her.\"\nB. No, because the motorist is only liable for foreseeable injuries that are not of psychological origin.\nC. No, because the victim's psychosomatic reaction is usually held to be malingering under the law.\nD. Yes, because the victim in this case is called a \"predictably unpredictable plaintiff.\"\n"

Yes, because the victim in this case is called a \"predictably unpredictable plaintiff.\" This term refers to individuals who have a history of experiencing sudden onset illnesses or injuries that can be attributed to stress, trauma, or other factors unrelated to their pre-existing conditions. In such cases, courts may find that the injury is a result of the defendant's actions rather than an unforeseeable event, and hold the defendant responsible for the resulting harm. However, it is important to note that this type of claim is relatively uncommon and requires careful consideration of the specific facts and circumstances of each case."
