Dashing to the car, the husband then drove his wife and ailing son to the nearest hospital. On the way to the hospital, the son had a seizure and stopped breathing. Seconds later, the car went out of control despite the husband's reasonable efforts, swinging across the center line into oncoming traffic, where it collided wit. I1 a car driven by a driver who was driving in the opposite direction. In this jurisdiction, a statute makes it a misdemeanor for any motor vehicle to travel to the left of the center line of any two-way highway, road, or street. If the driver asserts a claim against the husband, the most likely result is that the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the husband is strictly liable for violating the statute.\nB. prevail, because the statute was designed to protect motorists such as the driver.\nC. not prevail, because the driver had the last clear chance to avoid the accident.\nD. not prevail, because the husband was acting reasonably in an emergency.\n"

This is because the husband violated the law by traveling to the left of the center line of the road. The statute he violated made it a misdemeanor to do so, which means that he could face criminal charges if found guilty.\n\nIn addition, the husband acted reasonably in an emergency, but the statute still applies even if the emergency is not life-threatening. Therefore, the court may find that the husband's actions were not unreasonable under the circumstances, and the statute still applies.\n\nIt is also possible that the court may find that the husband did not have the last clear chance to avoid the accident, but this would depend on the specific facts of the case. Ultimately, the outcome would depend on the judge's interpretation of the law and the evidence presented at trial."
