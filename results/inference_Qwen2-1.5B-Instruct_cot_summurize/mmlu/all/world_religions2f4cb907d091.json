He is also known as the Buddha of Abode of Bliss and is often depicted with a white lotus flower on his head, symbolizing purity and enlightenment.\n\nWhile Guan-yin is revered for her compassion towards all living beings, she does not specifically perform the souls of deceased children to salvation. Kannon, another bodhisattva associated with compassion, similarly focuses on saving all sentient beings, but again, there is no specific mention of her performing the souls of deceased children to salvation.\n\nOjizo-sama, or Jizo, is a Japanese bodhisattva associated with compassion and protection for children, but he is not directly mentioned in this context of performing the souls of deceased children to salvation."
