This is because each element can belong to one of \\(n\\) cycles and every cycle can have up to \\(n-1\\) elements.\n\nThus, if there were less than \\(n!\\) distinct cycle types, then some cycles would repeat, leading to a permutation with fewer than \\(n!\\) distinct cycle types. But since no cycle can contain more than \\(n-1\\) elements (as this would require more than one cycle), we conclude that \\(n!\\) must be the number of distinct cycle types.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible order for an element of \\(S_n\\) for \\(n=10\\) is \\(10!\\) or \\(10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times ... \\times 1 = 362880\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is **(C) 30**."
