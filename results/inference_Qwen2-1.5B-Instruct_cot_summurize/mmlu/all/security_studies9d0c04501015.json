To achieve energy security is to ensure that there are currently sufficient energy resources to sustain the current consumption and demand for energy across the globe.\nB. Energy security refers to the ability of the current energy supplies to meet the demands of state military consumption, placing the military at the core of the security paradigm.\nC. To achieve energy security is to secure the supply of energy that is needed in the current context and in the future, with regards to foreseeable changes in demand where relevant.\nD. Energy security refers to the ability of individuals, economic and non-state actors to access the energy required for sustaining their growth and development.\n"

To achieve energy security is to secure the supply of energy that is needed in the current context and in the future, with regards to foreseeable changes in demand where relevant.\n\nEnergy security is about ensuring that a country has enough energy resources to meet its current and future needs, taking into account any changes in demand or availability of energy sources. This includes securing the supply of energy from domestic and international sources, as well as addressing potential risks such as geopolitical instability or climate change. Achieving energy security also involves developing strategies to increase energy efficiency and reduce waste, while promoting sustainable energy sources and technologies."
