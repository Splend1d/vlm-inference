However, if the charge was excessive or unjustified, it could still be seen as morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, proposing that a school celebrate the KKK's founding date is highly controversial and illegal in many places due to its racist and discriminatory nature. It goes against the values of democracy, equality, and human rights, and can cause harm to marginalized communities.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios have different degrees of moral wrongness based on their specific contexts and cultural norms. The correct answer would depend on the reader's perspective and beliefs about the respective scenarios."
