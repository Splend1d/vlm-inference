                    "text": "The owner and operator of a pizza restaurant entered into a written contract with an employee that provided that the employee would be employed as manager of the restaurant for a period of three years. The contract provided that the owner was to pay the employee a salary of $2,000 per month, payable one-half to the employee and one-half to the employee's elderly mother. The contract further stipulated that \"the monies due hereunder shall not be assignable. \"When the mother learned of this contract, she wrote a letter to the owner stating, \"Kindly pay the amounts due me under your contract with my son directly to the nursing home, where I am presently a patient. \" During the first year of the contract, the owner paid $1,000 per month to the employee and $1,000 per month to the nursing home. After one year, another pizza restaurant opened across the street, creating competition. During the next few months, business steadily declined. As a result of the loss in business, the owner informed the employee that unless he agreed to take a cut in his salary, the employee would be fired. Reluctantly, the employee orally consented to a salary reduction of $500 per month. By the terms of their oral agreement, the owner promised to continue to pay $1,000 to the employee, but to pay only $500 per month to the nursing home. If the nursing home brings suit against the owner for breach of contract, who is most likely to prevail?\n\nA. The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause.\nB. The owner, because the agreement between the owner and the employee reduced the owner's obligations to the nursing home.\nC. The nursing home, because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\nD. The nursing home, because the mother's gratuitous assignment was irrevocable.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is D. The nursing home, because the mother's gratuitous assignment was irrevocable.\n\nIn a gratuitous assignment, the assignee has no legal right or interest in the subject matter of the assignment, and the assignor retains all rights to it. In this case, the mother did not have any legal interest in the subject matter of the assignment (her own money), and the owner retained all rights to the money. Therefore, the mother's assignment to the nursing home was valid and binding on both parties.\n\nHowever, the owner's promise to pay $1,000 per month to the employee without regard to the nursing home's payment is not a legally binding obligation. This means that the owner cannot unilaterally reduce the amount of money owed to the nursing home by $500 per month without the employee's consent. Therefore, if the nursing home brings suit against the owner for breach of contract, the nursing home is most likely to prevail because the owner's promise to continue paying $1,000 per month to the employee is not a legally binding obligation."
