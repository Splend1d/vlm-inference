He believed that this means that the Earth must be very old, as there is evidence of many different types of geological processes happening simultaneously at once. For example, he believed that the Earth's surface could have been formed by the slow accumulation of sediment over millions or billions of years. This would mean that the Earth's oldest rocks are likely to be found in its deepest layers, where they were subjected to the most extreme conditions."
