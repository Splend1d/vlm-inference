The temperature differences across the rod also vary linearly from 10\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C. \n\nBased on these conditions, we can see that:\n\n- The thermal conductivity (k) of aluminum is generally high.\n- The cross-sectional area of the rod is constant (since it's cylindrical), so the rate of heat transfer through the cross-section is proportional to the product of k and A.\n- However, the variation in the radius (Q) means there is a change in the cross-sectional area as you move from one end of the rod to the other.\n\nTherefore, both the length and the area of the rod will influence the rate of heat transfer. The choice that best describes how the rate of heat transfer depends on these factors is:\n\nC. Both the length and area\n\nThis means that while the length directly influences the rate of heat transfer due to its effect on the cross-sectional area, the area itself does not significantly affect the rate if the thermal conductivity remains constant. But as the length changes, the cross-sectional area changes accordingly, affecting the rate of heat transfer more directly."
