This indicates that the consumer surplus (the difference between what the consumer paid and what the consumer could have gotten if they had bought from another seller) is negative, meaning the consumer actually paid more than they would have otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is D. The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25."
