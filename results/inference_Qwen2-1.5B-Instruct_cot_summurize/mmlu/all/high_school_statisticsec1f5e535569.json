Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean.\n\nThis statement is only approximately true for normal distributions, but it is not universally true for all discrete random variables. For example, in a binomial distribution, there is no guarantee that any given outcome will occur with a certain frequency, and so the mean cannot be calculated using the formula for the expected value of a continuous random variable. Therefore, option D is incorrect for all discrete random variables."
