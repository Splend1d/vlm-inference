This is because leading questions are generally allowed on cross-examination under certain circumstances, such as when they are used to elicit information that would be difficult to obtain otherwise. In this case, it is unclear whether the question was intended to lead, but if it was asked in a way that suggests a particular answer, then it may be considered a leading question. However, without more context about the specific language of the question, it is difficult to determine with certainty how the court will rule."
