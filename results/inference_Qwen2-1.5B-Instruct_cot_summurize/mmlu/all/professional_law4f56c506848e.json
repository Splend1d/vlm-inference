An implied-in-fact contract.\n\nAn implied-in-fact contract occurs when a party agrees to something in such a way that it would be unreasonable for them not to do so. In this case, a client accepts the services of an attorney without an agreement concerning the amount of the fee. This situation can be considered as an implied-in-fact contract because it would be unreasonable for the client not to agree to pay the agreed-upon fees.\n\nAn implied-in-law contract refers to a contract that arises from law or custom and is enforceable regardless of whether it was expressly agreed upon. An express contract, on the other hand, requires explicit agreement between the parties involved. Finally, no contract exists if there is no agreement at all."
