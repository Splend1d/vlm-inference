All of the above\n\nAccording to social psychology, individuals tend to be drawn to others who share their attitudes and beliefs because it can provide them with a sense of belonging and validation. This can lead to positive reinforcement when they agree with each other, as it confirms their perceptions and thoughts. Additionally, anticipating positive interactions with someone who shares their views can also contribute to attraction. Therefore, all of these factors combined make people more likely to be attracted to those who are similar to them in terms of attitudes."
