Entitlement programs\n\nEntitlement programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, are designed to provide benefits to individuals based on their age, income, or other criteria. These programs are funded through payroll taxes paid by workers and employers, which are then used to pay out these benefits to eligible recipients.\n\nWhile some of these programs, such as Social Security, have been criticized for being too expensive and unsustainable in the long term, they still represent a significant portion of the federal budget and are considered an important source of automatic spending for the government."
