In the contract of sale, Beeson and Sloan agreed that the property was to be used for the purpose of building a commercial shopping mall. The contract required Beeson to pay Sloan a deposit of $12,500, with the balance of the purchase price payable at closing a month later on December 1. On November 24, the city council rezoned the property so that it could be used only for single-family residential purposes. As a consequence, Beeson refused to honor the contract. Sloan now brings an action for specific performance arguing that the doctrine of equitable conversion places the loss on the buyer. Beeson argues that to enforce the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him. If judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because\n\nA. Sloan assumed the risk.\nB. Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\nC. legal title remained in Sloan.\nD. equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n"

Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\n\nUnder the doctrine of equitable conversion, if the buyer (Beeson) fails to perform their contractual obligation due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control, such as changes in zoning laws, they may be entitled to recover the benefit of the bargain from the seller (Sloan). However, if the seller does not assume the risk of the buyer's failure to perform, then the buyer cannot recover the benefit of the bargain under this doctrine. \n\nIn this case, the city council changed the zoning laws after the contract was signed, which caused Beeson to refuse to honor the contract. This change in circumstances was unforeseeable by both parties, and thus, Beeson should be held responsible for the loss. Therefore, the court is likely to rule in favor of Beeson, as he did not have any control over the zoning change and therefore cannot be considered unjustly enriched by it."
