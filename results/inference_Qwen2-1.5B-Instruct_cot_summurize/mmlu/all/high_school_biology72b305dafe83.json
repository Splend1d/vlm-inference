The energy of electrons passing along the electron transport chain is the direct energy source that allows ATP synthase to produce ATP in mitochondria. This process occurs through the electron transport chain, which generates a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane and uses this gradient to pump protons into the matrix, creating a concentration gradient for ATP synthesis."
