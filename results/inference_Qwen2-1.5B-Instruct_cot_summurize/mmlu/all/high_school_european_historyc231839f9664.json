It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nThe Communist Manifesto can be understood as an example of the influence of which mode of modern European thinking?\n\nA.

Materialism and economic determinism\n\nThe Communist Manifesto is written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who were both influenced by materialist philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of material factors such as money, property, and exchange value in determining social structure and human behavior. This mode of thinking aligns closely with the concept of economic determinism, which posits that the state of society is determined by its economic structures and relationships between different classes.\n\nIn contrast, the concepts of the Oxford Movement, Hegelian idealism, and the rationalism of the Scottish Enlightenment do not provide a basis for understanding class struggles or the development of modern capitalism. These philosophical traditions focus on individualism, spiritual values, and reason rather than on the material conditions that underlie societal organization and conflict."
