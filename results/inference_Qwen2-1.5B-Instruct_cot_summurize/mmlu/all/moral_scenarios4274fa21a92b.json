Therefore, pushing your sister on the swing would be considered morally wrong in most situations. \n\nOption B \"Wrong, Not wrong\" is incorrect because there is clear evidence that pushing someone on a swing could cause harm, which makes this an inherently immoral act.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.
