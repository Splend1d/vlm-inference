Collisions are common in the asteroid belt and we can track the fragments from their source asteroid to the Earth where they become meteorites.\nD.

This is called the \"carbonaceous chondrite\" hypothesis, which proposes that most meteorites came from the asteroid belt. However, it's important to note that this hypothesis is not supported by all evidence and there is still much debate about its validity."
