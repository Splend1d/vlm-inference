And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat was the likely cause of women not wearing the veil?\n\nA. They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam.\nB. It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.\nC. As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves.\nD. The climate of Mali makes veiling women impractical.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the information provided, it is most likely that the reason women did not veil themselves was due to their status as sexual objects and the fact that they were prevented from veiling themselves. The passage states that \"they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers,\" which suggests that they may have felt uncomfortable or restricted by the requirement to cover up. Additionally, the passage mentions that the women had friends and companions from outside the prohibited degrees of marriage, which could indicate that they were not considered equal partners in society and therefore did not feel compelled to adhere to societal norms related to gender roles and dress. Therefore, options B and C are both plausible explanations based on the information provided. Option A is also possible given the context of the passage, but it is less supported by the evidence."
