So option A is incorrect.\nOption C is correct: if A and B are similar matrices, then so are A - 2I and B - 2I. This is because the similarity transformation preserves the relation between the matrices, i.e., it maps one matrix to another while preserving their relation with respect to the other matrix. \nOption D is incorrect: the three statements given in the question do not guarantee that A and B have the same trace or that A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices. For example, if A = B, then they will have the same trace but A^-1 and B^-1 may not be similar matrices. Similarly, even if A and B have the same trace, they could still be different matrices and thus not be similar. Therefore, options B and D cannot both be true simultaneously.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
