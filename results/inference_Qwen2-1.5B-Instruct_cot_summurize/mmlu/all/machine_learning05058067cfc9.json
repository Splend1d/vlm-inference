Convolutional Networks\n\nConvolutional networks have been shown to perform exceptionally well in image classification tasks due to their ability to process and extract features from high-resolution images efficiently. They are particularly effective at recognizing patterns within the image data that can be useful for classifying different objects or categories.\n\nGraph-based methods (such as Graph Neural Networks) might be considered if the focus is on understanding complex relationships between nodes in the image rather than extracting features directly. However, for high-resolution image classification, the convolutional network approach is generally preferred because it is computationally efficient and has been proven to outperform other architectures like Fully Connected Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks in many scenarios. \n\nRBF Networks are another type of neural network that could potentially be used in this context but are not typically associated with high-resolution image classification tasks. RBF Networks are known for their non-linear capabilities, but they are less suitable for high-dimensional feature spaces compared to Convolutional Networks."
