                    "text": "The answer is B. The ring of integers modulo 11.\nIn the ring of integers modulo 11 (also known as the ring of integers mod 1), every element can be expressed in the form $n \\cdot 11 = n$, where $n$ is an integer. This means that any two nonzero elements can be multiplied together to give another nonzero element, since they are both multiples of the same number (1).\nHowever, if we consider the ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1], then not all nonzero elements will have multiplicative inverses. For example, the function $f(x) = x^2$ has no inverse because its derivative is undefined at $x=0$. Therefore, it is not possible for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero in this case.\nFinally, in the ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}, the only way for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero would be if one element was the negative of the other. However, there are no nonzero rational numbers whose square is -1, so this cannot happen in this ring either. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
