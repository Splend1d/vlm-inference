                    "text": "The correct answer is D: The hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart.\n\nDuring the boiling process, the temperature of the liquid increases as the molecules gain kinetic energy and start to move faster. This movement causes the molecules to interact more strongly with each other, forming stronger hydrogen bonds between them. As these bonds become weaker due to the increased kinetic energy, the overall stability of the NH3 molecule decreases, leading to the breaking of the bonds and the formation of gas bubbles."
