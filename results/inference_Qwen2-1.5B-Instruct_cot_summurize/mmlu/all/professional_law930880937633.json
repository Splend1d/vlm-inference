She saw a newspaper ad offering a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25,000, The ad also gave a website address \"to view a picture of the car,\" which Carol visited, and which showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol paid the $25,000 and signed a sales contract which specified that the Thunderbird was \"used and sold as is.\" When Carol went to pick up the car, she learned it was a 1968 model, which was not at all rare and worth much less than the advertised 1964 model. If Carol brings suit against the seller, the likely outcome is for\n\nA. Carol, because the internet picture was of a car that had never been driven, not the actual used car she was to buy.\nB. The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold \"as is.\"\nC. The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.\nD. Carol, because the \"as is\" disclosure was not totally effective.\n"

The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold \"as is.\"\n\nWhen a buyer buys an item, they have the right to know what they are getting into. In this case, the seller made a clear statement about the condition of the car being \"used and sold as is.\" This means that the car is in a usable but imperfect state, and the buyer should expect any defects or damages to be disclosed upfront.\n\nIn Carol's case, she knew from the advertisement that the car was described as a 1964 Thunderbird, but when she arrived at the seller's location, she discovered that the car was actually a 1968 model. This information would have been relevant to her decision-making process and should have informed her expectations regarding the condition of the car.\n\nTherefore, if Carol brought suit against the seller, the court is more likely to find in favor of the seller, based on the seller's clear and explicit disclaimer of the car's true condition."
