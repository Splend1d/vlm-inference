An inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes\n\nThis means that the image of distant objects is inverted and located behind the eye. The focal length of the corrective lens used to treat myopia is typically around 12-24mm, which results in a virtual image at a distance of 20cm from the eye (assuming a spherical lens). Since the image is inverted, it will be located behind the eye, creating an image that is 20cm behind the eye."
