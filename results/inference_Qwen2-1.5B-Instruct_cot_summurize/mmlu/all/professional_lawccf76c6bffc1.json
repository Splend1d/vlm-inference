Adjoining the quarry to the west is a 10-acre ranch, owned by a librarian. In order to gain access to the highway, the teacher has been granted an easement to cross over the ranch using the road along the ranch's southernmost boundary. The teacher has recently purchased a 12-acre farm, which abuts the ranch, but is not appurtenant to the quarry. Directly north of the farm is the ranch and directly west is the highway. The teacher has begun constructing a farmhouse on the farm and is using the existing easement (across the ranch) to gain access to the 1 2acre farm. The teacher has never received permission from the librarian to use the road across the ranch to gain access to the farm. In an appropriate action by the librarian to enjoin the teacher from using the existing easement to gain access to the farm, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. succeed, because the teacher is making use of the servient tenement beyond the scope and extent of the easement as it was originally created.\nB. succeed, because the teacher has no right to use the servient tenement in connection with a tract of land that is not part of the dominant tenement.\nC. not succeed, because the teacher has an easement by necessity.\nD. not succeed, because the teacher has a right to use the easement in a manner not inconsistent with the rights of the owner of the servient tenement.\n"

However, if the servient tenement is not being used in conjunction with the dominant tenement, then the easement may be considered invalid.\n\nIn this case, the teacher has constructed a farmhouse on the 12-acre farm and is using the existing easement to gain access to the 12-acre farm. This means that the teacher is now using the servient tenement beyond its original scope and extent, which would make the easement invalid. Therefore, the librarian can successfully enjoin the teacher from using the existing easement to gain access to the farm."
