The woman purchased an owner's policy of title insurance before the an owner's policy of title insurance before the closing. Because of an error by the title insurance company, the title commitment and title policy failed to list a county tax lien encumbering the lot as an exception to coverage. Last year, the woman conveyed the lot for a bargain price by a quitclaim deed to a friend, who paid cash, did not conduct a title search, and did not purchase title insurance. Subsequently, the county began proceedings to foreclose the tax lien, and the friend filed a claim with the woman's title insurance company, demanding that the company reimburse her for the tax lien amount. Is the title insurance company obligated to pay the friend's claim?\n\nA. No, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.\nB. No, because the title insurance policy expired when the woman conveyed the lot to the friend.\nC. Yes, because the tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy.\nD. Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss.\n"

Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss.\n\nUnder the law of property insurance, a covenant against encumbrances is a provision in a title insurance policy that guarantees that the title to the property will remain free from certain types of liens or encumbrances until the policy expires or is canceled. If the title insurance company fails to disclose a lien that is listed as an exception on the title policy, it can be considered a breach of its duty to defend the insured against claims arising out of the covered premises.\n\nIn this case, the title insurance company had an obligation to inform the insured about the existence of the county tax lien on the lot. However, due to an error in their policies, they failed to do so. As a result, the friend may have been exposed to potential liability if the tax lien were to be enforced against the lot.\n\nTherefore, under the terms of the title insurance policy, the woman (the insured) would be responsible for reimbursing the friend for any losses resulting from the failure to disclose the lien. In this scenario, the friend's claim is supported by the fact that she has suffered a loss due to the lien being undisclosed, and therefore, the title insurance company should be held liable for covering the friend's potential loss."
