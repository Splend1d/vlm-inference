When they got there, they saw a high-ticket group, apparently high-society people, attending an air history video. They took over the meeting room, waving their guns menacingly, and demanded their watches, wallets and jewelry. When they took inventory of their bounty, they found that the customers were actually from a university history club and that they had little real jewelry, watches or wallets, they became enraged and struck several of the participants, killing one and badly injuring another. Which of the following is the most accurate list of common law crimes that they may likely be convicted of? Do not select attempted crimes if they were consummated.\n\nA. Attempted burglary, robbery and attempted murder.\nB. False imprisonment, attempted murder and murder.\nC. False imprisonment, robbery, aggravated assault, and murder.\nD.
