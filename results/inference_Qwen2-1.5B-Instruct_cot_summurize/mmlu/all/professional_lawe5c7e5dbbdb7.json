They decided on strychnine poisoning, which the friend told them how to get and they went and got it. When they asked the friend to go forward in poisoning the victim, he refused, saying, \"I'm was only here for planning and advice, but I never intended to commit murder.\" The man and his brother took the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but he wouldn't drink. They were caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. Which of the following most accurately states the criminal responsibility of each of the three men?\n\nA. The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.\nB. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.\nC. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.\nD. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n"

The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.\n\nAccording to the law, the man and his brother had agreed on a plan to murder the neighbor, so they can be charged with conspiracy (the agreement). However, the friend did not intend to commit murder, so he cannot be held criminally responsible for anything. He was only involved in planning and giving advice, so he can be charged with criminal conspiracy."
