This can lead to an increase in the number of customers who choose not to make payments on time, resulting in higher levels of bad debt. However, if this action is similar to that taken by other companies and leads to a perception of increased customer confidence or willingness to pay off debts, it may actually lead to a decrease in bad debt losses as customers feel more secure about making timely payments. This could potentially lead to an increase in sales and higher profits."
