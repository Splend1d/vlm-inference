Party activists are typically those who are involved in political campaigns and fundraising efforts within their party. They tend to be more conservative than the average Republican voter due to their involvement in these activities.\n\nIt is also true that some moderate Republicans may struggle to win over voters in the primary process, but this does not necessarily mean that they are more conservative than other Republicans. It could simply be that they are not as well-known or well-organized as more conservative candidates, which can make it harder for them to gain traction in the primary process. Additionally, many moderate Republicans do care about their party's nominee sharing their political views, so it is possible that some moderate Republicans may still support a candidate with whom they disagree on certain issues."
