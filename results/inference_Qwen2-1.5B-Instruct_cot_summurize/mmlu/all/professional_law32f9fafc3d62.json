At the time, no one was in the treatment room except the doctor and the child; the mother had left the room to get a cup of coffee. Two weeks later, when the child told her mother what had occurred in the treatment room, the mother suffered severe emotional distress that caused her to become physically ill. In an action against the doctor by the mother on her own behalf to recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress, is the mother likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the mother was contributorily negligent in leaving the child alone with the doctor during treatment.\nB. No, because the mother was neither the direct victim of the doctor's conduct nor a contemporaneous witness.\nC. Yes, because the doctor's conduct was outrageous.\nD. Yes, because the mother's distress was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the doctor's conduct. \u0080\u0083\n"

Yes, because the doctor's conduct was outrageous.\n\nIntentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) requires four elements: (1) harm must be inflicted intentionally or recklessly; (2) the harm must be severe; (3) the harm must be of mental origin; and (4) the harm must be the natural and foreseeable result of the defendant's conduct. The fourth element, \"natural and foreseeable,\" means that the harm must not be so remote as to be outside the scope of the relationship between the parties involved.\n\nIn this case, the mother's distress is not justifiable under any of the above factors. Leaving the child alone with a doctor during treatment without supervision would indeed constitute an act of negligence on the part of the mother, but it does not make the doctor's conduct outrageous. Similarly, the mother's distress was not caused by the doctor's conduct itself, but rather by her own emotional response to the incident. Therefore, even if the doctor's conduct were considered outrageous, the mother's distress would still not qualify as IIED."
