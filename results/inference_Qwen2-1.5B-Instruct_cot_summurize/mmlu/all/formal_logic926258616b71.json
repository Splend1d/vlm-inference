This means that if someone is a king, then by definition they are not a pauper and therefore, they are more likely to be lucky than those who are not kings. The second part of the statement uses the same principle but reverses the direction, stating that if someone is lucky, then they must also be a pauper. Therefore, the overall conclusion is that being a king guarantees you will be more likely to be lucky than being a pauper."
