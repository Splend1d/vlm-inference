However, they may be more accepting of casual relationships and sexual experimentation outside of marriage. Additionally, individuals with liberal attitudes towards premarital sex may be more open to exploring their sexuality through different means such as swinging, which involves multiple partners engaging in sexual activities together. It's important to note that everyone's views on premarital sex are unique and can vary depending on individual beliefs, values, and experiences."
