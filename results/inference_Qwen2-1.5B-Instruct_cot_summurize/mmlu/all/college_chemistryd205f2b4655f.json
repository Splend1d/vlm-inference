Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a capillary column followed by electron capture detection\n\nThis method is suitable for measuring trace amounts of CFCs because it can detect very small concentrations of the compound and provides good sensitivity and selectivity. The use of electron capture detection (ECD) makes this technique particularly useful for detecting small amounts of analytes in complex mixtures.\n\nThe other options are not appropriate for measuring sub-ppb levels of CFCs:\n\nB. Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a packed column followed by thermal conductivity detection - This method may not provide sufficient sensitivity or selectivity for measuring low concentrations of CFCs.\n\nC. Gas chromatographic separation of the air sample on a capillary column followed by flame ionization detection - While this method could potentially measure trace amounts of CFCs, it does not specifically target these compounds and may not be as sensitive or selective as ECD.\n\nD. Conversion of the sample of the chlorinated compounds to chloride ions, followed by titration with Ag+ - This method converts the chlorinated compounds into chloride ions, which can then be measured using a titration with silver ions. However, this approach is not specific to CFCs and may not be effective for measuring these compounds in a gas sample."
