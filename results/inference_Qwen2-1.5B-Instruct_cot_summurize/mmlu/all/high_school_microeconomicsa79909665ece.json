This means that the firm is earning zero economic profit, which implies that the long-run price is equal to the minimum average total cost (ATC) of producing at that level of output. If the long-run price is above minimum average total cost, it indicates that the firm is not earning enough to cover its variable costs, leading to inefficiency.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer."
