The hypotenuse of these two triangles will give us the total distance from the starting point.\n\nLet \\(d\\) be the length of the hypotenuse in miles. Then:\n\n\\[ d^2 = 3^2 + 10^2 = 9 + 100 = 109 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{109} \\approx 10.56 \\]\n\nSo, the person is approximately 10.56 miles away from their starting point. The closest answer choice is B. 6.7."
