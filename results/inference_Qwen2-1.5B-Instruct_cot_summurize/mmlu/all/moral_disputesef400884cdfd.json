However, this approach has been criticized for failing to take into account the importance of other factors such as a person's character, virtues, and relationships with others. In particular, some argue that it can lead to actions that conflict with the principles of justice or compassion if they prioritize outcomes over individual well-being.\n\nTherefore, option B (that it can run counter to a person's ability to integrate their commitments) is the most relevant to the given argument."
