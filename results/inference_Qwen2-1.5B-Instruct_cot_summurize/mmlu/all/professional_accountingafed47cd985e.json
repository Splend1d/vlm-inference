Therefore, if there were 1,000 shares of common stock outstanding before the dividend was declared, after the dividend is distributed, there will only be 1,000 - (1,000 * 0.3) = 1,000 - 300 = 700 shares remaining. Since each share is worth $10, the total value of the remaining shares will be $10 * 700 = $7,000. This amount is recorded in the balance sheet under \"common stock\" and is debited from it.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct."
