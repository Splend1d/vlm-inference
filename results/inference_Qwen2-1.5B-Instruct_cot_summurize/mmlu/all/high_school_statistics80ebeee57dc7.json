This can lead to unnecessary closures of parks, which could have negative impacts on community health and economic activity.\n\nType II errors occur when the alternative hypothesis (the park has lead contamination beyond the allowed limit) is not rejected even though it is true. However, in this scenario, we're considering a Type I error where the park should be kept open because the lead levels exceed the allowed limit."
