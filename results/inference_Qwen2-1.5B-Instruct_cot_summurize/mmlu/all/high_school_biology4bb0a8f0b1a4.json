HIV can change its surface proteins and resist vaccines.\nB. The patient must have become reinfected with 3TC-resistant viruses.\nC. HIV began making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug.\nD. A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n"

A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.\n\nThis occurs when a virus mutates to become resistant to a specific medication, like 3TC. When the medication is administered, it targets only some of the virus's genetic material, leaving behind other viral components that aren't affected by the drug. Over time, as more of these \"resistant\" viruses reproduce, they become increasingly common, while less resistant viruses die off. This process is called natural selection, where traits that improve an organism's chances of survival are passed on to future generations. In this case, the resistance trait becomes more prevalent among the HIV population because it allows the virus to survive longer under treatment."
