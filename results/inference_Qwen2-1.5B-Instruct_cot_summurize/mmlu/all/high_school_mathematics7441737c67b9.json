                    "text": " The problem states that Alex walks 3 feet for the first stone, then 5 feet for the second stone, and so on. This means he increases his walking distance by a factor of $n$ (where $n$ is the number of stones) every time.\n\nSo, for the first stone, Alex walks $3 = 3^1$ feet.\nFor the second stone, Alex walks $5 = 3 \\cdot 2$ feet.\nFor the third stone, Alex walks $7 = 3 \\cdot 4$ feet.\nAnd so on.\n\nIn general, for the $k$th stone, Alex walks $3 \\cdot k$ feet.\n\nThe total distance Alex walks can be expressed as the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\\[S = 3 + 5 + 7 + \\dots + 3(50-1).\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[S = 3(1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 49).\\]\n\nThe sum of the first $n$ positive integers is given by $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. So we have:\n\\[S = 3\\left(\\frac{49 \\cdot 50}{2}\\right) = 3 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 25 = 153 \\cdot 25 = 3825.\\]\n\nHowever, this is not one of the options provided. Let's re-examine our calculation. We made a mistake in calculating the sum of the first $n$ positive integers. The correct formula should be $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, but when we apply it here, we get $\\frac{49 \\cdot 50}{2} = 153 \\cdot 25 = 3825$, which is incorrect.\n\nLet's correct this: the sum of the first $n$ positive integers is actually $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, but when applied here, we need to substitute $n=50$:\n\\[S = 3 \\cdot \\frac{50 \\cdot 51}{2} = 3 \\cdot 1275 = 3825.\\]\n\nNow let's calculate the total distance Alex walks. Since he walks 3 feet for the first stone, and then 5 feet for the next one, and so on, the distance he walks can be represented by the sum of an arithmetic series with common difference 2:\n\\[T = 3(1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 49) + 2(1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 49).\\]\n\nAgain, the sum of the first $n$ positive integers is $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, but now we use $n=50$:\n\\[T = 3 \\cdot \\frac{50 \\cdot 51}{2} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{50 \\cdot 51}{2} = 3 \\cdot 1275 + 2 \\cdot 1275 = 3825 + 2550 = 6375.\\]\n\nTherefore, the total distance Alex walked is 6375 feet, which corresponds to option D."
