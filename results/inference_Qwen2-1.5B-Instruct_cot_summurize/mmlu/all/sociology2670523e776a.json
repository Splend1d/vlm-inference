Television based on producer-broadcaster rather than publisher-broadcaster models.\n\nIn post-fordist media production and consumption, there has been a shift towards more diverse and specialized product offerings. This includes a wide variety of content aimed at different age groups, interests, and lifestyles. However, the focus has shifted from mass-produced standardized products to a more personalized approach, with producers tailoring content to specific audiences.\n\nAdditionally, the role of traditional media outlets like television has evolved. Instead of being primarily focused on advertising, they now offer a mix of programming that caters to different tastes and interests. The rise of streaming services and online platforms has also contributed to this trend, as these channels have become primary distribution points for entertainment content.\n\nRegarding advertisements, while they still play an important role in media production and consumption, their function has changed significantly over time. In the past, ads were typically seen as a way to sell products directly to consumers. Today, however, advertisers use various tactics to engage with viewers and create a connection with their target audience. This can include sponsored content, influencer marketing, and other creative strategies that aim to build brand awareness and foster engagement with consumers."
