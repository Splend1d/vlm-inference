In a closed family, members may not communicate effectively or openly with each other, which can lead to feelings of isolation and detachment from one another. This type of family may also have limited communication about important decisions, such as a child's behavior or legal issues.\n\nIn the given scenario, the family is described as having a closed structure due to the lack of communication between the parents and the child. The mother's indifference towards her son's actions and the father's absence at the court hearing suggest that there is a lack of open communication within the family. Additionally, the fact that the sister cannot attend the court hearing due to her homework suggests that there is also an issue with the family's ability to support each other during difficult times.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate description of this family from the perspective of structural family therapy is B. closed."
