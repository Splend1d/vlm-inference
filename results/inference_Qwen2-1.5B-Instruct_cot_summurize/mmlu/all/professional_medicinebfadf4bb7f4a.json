He also has had fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting since he returned from summer camp 2 days ago. His parents say he does not use illicit drugs. On arrival, he is combative and there is evidence of hallucinations. His temperature is 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. A lumbar puncture is performed. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis show cysts and trophozoites. The most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is which of the following?\n\nA. Facial nerve\nB. Frontal sinus\nC. Mastoid sinus\nD. Olfactory nerve\n"

Cysticercosis is caused by the parasitic roundworm\u5375\u5706\u866b, which is commonly found in soil and contaminated water sources. It can enter the body through broken skin or mucous membranes, including the eyes, nose, mouth, and gastrointestinal tract. Infections can also occur through the bloodstream if the worm enters the brain. The symptoms you described suggest a possible infection with the roundworm, which could be causing the fever, headache, stiffness, and vomiting. However, it's important to note that this diagnosis should be confirmed by further testing such as imaging studies or laboratory tests."
