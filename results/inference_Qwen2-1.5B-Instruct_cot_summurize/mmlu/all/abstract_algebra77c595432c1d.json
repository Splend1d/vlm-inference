However, this is not necessarily true. For example, consider the cyclic group C_{15} under addition modulo 15. This group has only one element of order 15 (the identity element), but does not contain any other elements of order 15. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\nStatement 2 is correct because it states that if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, then it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. This is because by Lagrange's theorem, the number of elements of each finite order divisor of the order of the group must divide the order of the group. In particular, for any prime power p^k, the order of the group generated by a single element of order p^k is always divisible by p^(k+1). Thus, if the group contains more than 8 elements of order p^k for some prime power p^k, then it must also contain at least 16 elements of order p^(k+1) for all such powers. Therefore, Statement 2 is true."
