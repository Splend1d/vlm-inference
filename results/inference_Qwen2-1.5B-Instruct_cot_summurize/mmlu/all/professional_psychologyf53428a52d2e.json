In this case, the original IQ test was administered to a ten-year-old child, and his score was 130. Since the ceiling effect applies, it is reasonable to assume that any subsequent IQ test administered to the same individual would likely yield a lower score.\n\nTherefore, option B (less than 130) is the most likely answer based on the given information."
