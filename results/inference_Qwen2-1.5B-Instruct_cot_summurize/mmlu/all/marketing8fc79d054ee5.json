Inelastic demand occurs when the quantity demanded does not change much when the price changes, indicating that the good or service is relatively insensitive to price fluctuations. This type of demand is characterized by low elasticity, meaning that small changes in price have little effect on the quantity demanded. In contrast, elastic demand occurs when the quantity demanded changes significantly with a change in price, indicating that the good or service is more responsive to price changes."
