The state law, however, does permit illegitimate children to inherit from and through their mothers. A man died intestate, leaving neither spouse nor any children other than an illegitimate son. The man's wife and his daughter died one year later in a motor vehicle accident. The illegitimate son filed suit in an appropriate court alleging that the state statute, which bars an illegitimate child from sharing in his father's estate is invalid, and that he should be declared the lawful heir of the man's estate. In challenging the validity of the state statute, will the illegitimate son prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because most state laws that discriminate against illegitimate children have been invalidated to ensure that a state's concern over illicit relationships is not the basis for punitive measures against the product of such a relationship.\nB. Yes, because he has been deprived of property without due process, since his fundamental right to inherit has been compromised without a compelling state need.\nC. No, because a state may promote the just and expeditious disposition of property at death by denying intestate succession to all illegitimate children.\nD. No, because discrimination against illegitimate children is not suspect and, therefore, the law does not violate the equal protection clause if it is substantially related to a legitimate state interest.\n"

Yes, because he has been deprived of property without due process, since his fundamental right to inherit has been compromised without a compelling state need.\n\nIn the case of a person who dies intestate (without a will), the state has the power to determine how the deceased's assets should be distributed among surviving family members or to distribute the entire estate to the state or public authority. However, under some state statutes, illegitimate children may be excluded from inheriting from their father's estate entirely.\n\nThis exclusion can be seen as discriminatory based on illegitimacy, as it discriminates against individuals solely on the basis of their biological parentage. It can also result in the deprivation of property without due process, which is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the illegitimate son would likely prevail in challenging the validity of the state statute, arguing that the exclusion of illegitimate children from inheriting from their fathers' estates violates their fundamental right to inherit and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
