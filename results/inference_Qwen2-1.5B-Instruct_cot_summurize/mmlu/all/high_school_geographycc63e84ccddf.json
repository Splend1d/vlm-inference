Rank-size rule\n\nThe Urban Hierarchy Model, also known as the Burgess's Sector Model, posits that cities with higher populations tend to have larger sectors or regions within them than those with lower populations. This means that the size of a city is directly related to the number of people living there and not their rank in the hierarchy. The model suggests that the density of a city depends on the size of its central area and the distance from it."
