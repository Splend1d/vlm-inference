PCP is a potent hallucinogen that can cause severe psychiatric symptoms, including paranoia, aggression, and violence, when used in large doses. It is often used as an amphetamine substitute and is known for its high euphoric effects. In this case, the patient's aggressive behavior and hostility during the physical examination suggest that they may have ingested PCP."
