                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The intergenerational storm refers to the problem that the bad effects of current carbon dioxide emissions will fall largely on future generations. This means that the consequences of climate change, such as rising sea levels and more frequent extreme weather events, will be felt by future generations who have not contributed to these problems through their own actions or behaviors. As a result, they may bear the brunt of the costs associated with addressing climate change, such as increased insurance premiums and lost economic opportunities. Therefore, it is important for all individuals and governments to take action to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change on future generations."
