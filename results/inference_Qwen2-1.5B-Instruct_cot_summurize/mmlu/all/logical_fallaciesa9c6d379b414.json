The fallacy of special pleading occurs when someone argues that their own beliefs or actions are more important or valid than those of others based on how they were presented or argued about. This is often done by using emotionally charged language or making sweeping generalizations that apply only to specific instances or contexts. It is also known as \"ad hominem\" attack, where the argument is made against the person rather than the argument itself."
