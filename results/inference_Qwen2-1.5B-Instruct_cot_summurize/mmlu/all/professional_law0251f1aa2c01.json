The organization usually used leafleting and public speeches to advance this view, but it sometimes engaged in violent demonstrations against the embassies and consuls of those countries. Although the woman had never participated in a violent demonstration, she was criminally prosecuted for being a member of the organization. In her defense, the woman claimed that her association with the organization was protected by the First Amendment. Which of the following would the prosecution need to prove to overcome that defense?\n\nA. The woman joined the organization with the specific intent of furthering its illegal activities.\nB. The woman provided material aid to the organization through the payment of dues before the violent demonstrations.\nC. The woman continued to provide material aid to the organization through the payment of dues after the violent demonstrations.\nD. The woman expressed public support of the organization after the violent demonstrations.\n"

This is because joining an organization solely for the purpose of participating in illegal activities can be considered an attempt to commit a crime under criminal law. If the prosecution were able to establish that the woman intended to use the organization's advocacy to advance illegal activities, then they could argue that her membership in the organization should not be protected under the First Amendment."
