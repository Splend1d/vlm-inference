However, this does not necessarily mean that all values between \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) will have the same value of \\(f\\). For example, if \\(f(x) = 2x + 1\\), then for any real number \\(a < b\\), we can find such points like \\((a, 3a+1)\\) or \\((b, 4b+1)\\) but not always exactly equal to the midpoint (\\(c = \\frac{a+b}{2}\\)).\n\nB. \\(f(c) \\neq f(d)\\): This is the opposite of A, so it must be false in order for B to be TRUE.\n\nC. \\(f(c) > f(d)\\): This is also possible if \\(f\\) is increasing (or decreasing) enough for the difference between the two points to be positive. If \\(f\\) is strictly increasing, then no matter how close \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) are, \\(f(c) > f(d)\\).\n\nD. \\(f(c) < f(d)\\): This is also possible if \\(f\\) is decreasing (or increasing) enough for the difference between the two points to be negative. If \\(f\\) is strictly decreasing, then again, there would be no specific case where \\(f(c) < f(d)\\).\n\nIn summary:\n- Statement A is possible.\n- Statement B is definitely FALSE.\n- Statements C and D are both POSSIBLE.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B**."
