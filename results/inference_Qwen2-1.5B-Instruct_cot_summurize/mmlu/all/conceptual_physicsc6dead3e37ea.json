This causes the light to bend or refract, and the amount of bending depends on the angle of incidence and the index of refraction of the material through which the light is traveling. The angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence, so the wavelength of the light is reduced as it travels away from the surface. Therefore, the correct answer is B. wavelength."
