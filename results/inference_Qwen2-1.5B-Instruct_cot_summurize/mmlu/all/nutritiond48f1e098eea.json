All of the above.\n\nThe complex interplay between dietary cholesterol, absorption, export, and clearance pathways within the body makes it difficult to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship between dietary intake and plasma LDL cholesterol levels. Factors such as genetic variations, age, sex, and other health conditions can also influence these processes. Therefore, there may not be enough conclusive evidence to determine whether dietary cholesterol has an impact on plasma LDL cholesterol levels."
