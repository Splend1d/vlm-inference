Environmental constraints can limit conventional economic growth, posing a direct threat to economic security and development.\nB. Environmental changes, such as rising sea levels, can threaten the land on which populations are settled as well as their access to resources. Migration as a result of these changes presents threats to societal, economic and other sectors of security.\nC. Environmental degradation and increased demand for resources is likely to lead to scarcity and result in conflict.\nD. All of these options.\n"

These issues can affect economic stability, social cohesion, and political stability, leading to conflicts over resources and territory. For example, droughts and floods caused by climate change can disrupt food production and cause displacement, while deforestation and pollution can harm ecosystems and human health, leading to conflicts over resources and livelihoods. Additionally, resource scarcity due to environmental degradation can fuel competition among nations and exacerbate existing geopolitical tensions. Therefore, environmental issues present a significant concern for peace researchers in the twenty-first century."
