So the area of the rectangle is $A = (3x)(x+5) = 3x^2 + 15x$.\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula $P = 2(l+w)$, so in this case, we have $P = 2(3x + x + 5) = 8x + 10$.\n\nWe are told that the area and perimeter of the rectangle are equal, so we can set up the equation $3x^2 + 15x = 8x + 10$.\n\nTo solve for $x$, we first subtract $8x + 10$ from both sides to get $3x^2 + 7x - 10 = 0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it by factoring: $(3x-5)(x+2)=0$.\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions $x=5/3$ and $x=-2$.\n\nHowever, since $x$ represents a dimension of a rectangle, it cannot be negative. Therefore, the only valid solution is $x = \\boxed{\\frac{10}{3}}$."
