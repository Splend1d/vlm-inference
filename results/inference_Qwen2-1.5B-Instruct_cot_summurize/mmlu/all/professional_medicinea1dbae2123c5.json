He says, \"I cannot go more than a day without cigarettes because I get so anxious and irritable. I even wake up at night to smoke.\" The patient began smoking cigarettes at age 12 years; he was smoking two packs of cigarettes daily by age 17 years, and he has not curtailed his use since that time. He does not drink alcoholic beverages or use illicit drugs. Medical history is remarkable for childhood febrile seizures. He takes no medications. Vital signs are normal. The patient is interested in using a nicotine patch and bupropion therapy because he says his friend found the treatments to be helpful. In combining these two therapies, this patient is at greatest risk for which of the following?\n\nA. Hypertension\nB. Polyuria\nC. Renal insufficiency\nD. The patient is at no increased risk\n"

                    "text": "The patient's history suggests that he may have developed nicotine dependence as an adult due to childhood febrile seizures. This condition can lead to the development of nicotine addiction and withdrawal symptoms if the patient stops smoking suddenly. Therefore, it is important to manage his withdrawal symptoms with a combination of nicotine patches and bupropion.\n\nNicotine patches help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting smoking. Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is a medication used to treat depression but also acts as a partial agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, leading to reduced craving and withdrawal symptoms when taken in conjunction with nicotine replacement therapy.\n\nBoth of these medications are safe for adults over 18 years old and should be started under close medical supervision. However, they do come with potential side effects such as nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, and weight gain.\n\nThe patient's greatest risk is likely to develop hypertension, polyuria, or renal insufficiency from the withdrawal symptoms. It is essential to monitor his blood pressure regularly during treatment and avoid excessive fluid intake, especially if he experiences polyuria. If any of these complications occur, immediate medical attention is necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, the patient is at highest risk of developing hypertension, polyuria, or renal insufficiency from the combined use of nicotine patches and bupropion therapy. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Renal insufficiency\n\nIt is important to note that this information is based on general guidelines and individual responses can vary significantly. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new treatment regimen."
