Object Relations Therapy is based on the idea that humans have a need for a secure base or object to rely on, and when this need is not met, it can lead to emotional distress and psychological problems. The therapist works with the client to explore their relationship with objects such as parents, siblings, and pets, and how these relationships impact their current functioning. This approach differs from Freudian psychoanalysis in that it focuses more on the present and future rather than past events, and it emphasizes the importance of the client's subjective experience of their own life."
