Acknowledging the force of the criticism that effective altruism is a band-aid approach and diffusing this same criticism can help us recognize our backup duties to donate to aid agencies. This will allow us to acknowledge the moral urgency of our duties to the global poor, even though they may seem less pressing than the criticism we might face from others who believe that effective altruism is not the right response to global poverty. \n\nEffective altruism is often criticized for being too focused on solving problems rather than addressing the root causes of those problems. However, by acknowledging these criticisms and working towards solutions that address the root causes of global poverty, we can demonstrate our commitment to helping the most vulnerable members of society. This can also help to diffuse any negative criticism or skepticism about our efforts to help the global poor.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer."
