However, it is not accurate to say that women only seek cosmetic surgery due to a \"deep-rooted sense of ineffectiveness\" or to be in pursuit of the \"perfect\" body, which can be influenced by societal pressure and unrealistic beauty standards. Additionally, it is not accurate to assume that men pressure women into seeking cosmetic surgery, as this is often perpetuated by media and cultural norms rather than individual behavior. Therefore, the most accurate answer would be C: women perceive a part of their body as stigmatizing, in relation to a cultural ideal."
