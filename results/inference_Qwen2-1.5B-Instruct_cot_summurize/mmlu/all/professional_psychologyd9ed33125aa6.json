Ethically acceptable since it serves the best interests of his clients.\n\nSliding scales or fee-for-service arrangements are allowed under ethical guidelines as long as they are fair and equitable, do not discriminate against any individual, and do not cause undue financial burden to individuals who cannot afford the full cost of services. In this case, Dr. Manzetti's sliding scale is likely being used to ensure that all clients have access to his services, regardless of their income level, which aligns with ethical standards. However, it's important to note that each situation may vary depending on local laws and regulations."
