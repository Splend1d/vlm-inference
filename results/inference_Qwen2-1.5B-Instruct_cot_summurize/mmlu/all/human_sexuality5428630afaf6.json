Vasocongestion refers to an increase in blood flow to certain areas of the body, such as the face or arms, which can cause redness and swelling. In some cases, vasocongestion can also occur in the genital area, leading to congestion and discomfort. However, this is not typically associated with muscle contraction, relaxation, or detumescence."
