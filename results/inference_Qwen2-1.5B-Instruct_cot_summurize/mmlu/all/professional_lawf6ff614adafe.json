The husband's wife now brings an action to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. The wife testified that she and her husband had a close relationship and that they were happily married for over 15 years. Then on cross-examination, defendant's counsel asked her if she \"was aware of the affair that her husband was having with his passenger?\"The wife's attorney immediately objected to this question. The judge should rule that the question is\n\nA. objectionable, because the question is beyond the scope of direct examination.\nB. objectionable, because it was highly prejudicial.\nC. unobjectionable, because plaintiff's knowledge of such an affair was probative of the value to be placed on her loss.\nD. unobjectionable, because it was relevant on the issue of negligence.\n"

Objectionable, because it was highly prejudicial.\n\nThe reason being that the question was asking about the wife's awareness of her husband's affair, which could potentially impact her testimony as to the nature and extent of their relationship, including any emotional or psychological harm caused by the affair. This type of evidence is often considered highly prejudicial and should not be allowed unless there is a strong showing that it will have no tendency to make the fact of the accident more probable or less probable than it otherwise would be. In this case, the question may have led the jury to believe that the wife's testimony was unreliable or biased, which could undermine the credibility of her claims of loss of society and companionship."
