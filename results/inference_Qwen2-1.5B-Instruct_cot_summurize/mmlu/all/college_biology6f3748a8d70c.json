                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Both fox and hare populations will decrease.\n\nWhen mites infect foxes, they can cause significant damage to their fur, leading to decreased body temperature and reduced feeding efficiency. This can lead to a decrease in food intake and, ultimately, a decrease in reproductive success. Therefore, fox populations may decrease as a result of mange mite infestations.\n\nOn the other hand, when mites infect hares, they do not have a direct impact on their survival or reproduction. Instead, they can cause discomfort and stress, which can lead to decreased growth rates and reduced fertility. However, these effects are generally less severe than those experienced by foxes, so hare populations may not be significantly affected by mange mite infestations.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that both fox and hare populations will decrease as a result of mange mite infestations."
