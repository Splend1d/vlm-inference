However, it is generally accepted that Mill believed that individuals have a duty to follow certain moral principles and values, such as the maxim \"the greatest happiness for the greatest number.\" He also believed that one's actions should be guided by reason and logic rather than arbitrary or subjective considerations.\n\nIn his book \"On Liberty,\" Mill argued that individuals have a right to pursue their own happiness and interests without interference from others, but this does not mean that they can do whatever they please. Instead, he proposed that individuals should be free to pursue their goals as long as they do not harm others or violate the rights of others. This approach is known as the \"maxims of liberty\" and involves considering the consequences of one's actions carefully before taking them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be either A) we should always calculate the expected consequences of our action or B) we should consult reasons and logic. It is important to note that these approaches may vary depending on cultural, religious, and philosophical beliefs."
