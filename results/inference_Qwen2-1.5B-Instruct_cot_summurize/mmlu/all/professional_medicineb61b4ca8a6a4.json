Gait analysis reveals a lack of fluid motion. Standing flexion test results are negative. Cruciate and collateral knee ligaments appear intact. Foot drop on the right is noted. The most likely diagnosis is\n\nA. anteriorly deviated distal femur\nB. plantar flexed cuboid\nC. posteriorly deviated fibular head\nD. unilateral sacral shear\n"

Unilateral Sacral Shear\n\nThis condition occurs when there is a disruption or injury to the sacroiliac joint, which connects the sacrum (the lower part of the spine) to the ilium (the hip bone). When the sacroiliac joint is injured, it can cause pain and instability in the pelvis, leading to a loss of stability during movements such as walking.\n\nIn this case, the patient's symptoms suggest that there may be an injury to the sacroiliac joint, which could explain why the standing flexion test results were negative and why the foot drop on the right is noted. However, without further information about the specific details of the patient's presentation, it is not possible to definitively diagnose the cause of these symptoms based solely on the given information."
