According to estimates, blue whales can live up to 100 years or more in captivity and over 200 years in the wild. The gorilla's lifespan is estimated to be around 30-40 years, while dogs have an average lifespan of around 10-15 years, and queen bees typically only live for about 6 months to a year. Therefore, the answer is B. Blue whale."
