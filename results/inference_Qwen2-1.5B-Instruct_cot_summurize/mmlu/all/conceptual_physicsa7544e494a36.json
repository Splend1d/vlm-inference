When a diver shines a flashlight upward towards the surface of the water at an angle of 20 degrees from the normal, the refractive index of water (1.33) is less than that of air (1.00). This means that the ray of light entering the water is bent downward by an amount equal to the difference in angles between the incident and emergent rays. In this case, the angle of incidence is 40 degrees (90 - 50) and the angle of refraction is 20 degrees (90 - 70), so the beam of light passes into the air above."
