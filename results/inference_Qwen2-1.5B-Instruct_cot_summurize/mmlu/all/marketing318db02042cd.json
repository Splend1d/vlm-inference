Indefinite price elasticity of demand.\n\nPrice elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to changes in the price of a good or service. It is defined as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price, and it can be positive or negative depending on whether the quantity demanded increases or decreases with an increase or decrease in price, respectively.\n\nIf the price elasticity of demand is zero, then a one percent increase in price results in no change in the quantity demanded. This means that the demand curve is perfectly elastic, meaning that the quantity demanded is completely insensitive to changes in price.\n\nIf the price elasticity of demand is infinite, then a one percent increase in price results in a large increase in the quantity demanded. This means that the demand curve is perfectly inelastic, meaning that the quantity demanded is completely insensitive to changes in price.\n\nIn this problem, the price elasticity of demand is neither zero nor infinite, but rather somewhere in between. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Indefinite price elasticity of demand."
