(i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nThe acf (autocorrelation function) and pacf (partial autocorrelation function) are statistical tools used in time series analysis to identify the order of a time series. They are often hard to interpret in practice because they involve complex mathematical functions that require specialized knowledge to understand. Additionally, calculating these functions for some data sets can be difficult due to issues such as outliers or missing values.\nInformation criteria, on the other hand, are used to determine the optimal number of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) parameters to include in a model. These criteria do not rely on the interpretation of the acf or pacf and are more straightforward to use in practice.\nFinally, it is important to note that applying information criteria correctly does not guarantee that the chosen model will always perform well. Other factors, such as the quality of the data and the specific research question being addressed, also play a role in determining the best model. Therefore, the correct answer is C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only."
