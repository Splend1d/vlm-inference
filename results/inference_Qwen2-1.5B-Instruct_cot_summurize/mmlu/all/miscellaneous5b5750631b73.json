This can include activities such as working on farms, participating in agricultural competitions, or gaining experience through internships or other work-related opportunities. By allowing students to apply their skills and gain practical experience, SAE programs can help them develop valuable skills and build confidence in their abilities. Additionally, they can also help students earn recognition and awards for their accomplishments, which can be a great motivator and boost their self-esteem."
