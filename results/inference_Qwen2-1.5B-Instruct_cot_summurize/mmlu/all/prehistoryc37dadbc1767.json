                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Between 1% and 4% of the genome of modern humans with European and Asian ancestry originated from Neandertal populations, most likely through interbreeding.\n\nThis conclusion was drawn from genetic studies that have identified small regions within the genomes of modern humans that are present in both Neandertal and modern human populations. These regions suggest that there was some degree of genetic exchange between these two groups, which is consistent with the idea that they interbred at some point in history.\n\nIt's important to note that this finding does not mean that Neandertals and modern humans lived together for any significant period of time, as it has been suggested that they lived in isolation for millions of years before interbreeding began.\n\nAs for the other options:\nB. Neandertal populations were entirely distinct and separate from anatomically modern humans, with no evidence of interbreeding - This option is incorrect because there is strong evidence that Neandertals and anatomically modern humans interbred, especially based on the identification of small genetic regions shared between them.\nC. Anatomically modern humans throughout the world uniformly share approximately 16% of their genome with Neandertal populations - This option is also incorrect because while some regions of the genome do overlap between Neandertals and modern humans, it's not accurate to say that all of the genome shares the same percentage of genetic material with Neandertals.\nD. Modern Africans share more than 4% of their genome with Neandertals, far greater than modern European and Asian populations, indicating a lengthier time of successful interbreeding - This option is also incorrect because the study cited in the question only found small regions of shared genetic material between Neandertals and modern humans, not an entire genome. Additionally, the study did not provide enough information to make conclusions about the duration or frequency of interbreeding between Neandertals and modern humans."
