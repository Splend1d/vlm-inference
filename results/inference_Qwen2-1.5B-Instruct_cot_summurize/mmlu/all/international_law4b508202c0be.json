A peremptory norm is a rule that is so fundamental that it applies to everyone without exception, regardless of individual circumstances or national laws. In other words, there is no option for negotiation or compromise when dealing with a peremptory norm.\n\nIn summary, the obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes is a peremptory norm of international law, and all states have a legal interest to uphold its application in any given dispute. The obligation of the peaceful settlement of disputes is not limited to the outcome of the dispute, but rather encompasses the conduct of the parties involved in the dispute."
