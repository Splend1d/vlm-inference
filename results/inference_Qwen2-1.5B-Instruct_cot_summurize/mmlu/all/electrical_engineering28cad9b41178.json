                    "text": "The correct answer is C: both A and B.\n\nWith normal frequency supply, the electromagnetic forces in the induction furnace can cause severe stirring action in the molten metal. This is because the frequency of the alternating current (AC) used to generate the magnetic field in the furnace affects the speed at which the molten metal flows through the heating elements. If the frequency is too low, the molten metal may not flow quickly enough, leading to uneven heating and potentially overheating or burning spots.\n\nHowever, with a low frequency supply, the magnetic field generated by the AC current will be weaker, which means that the electromagnetic forces acting on the molten metal will also be weaker. This could result in less stirring action, which could lead to more uniform heating and better quality casting. However, it's important to note that using a low frequency supply might require careful monitoring and adjustments to ensure that the molten metal does not cool down excessively during the process.\n\nTherefore, both factors - low frequency supply and the associated lower strength of the electromagnetic forces - contribute to the need for a low-frequency supply in direct core-type induction furnaces."
