                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Increased voltage and decreased resistance.\n\nWhen you increase the voltage across a circuit, the electrons in the conductor move faster due to the higher electric field strength. This results in an increase in current because the number of free charges (electrons) per unit area increases with the square root of the voltage change. Similarly, when you decrease the resistance, more charge carriers can flow through the circuit at the same voltage, resulting in an increase in current. Therefore, increasing voltage while decreasing resistance always brings about an increase in current. \n\nOn the other hand, decreasing voltage alone does not necessarily result in an increase in current because it depends on the overall circuit components and their values. Similarly, decreasing resistance without changing the voltage also does not necessarily lead to an increase in current as the rate of electron flow may be reduced by the added resistance."
