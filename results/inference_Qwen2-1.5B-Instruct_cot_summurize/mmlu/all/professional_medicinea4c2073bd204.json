He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Right bundle branch block\nB. Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I\nC. Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II\nD. Third-degree atrioventricular block\n"

This condition occurs when there is a delay in the conduction system from the sinoatrial node to the atria or ventricles, resulting in a slow rate of electrical activity in the heart. In this case, the P-wave rate is faster than the R-wave rate, which suggests that the conduction system is functioning properly but the heart is not able to synchronize its electrical activity. A right bundle branch block would cause a delayed P-wave compared to the R-wave, while third-degree atrioventricular block would result in a complete absence of P-R intervals."
