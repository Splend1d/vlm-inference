While this may not be inherently wrong, it could be seen as morally wrong if the individual has other important tasks or obligations they need to attend to. Additionally, the act of shopping itself could involve purchasing items with negative environmental impacts, such as buying products made from non-renewable resources or supporting companies with unethical practices.\n\nTherefore, option A - Wrong, Wrong - is correct."
