Fast responses to increase calcium absorption with no change in gene expression\n\nVitamin D is primarily known for its role in regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the body, which affects bone health. It also plays a crucial role in muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission by binding to and activating specific receptors on these systems.\n\nThe other options listed are functions of Vitamin D:\n\nA. Lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes: This is true as Vitamin D helps maintain membrane integrity through its antioxidant properties.\nC. Regulation of differentiation of adipocytes: This is true because Vitamin D can influence the differentiation of fat cells (adipocytes) in response to environmental cues.\nD. Regulation of bone turnover: This is true as Vitamin D regulates bone formation and resorption by influencing osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) and osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells).\n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect based on the given information about Vitamin D's effects."
