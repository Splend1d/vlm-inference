If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nThe long-term effects of Otto von Bismarck's speech include which of the following?\n\nA.

Development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe\n\nOtto von Bismarck's speech was made during the late 19th century and discussed issues such as unemployment, poverty, and the lack of support from society for those who were unable to find work or care for themselves. These concerns would later lead to the development of various social welfare systems across Europe, including in Germany. This includes the introduction of unemployment insurance and other forms of social assistance.\n\nWhile the long-term effects of Bismarck's speech may vary among countries and regions, the creation of socialized programs in many places can be seen as an attempt to address the economic and social challenges faced by workers and their families. It's important to note that these policies often face criticism for being insufficient and leading to unintended consequences, but they have also contributed to some degree to the development of modern welfare states."
