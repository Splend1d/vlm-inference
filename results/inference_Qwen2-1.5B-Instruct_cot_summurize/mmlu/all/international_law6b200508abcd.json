The meaning of \"armed attack\" in Article 5(1) of the United Nations Charter refers to any act of war, including all types of armed force, including but not limited to military and police forces, as well as paramilitary and terrorist groups. It does not include acts of terrorism or other non-state actors. Therefore, option C is incorrect. Option D is also incorrect because it suggests that an \"armed attack\" gives the right to invade the aggressor state, which is not mentioned in the charter."
