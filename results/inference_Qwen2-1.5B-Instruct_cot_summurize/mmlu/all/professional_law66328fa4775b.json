Battery is not considered a serious crime in this context as it involves touching someone without their consent. Involuntary manslaughter occurs when someone unintentionally causes death through an act that results in death, but there is no intent to kill. Assault with a deadly weapon involves intentionally causing harm or fear by using a deadly weapon."
