Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nOn which of the following arguments does the author of the passage principally base his appeal?\n\nA. It is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.\nB. Confucian teachings forbid the use of all narcotics as inherently immoral.\nC. Addiction is causing China to suffer an unfavorable balance of trade.\nD. Britain is unwise to risk the wrath of a militarily more powerful state.\n"

The passage argues against selling the drug opium to Britain because doing so would be hypocritical since China itself forbids its importation due to the harm it causes to human health. The author believes that Britain should not purchase the drug as it will only serve to further harm China's economy and reputation. Therefore, argument A is the most relevant to the appeal made by the author."
