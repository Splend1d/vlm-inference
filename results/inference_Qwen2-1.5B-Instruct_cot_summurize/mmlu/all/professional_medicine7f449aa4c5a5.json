Maternal serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration\nB. Triple screening for MSAFP, serum \u03b2-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations\nC. Ultrasonography\nD.

                    "text": "The most appropriate next step in management would be an ultrasound examination to assess the development of the fetus. The increase in maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration, along with the other signs of pregnancy such as the presence of a uterus and fetal heart beat, suggests that the pregnancy is ongoing. However, it is important to confirm this diagnosis through further imaging techniques such as ultrasonography or amniocentesis, which can provide more detailed information about the health of the fetus and the extent of any potential problems. Therefore, the answer is C: Ultrasonography."
