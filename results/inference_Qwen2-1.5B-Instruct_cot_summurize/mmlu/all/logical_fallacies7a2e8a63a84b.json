This occurs when someone presents only two options and assumes that these options must be mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both be true at the same time. For example, if someone argues that either you should go to the beach or stay home, but does not consider the possibility of going somewhere in between (such as visiting a friend's house), this would be an example of false dilemma."
