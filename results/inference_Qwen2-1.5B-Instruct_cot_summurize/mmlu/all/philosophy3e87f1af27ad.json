According to Moore's theory of moral psychology, good is an intrinsic value that arises from within and cannot be reduced to any other value. It is not something that can be obtained or achieved through external means, but rather something that exists independently of our desires or needs. Therefore, when we think about good, we should focus on its inherent nature and meaning, rather than on what it could bring us in terms of pleasure or satisfaction."
