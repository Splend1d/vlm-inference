Committee membership can indeed overrepresent certain interests or constituencies, particularly if they are composed primarily of members who share those interests. Similarly, committee size may limit the diversity of perspectives represented on the committee. The influence of special-interest lobbying can also bias the opinions of committee members, as they may prioritize the needs of their donors over those of their constituents. Finally, the frequent contact that committee members have with lobbyists can lead them to overlook the priorities of their constituents."
