Cut marks on animal bones that were made by butchering with pieces of stone: This evidence supports the idea that early humans used stone tools to butchery animals for food.\n\nB. The anatomy of Australopithecus africanus hands and analogies with studies of living non-human primates that demonstrate tool use: The hand anatomy of Australopithecus africanus suggests that they had the necessary physical capabilities to make and use stone tools.\n\nC. Simple stone cores, anvil stones, and flakes found at the Lomekwi 3 site in West Turkana, Kenya: These artifacts provide direct evidence of the presence of stone tools in Africa during this time period.\n\nTherefore, all of these pieces of evidence support the argument that hominids were using stone tools by at least 3.3 million years ago."
