Acting out\n\nThe patient's behaviors, such as engaging in sexual activity without protection, smoking cigarettes, disobeying curfew, and truancy, suggest that she may be acting out as a way to cope with stress and emotions that she is unable to express through more conventional means. This could be due to a combination of factors, including the separation from her parents, the loss of her academic achievements, and the difficulties associated with adolescence in general."
