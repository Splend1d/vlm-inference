On September 15, a worldwide shortage of widgets caused a steep increase in the market price for widgets, so the seller decided not to deliver the widgets to the buyer. The seller sent a letter to the buyer, stating that the widgets would not be delivered. The buyer received the seller's letter on September 20. On October 15, the buyer filed suit against the seller for breach of contract. In determining the damages to which the buyer is entitled, which of the following would be taken as the market price of widgets?\n\nA. The market price on September 1.\nB. The market price on September 15.\nC. The market price on September 20.\nD. The market price on September 30.\n"

In this case, the seller breached their obligation by failing to deliver the widgets on time due to a global shortage, and therefore the buyer has suffered damages.\n\nThe market price on September 20 represents the price at which the widgets were sold after the seller failed to deliver them. This is an estimate of what the buyer could have paid for the widgets if they had been delivered on time, but it does not take into account any additional costs or expenses incurred by the buyer as a result of the delay. Therefore, the market price on September 20 provides the best estimate of the damages that the buyer is entitled to recover. \n\nOption A (the market price on September 1) is incorrect because the buyer did not receive the widgets until September 20, well after the original delivery date of September 30.\n\nOption B (the market price on September 15) is also incorrect because the seller's decision to not deliver the widgets was based on a global shortage, and therefore the market price on September 15 reflects the situation before the seller's decision, not after.\n\nOption D (the market price on September 30) is incorrect because the seller's decision to not deliver the widgets was based on a global shortage, and therefore the market price on September 30 reflects the situation before the seller's decision, not after."
