Fermions have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nFermions, unlike bosons, interact with each other through a force called the Dirac equation. This means that fermions can occupy the same quantum state at the same time, which leads to the Pauli exclusion principle, stating that no two fermions can be in exactly the same quantum state at the same time. \n\nIn contrast, bosons like photons or gluons also interact with each other via their own forces (such as the electromagnetic force), but they don't have the Pauli exclusion principle because they can exist in multiple states simultaneously without violating the principle."
