                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the conservation of energy principle. The ball starts at rest and ends up with potential energy converted into kinetic energy when it reaches the highest point again.\n\nThe initial potential energy of the ball before being dropped is:\n\\[ E_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(0.08\\,kg)(9.8\\,m/s^2)(3.2\\,m) \\]\n\\[ E_i = 7.76\\,J \\]\n\nWhen the ball bounces back and rises to its original height, it has potential energy stored in its bounce.\n\\[ E_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(0.08\\,kg)(9.8\\,m/s^2)(3.2\\,m) \\]\n\\[ E_f = 5.84\\,J \\]\n\nSince there is no work done by gravity during the process, the total change in potential energy must be equal to the increase in kinetic energy.\n\\[ E_f - E_i = \\Delta K \\]\n\\[ 5.84\\,J - 7.76\\,J = \\Delta K \\]\n\\[ \\Delta K = -1.92\\,J \\]\n\nThis means that the ball lost 1.92 Joules of potential energy while rising from its lowest point back to the starting height. Since the ball started at rest, the force applied by the floor must have been enough to overcome the gravitational potential energy loss.\n\nLet's denote the normal force exerted by the floor as \\(F_n\\) and the acceleration due to gravity as \\(g = 9.8\\,m/s^2\\). We know that the ball's velocity changes by an amount equal to its displacement from the starting point divided by the time taken for the fall. This is given by:\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{2gh} \\]\nwhere \\(v_f\\) is the final velocity, \\(h\\) is the initial height, and \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nGiven \\(h = 3.2\\,m\\) and \\(t = 0.04\\,s\\), we can find the final velocity:\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{(2)(9.8\\,m/s^2)(3.2\\,m)} \\]\n\\[ v_f = \\sqrt{11.224}\\,m/s \\]\n\\[ v_f = 1.08\\,m/s \\]\n\nNow, using the formula for change in velocity:\n\\[ \\Delta v = v_f - v_0 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta v = 1.08\\,m/s - 0\\,m/s \\]\n\\[ \\Delta v = 1.08\\,m/s \\]\n\nThis means the ball gained 1.08 meters per second in speed upon reaching its highest point. However, since the ball only loses potential energy and gains kinetic energy, the change in velocity cannot be solely attributed to the force acting on it. It's more likely that the force acts over a period of time, allowing the ball to lose potential energy without losing speed significantly.\n\nAssuming the ball bounces off the floor multiple times, each bounce would result in the ball gaining some additional kinetic energy due to the collision. Over several collisions, the net force applied by the floor could cause the ball to move faster than it initially was dropped, resulting in the ball reaching its original height despite having lost potential energy.\n\nTherefore, the average force exerted by the floor on the ball should not be directly calculated based on the change in velocity alone. Instead, the net force required to overcome the gravitational potential energy loss over the course of the motion is necessary. Since we don't have information about the number of bounces or the exact time between each bounce, we cannot provide a precise numerical value for the average force. However, the concept is that the net force needed to maintain the ball's motion and eventually reach its original height would be greater than the initial force of the drop, which would depend on factors like the surface area of the floor and the elasticity of the material the ball is made of.\n\nIn summary, without additional details about the number of bounces or the time interval between each bounce, the correct answer choice is:\n\nD. 0.36 N"
