Additionally, the argument that criminal law should prioritize protecting the innocent over murderers is consistent with his perspective on the morality of capital punishment. Furthermore, Van den Haag supports the idea that the severity and finality of the death penalty are appropriate given the gravity of murder. Therefore, all of these points support his overall view on the death penalty as a tool for preventing murder."
