Billy thought Jack was a weakling, but Jack had been working out with weights and knew karate. Ike Intervenor, a large 25-year-old who knew neither party, strolled around the corner of the block in time to see Jack strike Billy twice. Billy fell back and Jack stepped forward to strike him again. Ike thought Jack was the aggressor and to protect Billy, Ike threw Jack into the bushes, accidentally breaking Jack's arm. Jack brought suit against Ike for his damages. Ike's best defense is\n\nA. He thought Jack was the initial aggressor.\nB. Billy had a valid defense if Jack sued him.\nC. The force Ike used was not excessive.\nD. He had no intention of injuring Jack, only to stop his beating of Billy.\n"

This is because the act of throwing Jack into the bushes did not cause any harm to Jack, and it was done with the intention of stopping Billy from being attacked by Jack. Additionally, the force used was reasonable given the situation, as it was necessary to prevent further harm to Billy. Therefore, Ike's action was justified under the circumstances."
