This implies that moral actions should be based on principles that can be universally applied and followed by others.\n\nTherefore, option C (justified constraint) would be the most appropriate answer for this question. It suggests that moral actions should take into account the constraints imposed by our relationships with others, including family, friends, and society in general. However, this does not necessarily involve an \"enlightened egoism\" or \"pure altruism,\" as these terms may have different meanings depending on the context. \n\nOption D (prima facie duties) also refers to the idea of acting in accordance with what is morally right or wrong, but it does not explicitly mention the concept of constraint or the need to justify actions based on universal laws. Therefore, it is less likely to be the correct answer.\n\nOption A (enlightened egoism) is not mentioned in the given text, so we cannot say whether it is relevant to Gauthier's perspective. Option B (pure altruism) is similar to enlightened egoism, as both suggest acting out of self-interest rather than concern for others. However, it is more closely related to the idea of altruism than enlightened egoism."
