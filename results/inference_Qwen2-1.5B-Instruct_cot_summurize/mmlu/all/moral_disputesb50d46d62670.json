Kantianism. \n\nKantianism, also known as deontology or duty ethics, focuses on the moral worth of an action based on its adherence to certain duties and rules. According to this theory, actions that promote the happiness or well-being of others are considered morally good, while actions that cause harm are considered immoral.\n\nCarruthers' work suggests that nonhuman animals should be treated with respect and have moral standing based on their ability to experience pain and pleasure, their capacity for suffering and flourishing, and their intrinsic value as beings with rights. This approach aligns more closely with Kantian principles than other ethical theories such as consequentialism (which focuses on outcomes) or virtue ethics (which emphasizes character and virtues). Contractualism (which emphasizes agreements and contracts between individuals) does not seem to fit in this context."
