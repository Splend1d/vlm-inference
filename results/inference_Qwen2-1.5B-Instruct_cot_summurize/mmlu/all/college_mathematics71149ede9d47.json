However, the group must be non-trivial (not trivial) for it to have elements other than the identity element.\n\nLet's consider the cases:\n\n1. **Order 1**: In this case, there is only one element in the group, which would satisfy the condition given.\n   \n2. **Order 2**: The subgroup generated by two elements of order 2 will also generate the entire group, since they commute. This means that if \\(a\\) has order 2, then so does \\(b\\) for all \\(b\\) in the subgroup generated by \\(a\\). Therefore, in addition to the trivial group, there could be at most two subgroups of order 2.\n\n3. **Order 4**: If \\(a\\) has order 4, then so does \\(b\\) for all \\(b\\) in the subgroup generated by \\(a\\). Thus, in addition to the trivial group, there could be at most two subgroups of order 4.\n\nIn total, there could be \\(1 + 2 + 2 = 5\\) groups of order 16 up to isomorphism, but we need to exclude the trivial group, which doesn't satisfy the given condition. So, we subtract 1 from the total count to get 4 groups that satisfy the condition:\n\n- Order 1: Trivial group\n- Order 2: Only one group, the trivial group\n- Order 4: Two subgroups of order 4, each of which generates the entire group\n\nThus, the answer is **(D) 3**."
