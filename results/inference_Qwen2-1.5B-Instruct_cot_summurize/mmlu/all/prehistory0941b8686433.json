The Ancestral Puebloans were a pre-Columbian Native American culture that lived in what is now southern Utah and northern Arizona from about 200 A.D. to 1300 A.D. They built large, multi-story cliff dwellings and other structures made of adobe bricks, which allowed them to live in more densely populated areas than would have been possible without these buildings. These structures served both practical purposes, such as providing shelter and storage space, and symbolic ones, such as indicating social status or clan affiliations."
