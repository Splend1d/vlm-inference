Bi-directional feedback occurs when one variable has an impact on another variable, which then has an impact on the first variable. In other words, the relationship between the two variables is reciprocal. If both the a and c coefficients are insignificant, then there would not be any evidence of bi-directional feedback, as the impact of one variable on the other would only be one way (i.e., from the dependent variable to the independent variable). Similarly, if the b and d coefficients are insignificant, then there would not be any evidence of bi-directional feedback, as the impact of one variable on the other would only be one way (i.e., from the independent variable to the dependent variable). Therefore, the correct condition for bi-directional feedback is that both the a and c coefficients must be significant."
