Let her not refuse to perform domestic duties whether easy or difficult. That which must be done, let her finish completely, tidily, and systematically, When a woman follows such rules as these, then she may be said to be industrious.\nLet a woman be correct in manner and upright in character in order to serve her husband. Let her live in purity and quietness of spirit, and attend to her own affairs. Let her love not gossip and silly laughter. Let her cleanse and purify and arrange in order the wine and the food for the offerings to the ancestors. When a woman observes such principles as these, then she may be said to continue ancestral worship.\nNo woman who observes these three fundamentals of life has ever had a bad reputation or has fallen into disgrace. If a woman fail to observe them, how can her name be honored; how can she but bring disgrace upon herself?\"\n\u00a9 The East Asian Library and the Gest Collection, Princeton University.\nBan Zhao, Lessons for a Woman, ca. 80 C.E.\nWhich theme in the passage was common in patriarchal ancient societies?\n\nA.

These themes align with the importance placed on women's roles within patriarchal societies, where they were expected to be submissive and obedient to their husbands and families."
