This process is known as \"coring\" and is often used in the administration of intravenous (IV) medications to ensure that the medication reaches the patient's bloodstream directly. It is not related to phlebitis or titration of a drug with its desired effect, nor does it involve the delivery of medication straight into the bloodstream."
