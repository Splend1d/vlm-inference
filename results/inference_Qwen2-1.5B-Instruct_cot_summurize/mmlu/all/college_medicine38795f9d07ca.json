To allow the electrophoresis to separate the proteins solely on the basis of the length of the primary sequence.\nC. To prevent the protein from denaturing so that the electrophoresis can accurately resolve the proteins on the basis of tertiary structure.\nD.

To coat the proteins with a large positive charge, since amino acid side chains may have positive, negative, or neutral charges, and a large uniform charge is necessary to get good separation in the gel.\n\nWhen proteins are subjected to SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate) electrophoresis, they are first treated with SDS to remove their native charge. The SDS molecules have a net positive charge, which allows them to bind to negatively charged proteins, such as glutamine residues in the amino acids, and form a covalent bond between the positively charged SDS molecule and the negatively charged protein. This process is called denaturation, which involves breaking the hydrogen bonding between the protein's backbone and its side chains.\n\nAfter denaturation, the proteins are separated based on their molecular weight rather than their primary sequence. In this way, the SDS treatment helps ensure that all proteins are treated equally, regardless of their sequence, and provides a uniform charge distribution across the gel, which aids in efficient separation and resolution of the proteins by the electrophoretic mobility."
