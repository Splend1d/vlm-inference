(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). \n\nVariance decompositions are used in time series analysis to estimate the contribution of different factors, such as exogenous shocks or structural changes, to the variation in a set of observed values. In the context of vector autoregression (VAR) models, variance decompositions allow us to understand how changes in one variable affect the other variables in the model. Specifically, we can decompose the variance of the dependent variable into contributions from the independent variables using a linear combination of their coefficients. This allows us to identify which variables have the largest influence on the dependent variable's variance.\n\n(i) True: Variance decompositions indeed measure the impact of a unit shock to each of the variables on the VAR.\n(ii) True: Variance decompositions can be thought of as measuring the proportion of the forecast error variance that is attributable to each variable.\n(iii) False: The ordering of the variables is important for variance decompositions, but it is not necessary for impulse response functions.\n(iv) True: It is usually the case that most of the forecast error variance for a given variable is attributable to shocks to that variable. However, this does not necessarily mean that all of the variance is explained by the shocks. There may also be other factors contributing to the variance of the dependent variable."
