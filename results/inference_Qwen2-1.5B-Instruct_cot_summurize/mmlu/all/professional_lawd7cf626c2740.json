Inspired by a progressive revolt against the chemical company's domination of the state government, the corporate official's opponent, won by an extremely close margin. After the new governor took office, he vowed to get back at the company that owned the local newspaper for its newspaper's endorsement of the corporate official. Using his influence, the new governor was instrumental in getting the state legislature to pass a bill that imposed a special tax on the sale of ink and paper used in the publication of newspapers and periodicals of general circulation. The tax bill was signed into law by the governor. The strongest constitutional basis upon which to challenge the validity of the tax would be the\n\nA. equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. bill of attainder provision under Article I, Section 10.\nC. privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. First Amendment, as incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

The Fourteenth Amendment incorporated these freedoms against states, thus making them applicable to the federal government and its actions. In this case, the state legislature passed a bill imposing a tax on newspapers and periodicals, which can be considered an action taken by the state government. Therefore, the tax may not be challenged as being unconstitutional due to the First Amendment.\n\nThe other options do not apply:\n\n- The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the state level, not the federal level.\n- The Bill of Attainder provision only applies to acts committed during a state's term of office and cannot be applied retroactively.\n- The Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not have any relevance here because it pertains to state governments and not the federal government."
