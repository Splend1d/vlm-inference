She testified at trial that while sitting on the floor trying to gather the strength to get up, she heard a grocery employee asst. manager say to an employee, \"I thought I told you to get that mess up!\" The grocer's counsel objected on the basis of hearsay to the admissibility of the purported statements of the asst. manager and the other employee. What will the court decide?\n\nA. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement was not hearsay \u0080\u0094 it was offered to show that they were aware of a problem on the floor.\nB. The objection will be sustained because the asst. manager's statement was pure hearsay and she had to be available for cross-examination for the statement to be admissible.\nC. The objection will be sustained because the statement was irrelevant to whether or not the store was negligent and liable for the shopper's injuries.\nD. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n"

The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n\nIn this case, the shopper testified that she heard an employee, who was also an employee of the store, tell another employee, who was not present during the incident, to clean up a puddle of liquid on the floor. This statement by the employee who was cleaning up the puddle was not offered as evidence of what happened before or after the incident, but rather as proof that the employee knew about the problem on the floor. Therefore, the statement falls under the exception for admissions made in the course of a regular employment activity, which is known as a \"vicarious admission.\"\n\nSince the statement was made in the scope of the employee's job duties, the court will allow its introduction into evidence to prove the employer's negligence in failing to maintain a safe environment."
