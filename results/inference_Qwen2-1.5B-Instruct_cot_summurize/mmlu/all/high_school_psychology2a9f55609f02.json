Somatic therapists focus on the body and how it relates to mental health, so they may use techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation or imagery to help clients manage physical symptoms or trauma. They may also use mindfulness-based approaches to help clients become more aware of their thoughts and emotions and develop coping strategies. While other therapies may involve cognitive restructuring or emotional processing, systematic desensitization is specifically designed for treating anxiety disorders and phobias, which can have a strong physical component."
