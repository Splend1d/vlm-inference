Pollution.\n\nExteriority refers to externalities that arise from actions taken by one party and affect another party in ways not intended or agreed upon by either party. In this context, pollution is an example of an externality because it affects the environment (a third party) but was caused by economic activities carried out by wealthy nations. The pollution can have negative impacts on human health and the environment, which can be harmful to society as a whole. Therefore, option D (pollution) is correct."
