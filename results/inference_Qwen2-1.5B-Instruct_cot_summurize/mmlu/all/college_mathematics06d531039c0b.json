In other words, the kernel of $T$ is the set of vectors $\\mathbf{x} \\in V$ such that $T(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nFor any matrix $\\mathbf{A} \\in M_{2x3}(R)$ (the space of all $2 \\times 3$ matrices over the real numbers), we can write it as $\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix}\na & b & c \\\\\nd & e & f \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}$, where $a, b, c, d, e, f \\in R$. Similarly, for any column vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nv_1 \\\\\nv_2 \\\\\nv_3 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}$ with $v_1, v_2, v_3 \\in R$, we can write it as $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nv_1 \\\\\nv_2 \\\\\nv_3 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nNow, consider the transformation $T: V \\rightarrow W$ defined by $T(\\mathbf{A}) = \\mathbf{0}$ if and only if $T(\\mathbf{A}) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}$. This means that the transformation maps every $2 \\times 3$ matrix to the zero matrix. \n\nSince the zero matrix has four rows but only one column, the transformation $T$ must map at least one row to the zero vector in order to make the whole matrix zero. Therefore, the kernel of $T$ is a two-dimensional subspace of $M_{2x3}(R)$ consisting of all matrices with exactly one non-zero row.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 2"
