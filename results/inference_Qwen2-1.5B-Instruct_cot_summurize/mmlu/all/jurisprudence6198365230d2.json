In Bentham's philosophy, happiness is considered to be the ultimate end of human actions, and any action that leads to happiness should be pursued at all costs. Proposition A challenges this central principle by suggesting that other factors such as economic prosperity may be more important than happiness. This proposition represents a significant departure from Bentham's view and would make his felicific calculus much weaker or even meaningless.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer."
