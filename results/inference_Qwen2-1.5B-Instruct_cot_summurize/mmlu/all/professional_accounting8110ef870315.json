                    "text": "The answer is D. $283,000.\n\nTo calculate Prime's current-year taxable income, we need to adjust the book income by deducting the following items:\n\n1. Corporate bond interest income: $170,000\n2. Term life insurance premium expense: $20,000\n\nSubtract these amounts from the book income to get the adjusted taxable income:\n$300,000 - $170,000 - $20,000 = $193,000\n\nFinally, add back any tax-exempt interest income or other deductible expenses to arrive at the final taxable income:\n$193,000 + $170,000 + $20,000 = $363,000\n\nDivide this amount by 12 to find the monthly income:\n$363,000 / 12 = $30,500\n\nSo, Prime's current-year taxable income as reconciled on its Schedule M-1 Reconciliation of Income (Loss) per Books With Income per Return of Form 1120 U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return is $30,500, which rounds to $300,000 when expressed in millions of dollars. Therefore, the correct answer is B. $300,000."
