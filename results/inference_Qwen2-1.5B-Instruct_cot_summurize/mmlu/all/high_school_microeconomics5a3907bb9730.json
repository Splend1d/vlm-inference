A rival firm fails to match both price increases or price decreases of rivals.\n\nIn an oligopoly, there are only a few sellers in the market and they compete with each other rather than with all other buyers. In this scenario, if one firm lowers its prices, it can expect that other firms will lower their prices as well, because they cannot afford to sell at higher prices without losing customers to the cheaper competitor. However, if one firm raises its prices, the other firms may not be willing to follow suit, especially if they fear that customers will switch to a more expensive competitor. This is known as the \"price leadership\" effect in oligopolies. So, a rival firm should fail to match both price increases and price decreases of rivals."
