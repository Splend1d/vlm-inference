The Columbian Exchange\n\nThe quote suggests that the Spanish nobleman brought various European crops (wheat, grapes, melons) to America, along with fruits like peaches, pears, oranges, lemons, chickpeas, grapes, and onions. This indicates that the Columbian Exchange occurred between Europe and the Americas. The exchange involved the transfer of goods such as crops, livestock, diseases, languages, ideas, technology, and people across national boundaries. Therefore, option B is correct."
