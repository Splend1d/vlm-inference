Increased government spending.\n\nIncreased government spending can promote economic growth by stimulating demand and increasing investment, which can lead to increased production and employment. Additionally, government spending can create jobs and boost consumer confidence, both of which can contribute to economic growth. However, it is important to note that government spending must be well-managed and targeted effectively to avoid inflation or other negative consequences."
