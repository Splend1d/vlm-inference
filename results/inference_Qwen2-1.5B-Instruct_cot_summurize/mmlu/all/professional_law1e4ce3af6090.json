This bid was $30,000 lower than the construction company's next lowest bid for the kitchen work. As a result, the construction company lowered its bid by $20,000 before submitting it to the hospital board. After the construction company was awarded the construction bid and had accepted the subcontractor's offer, the subcontractor discovered that in his preparation of the quotation, he had overlooked some subsidiary kitchen installments required by the plans. Immediately thereafter, the subcontractor brought suit for rescission of the contract. It should\n\nA. prevail, because of the unilateral mistake.\nB. prevail, because the mistake was an essential element of the bargain.\nC. not prevail, unless the construction company knew or should have known of the subcontractor \u0080\u0098s error.\nD. not prevail, because the computation mistake was antecedent to acceptance of the bid.\n"

The construction company did not know or should not have known about the subcontractor's error until after they had accepted the subcontractor's offer and lowered their own bid by $20,000. Therefore, the subcontractor's mistake was not an essential element of the bargain and the construction company's mistake was not a unilateral mistake. As a result, the subcontractor cannot prevail on their claim for rescission."
