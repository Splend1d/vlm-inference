In this case, the decision boundary is a straight line, and the problem is considered to be linearly separable if there exists a separating hyperplane in the transformed space.\n\nOn the other hand, logistic regression and soft margin SVMs do not guarantee that the optimal solution will always exist or be unique, which makes them less suitable for problems with non-linear separability. The centroid method is another approach to solving non-linear classification problems, but it does not provide any guarantees about the existence of a separating hyperplane."
