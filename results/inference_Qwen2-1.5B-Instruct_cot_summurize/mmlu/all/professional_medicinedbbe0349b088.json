Rhinoviruses are a group of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold, but they are not typically associated with meningitis.\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis, but it is less common than C. perfringens or H. influenzae in this age group."
