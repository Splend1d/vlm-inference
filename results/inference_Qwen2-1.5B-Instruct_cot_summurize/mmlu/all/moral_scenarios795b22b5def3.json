The scenario goes against the principle of treating animals with kindness and respect.\nScenario 2 is also considered morally wrong but for a different reason. Laughing at someone who is performing a dangerous or inappropriate act, such as juggling, can be seen as disrespectful and cruel. However, if the person involved is performing their act safely and responsibly, laughing at them may not necessarily be morally wrong. Ultimately, whether laughter is acceptable in this situation depends on the context and the specific circumstances of the situation."
