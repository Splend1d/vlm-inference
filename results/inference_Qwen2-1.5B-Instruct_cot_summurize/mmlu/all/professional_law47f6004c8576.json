The group secured a rally permit in accordance with a local ordinance. Several members of the group, including a political science professor at a state university and one of the group's leaders, were scheduled to give speeches. Other members of the group were assigned to walk among the crowd to solicit signatures for a petition, which the group planned to present to the President. A large crowd gathered in the park at the appointed date and time, anxiously waiting for the speeches to begin. As the professor, the first speaker, began addressing the gathering, a television news team started filming her presentation, which was to be shown on the local news that evening. After the professor finished her speech, a few members of the crowd began hissing and booing and shouting. The police soon arrived and attempted to break up the rally. Several members of the group, including the professor, were arrested for inciting a riot. Which of the following would be the most accurate statement with regard to the police halting the rally?\n\nA. The police were justified, since the rally threatened imminent violence and serious disorder.\nB. The police were justified in order to protect the group's leaders.\nC. The police violated the group's First Amendment rights of assembly.\nD. Since the group obtained the rally permit, the police were not permitted to interfere with the staging of the rally.\n"

The police were justified, since the rally threatened imminent violence and serious disorder.\n\nThis answer aligns with the idea that the police acted within their authority to maintain public safety during an event where there was a potential for civil unrest or criminal behavior. The fact that the group had obtained a permit does not absolve them from responsibility for ensuring that the rally did not disrupt the peace. If they failed to do so, then they may have been justified in taking action to restore order."
