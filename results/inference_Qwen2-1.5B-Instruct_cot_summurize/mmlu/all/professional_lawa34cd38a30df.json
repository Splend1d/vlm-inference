                    "text": "The owner of a drug store hired an independent contractor to renovate the store. Among other things, the renovations included installing a new front door made of plate glass. The contractor purchased the door from a glass door company. The sales representative of the glass door company told the contractor and the owner that plate glass was \"super safe\" and could withstand considerable pressure. The contractor installed the door, completed the other renovation work, and the store reopened for business later that same month. A few weeks later, a shopper and her 9-year- old son went to the drug store to purchase some merchandise. As they approached the store, the son was skipping ahead of his mother. Until he was within a few steps of the door, he thought it was open. When he realized it was, in fact, closed, he slowed down and, while still \"going faster than walking,\" pushed his hand against the handle to push open the door. His hand slipped off the handle and, at the same time, there was a \"kind of exploding noise. \" Due to a defect, the glass shattered and broke, cutting the son's hand and wrist. A subsequent inspection revealed that the glass door had been negligently installed by the contractor. If the shopper, on behalf of her son, asserts a claim against the glass door company based on strict products liability, the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the glass door was defective.\nB. prevail, because the sales representative represented the plate glass as being \"super safe. \"\nC. not prevail, because the contractor negligently installed the plate glass door.\nD. not prevail, because the son negligently pushed open the glass door.\n"

                    "text": "C. not prevail, because the contractor negligently installed the plate glass door.\n\nStrict products liability is a type of negligence claim where the manufacturer or seller of a defective product can be held liable for injuries caused by using or selling the product. In this case, the glass door was installed by the contractor, who is considered the manufacturer under the doctrine of respondeat superior (the principal is vicariously liable for the torts committed by its agents). Therefore, if the contractor acted negligently in installing the door, the plaintiff may have a cause of action against the contractor for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and/or negligence.\n\nIf the contractor did not act negligently in installing the door, then the plaintiff would need to establish that the glass door was defective in order to recover damages. The sales representative's representation about the safety of the glass does not necessarily make the door safe, as it depends on how the door was actually installed and maintained over time. The plaintiff would need to prove that the contractor failed to properly install and maintain the door, resulting in a defect that led to the injury."
