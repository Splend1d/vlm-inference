Rather, his findings suggest that individuals may engage in moderate or controlled use of illegal drugs for various reasons, such as seeking pleasure or avoiding social isolation. Additionally, his study found that many individuals report using illegal drugs only occasionally or not at all, which suggests that it is possible for some people to continue using them without becoming addicted."
