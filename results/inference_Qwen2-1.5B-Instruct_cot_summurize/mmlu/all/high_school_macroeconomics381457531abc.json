Government purchases (G)\n4. Investment (I)\n5. Consumption (C)\n\nSubtracting subsidies and adding depreciation expenses would be included in these calculations, as they represent changes in economic activity that affect both NI and GDP. Subtracting subsidies is especially important because it can help identify which sectors or industries are receiving government support and thus may not be contributing equally to overall growth. Adding depreciation expenses helps capture the impact of capital investment on economic output over time."
