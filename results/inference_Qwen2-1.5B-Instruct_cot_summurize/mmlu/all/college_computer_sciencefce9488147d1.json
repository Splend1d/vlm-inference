Each element in Array A occupies 4 bytes, so it has 256 * 4 = 1024 bytes.\n3. Each element in Array B also occupies 4 bytes, so it has 512 * 4 = 2048 bytes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of bytes written to memory during the loop execution:\n\nTotal bytes written = (Number of elements in Array A) * (Size of each element)\n= 256 * 4\n\nSince the cache has a write-through policy, all writes to memory will occur immediately without waiting for the data to be transferred from the cache to main memory.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **D. 2048**."
