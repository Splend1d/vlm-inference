Diplomatic methods are typically used when both parties agree to engage in dialogue and negotiation rather than going through formal legal channels. However, it is possible for diplomatic methods to result in an agreement that is enforceable under international law, such as through the International Court of Justice (ICJ). \n\nLegal means of dispute settlement, on the other hand, involve formal legal proceedings such as arbitration or litigation. These procedures are designed to be impartial and to provide a final and binding resolution to a dispute. In contrast, diplomatic methods may involve informal negotiations and do not necessarily result in a legally binding agreement.\n\nTherefore, the key difference between the two approaches is that legal means of dispute settlement result in a legally binding resolution, while diplomatic methods may result in an agreement that is enforceable under international law but does not have the same level of legal certainty as a court decision."
