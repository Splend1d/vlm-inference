Water\n\nWater is the best example of an agent that gradually shapes Earth's surface by taking bits of rock, soil, and other substances away from their original locations and depositing them in other locations through erosion. This process occurs naturally over time due to various factors such as gravity, wind, and temperature changes.\n\nFire and lightning can also contribute to erosion, but they are not agents that gradually shape Earth's surface like water does. Similarly, sunlight plays a role in weathering and erosion, but it is not directly responsible for shaping Earth's surface."
