These symptoms can manifest at any age, but they are more commonly seen during early childhood. Autistic children often have difficulty forming meaningful relationships, showing little interest in other children, and may not respond to their own name. They may also exhibit repetitive behaviors such as touching objects or repeating certain sounds."
