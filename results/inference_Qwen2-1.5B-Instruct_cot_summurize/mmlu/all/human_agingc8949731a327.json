While it is true that men tend to experience more hair loss than women, this can be due to various reasons such as genetics, hormonal changes, stress, and environmental factors.\n\nIt is also important to note that hair loss can affect both men and women equally in different ways. Some women may experience hair loss due to hormonal changes, while others may have a genetic predisposition for thinning or baldness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C: Women lose hair less frequently but more rapidly than men. It's essential to recognize that hair loss can affect anyone regardless of gender and that there are many potential causes for hair loss, including genetics, hormones, and environmental factors."
