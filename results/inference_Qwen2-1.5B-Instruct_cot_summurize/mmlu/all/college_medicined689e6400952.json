This can cause tremors, stiffness, and other motor symptoms, as well as changes in mood and behavior. However, without further information about the specific symptoms and medical history of the patient, it is difficult to say for certain what is causing the agitation and aggression. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."
