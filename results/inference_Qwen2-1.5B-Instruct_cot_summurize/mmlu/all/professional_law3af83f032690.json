Assault with the intent to cause serious bodily injury.\n\nThe defendant was driving recklessly, which indicates a lack of concern for the safety of others. The pedestrian was struck as the defendant was speeding, which suggests that the defendant had no intention of avoiding an accident or causing harm. However, the defendant's admission that he was indifferent about the consequences of driving recklessly suggests that he intended to cause serious bodily injury, which constitutes assault with intent to cause serious bodily injury."
