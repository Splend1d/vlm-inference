Proceeded much more successfully as large numbers of DNA markers became available.\n\nThe mapping of human chromosomes was a significant achievement in genetics, which began with the identification of sex chromosomes and continued through the use of DNA markers such as STRs (Short Tandem Repeats) and SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms). As these markers became more widely available, the process of mapping the human genome became easier and more accurate. The mapping of chromosomes also led to the discovery of new genetic disorders and helped to identify potential genetic targets for treatment."
