The major premise (MP): which includes at least two alternatives.\n2. The minor premise (MP): which negates one of the alternatives in the MP.\n3. The conclusion (CP): which states that either the major premise is true, or both alternatives are false.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct because it describes the structure of a valid disjunctive syllogism. Option B is incorrect as it refers to classification of subjects, which is not part of a valid disjunctive syllogism. Option C is also incorrect because it only affirming the antecedent, which does not necessarily lead to a valid conclusion. Finally, option D is incorrect because it refers to validity, which is not relevant to a valid disjunctive syllogism."
