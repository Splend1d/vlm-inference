Decrease taxes. \n\nDecreasing taxes will increase disposable income, leading to increased consumption and investment, which can stimulate economic growth and reduce the recessionary gap. \n\nIncreasing taxes would decrease disposable income and discourage spending, exacerbating the recessionary gap.\n\nDecreasing spending would lead to lower aggregate demand and further depress the economy. \n\nSelling Treasury securities would not affect the recessionary gap since it does not involve changes in government spending or taxation. \n\nIncreasing the reserve ratio would not have any effect on the recessionary gap as it pertains only to liquidity and has nothing to do with the overall level of money supply."
