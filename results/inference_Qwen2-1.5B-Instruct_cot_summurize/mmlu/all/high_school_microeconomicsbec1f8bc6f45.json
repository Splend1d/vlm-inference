Decrease price as demand is inelastic.\n\nWhen the demand for a product is inelastic (i.e., the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price is less than one), increasing the price will lead to an increase in revenue because more people will buy the product at that higher price. This is known as the law of demand, which states that when the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases proportionally, and vice versa.\n\nIn contrast, when the demand for a product is elastic (i.e., the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price is greater than one), decreasing the price will lead to a larger decrease in quantity demanded, resulting in lower revenue compared to increasing the price. This is known as the inverse demand function or the Law of Diminishing Marginal Revenues.\n\nTherefore, if the small business's estimate of price elasticity of demand is 3, it means that the demand for their product is relatively inelastic. In this case, they should increase the price rather than decrease it to maximize revenue."
