Prior to the date of closing, the purchasers noticed peeling paint and plaster erosion in a corner of a ceiling near the fireplace. They also noticed water marks lining the interior wall in the basement. The sellers explained that these were old problems that had been fixed and they just didn't get around to doing the cosmetic repairs and painting. The parties went to closing and finalized the deal. On their first week in the house, the purchasers found a virtual flood plain in their basement and they confronted water gushing in at the corner areas near the fireplace. They hired a contractor who reported the need for extensive structural repairs. They sued the sellers for fraud, misrepresentation, and implied warranties of habitability, and they asked for the funds to fix the property. Do they have a valid cause of action against the sellers?\n\nA. No, because the facts do not indicate an intention to deceive by the sellers.\nB. No, because buyers must always buy a used house in \"as is\" condition and they assume the risk of any hidden defects under the caveat emptor rule.\nC. Yes, the evidence indicates that the sellers made knowingly false representations of material fact to induce the buyers to rely thereon and buy the property.\nD. Yes, the sellers breached the contract of sale and must pay damages.\n"

Yes, the evidence indicates that the sellers made knowingly false representations of material fact to induce the buyers to rely thereon and buy the property.\n\nIn this case, the sellers represented that they did not know of any structural defects in the home, which was incorrect. The buyers discovered that the home had significant issues with peeling paint and plaster erosion in a corner of a ceiling near the fireplace, as well as water marks lining the interior wall in the basement. These issues were clearly present when the sellers signed the contract, but they failed to disclose them to the buyers before closing.\n\nTherefore, the sellers' failure to disclose these defects constitutes a breach of their duty of disclosure under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). This breach can be considered fraudulent if the seller knew or should have known about the defect and intended to deceive the buyer into buying the property. Additionally, the buyers assumed the risk of any hidden defects under the caveat emptor rule, which means they bought the property \"as is,\" meaning they accepted all defects as part of the purchase price. However, the sellers' undisclosed defects rendered the property uninhabitable, so the buyers could claim that the sellers had made false representations of material fact to induce them to buy the property, which would entitle them to recover damages for the improvements necessary to make the property habitable."
