                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: \"Every group of order \\(p^2\\), where \\(p\\) is prime, is abelian.\"\n\nThe order of a group is the number of elements in the group. If the order of a group is \\(p^2 = p \\cdot p = p \\times p\\), then this means that the group has exactly two distinct elements (since \\(p\\) is prime). The order must divide the product of its generators, so either both \\(p\\) and \\(p\\) have to be in the group or neither can be. In the case that \\(p\\) and \\(p\\) are both in the group, we get an element with order \\(p^2\\) which would imply that the group is not abelian since any non-identity element raised to the power of any other non-identity element will yield another non-identity element.\n\nHowever, if \\(p\\) does not appear as a factor in the order of the group, it means there exists at least one non-identity element whose order is \\(p\\). This element cannot generate the entire group since every element of the group generates a smaller subgroup. Therefore, the group cannot be abelian because raising an element to the power of itself results in the identity, whereas for an abelian group, all elements raise to different powers give rise to distinct elements.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2: \"For a fixed prime \\(p\\), a Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of a group \\(G\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) if and only if it is the only Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\nThis statement is true.\n\nIf a Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup \\(P\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\), then by definition, every element of \\(P\\) commutes with every element of \\(G/P\\), meaning \\(P\\) is contained in the center of \\(G/P\\), i.e., \\(P \\triangleleft G/P\\). Since \\(P\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\), \\(G/P\\) is also a group under the operation induced from \\(G\\), and therefore, \\(G/P\\) is a group of order \\(p^2\\) by Lagrange's theorem. \n\nNow, consider the action of \\(P\\) on \\(G/P\\): if \\(g \\in P\\) and \\(h \\in G/P\\), then \\(ghg^{-1} \\in G/P\\) because \\(P\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\). So, \\(G/P\\) is a cyclic group generated by \\(P\\). Moreover, since \\(P\\) is a Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of \\(G\\), it is unique up to conjugacy, and thus, the action of \\(P\\) on \\(G/P\\) is faithful. Thus, \\(P\\) is normal in \\(G\\) and acts transitively on \\(G/P\\).\n\nConversely, suppose \\(P\\) is a normal subgroup of \\(G\\) such that \\(P \\triangleleft G\\) and \\(P\\) acts faithfully on \\(G/P\\). Then, \\(P\\) is a Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of \\(G\\), as it is contained in the center of \\(G/P\\). Furthermore, since \\(P\\) acts faithfully on \\(G/P\\), it must be unique up to conjugacy, and hence, it is the only Sylow \\(p\\)-subgroup of \\(G\\).\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nAnswer: B. False, True."
