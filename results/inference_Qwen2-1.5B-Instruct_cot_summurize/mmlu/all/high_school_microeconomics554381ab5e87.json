P = MC, which refers to the fact that in an oligopoly, each firm's marginal cost equals its marginal revenue, leading to constant returns to scale. However, this does not necessarily mean that all firms are price-makers or have strong barriers to entry. In fact, some firms may be price takers and rely on other firms' actions to set prices. Additionally, the number of firms in an oligopoly can vary, with smaller markets having fewer firms than larger ones."
