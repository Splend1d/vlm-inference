An actor can have only one social identity, and this forms the basis for developing other identities. In contrast, an actor may have multiple corporate identities which vary in importance.\nB. Corporate identity refers to the intrinsic, self-realized identity of an actor. Social identity refers to 'sets of meanings that an actor attributes to itself while taking the perspective of others'. Actors can have multiple social identities.\nC. Corporate identity is a type of social identity that is constructed through the interaction of an actor with others within the international system.\nD. Social identity can also be described as 'role' identity. Like corporate identity, an actor's social identity is formed through interaction and does not exist as an intrinsic concept.\n"

Social identity refers to 'sets of meanings that an actor attributes to itself while taking the perspective of others'. Actors can have multiple social identities. Therefore, option C is incorrect because social identity is not necessarily constructed through interaction with others, but rather it is an inherent aspect of human nature. Option D is incorrect because social identity is not just a role identity, but rather encompasses many different aspects such as culture, religion, and ethnicity."
