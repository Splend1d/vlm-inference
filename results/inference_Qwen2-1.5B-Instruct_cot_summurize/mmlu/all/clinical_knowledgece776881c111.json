Dyspnoea, tachycardia, and distended neck veins.\n\nThese symptoms are indicative of circulatory overload or shock, which can occur in various medical conditions such as heart failure, severe anemia, or trauma. Hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia are also common in these situations but are not specific to circulatory overload. Oliguria and uticaria are not typically associated with circulatory overload, while shivering, pyrexia, and thirst may indicate other conditions such as heat stroke or dehydration. Distended neck veins could be a sign of pulmonary edema, which is another indication of circulatory overload."
