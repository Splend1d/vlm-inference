No other kinds of posters or literature are subject to this prohibition, nor are any other types of commercial establishments in the state subject to similar prohibitions. Is this law constitutional?\n\nA. No, because it treats barbershops differently from other commercial establishments.\nB. No, because it imposes a restriction on the content or subject matter of speech in the absence of any evidence that such a restriction is necessary to serve a compelling state interest.\nC. Yes, because it leaves political candidates free to communicate their campaign messages to voters by other means.\nD. Yes, because the operation of a licensed barbershop is a privilege and therefore is subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by the state.\n"

The law does not treat barbershops differently from other commercial establishments, but rather restricts the type of speech that can be displayed or distributed in bars, which is different from the general rule that applies to all commercial establishments. Additionally, the law does not impose a restriction on the content or subject matter of speech in the absence of any evidence that such a restriction is necessary to serve a compelling state interest. Therefore, the law may be considered unconstitutional under either A. or C., as it discriminates against barbershops based on their use of speech and may also violate the First Amendment's protection of freedom of speech."
