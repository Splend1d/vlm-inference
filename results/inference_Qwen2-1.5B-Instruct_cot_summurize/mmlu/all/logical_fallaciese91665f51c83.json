Hypostatization.\n\nHypostatization occurs when someone takes on the form or essence of something else without providing evidence or justification for it. In this case, if someone uses an emotionally charged restatement of a claim to make their point instead of supporting it with evidence or reasoning, they are committing hypostatization by assuming qualities or characteristics about the thing being claimed without presenting any actual evidence or reason to believe them true. This can be seen as using an emotional appeal rather than logical reasoning to persuade others of the validity of the claim."
