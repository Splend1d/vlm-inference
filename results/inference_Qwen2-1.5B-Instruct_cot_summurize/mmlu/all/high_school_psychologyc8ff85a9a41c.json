In Group I, each rat was raised in isolation with no toys, while in Group II, rats were divided into small groups and given toys to play with. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the probable findings of this study?\n\nA. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh more than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nB. The rats raised in Group I will have forebrains that weigh less than those of the rats raised in Group II.\nC. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will not be noticeably different from the brains of the rats raised in Group II.\nD.

                    "text": "The most likely answer is C. The brains of the rats raised in Group I will not be noticeably different from the brains of the rats raised in Group II.\n\nThis is because the statement \"in Group II, rats were divided into small groups and given toys to play with\" suggests that the rats raised in Group II had access to social interaction and playtime, which can help promote brain development and growth. On the other hand, the statement \"in Group I, each rat was raised in isolation with no toys\" suggests that the rats raised in Group I did not have access to social interaction or playtime, which could potentially impact their brain development.\n\nIt's important to note that there may be some variation in the results depending on various factors such as the age at which the rats were separated from their mothers, the duration of the separation period, and the type of toys provided for playtime. However, based solely on the information provided, it seems reasonable to conclude that the brains of the rats raised in Group I would not be significantly different from those raised in Group II."
