We also know that \\(a = -9.81 m/s^2\\) (the acceleration due to gravity). The initial velocity \\(u\\) is given as 10 m/s and the launch angle (\\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\)) is not needed for this calculation because it does not affect the magnitude of the initial velocity.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ v = 0 + (-9.81) \\times t \\]\n\\[ v = -9.81t \\]\n\nThe average velocity during the flight will be equal to the initial velocity divided by 2, since the object travels half the distance before reaching terminal velocity (assuming no change in direction).\n\nSo, the final velocity (\\(v_f\\)) is \\(v/2 = -4.905m/s\\).\n\nUsing the kinematic equation again:\n\n\\[ v = u + at \\]\n\\[ -4.905 = 0 + (-9.81)t \\]\n\\[ -4.905 = -9.81t \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{-4.905}{-9.81} \\]\n\\[ t = 0.5s \\]\n\nTherefore, the total flight time of the soccer ball without considering air resistance is 0.5 seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 0.5 s."
