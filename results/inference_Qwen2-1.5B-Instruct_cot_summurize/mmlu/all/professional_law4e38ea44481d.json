Along with the mirror itself, the manufacturer provided brackets and bolts to be used for hanging the mirror. The grocery store paid a local carpenter to come in and hang the mirror. A few days after the carpenter installed the mirror, the mirror suddenly fell from the wall because of a defect in the brackets. It struck a shopper on the head, causing serious injuries to him. If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.\nB. prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.\nC. not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.\nD. not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.\n"

The shopper will prevail because the brackets were defective when installed.\n\nStrict liability is a legal doctrine that holds individuals or entities responsible for harm caused by their products or actions even if they did not intend to cause harm. In this case, the grocery store's mirror fell from the wall due to defects in the brackets, which is an example of a product defect. Therefore, the shopper can assert a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the shopper cannot prevail simply because the mirror could have been more securely hung on the wall without any defect in the brackets. Option C is also incorrect because the carpenter was involved in installing the mirror and therefore has some degree of responsibility for its safety. Option D is incorrect because the carpenter had a relationship of privily with the shopper, as he was hired to install the mirror at the grocery store.\n\nIn summary, the shopper will prevail because the carpenter was responsible for installing the defective brackets that led to the mirror falling and striking the shopper."
