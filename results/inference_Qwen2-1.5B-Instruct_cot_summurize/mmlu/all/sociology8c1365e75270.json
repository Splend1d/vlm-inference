Globalization refers to the interconnectedness and interdependence of nations, economies, cultures, and societies on a global scale. It has led to increased communication and trade between countries, but it does not necessarily extend the power of nation-states in the same way that it stretches social relationships across borders. The power of nation-states can still be significant in certain areas such as military or political power, but they are no longer the dominant force in shaping global events. Therefore, option B is not a feature of globalization."
