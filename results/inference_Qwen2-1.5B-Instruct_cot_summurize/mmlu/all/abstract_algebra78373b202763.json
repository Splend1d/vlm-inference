Since g(b) = a, we have g(b) \u2260 b, which contradicts the definition of an injection (g(f(a)) = a). Therefore, statement 1 is not true.\nStatement 2 is true. If g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, then g(f(a)) must equal a for every element of B. This implies that g(f(a)) = a for all elements of B, which is equivalent to saying that g is surjective. Therefore, statement 2 is true."
