The water forms a puddle in the street, which freezes over during the night. Early the next morning, a car driving on the street slides on the ice and crashes into a tree. If the driver of the car sues the man and asserts that the man was negligent per Se, which of the following additional facts would help the man the most?\n\nA. The man was not aware of the ordinance.\nB. The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.\nC. The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident.\nD. The driver is not a resident of the city.\n"

Additionally, if the man had been aware of the ordinance at the time he washed his car, he might have taken steps to prevent any accidents from occurring."
