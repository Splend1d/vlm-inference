Similarly, if Congress wanted to increase tax rates, they could pass new legislation with that goal in mind. However, if Congress wants to authorize the Treasury to print money, it can do so without passing any specific legislation.\n\nIn short, while Congress does have some powers over monetary policy, it cannot simply authorize the Treasury to print money on its own initiative. Instead, such authority must be granted by Congress through specific legislation."
