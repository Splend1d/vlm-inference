BB \u00d7 Bb.\n\nIf the genotype of a parent is BB (Black Coat) and the genotype of the other parent is Bb (White Coat), then the offspring will have a 50% chance of inheriting the dominant gene for black coat from the mother (BB), and a 50% chance of inheriting the recessive gene for white coat from the father (bb). Therefore, three-quarters of the offspring will have black coats (3/4 * 1 = 0.75 or 75%), and one-quarter of the offspring will have white coats (1/4 * 1 = 0.25 or 25%). This matches the given information that three quarters of the offspring have black coats, and one quarter have white coats."
