The Ka constant can be found using the solubility product constant (Ksp), as shown below:\n\n- For Na2CO3: \\( K_{sp} = 5.6 \\times 10^{-9} \\)\n- For Na3PO4: \\( K_{sp} = 7.1 \\times 10^{-18} \\)\n- For Na2S: \\( K_{sp} = 4.3 \\times 10^{-4} \\)\n- For NaCl: \\( K_{sp} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-10} \\)\n\nWe also know that for a weak acid like Na2CO3 or Na2S, the dissociation constant \\( K_a \\) is much smaller than the solubility product constant \\( K_{sp} \\). Therefore, \\( [H^+] \\) will be very small compared to \\( [A^-] \\).\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the hydrogen ion concentrations for each solution.\n- For Na2CO3: \\( [H^+] = \\frac{10^{-pK_{a}}}{10^{-9}} = 10^{-pK_{a}-9} \\)\n- For Na3PO4: \\( [H^+] = \\frac{10^{-pK_{a}}}{10^{-18}} = 10^{-(pK_{a}-18)} \\)\n- For Na2S: \\( [H^+] = \\frac{10^{-pK_{a}}}{10^{-4}} = 10^{-(pK_{a}-4)} \\)\n- For NaCl: \\( [H^+] = \\frac{10^{-pK_{a}}}{10^{-10}} = 10^{-(pK_{a}-10)} \\)\n\nNow we can calculate the pH for each solution:\n- For Na2CO3: \\( pH = -\\log(10^{-pK_{a}-9}) = pK_{a}-9 \\)\n- For Na3PO4: \\( pH = -\\log(10^{-(pK_{a}-18)}) = pK_{a}-18 \\)\n- For Na2S: \\( pH = -\\log(10^{-(pK_{a}-4)}) = pK_{a}-4 \\)\n- For NaCl: \\( pH = -\\log(10^{-(pK_{a}-10)}) = pK_{a}-10 \\)\n\nSince \\( pK_{a} \\) is negative, all the pH values will be positive but close to zero. Therefore, the smallest value would correspond to the solution with the highest pH, which is B. Na3PO4."
