A better understanding of how cellular genes aid virus replication and so become a target for new drugs\n\nThe discovery that viruses can hijack the host cell's machinery has led to the development of antiviral drugs that target specific viral enzymes or proteins. This has improved our ability to treat viral infections, such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, and influenza. It has also led to the eradication of smallpox through vaccination programs and the eradication of polio through efforts to eradicate the disease in children worldwide. Additionally, research on viruses has led to advancements in our understanding of immunology, which has contributed to improvements in immune responses against infectious diseases. Overall, viruses have played an important role in shaping the course of human history and continue to do so today."
