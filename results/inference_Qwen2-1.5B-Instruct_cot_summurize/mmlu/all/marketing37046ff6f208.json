Inseparability.\n\nInseparability refers to the fact that services cannot be separated into distinct parts or components for sale individually. This means that once a service is provided, it becomes an integral part of the customer's experience and is delivered alongside other elements such as product quality and customer support. As a result, it is extremely difficult to standardize the delivery of services around a blueprint model, as any changes to one aspect of the service can affect all other aspects as well."
