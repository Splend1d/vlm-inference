It helps ensure consistency in messaging across all platforms and touchpoints, making it an effective tool for organizing and coordinating the marketing communications mix. \n\nPersonal selling (PS) refers to direct interactions between sellers and buyers, while direct marketing (DM) focuses on promoting products through various methods such as mail, phone, or email. Customer service (CS), on the other hand, deals with providing customer support and resolving issues related to products or services.\n\nWhile these approaches can be integrated within an overall marketing strategy, they do not necessarily form the entire basis of integrated marketing communications."
