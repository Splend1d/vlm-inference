The candidate subsequently lost the election and sued the newspaper for defamation. The newspaper defended on the grounds of truth. At trial, the candidate took the stand and testified that he was not a thief. Thereafter, the newspaper called a witness to testify that three years ago the candidate committed a larceny while employed at his former job. Upon objection by the candidate's attorney, the witness's testimony should be\n\nA. excluded, because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\nB. excluded, because it is improper character evidence.\nC. admitted as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity.\nD. admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.\n"

In order to prevail in its defense, the newspaper must prove that the statements made were true or that they were based on public information.\n\nIn this case, the newspaper argues that the candidate was a thief two years ago, which is a fact that could have been established through public records or other means. However, the newspaper also relies on the testimony of a witness who claims that the candidate committed a larceny during his employment three years ago. This is an attempt to introduce extrinsic evidence to prove the candidate's character for veracity.\n\nWhile the newspaper has the right to present any evidence it chooses, the court will generally exclude evidence that is irrelevant to the issue at hand, such as the witness's claim about the candidate's past criminal record. However, if the evidence is relevant and probative, the court will allow it to be presented.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the newspaper's claim that the candidate was a thief two years ago is relevant and probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity. The court will likely admit this evidence, even though it goes beyond what the newspaper has already introduced as part of its defense strategy."
