While walking home in the increasing darkness, Lizette notices that she can no longer distinguish the colors of objects. Which of the following best explains why Lizette cannot see color in dim light?\n\nA. Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nB. Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nC. Cones, which are specialized for black and white vision, require a small amount of light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in color, require greater amounts of light for vision.\nD. The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light.\n"

As the darkness increases, the retina adjusts its sensitivity to detect light, allowing Lizette to see colors even in dim light conditions. \n\nRods, on the other hand, are responsible for night vision and do not rely as much on light detection. They are sensitive to low light levels but have a narrower visual field than cones, which allows them to detect motion and fine detail.\n\nCones, on the other hand, are responsible for color perception and are more sensitive to light than rods. However, they also require more light to be activated compared to rods. In dim light conditions, cones may still be able to detect some colors, but their ability to differentiate between different colors may be reduced.\n\nIn summary, while rods play an important role in detecting motion and fine detail in dim light, they are not as sensitive to color as cones, which are responsible for color perception and require more light to be activated."
