Since each hour represents \\(30^\\circ\\), the angle between the hour and minute hands is:\n\n\\[6 \\times 30^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\]\n\nThis means that the difference between the two hands is \\(180^\\circ - 0^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\).\n\nWhen John returned home around 6:59 p.m., the hands were again pointing to 6 o'clock. The change in time from 6 p.m. to 6:59 p.m. would be:\n\n\\[1/6 \\text{ of an hour}\\]\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, this corresponds to:\n\n\\[1/6 \\times 60 = 10 \\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nHowever, since the difference between the angles is not exactly \\(180^\\circ - 0^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\), we need to account for the additional difference caused by the return journey.\n\nThe actual difference between the angles should be \\(180^\\circ - 10^\\circ = 170^\\circ\\). This discrepancy indicates that the hands moved past the 6 o'clock position by another 10 degrees during his return journey, which occurred within the last 10 minutes of his return. \n\nTherefore, the total amount of time he was away from home due to the movement of the hands is the difference between the time he left home and the time he returned home plus the extra 10 minutes:\n\n\\[6 \\text{ p.m.} + 10 \\text{ minutes} + 10 \\text{ minutes} = 7 \\text{ p.m.}\\]\n\nGiven that he returned around 6:59 p.m., the total time he was away is:\n\n\\[7 \\text{ p.m.} - 6 \\text{ p.m.} = 1 \\text{ hour} = 60 \\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. 40**."
