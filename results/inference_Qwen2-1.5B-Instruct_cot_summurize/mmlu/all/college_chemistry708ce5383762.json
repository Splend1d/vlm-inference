This process can be done in two ways: either by adding more salt or by decreasing the concentration of the salt.\n\nIn this case, we want to determine which solution has the highest ionic strength. The easiest way to do this is to look at the concentrations of the ions in each solution and compare them.\n\nFor solution A, we have 0.050 M AlCl3. The chloride ion has a molar mass of approximately 36 g/mol, so there would be approximately 0.017 mol of Cl- per liter of solution. The aluminum ion has a molar mass of approximately 27 g/mol, so there would be approximately 0.028 mol of Al3+ per liter of solution. Therefore, the ionic strength of solution A would be approximately:\n\n(0.028 - 0.017) / 27 = 0.004\n\nSo, the ionic strength of solution A is 0.004, which is the smallest value among the options given.\n\nSolution B has 0.100 M NaCl, which means there would be approximately 0.01 mol of Na+ per liter of solution and approximately 0.01 mol of Cl- per liter of solution. Therefore, the ionic strength of solution B would be approximately:\n\n0.01 / 23 = 0.0042\n\nSolution C has 0.050 M CaCl2, which means there would be approximately 0.01 mol of Ca2+ per liter of solution and approximately 0.05 mol of Cl- per liter of solution. Therefore, the ionic strength of solution C would be approximately:\n\n(0.05 - 0.01) / 100 = 0.004\n\nSolution D has 0.100 M HCl, which means there would be approximately 0.01 mol of H+ per liter of solution and approximately 0.1 mol of Cl- per liter of solution. Therefore, the ionic strength of solution D would be approximately:\n\n(0.1 - 0.01) / 1 = 0.01\n\nTherefore, the solution with the highest ionic strength is solution A, which has an ionic strength of 0.004."
