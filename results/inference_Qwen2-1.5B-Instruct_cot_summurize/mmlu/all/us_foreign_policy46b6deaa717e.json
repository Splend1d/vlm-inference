It was also an example of the doctrine of containment, as U.S. involvement was intended to prevent the fall of South Vietnam to the communists. Additionally, the war demonstrated that even a great power such as the United States may not be able to prevail against a determined enemy unless there is a clear objective and the national will to do so. Therefore, all of these factors make the Vietnam War an important historical event that shaped the post-war world."
