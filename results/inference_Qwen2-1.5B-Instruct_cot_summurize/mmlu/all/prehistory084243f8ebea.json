Caves that have been formed over millions of years can become vulnerable to these factors if they are not properly protected or maintained. As a result, many caves are closed to visitors to prevent further damage from occurring. This is why you might see signs indicating that a cave is \"closed to the public\" rather than just \"closed.\""
