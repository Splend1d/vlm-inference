As they were swimming, both men saw what appeared to be a large fin entangled in a nearby coral reef. Simultaneously, they shot their spear guns at the projecting wing-like figure. Unbeknownst to either of the friends, it was not a fish but rather another scuba diver. The victim was struck and slightly wounded by one of the spears. The victim asserts a claim for damages against the two friends. At trial, the judge should instruct the jury to rule\n\nA. in favor of both defendants if no evidence is presented showing who actually shot the spear that injured the victim.\nB. against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.\nC. against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both acted independently and not jointly.\nD. against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both shot their spear guns simultaneously.\n"

Against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.\n\nIn this scenario, both defendants (the two friends) fired their spearguns simultaneously and accidentally hit the third person. Since the injury occurred as a result of the accidental firing, both defendants must share liability equally. Therefore, neither can absolve themselves from responsibility. The court would then instruct the jury to decide based on whether one defendant proved that he did not shoot the spear that caused the injury. If one defendant could prove this, they would be held liable for half of the damages; otherwise, both defendants would share the liability equally."
