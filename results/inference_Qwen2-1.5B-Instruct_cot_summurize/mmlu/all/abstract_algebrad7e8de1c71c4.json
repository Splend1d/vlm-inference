The left-hand side counts the number of elements in the direct sum of two groups, while the right-hand side counts the product of their orders. In general, if G and H are finite groups with orders n and m respectively, then |G + H| will be equal to mn when G and H are abelian, but this is not necessarily true for non-abelian groups.\n\nStatement 2 is true.\nThis statement is a special case of Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup of a group must divide the order of the group. Since Z_m and Z_n are subgroups of Z_m + Z_n, their orders are both divisors of the order of the larger group. Therefore, by Lagrange's theorem, there exists a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s for some positive integers r and s dividing m and n respectively."
