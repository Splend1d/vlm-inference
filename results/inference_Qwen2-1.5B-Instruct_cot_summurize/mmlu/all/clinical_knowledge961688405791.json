This is because the heart's pumping action can cause a small amount of blood to be pushed into the lower extremities, resulting in a falsely low reading for systolic blood pressure. However, it should be noted that this phenomenon is rare and most blood pressure cuffs are designed to minimize or eliminate this effect. Therefore, option B (overestimate the blood pressure) is correct."
