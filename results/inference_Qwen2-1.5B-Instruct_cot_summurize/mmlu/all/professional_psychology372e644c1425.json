In this case, the child is focusing on the new dog rather than continuing to call the cat \"kitty.\" This demonstrates the ability to shift attention away from one thing to another, which is characteristic of children in the preoperational stage of Piaget's theory of cognitive development. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. centration."
