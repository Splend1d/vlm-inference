This can lead to a constructed memory, where individuals may only recall information in a certain way that aligns with their expectations or preconceptions about the question being asked. \n\nBrain injuries, such as those caused by accidents or trauma, can also affect memory function, but they are not directly related to leading questions or the formation of constructed memories.\n\nSerial position effects occur when people remember items in a list out of order due to the sequence of presentation rather than any actual memory error. Proactive interference refers to the tendency for people to remember new information at the expense of older, less recently learned information, which is unrelated to the question being asked.\n\nTherefore, leading questions are most likely to lead to a constructed memory."
