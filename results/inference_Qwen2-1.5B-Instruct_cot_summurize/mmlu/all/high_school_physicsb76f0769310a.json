However, since the direction remains the same, the total force acting on the particle also doubles. The electric field strength E is constant, so the force due to the electric field will also double.\n\nIf the mass is halved, the force acting on the particle becomes half as strong. This means that the work done by the electric field on the particle during its displacement will be reduced by a factor of 4 because of the change in force from doubling the velocity while keeping the electric field strength unchanged. \n\nSince work done = force x displacement, the new displacement covered by the particle is:\n\n\\[ \\text{New Displacement} = \\frac{\\text{Work Done}}{\\text{Force}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 2d = \\frac{1}{2}d \\]\n\nTherefore, when the velocity is doubled and the mass is halved, the particle travels a distance \\( \\frac{1}{2}d \\), which corresponds to option C. d."
