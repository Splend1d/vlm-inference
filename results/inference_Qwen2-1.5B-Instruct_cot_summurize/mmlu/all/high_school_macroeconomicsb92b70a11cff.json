This decrease in money supply leads to an increase in interest rates, which can lead to an increase in excess reserves in the banking system. As a result, excess reserves will increase because banks have more money to lend out and earn interest on.\n\nOn the other hand, when the reserve ratio is increased or checking deposits increase (which would cause excess reserves to decrease), this does not necessarily lead to an increase in excess reserves in the banking system. These changes affect the overall level of money supply and interest rates, but they do not directly impact excess reserves. Similarly, increasing the discount rate or decreasing the reserve ratio would also not directly impact excess reserves."
