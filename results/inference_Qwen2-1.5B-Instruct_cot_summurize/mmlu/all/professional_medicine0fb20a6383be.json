At the time of the initial wound, he was discharged after 6 hours of observation with no fractures or soft-tissue swelling. A loud murmur is heard on auscultation; there is a thrill. He has dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Arterial spasm\nB. Arteriovenous fistula\nC. Deep venous thrombosis\nD. Occlusion of the superficial femoral artery\n"

Deep venous thrombosis\n\nDeep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a common complication of trauma and is more likely to occur in individuals who have been immobilized for an extended period, such as those who were previously shot. The patient's symptoms of a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar, a loud murmur on auscultation, and dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg suggest that deep vein thrombosis is present. Additionally, the presence of a deep vein thrombosis would explain why the patient was able to be observed without further intervention at the time of the initial injury."
