Choroid plexus\n\nThe choroid plexus is a network of capillaries and blood vessels that line the roof of the third ventricle, which is the opening to the brain and spinal cord. It is responsible for producing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which serves as a protective cushion around the brain and spinal cord. The CSF contains important nutrients and chemicals that help support normal brain function."
