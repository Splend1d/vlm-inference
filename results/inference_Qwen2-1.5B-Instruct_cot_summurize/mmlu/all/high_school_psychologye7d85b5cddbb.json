Yerkes-Dodson law, which states that there is an optimal level of exercise or activity for an individual, above which there is increased stress and below which there is decreased performance. In this case, Conrad began to review his notes two weeks before finals, which was well within the recommended range of exercise for optimal performance. However, when he came down with the flu right after finals, his body responded by increasing its stress levels, which led to poor performance on the exam. This is why it is important to maintain a healthy balance between physical activity and rest in order to avoid burnout."
