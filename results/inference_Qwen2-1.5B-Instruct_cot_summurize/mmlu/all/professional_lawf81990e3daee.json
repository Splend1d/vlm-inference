It also has several movie theaters, an ice-skating rink, a small amusement park, and a branch of the local public library. The mall is advertised as \"a small town with a big-town feel.\" During shopping hours, a group of 10 protesters gathered in the pedestrian area near the entrance to a department store to denounce the sale of animal fur products in that store. The protesters were peaceful and did not interfere with traffic into or out of the store, but they carried signs and vocally communicated their message to people walking in the area. Mall management quickly broke up the protest and required the protesters to leave the mall. The protesters have sued the mall, claiming that their right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was violated. Should the protesters prevail?\n\nA. No, because the mall is private property, and there was no state action to which the freedom of speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments apply.\nB. No, because the prohibition of protests adjacent to the entrance of a department store during shopping hours is a constitutionally proper limitation on the time, place, and manner of speech.\nC. Yes, because the mall is functionally equivalent to a town and, therefore, its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.\nD. Yes, because the mall's restriction on the protesters' speech was broader than necessary to ensure proper access to the department store.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Yes, because the mall is functionally equivalent to a town and, therefore, its actions are subject to the Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and assembly.\n\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects freedom of speech and assembly, including the right to protest peacefully in public spaces. In this case, the mall is open to the public and includes various facilities such as restaurants, movie theaters, an ice-skating rink, and a small amusement park. Therefore, it can be considered a town for the purposes of constitutional law, even though it may be privately owned.\n\nThe mall's restrictions on the protesters' speech were not narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, particularly since the only significant interest served by the restrictions was to ensure proper access to the department store. Additionally, the restrictions were more extensive than necessary to achieve that goal. Therefore, the protesters should prevail in their lawsuit against the mall."
