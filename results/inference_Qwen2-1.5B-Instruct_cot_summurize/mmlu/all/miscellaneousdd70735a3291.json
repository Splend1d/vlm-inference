According to Article III, Section 1 of the United States Constitution, judges \"shall hold their offices during good behavior.\" This means that judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, but they are not subject to removal by Congress. The only exception to this rule is if a judge engages in misconduct or disobeys the laws, which could result in their removal from office. Therefore, federal judges retain their independence and are not subject to political influence."
