The farmer decides to test H0: \u03bc = 4.0 ounces versus Ha : \u03bc > 4.0 ounces, at a 5 percent level of significance, where \u03bc = the mean weight of apples using the new fertilizer. The weights of apples are approximately normally distributed. The farmer takes a random sample of 16 apples and computes a mean of 4.3 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.6 ounces. Which of the following gives the p-value for this test?\n\nA. P(Z > 2)\nB. P(Z < 2)\nC. P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\nD. P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n"
