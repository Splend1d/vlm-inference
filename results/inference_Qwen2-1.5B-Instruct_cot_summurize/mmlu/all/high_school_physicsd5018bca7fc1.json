Which of the following is the primary reason for this phenomenon?\n\nA. The molecules of the person are, on average, moving faster than those of the surroundings.\nB. Thermal energy moves from high concentration areas (hot) to low concentration areas (cold).\nC. As heat flows out of the person and warms the fluid surrounding the person, the warmer fluid rises, allowing fresh cool fluid to come in contact with the person and increasing the rate of heat transfer.\nD. Water has more molecules per volume than air, increasing molecular contact with the person.\n"

Thermal energy moves from high concentration areas (hot) to low concentration areas (cold).\n\nWhen a person falls into a cold lake, they are exposed to a sudden drop in temperature. This change in temperature causes thermal energy to move from the warm body of the person to the colder water around them. This process increases the kinetic energy of the molecules in the water, causing them to vibrate and collide with each other at higher speeds.\n\nAs the thermal energy continues to increase, it eventually reaches the point where the kinetic energy exceeds the resistance offered by the water molecules themselves. At this point, the thermal energy is converted into heat, which is then transferred to the person's body through conduction and convection.\n\nThis rapid conversion of thermal energy into heat allows the person to quickly lose significant amounts of body heat, leading to hypothermia and eventual death if not treated promptly. Therefore, B is the correct answer."
