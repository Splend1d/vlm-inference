Beyond sense experience to unchanging ideas (Forms) that are perceived as rationally ordered.\n\nPlato argues that knowledge is a form of belief that is justified by reason rather than by sensory perception alone. He believes that knowledge comes from perceiving the Forms, which are unchanging ideas that exist independently of our perceptions. These Forms can be perceived through rational reflection and reasoning, rather than through direct sensory experience.\n\nIn contrast, Aristotle argued that knowledge is a form of belief that is justified by sensory experience. He believed that knowledge arises from our innate understanding of the world, rather than from any external source. This view was later developed by Descartes and other philosophers who rejected the idea of innate ideas and instead posited a dualistic view of mind and body.\n\nTherefore, while both Aristotle and Descartes held different views on the nature of knowledge, Plato's position that knowledge is a form of belief based on unchanging Ideas (Forms) is still widely accepted today."
