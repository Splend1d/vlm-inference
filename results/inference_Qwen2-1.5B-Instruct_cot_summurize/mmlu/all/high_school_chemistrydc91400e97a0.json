The samples were titrated with standard potassium hydroxide, KOH, solution. Cresol red was the acid-base indicator used in the titration. The samples required 31.75, 32.38, and 41.75 mL to reach the endpoint. Which of the following might explain why one of the samples required significantly more base to reach the endpoint?\n\nA. The indicator was added too late.\nB. The wrong indicator was used.\nC. There was a base contaminating the unclean beaker.\nD. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.\n\nWhen phenol reacts with KOH, it forms a precipitate of phenolate (C6H5O-), which can interfere with the reaction if there is a source of acid present. The presence of acid in the beaker could have caused the phenol to react with KOH instead of forming phenolate, resulting in a higher amount of phenol being consumed by the acid than expected. This would lead to a lower pH at the end of the titration, making it difficult for the indicator to change color. Therefore, option D is the most likely explanation."
