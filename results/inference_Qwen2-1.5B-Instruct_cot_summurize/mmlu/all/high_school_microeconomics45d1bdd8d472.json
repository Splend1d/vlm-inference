Studying: Let's say Nancy earns $x per hour studying. Her total benefit (or \"opportunity\" in this context) would be \\(x \\times 1\\) hours of studying.\n\nB. Mowing the Lawn: Nancy earns $6 per hour mowing the lawn. So, the opportunity cost of mowing the lawn is \\(6 \\times 1 = \\$6\\).\n\nC. Babysitting: Nancy earns $8 per hour babysitting. So, the opportunity cost of babysitting is \\(8 \\times 1 = \\$8\\).\n\nD. The statement \"Nancy's behavior is irrational\" refers to the fact that she chose to study instead of mowing the lawn or babysitting. This doesn't necessarily imply any of the given options are better, worse, or indifferent.\n\nComparing the options based on their statements:\n\n- A states that the benefit from studying is greater than the opportunity cost ($\\$8$), which could be true if Nancy finds studying more beneficial than babysitting or mowing the lawn.\n- B states that the opportunity cost of studying is $14, which is less than the benefit received from studying, meaning studying is indeed a better choice.\n- C states that Nancy is indifferent between studying and mowing the lawn, which is not accurate as studying offers a clear benefit over mowing the lawn.\n- D states that Nancy's behavior is irrational because babysitting was clearly superior to all other options, but this isn't supported by the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B**, stating that the opportunity cost of studying is $8, which is less than the benefit received from studying."
