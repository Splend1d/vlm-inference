Secondary rules are the rules that govern the legal consequences arising from a breach of the primary rules, ie of the international obligations of the States\n\nThe meaning of secondary rules in the law of international responsibility refers to the rules that provide for the legal consequences that may arise from a breach of primary rules. These consequences can include the imposition of penalties or other measures by the international community, such as reparations or sanctions. The specific rules that make up secondary rules vary depending on the context and the nature of the breach. For example, if a state fails to comply with an obligation under the law of international responsibility, it may be subject to criminal charges, civil liability, or diplomatic isolation."
