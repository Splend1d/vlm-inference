Although the player attempted to continue playing for the team, he failed a physical examination and was cut from the team roster. After failing his physical, the team discontinued making contract payments to the player as per the terms of his employment contract. In his lawsuit, the player claimed that he was physically fit to continue playing but that he was cut from the team because they wanted to stop making contract payments. At trial, the team called its physician, an orthopedist, to testify that the player's hip injury was, in fact, career-threatening and, in his opinion, sufficiently serious to warrant failing his physical. The team physician stated during his testimony that his diagnosis was based, in part, upon an examination of the player's x-rays and review of an MRI test conducted by another doctor. Neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results have been admitted into evidence. In all likelihood, the team physician's testimony should be\n\nA. admissible, provided that the other doctor testifies as to the validity of the MRI test results.\nB. admissible, provided the team physician based his opinion on data reasonably relied upon by other orthopedic physicians in the field.\nC. inadmissible, because neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results had been admitted into evidence at the time he formulated his opinion.\nD. inadmissible, because the team physician's opinion was not based in part upon his own firsthand observation of the player's physical condition.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. admissible, provided the team physician based his opinion on data reasonably relied upon by other orthopedic physicians in the field.\n\nIn this scenario, the player's claim is that he was cut from the team roster due to a serious hip injury, which the team denies. The team's physician, an orthopedist, testified that the player's hip injury was career-threatening and required discontinuing contract payments under the terms of the player's employment contract. However, the team physician also acknowledged that the player's injury may have been more severe than initially believed, given the severity of the athlete's performance decline after failing the physical examination.\n\nTo support their position, the team called their orthopedic physician to testify about the extent of the player's injury. During cross-examination, the opposing counsel asked whether the physician would consider admitting to the jury that the player's hip injury was career-ending without further testing or direct observation of the player's physical condition. The physician responded that while it is possible to diagnose a career-ending injury based on medical records and imaging studies alone, such conclusions require careful consideration and interpretation, and cannot be made with certainty.\n\nGiven the testimony of both doctors, it appears that the team's physician based his opinion on data reasonably relied upon by other orthopedic physicians in the field. Therefore, the team physician's testimony regarding the player's hip injury is admissible. Additionally, if the opposing party calls an expert witness who provides additional testimony about the validity of the MRI test results, the court will likely admit those findings as well."
