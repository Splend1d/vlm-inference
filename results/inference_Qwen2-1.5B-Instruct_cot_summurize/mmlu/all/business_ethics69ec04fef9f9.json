This can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context, but generally, it means that there may be no clear guidelines or standards for the subject to follow. \n\nTherefore, based on this interpretation, option A (3,4) could potentially fit the description of being irrational and uncodified, as it involves numbers and does not necessarily follow any established rules or conventions. However, without additional information about the context and purpose of the statement, it is difficult to determine which specific aspect of the statement applies more directly to the given options."
