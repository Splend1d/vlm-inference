He hires a crop-duster to spray the field, but the crop- duster mistakenly sprays a strong herbicide, rather than a pesticide, and kills all the corn plants in the field. Several days later, a construction company building a house near the farmer's field negligently hits a gas line and starts a fire that burns everything in the area, including the farmer's field. If the farmer brings negligence claims against the crop-duster and the construction company in order to recover damages for the destruction of his corn crop, the most likely result is\n\nA. only the crop-duster is liable, because its negligence occurred before the construction company's negligence.\nB. only the construction company is liable, because its negligence would have destroyed the farmer's corn crop no matter what the crop- duster did.\nC. both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable, because each engaged in a negligent action that was sufficient to destroy the farmer's corn crop.\nD. neither the crop-duster nor the construction company is liable, because neither is a \"but for\" cause of the harm.\n"

This means that if one party is found to be responsible for causing the harm, then any other party may also be held responsible based on the theory of proximate causation. In this case, the farmer can sue both the crop-duster and the construction company, even though they acted independently of each other, because their actions were sufficiently connected to cause the harm.\n\nTherefore, the most likely result would be that both the crop-duster and the construction company are liable for the damage caused by the accidental spraying of the herbicide and the accidental fire, respectively."
