If you will replace them with all new tiles, I will pay you $5,000. \" The roofer replied, \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule. \" The homeowner then remarked, \"That's all right, but let me know soon. \" Three days later, the roofer drove his pickup truck to the homeowner's home and unloaded the materials and equipment needed to perform the roofing job. When the homeowner looked out his window and saw what was transpiring, he immediately ran outside and exclaimed, \"Stop! The deal's off. I decided to repair the roof myself. \"In an action by the roofer against the homeowner for breach of contract, which of the following would provide the roofer with his best theory of recovery?\n\nA.

The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.\n\nWhen the homeowner offered to pay $5,000 for the roofer to replace all the old tiles in the roof and clear his busy schedule, this constituted an offer. The roofer accepted the offer by agreeing to perform the work and delivering the necessary materials and equipment to the homeowner's house. Therefore, the roofer had a valid bilateral contract with the homeowner.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there was no agreement between the parties to form a bilateral contract based on the purchase of materials and equipment. Option B is also incorrect because the offer did not become irrevocable until the roofer actually started performing the work. Option C is incorrect because the homeowner's statement about repairing the roof himself does not constitute an offer, as it is a proposal to perform a service rather than a formal offer to pay money for something."
