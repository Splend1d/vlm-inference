In other words, the force used must be reasonable in response to the perceived threat posed by the aggressor.\n\nIn the context of international law, this principle applies not only to military actions but also to all forms of coercion or aggression, including economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and other measures taken by states to exert pressure on another state.\n\nTherefore, when a state engages in coercive action against another state, it must ensure that the measures employed are proportional to the perceived threat posed by the target state. This means that the state cannot use excessive force or engage in behavior that would violate the rights and freedoms of the targeted state's citizens. Instead, it should strive to achieve its goals through dialogue, negotiation, and other peaceful means.\n\nIn summary, the meaning of proportionality in relation to the options available to the victim state is that they must use only those means and force that are necessary to defeat the aggressor, and that the measures employed must be reasonable in response to the perceived threat posed by the target state."
