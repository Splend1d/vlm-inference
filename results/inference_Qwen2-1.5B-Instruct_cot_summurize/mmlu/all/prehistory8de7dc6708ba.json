Some resource-rich environments allow for the creation of surpluses that can lead to economic inequalities and social complexity.\n\nEconomic inequality arises when individuals or groups have different access to resources, including food. In some cases, societies with more abundant resources may develop economies based on trade and specialization, leading to greater economic disparity and social complexity. Surplus food production is one way to achieve this level of social complexity and economic inequality."
