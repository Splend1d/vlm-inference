Therefore, playing the guitar while someone else is sleeping would be considered morally wrong. \n\nOption A is incorrect because not all actions that involve music or personal expression necessarily result in moral wrongdoing. \n\nOption B is also incorrect because telling someone they are attractive without their consent is generally considered unethical and may be harmful to the person's self-esteem. However, turning up the thermostat to make someone feel comfortable is seen as acceptable behavior in many situations. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: \"Not wrong, Wrong\" - playing the guitar while someone else is sleeping would be considered morally wrong."
