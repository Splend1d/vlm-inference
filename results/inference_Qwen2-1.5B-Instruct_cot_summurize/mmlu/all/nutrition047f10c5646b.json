However, in general, fruits like apples tend to be lower in calories per serving compared to many other types of food. Broccoli is also relatively low in calories and high in nutrients.\n\nCheese burgers can vary widely in terms of their nutritional content, but they generally contain more calories than other options on this list. \n\nTherefore, it's difficult to say definitively which food is the \"cheapest\" and \"most nutritious,\" as these factors would depend on various factors such as individual costs and portion sizes. In general, a balanced diet with a variety of nutrient-rich foods will provide the best combination of affordability and nutrition for most people."
