Recognition is only afforded to particular administrative acts not to the entity's declared statehood.\n\nRecognition refers to the act of recognizing or acknowledging the existence and rights of another country or political entity. This can be done through diplomatic gestures such as sending envoys, signing treaties, or issuing statements of support.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that recognition is not always granted based on the actual statehood of the entity being recognized. In some cases, recognition may be given to an entity that has not yet been formally established or recognized by other states. For example, the United Nations has recognized several non-state actors, such as international organizations and terrorist groups, with the understanding that they do not have the same status as sovereign states."
