No significant difference; low-income urban and rural people face similar constraints in accessing food and consume similar diets in developing countries.\nB. It will reduce poverty and hunger because these are almost entirely concentrated in rural areas.\nC. Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\nD. Poor city folk eat mainly sorghum, millet, maize and root crops, so a lot more of those foods will need to be produced as the world urbanises.\n"

This can result in higher prices for food commodities, which may put pressure on the poor and vulnerable populations who rely on subsistence farming or other forms of food production. Additionally, urban residents often have limited access to affordable and nutritious food options, making them more vulnerable to malnutrition and other health issues related to poor nutrition."
