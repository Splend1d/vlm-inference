Bayesian methods, which include the use of probability distributions and Bayes' theorem, place greater emphasis on uncertainty quantification and subjective belief about the underlying distribution of the data. In contrast, frequentist methods rely more heavily on statistical inference based on observed data, without considering subjective probabilities or beliefs.\n\nTherefore, it is possible that a non-Gaussian noise model could be used in a Bayesian framework, but not necessarily in a frequentist one. Similarly, both approaches can be used with probabilistic models, including the use of prior distributions and class priors. However, the specific choice of model and its implementation will depend on the research question and the goals of the analysis."
