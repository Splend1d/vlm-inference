This is because following someone without their consent is generally considered unethical and illegal in many countries. In the United States, it is considered a crime known as stalking or harassment if it occurs with intent to cause fear or distress.\nIn scenario 2, paying the bill with a 42-cent stamp may be seen as a minor inconvenience but not necessarily morally wrong. It depends on the context and circumstances of the situation. If the stamp was used to ensure that the bill was received safely, then it could be considered a reasonable action. However, if the intention behind using the stamp was to delay or obstruct the payment process for personal gain or revenge, then it would be considered morally wrong."
