The reserve requirement is 5%, which means that for every $100 worth of assets (such as cash or deposits) held by banks, they must hold back 5% in reserves.\n\nTherefore, if the FED sells $10 million worth of government securities, this will result in an increase in reserves in circulation by:\n\n$10 million x 5% = $500,000\n\nThis increase in reserves will cause an increase in the money supply because more money is available to be loaned out into the economy.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A: increase by $200 million."
