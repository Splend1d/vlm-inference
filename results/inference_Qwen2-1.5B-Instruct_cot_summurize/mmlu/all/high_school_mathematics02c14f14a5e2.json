We know that a year has 365 days (or 366 if considering leap years). Since Carlos has already lived through an extra year, he has also lived through another full cycle of 365 days. This means he has already accumulated 706 days into 706/365 \u2248 1.95 years. However, since we're only interested in the number of days, not years, this doesn't change our approach significantly.\n\nSo, we'll continue with the calculation as follows:\n\n\\[706 \\text{ days} = 13 \\text{ weeks} + 8 \\text{ days}\\]\n\\[706 \\div 365 = 1 \\text{ remainder } 14\\]\n\\[14 \\text{ days} = 2 \\text{ weeks} + 2 \\text{ days}\\]\n\nThus, Carlos will be 706 days old on a Sunday (since there are 2 full weeks plus 2 additional days).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **Sunday**."
