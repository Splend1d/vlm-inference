                    "text": "The problem states that you need to lift a 100-N crate with an ideal pulley system and pull a rope downward with 25 N of force. \n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of work done in lifting an object against gravity. The work done is given by:\n\nWork = Force \u00d7 Distance\n\nIn this case, the distance is 1 meter (m) since the rope is pulled down for a distance of 1 meter.\n\nTherefore, the work done in lifting the crate is:\n\nWork = 25 N \u00d7 1 m = 25 J\n\nSince the crate has a mass of 100 kg and the weight of the crate is equal to its mass times the acceleration due to gravity (g), we can find the acceleration of the crate using Newton's second law:\n\nF = ma\n\nWhere F is the net force acting on the crate, m is the mass of the crate, and a is the acceleration.\n\nGiven that the net force is 25 N, we have:\n\n25 N = ma\n\nSolving for a, we get:\n\na = 25 N / 100 kg = 0.25 m/s^2\n\nNow, we know that the acceleration of the crate is 0.25 m/s^2. Since the crate is lifted up at an angle, the net force will be greater than the applied force (25 N). Therefore, the tension in the rope will be greater than 25 N.\n\nHowever, we don't need to calculate the tension in the rope because the question asks about the rise of the crate when pulling the rope down. The crate rises when the tension in the rope is greater than 25 N and the rope is pulled down for a distance of 1 meter.\n\nUsing the formula for work done, we can find the height reached by the crate:\n\nWork = Force \u00d7 Distance\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\n25 J = 25 N \u00d7 h\n\nSolving for h, we get:\n\nh = 25 J / 25 N = 1 m\n\nTherefore, the crate rises 1 meter when pulling the rope down with 25 N of force. This matches option B: 25 m."
