Appeal to higher loyalties, Metaphor of the ledger, Denial of injury. \n\nThis strategy involves appealing to one's sense of duty or loyalty to justify ethical behavior or deny wrongdoing. For example, someone who believes in following their conscience may use this strategy to defend their actions even when they harm others. They might argue that their actions align with their higher loyalties or moral principles, rather than focusing on the potential harm caused by their actions. This approach can be seen as a way to rationalize unethical behavior or to excuse it if it results in a greater good."
