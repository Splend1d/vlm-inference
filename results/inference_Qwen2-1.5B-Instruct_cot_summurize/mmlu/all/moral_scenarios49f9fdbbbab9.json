However, it's important to note that this action would not be considered morally wrong if it were done in a controlled and non-destructive manner. In this case, the protagonist intentionally harmed their own body, which goes against ordinary moral standards.\n\nIn scenario 2, cashing a check that was meant for one's dead grandmother is also considered morally wrong. This is because it involves taking someone else's property without permission, which violates trust and respect for others' rights. While it may be justified under certain circumstances, such as when the check is fraudulent or the recipient has died, this action generally goes against ordinary moral standards."
