Fruit bats\n\nThe Lassa virus, which causes Lassa fever, is believed to have originated from fruit bats (possibly flying foxes) that feed on the fruits of the African mango tree. The virus was first identified in 1965 in Nigeria, where it is now found in several West African countries including Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Ivory Coast.\n\nEbola virus, which causes Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is also believed to have originated from fruit bats, specifically the fruit bat species called Hainan palm civet or red-bellied fruit bat. This virus has been associated with outbreaks in Central Africa, particularly in Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. However, the exact origin of the virus remains uncertain due to its complex evolutionary history and the fact that it has multiple natural reservoirs."
