Therefore, if the car is traveling at 40 mph (67 km/h), the maximum safe speed for driving on a flat surface without slipping would be around 30-35 mph (48-56 km/h). \n\nHowever, since the car is sliding sideways onto the curb, the situation is much more dangerous as the force required to overcome the friction becomes much greater. A car traveling at 40 mph (67 km/h) could easily reach this point with enough momentum before losing control and flipping over.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 40 mph."
