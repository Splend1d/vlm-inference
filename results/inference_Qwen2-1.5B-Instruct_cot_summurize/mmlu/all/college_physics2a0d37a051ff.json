An absorption spectrum shows the wavelength at which light is absorbed by a substance, while an emission spectrum shows the wavelengths at which light is emitted by a substance.\n\nIn contrast, an emission spectrum identifies the wavelengths at which atoms or molecules release energy when they absorb photons (particles of light). This means that the wavelengths in an emission spectrum will not necessarily match those in an absorption spectrum, as they represent different processes within the same object.\n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect."
