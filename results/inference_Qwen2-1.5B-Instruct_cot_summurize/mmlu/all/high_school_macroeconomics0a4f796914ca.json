An increase in government spending\n\nAn increase in government spending typically leads to an increase in aggregate demand, which can lead to an increase in real GDP over time if there is not a corresponding increase in prices (i.e., inflation). This is because increased government spending will create more money in circulation and increase consumer and business spending, which can lead to higher levels of economic activity.\n\nOn the other hand, an increase in taxes or a decrease in net exports would likely decrease real GDP as they reduce aggregate demand and lead to lower levels of economic activity. Similarly, an increase in the real rate of interest would also likely decrease real GDP as it reduces the amount of money available for investment and consumption."
