Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant Commissioner, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, 1865\nWhich of the following specific developments contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15?\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\nB. Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\nC. French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\nD. Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland.\n"

This sentiment can be seen as contributing to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15, which argues against slavery based on the belief that it violates human rights.\n\nWhile there are other historical events mentioned in the passage (such as the British refusal to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region, the Spanish reoccupation of Florida, French aid to Native Americans in New England, and Dutch trading pressure on American ships), none of these events directly contribute to the sentiment expressed in Federalist #15 about the treatment of African Americans after the Civil War.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region."
