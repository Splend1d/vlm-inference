                    "text": "The answer is C: incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization. The binding of ZP3 receptors to ZP3 initiates the sperm's acrosomal reaction, which leads to the penetration of the zona pellucida and the release of the sperm into the oocyte. Therefore, injecting eggs with antibodies that block ZP3 binding should not prevent in vitro fertilization. Similarly, coating synthetic beads with ZP2, which does not bind to ZP3, should also not prevent sperm from aggregating on the beads. However, it is possible that other experiments may show that injecting eggs with antibodies that block ZP3 binding or coating beads with ZP2 can prevent in vitro fertilization. Without additional information about the specific experimental conditions being studied, it is difficult to determine whether any of these options would be expected to block in vitro fertilization."
