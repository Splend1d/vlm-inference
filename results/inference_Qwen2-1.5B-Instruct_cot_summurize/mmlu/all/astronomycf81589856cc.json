This statement does not directly support the Giant Impact Hypothesis, which suggests that the Moon formed from debris left behind by an impact event with a larger object such as a planet or asteroid. The age of the Moon's rocks provides additional evidence for the formation of the Moon, but it does not specifically address the hypothesis itself."
