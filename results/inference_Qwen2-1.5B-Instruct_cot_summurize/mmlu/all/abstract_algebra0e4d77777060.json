Since for every pair of elements in the set \\(A\\), there exists another element in the set such that it forms a pair with itself, this means that every element in \\(A\\) is related to itself by the relation \\(S\\).\n\nTherefore, the relation \\(S\\) is symmetric because if \\(x = y\\) in \\(A\\), then \\(y = x\\) in \\(S\\). \n\nHowever, the relation \\(S\\) is not antisymmetric since if \\(x = y\\) in \\(A\\), then it does not necessarily follow that \\(y = x\\) in \\(S\\). For example, consider the pairs \\((1, 1)\\) and \\((2, 2)\\) from \\(S\\), but these pairs do not form a pair in \\(A\\).\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Anti-symmetric only**"
