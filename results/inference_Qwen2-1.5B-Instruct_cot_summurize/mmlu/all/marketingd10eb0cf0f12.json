Price skimming\n\nPrice skimming is an effective pricing strategy for introducing a new and unique product to the market as it allows you to earn a higher profit margin initially by setting a high price, knowing that consumers will be willing to pay more than the original cost due to the novelty and uniqueness of the product. This approach can also help to build brand loyalty and create a perception of exclusivity around the product. However, it's important to note that this strategy may not work well in all markets or for all products, and it should be used with caution."
