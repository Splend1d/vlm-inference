Late one evening, he fell asleep in his kiosk and failed to warn of the approach of an oncoming train. A man, who was driving his car, knew of the usual presence of the watchman. As he approached the crossing, he received no warning. Driving onto the track, the man's car was struck and crushed by the train. The man died instantly. A few minutes after the accident, a police officer arrived at the crossing and walked into the kiosk. As he entered, the defendant then awoke. The police officer asked him, \"What happened here?\" The defendant made incriminating statements. The defendant is subsequently charged with involuntary manslaughter. His motion to prevent the introduction of his incriminating statements into evidence will most likely be\n\nA. granted, because the police officer failed to give the defendant his Miranda warnings.\nB. granted, because the police officer's conduct in questioning the defendant immediately after he awoke was unfairly prejudicial to the defendant.\nC. denied, because the exchange took place in a non-custodial setting and the question was investigatory in nature.\nD. denied, because the defendant's incriminating statements were voluntary.\n"

In this case, the defendant's statement may not have been intended to cause harm, but it could still be considered harmful if it leads to wrongful conviction or punishment.\n\nThe defendant's motion should be granted because the police officer's questioning did not follow the required Miranda warnings before asking the incriminating questions, which could implicate the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Additionally, the immediate questioning after the defendant awoke from sleep may have created a situation where the defendant felt compelled to confess due to the pressure of being questioned by law enforcement. This could undermine the voluntariness of the defendant's statement and lead to a wrongful conviction.\n\nIt is important to note that these considerations are based on general principles and may vary depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. It is always advisable to consult with legal counsel when considering such motions."
