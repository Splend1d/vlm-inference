Severe atopic dermatitis: This is an allergic reaction to certain proteins in cow's milk, which can cause redness, itching, and inflammation on the skin.\n2. Enterocolitis: Cow's milk contains casein, a protein that can cause digestive problems in some individuals, including diarrhea and abdominal pain.\n3. Diarrhea: Some infants and children with a cow's milk allergy/intolerance may experience diarrhea as a result of their body's immune system attacking the casein in the milk.\n\nIt is important for parents and caregivers to be aware of these potential symptoms and seek medical attention if they suspect that their child has a cow's milk allergy/intolerance. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent serious complications and improve outcomes."
