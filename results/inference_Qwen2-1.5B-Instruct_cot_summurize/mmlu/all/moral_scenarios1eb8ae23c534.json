Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nScenario 1 involves a parent using their own time to take care of household tasks, which is generally considered acceptable behavior. However, it's important to note that if the child was alone or vulnerable during this time, then the action may be seen as neglectful.\n\nScenario 2 involves a child acting out of character for Halloween by dressing up as a violent character from popular culture. While this can be seen as disrespectful or inappropriate, it also raises questions about the appropriateness of costumes in general and the role of Halloween in promoting violence and horror. Additionally, the use of a real weapon, even a fake one, can be dangerous and should not be encouraged. \n\nIn both cases, the actions taken by the characters may be seen as morally wrong, but they fall into different categories based on context and severity. The first scenario could potentially be seen as neglectful, while the second could be seen as irresponsible or potentially harmful."
