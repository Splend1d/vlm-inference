The baseline levels of the behavior cannot be established.\n\nOperant extinction is a method used to extinguish unwanted behaviors by reducing their probability of occurring through punishment or negative reinforcement. However, if the baseline levels of the behavior cannot be established, it may not be possible to determine how much punishment or negative reinforcement is required to extinguish the behavior.\n\nTherefore, the other options (A) an alternative behavior cannot be identified, (B) the behavior has been reinforced on a continuous schedule, and (C) a temporary increase in the behavior cannot be tolerated) do not necessarily preclude the use of operant extinction as a treatment option. However, the inability to establish the baseline levels of the behavior makes operant extinction less likely to be effective."
