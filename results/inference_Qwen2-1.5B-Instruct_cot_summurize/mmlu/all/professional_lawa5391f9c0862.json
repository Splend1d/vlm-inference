However, a study by the federal Food and Drug Administration revealed that the pies contain potentially harmful levels of nuts for some consumers with nut allergies. As a result, Congress enacted legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines. A state has a statute that regulates the shipment and sale of the pies within its territory. In light of the federal legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines, the state statute is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because it is within the state's police power.\nB. constitutional, because Congress may not regulate an economic activity where both buyer and seller reside in the same state.\nC. unconstitutional, because it affects interstate commerce.\nD. unconstitutional, because the federal law preempts any conflicting state legislation regarding the sale and shipment of the pies.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The federal law (the prohibition on shipping and selling the pies) preempts any conflicting state legislation regarding the sale and shipment of the pies.\n\nIn this scenario, Congress has enacted a federal law to protect consumers from potentially harmful levels of nuts in pies sold across state lines. This federal law prohibits such sales and shipments, even if they occur within the same state. Therefore, the state statute regulating pie sales within its territory cannot conflict with this federal prohibition, as it would be preempted by the federal law.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Congress can still regulate activities that have no effect on interstate commerce, but the prohibition on interstate commerce prevents the state statute from having any effect at all.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the state's police power allows it to regulate economic activities within its own borders, including those related to food safety and consumer protection.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because while the state's law does affect interstate commerce, it only applies within the boundaries of the state, which is different from the federal law that prohibits interstate commerce altogether."
