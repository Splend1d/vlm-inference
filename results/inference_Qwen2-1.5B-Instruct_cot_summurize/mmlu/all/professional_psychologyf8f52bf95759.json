Unethically because his request is exploitative and violates ethical guidelines.\n\nDr. Dreadmire's behavior is unethical because it involves using the power dynamics between him and the newspaper editor to gain something personal, even though there may be no negative impact on his professional work. This kind of arrangement goes against ethical principles that emphasize respect for clients, transparency, and avoiding conflicts of interest. The fact that the newspaper editor is also recently divorced does not absolve Dr. Dreadmire from these ethical considerations."
