A tombstone made of marble, as it is composed primarily of calcium carbonate, which is highly reactive with acids such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid.\n\nGranite, slate, gabbro, and other types of rocks are less likely to be affected by acid precipitation because they contain minerals that are less prone to dissolution in acidic environments. However, even these rocks can become damaged or weakened over time due to weathering processes such as freeze-thaw cycles, chemical reactions with water, and physical wear and tear from human activities."
