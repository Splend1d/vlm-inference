The following day, the artist conveys the property to a bartender; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the artist executes an identical conveyance of the farm to a caterer. The caterer gives the artist a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of prior conveyance to the bartender. The bartender, however, records her deed on February 6. The caterer then conveys his interest in the farm to a dancer, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the caterer. On February 5, the dancer purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the bartender and duly records the deed. In conducting a title search, the dancer should pursue his investigation by looking in the\n\nA. Grantor Index under the caterer's name to ascertain if the caterer acquired title.\nB. Grantee Index under the caterer's name only.\nC. Grantee Index under the caterer's name, then the Grantor Index under the caterer's name, and then in the Grantee Index again, this time under the artist's name to discover if he acquired title.\nD.

This includes checking the names of all grantors (the people who transfer their interest in the property) and grantees (the people who receive the property). \n\nIn this scenario, the artist conveyed the property twice - first to the bartender and then to the caterer. The caterer recorded both transactions, but the artist did not record any transaction with the dancer. Therefore, the correct sequence to follow would be:\n\n1. Search the Grantee Index under the caterer's name to see if they received title from the artist.\n2. Search the Grantor Index under the caterer's name to see if they acquired title from the artist.\n3. If the caterer already owns the property, search the Grantee Index again under the artist's name to see if the artist acquired title from someone else.\n\nThis will help you determine which party was the true owner of the property before the transfer to the artist occurred."
