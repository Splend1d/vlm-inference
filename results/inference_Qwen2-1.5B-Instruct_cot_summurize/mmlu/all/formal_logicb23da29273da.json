So, the senses of terms must be able to vary without variation in thought. So, our thoughts do not determine the meanings of our terms; meanings are not in the head. (Hilary Putnam)\n\nA.

Instead, the meaning of a term is tied to the way it is used and understood by others, and is therefore not purely a product of individual thought."
