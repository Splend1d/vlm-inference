                    "text": "The correct answer is B: a decrease in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply.\n\nWhen the unemployment rate falls, it means that there are more job openings than people looking for jobs. This creates an upward pressure on wages, which can lead to an increase in aggregate demand (the total amount of goods and services produced by an economy). At the same time, if the inflation rate falls, it suggests that prices are falling relative to each other, which can also lead to an increase in aggregate demand because consumers may be willing to spend their money now rather than saving it for future purchases.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that aggregate supply has decreased. In fact, as aggregate demand increases, so too does aggregate supply, assuming that productivity and efficiency remain constant. Therefore, the overall effect of a lower unemployment rate and lower inflation rates on aggregate demand and aggregate supply would likely be an increase in both, rather than a decrease. \n\nIt's important to note that the relationship between unemployment, inflation, and economic activity is complex and depends on many factors, including technological changes, international trade, and government policies. However, in general, when unemployment decreases and inflation decreases, it can indicate a period of economic expansion and growth."
