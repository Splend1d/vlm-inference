Savagery, Barbarism, and Civilization.\n\nLewis Henry Morgan was an American anthropologist who proposed that human cultures can be organized into three stages: savagery (primitive or uncivilized), barbarism (civilization), and civilization. He believed that humans were naturally inclined towards barbarism before reaching civilization. The stages of human development are often used as a framework for understanding social change and cultural evolution."
