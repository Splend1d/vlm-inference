In the first case, we have $n > 0$ and $n-3 < 0$, which has no solution because $n$ cannot be greater than 0. In the second case, we have $n < 0$ and $3-n < 0$, so $n < 3$. Therefore, the only possible value for $n$ is $n = 2$.\n\nNow let's solve the other inequality $|n-3| < 9$. The absolute value of a number is less than 9 if and only if the number itself is between $-9$ and $9$. So we have $-9 < n-3 < 9$, which simplifies to $6 < n < 12$. The integers in this range are $7, 8, 9, 10, 11$, so there are five values of $n$ that satisfy the original inequality.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all integer solutions to the original inequality is $7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = \\boxed{45}$."
