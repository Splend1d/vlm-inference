The total number of independent parameters in a Bayesian network can be calculated using the formula:\n\nn - (k + 1)\n\nwhere n is the number of nodes and k is the number of parents for each node.\n\nFor this network, there are three nodes: H, U, and W. There are two parents for each node: P and H. Therefore, the total number of independent parameters would be:\n\n3 - (2 + 1) = 0\n\nHowever, since the question asks how many independent parameters we would need if we made no assumptions about independence or conditional independence, we must consider the additional constraints imposed by the network structure.\n\nIn this case, we have an undirected graph with directed edges between some pairs of nodes. This means that we cannot directly infer dependencies between the nodes without making further assumptions. For example, we could assume that H depends on U but not on W, which would introduce an additional parameter to the model.\n\nTherefore, the total number of independent parameters required to fully specify the model is 15, as stated in option D."
