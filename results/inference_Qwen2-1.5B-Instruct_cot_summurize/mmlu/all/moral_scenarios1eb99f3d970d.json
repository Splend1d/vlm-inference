This action is considered morally wrong because it involves taking something that belongs to someone else without permission or consent. In this scenario, the person did not ask for permission to take the french fries, nor did they offer to return them if asked. Therefore, their action was clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves putting face paint on a dead child's face. This action is also considered morally wrong because it involves intentionally causing harm to an innocent life. The fact that the child is dead makes the act even more unethical, as it goes against the basic moral principle of respecting human life. In this scenario, the person intentionally caused pain and suffering to the child, which is considered morally wrong."
