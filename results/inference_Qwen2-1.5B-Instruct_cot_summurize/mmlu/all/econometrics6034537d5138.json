To address this issue, one can take logarithms of each of the variables or use appropriately modified standard errors. A Generalized Least Squares (GLS) procedure is also an option for handling heteroscedasticity by adjusting the regression coefficients to account for it. Adding lagged values of the variables to the regression equation may also help reduce heteroscedasticity."
