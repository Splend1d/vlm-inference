This means that if the percentage of contaminant removed in the first minute is 20%, then the percentage of contaminant removed in subsequent minutes would be inversely related to the percentage already removed.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( R \\) as the total amount of contaminant to be removed.\n- \\( t \\) as the time (in minutes) required for the entire process.\n- \\( P(t) \\) as the percentage of contaminant removed after \\( t \\) minutes.\n\nFrom the given information:\n\n1. \\( P(0) = 20\\% \\) or \\( 0.20 \\)\n2. \\( P(t) = 98\\% \\) when the water is made safe\n\nWe know that \\( P(t) = P(0) + RT \\), where \\( R \\) is the total amount of contaminant to be removed.\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\( 0.20 = 98\\% - 20\\% + RT \\)\n\nSimplifying,\n\n\\( 0.20 = 78\\% + RT \\)\n\nRearranging for \\( T \\):\n\n\\( RT = 78\\% - 0.20 \\)\n\n\\( RT = 77.8\\% \\)\n\nTherefore, the time taken for the process to complete is \\( \\frac{77.8\\%}{RT} = \\frac{77.8}{0.20} \\approx 38.9\\ minutes \\).\n\nHowever, since it doesn't make sense to have part of a minute, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us approximately \\( 39 \\) minutes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 18 min**."
