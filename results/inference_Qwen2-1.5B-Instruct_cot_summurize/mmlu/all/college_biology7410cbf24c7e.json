Batesian mimicry refers to a type of mimicry where an organism, called the mimicker, mimics another organism, called the mimic, in order to avoid predation or other threats. In this case, the ground-nesting gull chick uses a coloration pattern that is similar to the surrounding rocks and soil in order to avoid detection by potential predators. This behavior helps the chick survive in its environment and increase its chances of survival. \n\nOption A, B, and C represent examples of other types of mimicry, such as parapatric mimicry (where two species with similar colors attract predators), allopatric mimicry (where one species mimics another in different environments), and cryptic mimicry (where a species blends into its background)."
