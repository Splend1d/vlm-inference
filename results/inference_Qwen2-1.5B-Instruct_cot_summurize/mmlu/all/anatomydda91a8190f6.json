Medulla oblongata - This region is involved in controlling basic functions such as breathing, heart rate, and digestion.\n\n3. Midbrain - It contains the thalamus, which is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the body to the cortex.\n\n4. Cerebellum - While not directly related to the vital centers, it plays an important role in motor control and coordination.\n\nTherefore, options B, C, and D are correct."
