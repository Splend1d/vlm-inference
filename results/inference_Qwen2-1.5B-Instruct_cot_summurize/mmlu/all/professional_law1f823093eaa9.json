During jury selection, one potential juror stated that five years earlier he had been an employee of the company and still owned sev-eral hundred shares of its stock. In response to questioning from the judge, the potential juror stated that he could fairly consider the evidence in the case. The wholesaler's attorney has asked the judge to strike the potential juror for cause. Should the judge strike the potential juror for cause?\n\nA. No, because the potential juror said that he could fairly consider the evidence in the case.\nB. No, because the wholesaler's attorney could use a peremptory challenge to strike the potential juror.\nC. Yes, because other potential jurors still remain available for the jury panel.\nD. Yes, because the potential juror is presumed to be biased because of his relationship to the company.\n"

Yes, because the potential juror is presumed to be biased because of his relationship to the company.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Evidence 403, a person who is a shareholder or officer of a party may not serve as a juror if it would reasonably appear that such person might have a bias due to interest in the outcome of the litigation. In this case, the potential juror was a former employee and current shareholder of the defendant, which suggests that there is a reasonable appearance of bias.\n\nHowever, even if the potential juror cannot be removed for cause, the judge can allow him to continue serving on the jury if the potential juror demonstrates that he is not biased. The judge must also ensure that any potential biases are disclosed to the parties before trial begins. If the potential juror does not disclose any biases, the judge should declare a mistrial."
