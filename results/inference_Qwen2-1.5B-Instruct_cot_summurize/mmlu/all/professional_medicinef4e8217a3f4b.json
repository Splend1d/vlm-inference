Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Increase the dosage of corticosteroids\nB. Increase the dosage of cyclosporine\nC. Begin amphotericin therapy\nD. Begin ganciclovir therapy\n"

Begin ganciclovir therapy.\n\nGanciclovir is an antiviral medication that can be used to treat infections caused by the herpes simplex virus, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can cause serious complications after renal transplant. The presence of intracellular inclusion bodies in the transplanted kidney suggests that CMV may be present and causing inflammation and damage.\n\nTherefore, increasing the dosage of ganciclovir could help reduce the viral load and prevent further damage to the kidneys. However, it's important to note that this treatment should only be considered if other options have been exhausted or if there are specific contraindications to other treatments. It's also important to monitor the patient closely during this treatment and consider alternative therapies such as immunosuppressive drugs or surgical interventions if necessary."
