Is the gain on the exchange less than the increase in future cash flows? \n\nThis question assesses whether the exchange between Markson and Pro Co. meets the criteria for a transaction that is considered \"on an arm's length basis\" under U.S. tax law. An arm's length transaction means that the price paid by one party for an asset equals what it would have been paid in a comparable market.\n\nIn this case, the book value of the truck is $10,000, while the fair value of the cement-mixing machine is $11,000. The difference ($1,000) represents the gain on the exchange. To ensure that the exchange meets the arm's length test, the gain must be less than or equal to the increase in future cash flows resulting from the exchange.\n\nIf the future cash flows (such as profits or revenue generated over time) do not significantly change due to the exchange, then the gain on the exchange may be less than the increase in future cash flows. This condition ensures that the exchange is considered arms-length and taxable at its fair market value.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer."
