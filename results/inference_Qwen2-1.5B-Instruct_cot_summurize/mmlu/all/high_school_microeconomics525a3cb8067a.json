The good cannot be divided into discrete units.\n\nPure public goods are those that benefit all consumers, but no single consumer can exclude others from using them. This means that the marginal cost of providing an additional unit of the good to additional citizens is greater than zero because each additional unit consumed by one person increases the overall demand for the good and thus raises the price paid by all consumers. \n\nConsumers cannot be excluded from its benefits by not paying for it either, as they are all consuming the good in equal amounts regardless of whether or not they pay for it. And while it may be possible to exclude some consumers from benefiting from a public good if there is a shortage of resources, this does not necessarily mean that the good cannot be provided or divided into discrete units. However, it would depend on how the good is being produced and distributed."
