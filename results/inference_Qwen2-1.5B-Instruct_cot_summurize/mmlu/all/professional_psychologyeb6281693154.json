This process involves three main stages: unfreezing, changing, and refreezing.\n\nUnfreezing refers to the initial phase where the organization is not ready for change and needs to be thawed out. This involves removing obstacles and promoting acceptance of change.\n\nChanging involves implementing changes to address the identified negative forces and create new opportunities for growth. This may involve restructuring, reorganizing, or even completely overhauling the organization.\n\nRefreezing refers to the final stage where the organization has successfully changed and is now stable and functioning effectively with its new structure and processes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. unfreezing, changing, and refreezing."
