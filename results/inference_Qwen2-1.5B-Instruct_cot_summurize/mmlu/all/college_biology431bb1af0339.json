It provides essential nutrients to the developing embryo, including proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. The yolk sac also helps to maintain the water balance of the embryo by secreting a fluid called yolk, which is rich in fat and proteins. This fluid protects the embryo from dehydration and injury caused by exposure to air or other environmental factors. Therefore, it is important for terrestrial vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, and mammals to have an adequate yolk sac to ensure their survival and growth."
