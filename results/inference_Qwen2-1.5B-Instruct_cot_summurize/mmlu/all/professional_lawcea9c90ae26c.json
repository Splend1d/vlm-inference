Inadmissible, because it seeks to put into evidence separate, unrelated transactions with a third party.\n\nWhen a witness testifies about an unrelated transaction involving their own injuries, this testimony cannot be used to prove the defendant's negligence or liability for damages. The testimony is only admissible if it is relevant to the issue of whether the defendant was negligent in causing the harm to the plaintiff. In this case, the witness's testimony does not relate to any aspect of the restaurant's conduct that caused the plaintiff's frostbite. Therefore, the witness's testimony is inadmissible."
