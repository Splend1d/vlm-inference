They differ in respect of their account of life before the social contract.\n\nHobbes and Locke had very different views on the nature of human beings and how they should be governed. Hobbes believed that humans were naturally violent and competitive, and that only through a strong central authority such as the state could they be brought under control. Locke, on the other hand, argued that people are inherently good and cooperative, and that the natural state of man was one of peace and harmony until it was disrupted by the fall from grace caused by Adam's sin.\n\nIn terms of the role of law in society, Hobbes saw laws as being imposed upon individuals by the sovereign power of the state, while Locke saw them as arising out of the consent of the governed. This meant that Locke believed that people would be more likely to follow laws if they were convinced that they were necessary for the protection of individual rights and freedoms.\n\nIn terms of contractual obligations, both Hobbes and Locke agreed that people enter into contracts when they agree to exchange goods or services with each other. However, Locke argued that these contracts arise out of the mutual agreement of the parties involved, whereas Hobbes believed that the social contract was a binding agreement between all members of society.\n\nOverall, Hobbes and Locke had differing views on the nature of human beings, the role of government, and the basis of legal obligations, which ultimately led to their different approaches to governance."
