In this case, the property passed to the life estate owner because the original fee simple owner predeceased him. This means that the life estate owner owns the property outright, as they were the last surviving owner at the time of the original fee simple owner's death. Therefore, the children of the life estate owner do have an enforceable interest in the property."
