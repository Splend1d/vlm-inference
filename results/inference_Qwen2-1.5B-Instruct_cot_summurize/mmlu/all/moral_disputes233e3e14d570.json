Which of the following is part of his response?\n\nA. He would say this begs the question because the immigration question is identical to the freedom-of-movement question.\nB. He would present an argument showing that there is actually no right to freedom of movement.\nC. He would argue that some rights are not absolute (e.g., the right to marriage doesn't allow you to marry an unwilling partner).\nD. He would use deontological premises to deductively conclude that unjust public policies are morally objectionable.\n"
