The total number of ways to choose 3 points from 36 = 216 possible points is $\\binom{216}{3}$.\n\nThe condition for all three pairwise distances between the points to be less than the radius of the circle is that the distance between any two points must be strictly greater than $r/2$ (since the maximum distance between any two points on a circle is $2r$, and we want all pairwise distances to be less than this).\n\nLet's consider one pair of points, say point A and point B. The distance between them must be greater than $r/2$. This means that the distance between point A and every other point on the circle (except for point B) must be greater than $r/2$, and similarly for the distance between point B and every other point on the circle (except for point A). \n\nSince there are 3 points in total, the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 3 such that the distance between them is greater than $r/2$ is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that all three pairwise distances between the points are less than the radius of the circle is $\\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{3}{\\binom{216}{3}} = \\frac{3}{21600}$.\n\nSimplifying this fraction gives us $\\frac{1}{700}$.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{700}}$."
