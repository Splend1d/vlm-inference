The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Prior to discharge, which of the following is the most appropriate step?\n\nA. Obtain CT scan of the chest\nB. Obtain a swallowing evaluation\nC. Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube\nD. Prescribe fludrocortisone\n"

                    "text": "The most appropriate step would be D: prescribe fludrocortisone. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation and swelling in the lungs, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. It should be administered as soon as possible after the diagnosis of pneumonia is made.\nOther options such as obtaining a CT scan of the chest or a swallowing evaluation may be needed if other underlying conditions are suspected, but they are not necessarily necessary based solely on the clinical presentation of the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings. A PEG tube may be considered if it is determined that the patient cannot tolerate oral feeding due to difficulty swallowing or dehydration, but this is not indicated in this case as the patient is able to maintain oral nutrition through the use of a nasogastric tube."
