According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, cheering at a car crash is generally considered morally wrong because it involves causing harm and distress to innocent people involved in the accident. Drawing someone doing something cool without their consent is also generally considered morally wrong, especially if that person is not aware of the drawing or does not want to be depicted that way."
