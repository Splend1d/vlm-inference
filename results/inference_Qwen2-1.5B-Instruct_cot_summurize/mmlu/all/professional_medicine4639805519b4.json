One week ago, she was treated in the emergency department after she accidentally spilled hot grease on her left leg while working at a fast-food restaurant. Examination of the left lower extremity shows a 7-cm, pink, soft, granular, edematous wound. The formation of this tissue was most likely caused by increased activity of which of the following?\n\nA. Glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1\nB. P-selectin\nC. Stromelysin\nD. Vascular endothelial growth factor\n"

In this case, the patient's wound may have been caused by an increase in VEGF levels due to the injury and subsequent inflammation. This can lead to the formation of new blood vessels and the healing of the wound."
