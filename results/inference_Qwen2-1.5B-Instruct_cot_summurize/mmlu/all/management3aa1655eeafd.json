He argues that firms should focus on understanding their industry, identifying their unique value proposition, and developing strategies that differentiate them from competitors in order to gain a competitive advantage and maximize profits. Therefore, Porter's perspective aligns with the idea that profitability can stem from how well a firm positions itself in the market."
