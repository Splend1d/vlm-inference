Letting children play in a shallow creek can be seen as harmless and even beneficial for their development if it's supervised appropriately. However, this scenario involves no explicit violation of ethical principles or societal norms.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, involves using an illegal substance to get more strikeouts, which goes against ethical and legal standards. This action is clearly morally wrong due to the potential harm caused by using substances that violate laws and regulations governing sports and health."
