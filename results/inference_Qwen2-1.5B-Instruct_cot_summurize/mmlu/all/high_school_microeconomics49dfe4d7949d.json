This shifts the demand curve to the right. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n- A shift in the supply curve does not typically occur with government subsidies; instead, the price and quantity supplied both increase.\n- A shift in the supply curve would also result in an overall decrease in total output (supply), whereas the question asks about the effect on the demand side only."
