Can impact genetic predispositions to developmental disorders\n\nThe body's stress response system is complex and can be influenced by both internal and external factors. During early childhood, the development of the nervous system and brain is critical for the proper functioning of the stress response system. However, this does not mean that it cannot be influenced later in life. \n\nExternal factors such as environmental stressors, trauma, and illness can also impact the stress response system. For example, chronic stress has been linked to changes in the immune system, which can affect gene expression and contribute to the development of certain diseases.\n\nAdditionally, genetics play a role in the development of the stress response system. Certain genes have been associated with an increased sensitivity to stress, while others may help regulate the response.\n\nPrescribed medications like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can also impact the stress response system by affecting neurotransmitters like serotonin. However, these medications are primarily used to treat depression and anxiety and do not directly impact the development or regulation of the stress response system itself."
