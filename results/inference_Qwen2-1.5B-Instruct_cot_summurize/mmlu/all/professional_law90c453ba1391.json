When she picked up the car, there was a bill for $5,000 on the dash board. All of the services and parts were workmanlike, not defective and pertained to the areas in the instructions. She refused to pay, claiming that there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for advance approval. Can she be held responsible for contractual services performed?\n\nA. No, because there is always an implication that the provider must get permission before doing work not approved.\nB. Yes, because the circumstances and past practice established an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent.\nC. No, because a contract cannot be based on implications and guess work.\nD. Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.\n"

The fact that the customer paid for the services and did not dispute them suggests that there was an understanding between the parties that the services would be performed as per the instructions given.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that the customer can be held responsible for the contractual services performed, even if they do not explicitly state so in writing. However, it is important to note that this depends on the specific circumstances of the case and any relevant laws or regulations governing contracts and agreements.\n\nIn summary, the answer would depend on whether the customer had an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent and whether the circumstances show intent to contract and a meeting of the minds. Without more information about these factors, it is difficult to say definitively what the outcome would be."
