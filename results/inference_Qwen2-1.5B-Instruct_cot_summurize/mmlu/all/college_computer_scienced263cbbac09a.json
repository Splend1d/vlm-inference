However, this doesn't match any of the other options directly. It seems there might have been an error in the question as it currently stands. The correct answer would be the option that matches the exact value calculated from the reciprocals of the service times. In this case, the closest matching answer would be C. 92/5, which is also close but not exactly the same. Given the nature of the problem, it's likely there was a mistake in the question as stated."
