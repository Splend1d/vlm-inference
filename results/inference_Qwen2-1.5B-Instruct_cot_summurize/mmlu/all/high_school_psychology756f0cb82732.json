Foot-in-the-Door\n\nThe foot-in-the-door technique involves asking someone to take the first step towards a goal or action, which can increase their willingness to continue with it. In Edy's case, by giving out cookies with \"Vote for Edy\" written on them, she is making a small request from potential voters and building trust and familiarity over time, which could lead to more people supporting her as they see her as a credible candidate. This approach helps to build momentum and credibility among supporters."
