Budget surpluses may not be appropriate in this situation as they could lead to decreased demand for goods and services and further slow down the economy. Lowering discount rates (interest rates) can also help stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper and more attractive, but it is important to do so gradually to avoid overheating the economy."
