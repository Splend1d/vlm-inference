This finding suggests that there may be some degree of \"confirmation bias\" in the way that doctors diagnose and treat mental illness. It also shows that people who are diagnosed with mental illness tend to be treated differently from those who are not. Finally, the study suggests that people with mental illness may be less likely to receive appropriate treatment because they are often misdiagnosed or have difficulty convincing medical professionals that they have a disorder."
