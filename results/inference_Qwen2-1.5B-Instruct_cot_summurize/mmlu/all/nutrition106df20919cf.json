An excess of energy yielding substrates\n\nDe novo fatty acid synthesis is the process by which cells generate new fatty acids from carbon dioxide and oxaloacetate, without the use of existing fatty acids or amino acids as intermediates. This process occurs in the liver and can be seen as an \"excess\" because it generates fatty acids that are not required for immediate energy needs but may be needed later on. The term \"de novo\" refers to the fact that these fatty acids are synthesized from scratch, rather than being derived from pre-existing molecules."
