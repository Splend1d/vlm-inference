Positive feedback occurs when the presence or absence of a stimulus leads to an increase in the intensity of the response to that stimulus, rather than restoring homeostasis by creating deviations from the status quo. In other words, positive feedback tends to perpetuate and amplify existing conditions within a system, rather than correcting them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D (Positive Feedback \u2192 Disrupting Homeostasis by Creating Deviations in the Status Quo)."
