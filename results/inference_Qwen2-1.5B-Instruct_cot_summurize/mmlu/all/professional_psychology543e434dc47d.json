Regression toward the mean: This refers to the phenomenon where individuals or groups tend to return to their baseline level of performance after a period of change or intervention.\n2. Historical and maturation variables: These refer to past experiences and developmental stages that can affect an individual's response to treatment. For example, some people may have had more exposure to trauma or stressors during early life, which could impact their response to treatment.\n3. Placebo effect: This refers to the tendency for participants who receive a placebo (a substance or procedure believed to have therapeutic effects) to report improved outcomes compared to those who receive no treatment.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the treatment is effective with extreme cases may not be valid without taking these factors into account."
