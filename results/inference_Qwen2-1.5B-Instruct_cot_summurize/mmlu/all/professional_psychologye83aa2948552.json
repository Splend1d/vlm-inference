This method involves pairing the electric shock with a neutral stimulus (such as a toy or a person's hand) to extinguish the original aversive response. The conditioned stimulus becomes the one that is repeatedly paired with the aversive stimulus and eventually loses its significance because it no longer elicits an aversive response."
