This is because the purpose of an evaluation by a psychologist is to assess the defendant's mental state and provide recommendations for treatment or rehabilitation. Confidentiality is important in maintaining trust between the psychologist and the defendant, as well as ensuring that any sensitive information is not disclosed to others without consent. Therefore, it is essential for the psychologist to obtain the defendant's consent before discussing any confidential information during the evaluation process."
