This can lead to a situation where the economy is in recession but also experiencing deflationary pressures, which can make it difficult for policymakers to achieve a stable economic environment. As a result, some economists argue that the Phillips curve should shift to the right, indicating that there may be an opportunity to lower interest rates and stimulate demand without increasing inflation too much."
