Whether that action is required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule the consequences of which are best.\n\nConsequentialism, also known as deontology, holds that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences, not by any inherent value judgments about the action itself. According to this theory, the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on the outcomes it produces. Thus, in consequentialist ethics, the moral status of an action is assessed based on how well it serves the interests of the people involved and maximizes overall happiness or utility.\n\nTherefore, option D correctly reflects the principle of consequentialism: that an action is morally right if it leads to good consequences, and wrong otherwise. This approach contrasts with other ethical theories like virtue ethics, which emphasizes the character and virtues of individuals, or utilitarianism, which focuses on maximizing overall happiness or minimizing suffering."
