This response causes the host bird to feed its fledglings, which can lead to the death of the cuckoo's own offspring if they are not able to find food elsewhere.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that the host bird's fitness is compromised. In fact, studies have shown that brood parasites can actually increase the overall fitness of the host bird population over time. This is because the host bird benefits from having a steady supply of food for its young, while the cuckoo's offspring are dependent on the host bird for survival.\n\nTherefore, the genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring do not need to remain in the gene pool of the population because the maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised."
