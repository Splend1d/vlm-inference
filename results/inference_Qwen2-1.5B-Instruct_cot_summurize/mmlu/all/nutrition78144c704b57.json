It is primarily responsible for the dough-like texture of bread and other baked goods. Gluten has been linked to several health problems due to its ability to bind with carbohydrates and cause digestive issues when consumed in excess or in certain forms.\n\nThe primary concern regarding gluten is its role in causing gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease (CD), which affects the small intestine's lining. CD results from an autoimmune response that attacks gluten molecules, leading to inflammation and damage to the intestinal lining.\n\nWhile gluten may not directly affect carbohydrate absorption, it can contribute to carbohydrate malabsorption if consumed in high amounts or under specific conditions. Carbohydrate malabsorption occurs when the body fails to absorb all of the glucose present in food, leading to symptoms like bloating, gas, diarrhea, and fatigue.\n\nIn terms of UC (Ulcerative Colitis) management, individuals with CD should avoid gluten-containing foods due to the risk of exacerbating their condition. However, some people with UC do not have CD but still experience gut inflammation, and therefore, they might need to limit gluten intake as well to manage their symptoms.\n\nTherefore, options A through D are accurate descriptions of gluten's effects on the body and its potential role in various health conditions."
