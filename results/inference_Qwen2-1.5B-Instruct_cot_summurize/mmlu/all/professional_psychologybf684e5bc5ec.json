The probability of making a type I error is 0.15.\n\nThe statistical power (power) of an experiment measures the probability that the results will be consistent with the null hypothesis, i.e., that they will reject the null hypothesis when it is false. In this case, the power is stated as 0.85. This means that there is a 25% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis if it is true.\n\nType I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true, also known as a Type I error. The probability of making a Type I error is calculated by taking the complement of the statistical power: \n\nP(Type I Error) = 1 - Power\n\nFor example, if the power is 0.85, then the probability of making a Type I error is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15."
