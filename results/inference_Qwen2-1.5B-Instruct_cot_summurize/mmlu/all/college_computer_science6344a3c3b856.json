Thus, we can write this as:\n\\[ (p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee p_3 \\vee p_4) \\wedge (\\lnot(p_1 \\wedge p_2 \\wedge p_3 \\wedge p_4)) \\]\n\n2. **Exactly three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true**: This condition requires exactly one of each variable to be true. Therefore, it is equivalent to:\n\\[ (p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee p_3 \\vee p_4) \\wedge (\\lnot(p_1 \\wedge p_2 \\wedge p_3 \\wedge p_4)) \\]\n\n3. **An even number of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true**: This condition implies that there must be an equal number of true and false values among them. The complement of having an even number of true values would involve having an odd number of false values. Hence, we can use:\n\\[ (p_1 \\vee p_2 \\vee p_3 \\vee p_4) \\wedge (\\lnot((p_1 \\wedge p_2 \\wedge p_3 \\wedge p_4))) \\]\n\nAmong the given options, option D correctly represents all the conditions mentioned above: \n- I only (the first expression)\n- II only (the second expression)\n- III only (the third expression)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
