The availability of amino acids plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism because they are essential building blocks for protein synthesis, which is involved in many metabolic pathways including growth, repair, and maintenance.\n\nSo, the correct answer is not A (size of proteins in the cell), C (proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material), or D (amino acid composition of the ribonucleic acids). Instead, it is B (availability of amino acids)."
