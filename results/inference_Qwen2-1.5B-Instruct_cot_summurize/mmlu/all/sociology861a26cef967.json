Women's increased chances of being in poverty, due to low pay and greater welfare dependency\n\nThe feminization of poverty refers to the phenomenon where women are disproportionately affected by poverty compared to men. This can occur for several reasons such as lower-paying jobs, higher rates of unemployment among women, and the fact that women often take on more responsibilities at home, including caring for children and elderly family members. Additionally, women may rely more heavily on government assistance programs like food stamps or welfare than men, further exacerbating their poverty status."
