This means that the presence or absence of neutral variation will not affect the overall level of heterozygosity within a population. \n\nHowever, neutral variation can still have indirect effects on other aspects such as genetic drift and migration rates, which can indirectly influence average heterozygosity through changes in allele frequencies over time. Therefore, while neutral variation may not directly affect average heterozygosity, its effects on these other processes can be significant."
