This is because saving represents an opportunity cost of spending on current goods or services, and as consumers become more pessimistic, they may choose to save instead of spending.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the consumption function will be greater than 1 (i.e., it will shift downward), and its value will be less than MPC and MPS in absolute terms. The correct option is D."
