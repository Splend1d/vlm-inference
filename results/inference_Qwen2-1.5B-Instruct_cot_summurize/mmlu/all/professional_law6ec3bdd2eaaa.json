The prosecutor now seeks to have the expert testify that in her opinion, based on years of experience with drug dealers, the defendant's statement about the apples was code for his having drugs for sale. Should the expert's opinion be admitted?\n\nA. No, because an expert must base his or her opinion on scientific or technical data, not merely on experience.\nB. No, because the opinion is based on the criminal actions of others engaged in drug dealing, and thus is substantially more unfairly prejudicial than probative.\nC. Yes, because the opinion is based on her specialized knowledge, and it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence and determining facts in issue in the case.\nD. Yes, provided that the expert first testifies about the specific information upon which she based her view that the defendant was using \"apples\" as a code word to refer to drugs.\n"

Yes, provided that the expert first testifies about the specific information upon which she based her view that the defendant was using \"apples\" as a code word to refer to drugs.\n\nWhen admitting expert testimony, courts consider several factors, including whether the expert's testimony is relevant to the case at hand, whether the testimony is based on scientific or technical data, and whether the testimony is necessary to explain complex scientific concepts or otherwise assist the jury in understanding the evidence and determining facts in issue. In this case, the expert's testimony seems relevant to the defendant's drug dealing charges, since it relates to the defendant's use of code words such as \"apples,\" and the expert bases her opinion on her expertise in drug dealing. Additionally, the expert has already established that she has years of experience working with drug dealers, so there may be some overlap between the expert's experience and the defendant's alleged conduct. Therefore, the court should consider allowing the expert's opinion if the expert provides sufficient context for the jury to understand the basis for the opinion."
