Merge sort\n\nMerge sort is an algorithm that sorts elements in linear time (O(n)) using recursion, but it also takes advantage of the fact that we can sort elements in half the size of the input at each step until we have only one element left. This makes it an efficient choice for sorting large lists.\n\nBubble sort and insertion sort both have worst-case and average-case running times of O(n^2), which is not optimal for most practical applications. Quick sort has an average-case running time of O(n log n) but its worst-case running time is O(n^2)."
