                    "text": "To determine which of the given statements must be true, we can analyze the properties of depth-first search trees and the relationship between edges and ancestors.\n\n1. **Depth-First Search Tree Properties:**\n   - A depth-first search tree is a binary tree where each node has at most two children. The left subtree of a node contains nodes with smaller keys than the node itself, and the right subtree contains nodes with larger keys.\n   - Pre-order traversal visits the root first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.\n\n2. **Pre-order Traversal and Depth:**\n   - In a depth-first search tree, if a node's parent is visited before its children, it means the node was visited more than once during the pre-order traversal.\n   - This implies that the node had an ancestor that was also visited before it.\n\n3. **Post-order Traversal and Depth:**\n   - Post-order traversal visits the right subtree first, then the left subtree, and finally the root.\n   - Since the post-order traversal of a depth-first search tree starts from the root, any node that is visited after its children will have been visited more than once during this traversal as well.\n\n4. **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA):**\n   - The LCA of two vertices u and v in a depth-first search tree T is defined as the deepest node that has both u and v as descendants but no descendant of either u or v is an ancestor of both u and v.\n   - In a depth-first search tree, every node except for the leaves has a unique path leading to it, and all paths between leaves are distinct.\n   - Thus, if there exists a node w such that both u and v are descendants of w, and no descendant of either u or v is an ancestor of both u and v, then w is the LCA of u and v.\n\nGiven these properties, we can analyze the conditions under which edges (u, v) would satisfy:\n\n- **Condition I:** `post(u) < post(v)`\n  - This condition holds because in a depth-first search tree, if a node v is visited after node u, then u must have been visited earlier by some ancestor of v, making u an ancestor of v according to the definition of depth-first search trees.\n  \n- **Condition II:** `u is an ancestor of v in T`\n  - This condition directly follows from the fact that if (u, v) is an edge in G that is not in T, and pre(u) < pre(v), then u must have been visited before v during a pre-order traversal of T, making u an ancestor of v according to the properties discussed above.\n\n- **Condition III:** `w = u`\n  - This statement is equivalent to saying that if (u, v) is an edge in G that is not in T, and pre(u) < pre(v), then u must be the LCA of u and v in the depth-first search tree T.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. II and III**\n\nBoth Condition II (`u is an ancestor of v in T`) and Condition III (`w = u`) must be true for the conditions in Statement I (`post(u) < post(v)`) to hold."
