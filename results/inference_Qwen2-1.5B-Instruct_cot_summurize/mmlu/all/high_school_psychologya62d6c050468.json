This association forms a conditioned response, which can be triggered by any other stimuli that resemble the conditioned stimulus. However, if the conditioned stimulus itself ceases to evoke the conditioned response, then extinction occurs. In this case, the organism will not learn to respond to the conditioned stimulus in the future."
