The VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) dimension of a support vector machine (SVM) is not determined solely by its kernel function. Instead, it depends on several factors including the data distribution, the complexity of the decision boundary, and the margin width between the classes. An SVM with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel can have a finite VC dimension if the data distribution is well-suited to the RBF kernel's behavior.\n\nStatement 2: This statement is true. A two-layer neural network with linear activation functions is indeed essentially a weighted combination of linear separators, where each neuron in the hidden layer acts as a linear separator that is trained on a given dataset. The boosting algorithm applied to this network builds a series of weak learners (separators) that are combined into a strong learner. Therefore, these two algorithms will find the same set of separating hyperplanes when trained on the same dataset, assuming they achieve similar accuracy."
