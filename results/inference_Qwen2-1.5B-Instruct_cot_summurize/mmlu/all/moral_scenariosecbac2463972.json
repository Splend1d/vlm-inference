However, this action does not go against any established moral principles.\n\nIn scenario 2, pulling your neighbor's weeds after getting into an argument is generally considered morally wrong. This is because it involves using force or violence to assert dominance over another person and violates their property rights. Additionally, it can create tension and resentment between neighbors, leading to negative consequences for both parties involved."
