On each of the Model 1 A snowmobiles produced, the manufacturer installed a speed-regulating device that prevented the snowmobiles from exceeding 50 m. p. h. The manufacturer distributed the snowmobile through wholesalers and retailers across the country. In its sales brochures and advertising materials, the manufacturer advises all of its distributors against making any modifications on snowmobiles without first conferring with the manufacturer's staff of engineers. The operator of a shop in a mountain community had the exclusive right to distribute Model 1A snowmobiles in the area. Amid complaints from previous buyers regarding Model lA's speed limitations, the operator removed the speed regulators from all the Model 1A snowmobiles in stock. A buyer purchased from the operator one of the Model 1A snowmobiles that had the speed regulator removed. One day, the buyer was driving the Model 1A snowmobile through a snow-covered field, at speeds in excess of 70 m. p. h. The snowmobile hit a snow-covered rock, causing the buyer to lose control of the snowmobile, crash into a tree, and suffer serious injuries. If the buyer institutes a strict liability in tort action, he will most likely recover against\n\nA. the manufacturer only.\nB. the manufacturer, even though it was unaware of the removal of the speed regulator.\nC. the operator only.\nD. both the manufacturer and the operator.\n"

Both the manufacturer and the operator.\n\nIn strict liability cases, a manufacturer or distributor can be held responsible for defects in products even if they were not aware of them. This is because the manufacturer or distributor has a duty to ensure that their products meet certain standards, including safety requirements. \n\nIn this case, the manufacturer knew that the Model 1A snowmobiles had speed regulators that could prevent them from exceeding 50 mph, but still allowed them to exceed that limit. This is a violation of the manufacturer's duty to ensure product safety. Therefore, the manufacturer is liable for any harm caused by the defective product.\n\nSimilarly, the operator knew that removing the speed regulators would allow the snowmobiles to exceed the manufacturer's recommended speed limit, but did so anyway. This is also a violation of the operator's duty to ensure product safety, and the operator may be held liable for any harm caused by the defective product.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Both the manufacturer and the operator."
