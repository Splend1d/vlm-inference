Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase is activated by insulin and therefore is most active following meal consumption\nC.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D: all options given are correct.\n\nConsumption of a meal can lead to an increase in plasma triglyceride levels due to the breakdown of dietary fats into free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol. This process occurs primarily in the liver and requires the action of enzymes such as lipase, which breaks down triglycerides into FFAs and cholesterol esters.\n\nDuring the postprandial period, the liver continues to break down FFAs from triglycerides and release them into the bloodstream. The released FFAs then enter the bloodstream and undergo oxidation in the mitochondria of cells, including adipocytes, where they are converted into ketone bodies (\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate). These ketone bodies are used for energy production when glucose levels are low.\n\nIn addition to the above processes, insulin also plays a role in regulating lipid metabolism. Insulin activates lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides in adipose tissue. This activation of lipoprotein lipase helps to maintain normal triglyceride levels after meal intake.\n\nFurthermore, during the postprandial period, the synthesis of VLDL (very-low-density lipoproteins) is inhibited, favoring the hydrolysis of chylomicrons, which are large particles of triglycerides and cholesterol. Chylomicrons are digested in the small intestine and released into the bloodstream, contributing to the release of FFAs from triglycerides.\n\nTherefore, all of these factors contribute to the complex cascade of events that integrate fat metabolism at the whole-body level after consumption of a mixed meal."
