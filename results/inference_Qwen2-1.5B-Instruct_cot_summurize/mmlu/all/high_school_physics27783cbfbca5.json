However, since the object floats on top of the water, only part of this volume actually touches the surface. The portion that is above the water level is less than the full volume because the object is not completely submerged. \n\nTo find the fraction of the object's volume that is above the water, we divide the volume above the water by the total volume:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Volume_{above}}{Total~Volume} = \\frac{0.02}{0.02 + 0.02} = \\frac{0.02}{0.04} = 0.5.\n\\]\n\nThis means that half of the object's volume is above the water. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n\\[\n0.5 \\times 100 = 50\\%.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 30%.**"
