He has mild hypertension. Other medications include acetaminophen, atenolol, and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 168/98 mm Hg. During the examination, he is uncooperative and refuses to answer questions. Neurologic examination shows tremulousness and no focal findings. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. A CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?\n\nA. Adverse effect of medication\nB. Alcohol withdrawal\nC. Fat emboli\nD. Sepsis\n"

Haloperidol is commonly used as a sedative-hypnotic drug, but it can also cause side effects such as agitation, confusion, and tremors. It's possible that the patient may be experiencing an adverse effect of this medication due to the extent of his injury and the length of time since surgery.\n\nAlcohol withdrawal, fat emboli, and sepsis are all potential causes of agitation and confusion, but they do not typically occur so quickly after open reduction and internal fixation surgery. Sepsis is more likely to occur if there is infection in the wound or other areas of the body, but without further information about the patient's medical history and current condition, it's difficult to determine whether this is the most likely cause.\n\nIt's important for the healthcare provider to carefully assess the patient and consider all possible causes before making a diagnosis and developing an appropriate treatment plan. The patient's symptoms should be closely monitored and evaluated regularly to ensure that he is responding appropriately to his treatment."
