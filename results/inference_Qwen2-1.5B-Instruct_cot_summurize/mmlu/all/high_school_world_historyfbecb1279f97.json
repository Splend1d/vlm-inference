Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear\u2014but apart from that, nothing has changed.\nHalima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence\nWhich of the following factors is likeliest to have prevented the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage?\n\nA. Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism\nB. Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure\nC. Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites\nD. Prioritization of national liberation over social reform\n"

Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites\n\nThe speaker in the first passage expresses hope for educational opportunities for her children and mentions that she is a poor peasant, indicating that poverty and lack of resources may have hindered progress. However, the specific factor that prevents the sort of progress hoped for by the speaker in the second passage is mentioned as hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites. This suggests that the speaker's aspirations were met with resistance from those who benefited from colonial rule and sought to maintain patriarchal structures, which likely prevented any significant social or political changes."
