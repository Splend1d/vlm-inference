Protons are actively pumped into the lysosome.\n\nThis statement refers to the process of acidification (or protonation) within the lysosome, where protons (H+ ions) are pumped out of the lysosomal membrane and into the cytoplasm through ATP-dependent transport mechanisms. This allows for the activation of enzymes located within the lysosome by lowering their pH below the optimal pH range for most enzymes, which typically lies between 8.0 and 9.6."
