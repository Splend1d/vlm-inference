The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is\n\nA. 0.8 microseconds\nB. 1.2 microseconds\nC. 1.6 microseconds\nD. 2.4 microseconds\n"

Since there are five ADCs triggering simultaneously, the total time taken for all ADCs to digitize the inputs would be \\(5 \\times 12 = 60\\) microseconds.\n\nEach CPU instruction takes 10 microseconds to execute. Therefore, the total time taken for all CPU instructions to execute the necessary number of times to average the outputs would be \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\) microseconds.\n\nTo find the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, we need to add the time taken by the ADCs to digitize the inputs to the total time taken for the CPU instructions to execute the necessary number of times:\n\n\\(60 + 100 = 160\\) microseconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1.6 microseconds."
