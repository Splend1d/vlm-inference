A 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line indicates that with a 95% probability, the true value of the slope lies within this range. Since the interval is (0.45, 0.80), it means that the researcher can conclude that the true slope is between 0.45 and 0.80. However, this does not necessarily mean that there is a linear relationship or that there is a non-zero correlation between the variables. The true slope could be close to zero, indicating a weak or no relationship. Therefore, the statement \"It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables\" is false based on the given information. Similarly, the statement \"It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0\" is also false because even if the slope is close to zero, it still represents a positive association between the variables."
