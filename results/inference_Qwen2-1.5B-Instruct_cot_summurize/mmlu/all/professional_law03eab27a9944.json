Late one night, the two men broke into the warehouse and proceeded to load the large crates of defibrillators onto their truck. As they were leaving, one of the men inadvertently threw his cigarette butt into a refuse pile of old cardboard boxes and papers. Soon afterward, the refuse ignited into a small fire. Although the men had time to douse the fire without any danger to themselves, they did not do so. Instead, they fled. Meanwhile, the fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire warehouse in flames. If the defendant is later charged as a co-conspirator, in all likelihood he would be held responsible as\n\nA. an accessory before the fact.\nB. a principal in the second degree.\nC. an accomplice.\nD. not respbnsible.\n"

This means that he helped to plan or organize the crime but did not actually participate in the commission of the act itself. In this case, the defendant may have been involved in planning the theft of the defibrillators from the warehouse, but did not physically break into the warehouse or throw the cigarette butt. Therefore, he is considered an accessory before the fact and is likely to be held responsible for his role in the crime."
