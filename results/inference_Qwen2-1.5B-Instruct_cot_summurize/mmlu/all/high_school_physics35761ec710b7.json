The electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space.\n\nThis statement follows from Gauss's law in electrodynamics, which states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the net charge enclosed divided by the permittivity of free space. In this case, the closed surface is an arbitrary spherical surface surrounding the object, and the net charge enclosed is the total charge on the surface of the object.\n\nIf the charge distribution is not uniform, then there will be some charge within the object itself as well as on its surface. However, since the electric field outside the object is only due to the charge on the surface, it will be constant everywhere except for a small region near the surface where the charge density is high. This means that the electric field outside the object can still be calculated using Gauss's law with a small spherical surface around the object, provided we take into account the contribution of the charge on the surface.\n\nTo calculate the electric field outside the object, we use Gauss's law and integrate over the volume of the sphere surrounding the object. The integral gives us the total electric flux through the surface of the sphere, which is equal to the net charge enclosed divided by the permittivity of free space. Since the net charge enclosed is the sum of the charge on the surface and the charge inside the object, we can write:\n\nE * A = Q / \u03b5\u2080,\n\nwhere E is the electric field, A is the area of the surface, Q is the total charge enclosed (which includes both the surface charge density and the charge inside the object), and \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space.\n\nHowever, if we want to find the electric field outside the object but very close to the surface, we need to consider the contributions from the charge inside the object as well. This means that we need to include the contribution of the charge inside the object when calculating the electric field outside the object. The key point is that the electric field outside the object will be higher than the surface charge density at any location because the charge on the surface contributes less to the electric field than the charge inside the object. Therefore, we can conclude that the electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space."
