The two legislative bodies form a conference committee.\n\nWhen the Senate and House of Representatives pass different versions of a bill, they have not reached an agreement on all aspects of the legislation. In this case, the bill needs to be reconciled between the two chambers so that it can become law. This process involves creating a compromise bill that addresses all the differences between the two versions, often involving negotiations and compromises from both sides. Once the two versions are reconciled, the bill may then be sent to the president for his or her signature, or to a conference committee if necessary."
