Crystal oscillators are commonly used in digital circuits for generating high-frequency signals, and they have been widely used in various applications due to their stability and accuracy.\n\nThe other options listed - Hartley oscillator, Wien bridge oscillator, and relaxation oscillator - may also be fabricated in monolithic ICs, but they typically require additional components or processing steps beyond the basic oscillator design. For example, a Hartley oscillator requires a feedback loop to stabilize its frequency, while a Wien bridge oscillator uses a thermistor to adjust its temperature compensation. A relaxation oscillator is another type of oscillator that may be implemented in a monolithic IC, but it typically involves more complex circuitry than the simpler crystal oscillator designs.\n\nOverall, crystal oscillators are considered one of the most straightforward and reliable types of oscillators that can be easily incorporated into a monolithic IC design."
