Granite, gabbro, diorite, quartz, feldspar\n\nGranite and gabbro are both types of igneous rock composed primarily of quartz and feldspar. Diorite is another type of igneous rock formed from the cooling of magma or lava. Quartz and Feldspar are minerals found in these rocks.\n\nGold, topaz, diamond, corundum, mica, and chlorite are all examples of precious and semi-precious gemstones. These are not minerals but rather valuable stones used for jewelry and other decorative purposes.\n\nChert, limestone, dolomite, and halite are all examples of sedimentary rocks, which are different from mineral deposits like gold, topaz, and diamonds. While they may contain some minerals, they do not fall under the category of minerals themselves.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer."
