'A nation is secure to the extent to which it is not in danger of having to sacrifice core values if it wishes to avoid war, and is able, if challenged, to maintain them by victory in such a war.' Lippman, W.\nB. 'Security itself is a relative freedom from war, coupled with a relatively high expectation that defeat will not be a consequence of any war that should occur.' Bellamy, M.\nC. 'Emancipation is the freeing of people (as individuals and groups) from the physical and human constraints which stop them carrying out what they would freely choose to do . . . Security and emancipation are two sides of the same coin. Emancipation, not power or order, produces true security. Emancipation, theoretically, is security.' Booth, K.\nD. None of the above\n"

None of the above.\n\nAccording to the field of Security Studies, security refers to a state of being free from fear and threat, both real and perceived. It encompasses various dimensions such as political stability, economic prosperity, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability. Security is often defined in terms of tangible and intangible assets, including military strength, economic resources, technological capabilities, and cultural identity. Security also involves addressing the root causes of conflict, promoting cooperation among nations, and ensuring that all individuals have access to basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare."
