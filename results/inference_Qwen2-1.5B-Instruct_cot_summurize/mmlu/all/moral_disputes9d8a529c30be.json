He wants to appeal to the reader's reason and not just pull at the reader's heartstrings.\n\nSinger argues for a utilitarian approach to ethics, which emphasizes the consequences of actions rather than abstract principles or emotional appeals. By presenting his argument from this perspective, he aims to persuade readers to consider the practical implications of their choices and actions. The drowning child serves as an example to illustrate how sacrificing someone else's life for the sake of saving one's own can be morally questionable. By bringing up this tragic scenario, Singer seeks to challenge readers' assumptions about what constitutes a morally acceptable action and to encourage them to consider the broader consequences of their decisions."
