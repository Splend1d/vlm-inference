It is too small to have been hit during the Late Heavy Bombardment\nC. Jupiter's strong gravity attracted the planetesimals more strongly than Io and thus none landed on its surface.\nD. Any craters that existed have been eroded through the strong winds on Io's surface.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Any craters that existed on Io would have been eroded by the strong winds on its surface, which can reach speeds of up to 500 miles per hour. Over time, these winds would have worn away any remaining craters on the surface of Io.\n\nIt is important to note that while Io has not had many impacts, it still experiences frequent volcanic activity due to its proximity to Jupiter. This volcanic activity can create new craters on the surface of Io, but these craters will also be eroded over time as the winds continue to wear them down.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most accurate explanation for why there are no impact craters on the surface of Io."
