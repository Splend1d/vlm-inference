A baseball fan traveled all night to the stadium, planning to purchase tickets from a scalper at the stadium. However, the fan arrived at the stadium after the game had started, and no tickets were available. He proceeded to sneak around the guard at the entrance gate and illegally entered the stadium. He watched the remainder of the game in the standing room only section. The fan became so enraged when the opposition took the lead in the ninth inning that he pulled out a gun from under his jacket and aimed it at the section of spectators in front of him. Before he could be subdued he had fired three shots, killing one person and severely injuring another.\nB. A customer was in a bank filling out a deposit slip when a robber entered. The robber went to the teller's window and quietly slipped a note to the teller, demanding everything in the cash drawer. The customer, who was unaware of the robbery taking place, went to the adjoining teller's window and made his deposit. Upon obtaining his receipt, the customer suddenly collapsed and died of a heart attack. When the robber saw this, he panicked and left the bank before the teller could comply with his demand.\nC. Two men planned to rob a luncheonette during the noontime rush. At 12:30 p. m. , as planned, one of the men entered the luncheonette and pointed a gun at the cashier, who handed over the money. The man left to meet the other man outside as he was standing guard as a lookout. As soon as the man ran out of the door, a police officer tried to grab him. The man evaded the officer for a brief moment. Thinking that the other man had double-crossed him and informed the police of their plans, he fatally shot the other man.\nD. A man and a woman had been feuding for years. In order to show him a thing or two, the woman decided to set fire to the man's house. Before dawn one morning, the woman went to the man's house and lit a match to gasoline she had poured at the man's front door. The house caught fire and quickly spread to the man's bedroom, where the man was able to leap out of the window without injury. A police officer who was driving by saw the woman running away one block from the man's house. The police officer pulled his car up to the woman to determine if she was involved in setting the fire. Upon seeing the officer, the woman starts to flee the scene. As she is running away, the woman pulled out a revolver and started shooting indiscriminately behind her. The police officer was struck by one of the shots and was killed.\n"

In this case, the defendant intentionally set fire to the victim's house with the intent to cause serious bodily harm or death, even though the act itself was not part of the underlying felony of arson. This constitutes felony murder because the defendant's actions directly caused the death of someone else, and the defendant knew that his actions were unlawful and dangerous."
