                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The electron rotates clockwise because it has negative charge and the electric field points upward. This means that the electron experiences a force that wants to rotate it counterclockwise. However, due to the conservation of angular momentum, the net torque on the electron must be zero, which means that the electron will rotate clockwise. \n\nThe radius of the circular path of the electron is given by the equation:\n\nr = v / (qB)\n\nwhere r is the radius, v is the velocity, q is the charge, and B is the magnetic field. Since the electron has a positive charge, it will experience a force that wants to rotate it counterclockwise, but since the electric field points upward, this means that the net force on the electron is downward. Therefore, the radius of the circular path of the electron will be equal to its mass times the acceleration due to gravity divided by the magnetic force, or:\n\nr = m * g / F\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity and F is the magnetic force. Substituting the value of g from 9.81 meters per second squared, we get:\n\nr = m * 9.81 / F\n\nSince the magnetic force is the only external force acting on the electron, we can set F equal to the magnitude of the magnetic force, which is equal to Bqv. Thus,\n\nr = m * 9.81 / Bv\n\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\n\nr = m * 9.81 / Bv\n\nThis shows that the radius of the circular path of the electron is directly proportional to the square root of the ratio of the electron's mass to its charge. In other words, the larger the electron's mass relative to its charge, the smaller the radius of its circular path."
