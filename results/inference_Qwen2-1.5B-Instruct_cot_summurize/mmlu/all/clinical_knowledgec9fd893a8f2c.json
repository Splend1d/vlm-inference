Two valves and four chambers.\n\nThe heart has two valves, which help to prevent blood from flowing backwards (regurgitation) into the wrong chamber. The heart has four chambers: two atria (the upper chambers where blood enters and leaves the heart), and two ventricles (the lower chambers where blood flows out of the heart). Therefore, it has four chambers in total."
