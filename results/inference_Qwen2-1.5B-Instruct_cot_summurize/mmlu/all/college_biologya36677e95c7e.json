They all have rigid cell walls. \n\nWhile some fungi, such as mushrooms and yeasts, do have rigid cell walls made of chitin or cellulose, not all fungi have rigid cell walls. For example, some fungi, such as Aspergillus and Penicillium, have cell walls made of peptidoglycan, which are more flexible than chitin or cellulose. Additionally, some fungi, such as the Ascomycota class, are not typically considered to be strictly unicellular organisms like bacteria and archaea, but rather form multicellular structures called hyphae that are composed of many individual cells interconnected by filaments."
