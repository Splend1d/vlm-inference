In 1990, a homeless couple occupied the crumbling cabin. They restored it, fenced the perimeter, and maintained the grounds. They started paying the taxes, despite knowing there was an absentee owner. In 2000, the owner appeared and demanded that they pay rent. They agreed but stopped the payments two years later after consulting an attorney. The required statutory period in the state is 20 years. In 2011 the owner filed an ejectment action, asserting his ownership rights. Leaving aside any other theories or equities, can the couple prevail on a theory of adverse possession?\n\nA. Yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years.\nB. No, because they missed some of the tax payments during that 20-year period.\nC. No, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.\nD. Yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Yes, because the couple prevailed on the theory of adverse possession.\n\nAdverse possession is a legal doctrine that allows someone to acquire title to real property by continuous, open, and notorious possession without the owner's permission. In order to establish adverse possession, the possessor must have been continuously present and in actual occupation of the property for the statutory period (in this case, 20 years) without the owner's consent.\n\nIn this scenario, the couple began occupying the land in 1990 as homeless individuals seeking shelter from the elements. Over time, they restored the cabin, fenced the perimeter, and maintained the grounds. They also started paying the taxes, which indicates their intent to occupy the property permanently. This demonstrates continuous, open, and notorious possession for the entire 20-year period, thus establishing their right to possess the property under adverse possession law.\n\nTherefore, the couple has successfully established adverse possession, and they would be entitled to own the property if they had not paid the last 2 years' worth of taxes."
