They argued for a stronger system where states retained more control over their own affairs and represented by smaller delegations to Congress than under the proposed constitution. \n\nFederalists, on the other hand, supported a system where states were represented by larger delegations to Congress and believed that this would lead to a strong central government capable of governing all Americans equally.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. whether representation in Congress should be equal among states or proportional to population."
