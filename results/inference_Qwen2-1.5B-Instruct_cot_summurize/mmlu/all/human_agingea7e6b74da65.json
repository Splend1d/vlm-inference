The Pauling's senior thesis describes the process of aging as a gradual and inevitable change that occurs over time, rather than being caused by sudden or rapid physical changes. Meditation can help people cope with the effects of aging, but it does not prevent physical changes from occurring. Discussing these topics in public should be done with care and respect for the individual's privacy and dignity."
