It works to dilate the airways quickly, allowing better deposition of other medications.\n\nShort-acting bronchodilators like albuterol (Proventil) and formoterol (Flixotide) work by relaxing the muscles in the airways, which helps to reduce inflammation and swelling. These drugs can be used as needed to help control symptoms of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When taking these drugs, it's important to take them with food or a small amount of liquid, so that they can reach the lungs more easily. This can make it easier for them to be absorbed into the bloodstream and reach the areas of the body where the airways are affected. Taking them first ensures that the medication has time to work before other medications are administered, such as corticosteroids or antibiotics."
