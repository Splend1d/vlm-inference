Divergent Thinking\n\nCreativity refers to the ability to generate and evaluate new ideas, concepts, or solutions that are not constrained by existing rules or conventions. This can involve generating novel hypotheses, exploring alternative perspectives, and approaching problems in unconventional ways.\n\nHypothesis testing is concerned with evaluating the validity of specific theories or propositions through statistical methods. Contextual intelligence involves understanding how different contexts affect behavior and decision-making processes. Habituation refers to the process of becoming accustomed to something, which may limit one's creative potential."
