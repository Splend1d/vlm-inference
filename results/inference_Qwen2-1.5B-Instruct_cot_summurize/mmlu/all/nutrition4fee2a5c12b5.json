A reduction in lean body mass: As people age, their muscle mass decreases, which can affect their overall energy expenditure.\n2. A reduction in physical activity: Physical activity is an important factor in maintaining a healthy metabolism and energy expenditure. Older adults may find it more difficult to engage in regular physical activity due to decreased mobility or reduced fitness levels.\n3. A reduction in basal metabolic rate (BMR): BMR is the amount of calories the body burns at rest. As people age, their BMR may decrease, making it harder for them to maintain their energy expenditure.\n\nAll of these factors contribute to reduced energy expenditure in older adults, leading to a higher risk of obesity, diabetes, and other health problems."
