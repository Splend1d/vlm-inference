This is because the ratio of output to population (i.e., the productivity of labor) can be calculated by dividing the output by the number of workers, which gives us:\n\nProductivity of labor = Output / Population\n\nFor Country X: Productivity of labor = 30000 units / 3000 workers = 10 units per worker\n\nFor Country Z: Productivity of labor = 40000 units / 8000 workers = 5 units per worker\n\nTherefore, the productivity of labor in Country Z is 33% higher than in Country X, which is why option A is correct."
