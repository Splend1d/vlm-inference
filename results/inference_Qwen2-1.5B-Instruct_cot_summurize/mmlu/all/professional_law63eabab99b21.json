This means that the defendant must present evidence that they were insane at the time of the offense and that this insanity prevented them from knowing what they were doing or understanding the nature and quality of their conduct.\n\nTherefore, the husband would have to meet the burden of production by presenting evidence that he was mentally ill at the time of the incident and that his mental illness made it impossible for him to know right from wrong. He would also have to meet the burden of persuasion by proving that his mental illness prevented him from knowing what he was doing or understanding the nature and quality of his conduct.\n\nSo, the husband's defense of insanity requires him to bear both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion."
