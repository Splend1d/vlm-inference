Not prevail, unless the land was subject to the mortgage.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a quitclaim deed transfers only the legal interest in real estate without any warranties or representations about the title. In this case, the investor conveyed the property to his friend by quitclaim deed, but the friend assumed the mortgage. This means that the friend acquired title to the property with the mortgage still attached, even though it is not part of the conveyance. Therefore, the farmer cannot recover the amount of the mortgage from the friend if the property is not free and clear of liens, such as the mortgage."
