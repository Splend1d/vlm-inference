Military security is one of the central concerns of security studies, and security studies is a subset of international relations.\n\nStrategic studies refers to the study of the conduct of war and the policies that govern it. It encompasses the analysis of political, economic, social, technological, and environmental factors that influence the conduct of war. In this context, military security is a key area of focus for strategic studies, as it involves the planning, preparation, and execution of military operations in order to achieve national security objectives.\n\nSecurity studies, on the other hand, is a broader field that encompasses various aspects of state and society security. While military security is an important aspect of security studies, it is not the central concern or the primary focus of the discipline. Rather, security studies is concerned with understanding the complex interplay between politics, economics, society, technology, and environment, and how they affect individual and collective security.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement that best describes the orientation of military security within the traditional conception of security studies is:\n\nMilitary security is the central concern of strategic studies; and strategic studies are a subset of security studies. Military security is one of the central concerns of security studies, and security studies is a subset of international relations."
