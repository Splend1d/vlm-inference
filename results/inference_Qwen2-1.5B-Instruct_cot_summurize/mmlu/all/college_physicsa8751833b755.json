Electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms\n\nWhen high-energy electrons bombard a metal target, they can collide with the empty outermost shells of the metal's atoms, creating vacancies called inner-shell vacancies. These vacancies are filled by electrons from the valence band of the metal, which then emit characteristic X-rays. This process is known as photoelectric effect and is responsible for generating X-rays in this scenario."
