Formal negative sanction\n\nIn the context of kindergarten, children who continue to suck their thumbs may be subjected to formal negative sanctions such as teasing or ridicule from other children, which can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment. This type of social sanction is considered more severe than informal sanctions that might occur naturally within a peer group, but it does not necessarily result in punishment beyond what the child feels internally due to the lack of external consequences."
