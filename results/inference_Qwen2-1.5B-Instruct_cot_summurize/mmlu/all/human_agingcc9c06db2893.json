Many pessimists die at a younger age.\n\nOlder adults tend to experience more life stressors and setbacks than younger adults, which can lead to higher levels of optimism. Additionally, some studies suggest that people who have experienced more negative life events in their past may have a stronger sense of resilience and optimism. \n\nIt's important to note that while optimism can be a positive trait, it's also possible for older adults to become overly optimistic or unrealistic about the future. This can lead to disappointment when things don't go as planned. It's always best to seek professional help if you're concerned about your level of optimism or if you suspect that it may be impacting your quality of life."
