Recall bias occurs when participants or researchers remember information differently after they have been exposed to it, which can lead to inaccurate reporting of outcomes. In this case, the first group of pathologists may be more likely to recall seeing hypertensive nephropathy in black patients because they were aware of the race of the patient from whom the biopsy came. This could lead to an overestimation of the frequency of this condition among black patients."
