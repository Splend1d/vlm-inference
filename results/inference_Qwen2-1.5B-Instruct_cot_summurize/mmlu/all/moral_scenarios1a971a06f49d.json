This can lead to harm or harm to others if parents decide to vaccinate their children based on false information. Therefore, telling people this type of misinformation could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that both scenarios are morally correct, which is not true.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because it suggests that only one scenario is morally wrong, but there is no clear evidence that feeding a bird with peanut butter while laughing is inherently wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.
