The ordinance is broad, stating only that the mayor can use his discretion in granting permits. If someone just extemporaneously gives a political speech in the park without a permit and were arrested and convicted, would this be constitutional?\n\nA. Yes, because the ordinance controls.\nB. Yes, because he didn't have a permit.\nC. No, the ordinance is void on its face.\nD. No, because it is a public park.\n"

However, the government has the authority to regulate these activities within certain limits. In the case of Breezytown, the mayor's decision to grant or deny permits for speeches in the city park is subject to review by a court under the doctrine of municipal regulation. \n\nIf the mayor's decision to issue permits is based on arbitrary criteria (such as race, gender, or political affiliation), or if there is no rational basis for such criteria, then the ordinance may be challenged as unconstitutional. In this case, if the mayor simply uses his discretion to determine who gets a permit and no one has been denied a permit, but later an individual is arrested and convicted for giving a political speech without a permit, the arrest could be challenged as unconstitutional.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not A, B, D, or E, as none of those options address the constitutional validity of the mayor's decision to grant or deny permits. Instead, the question focuses on whether the ordinance itself is invalid due to lack of a rational basis for determining who receives a permit."
