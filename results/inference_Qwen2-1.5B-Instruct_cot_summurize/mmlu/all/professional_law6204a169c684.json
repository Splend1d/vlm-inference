He often sold and leased his guard dogs to various business and factory owners who used the guard dogs to frighten away intruders from entering their premises at night. One evening, the breeder was in the back yard of his home training three of his guard dogs. The back yard was enclosed with a chain link fence and a latched gate that prevented the dogs from running out. After the training session, the breeder opened the gate and permitted the dogs to run loose in his front yard. Minutes later, a man was walking along the sidewalk in front of the breeder's house when he was attacked by one of the dogs. The man suffered severe injuries and died as a result of the attack. The breeder should be found guilty of\n\nA. murder.\nB. involuntary manslaughter.\nC. voluntary manslaughter.\nD. reckless endangerment.\n"

Involuntary manslaughter occurs when someone causes the death of another person through \"actus reus\" (the unlawful act) but with the intent not to cause death or harm. \n\nIn this case, the breeder had trained his dogs to attack strangers at night, which can be considered an \"actus reus\" violation of the law. However, the intent behind these attacks was to prevent potential harm to his own property rather than causing death or injury. Therefore, while the breeder may have been aware that his dogs could potentially attack people, his primary intent was to protect his property, which does not constitute intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this is just one possible interpretation based on the given facts. The actual legal determination would depend on the specific circumstances and evidence presented during any criminal trial or hearing."
