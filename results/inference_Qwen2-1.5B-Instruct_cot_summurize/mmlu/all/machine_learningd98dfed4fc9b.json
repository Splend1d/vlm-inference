Logistic regression models can have multiple optimal solutions due to the non-convex nature of the loss function and the presence of regularization terms that encourage sparsity in the coefficients.\n\nAs for the second statement, \"No classifier can do better than a naive Bayes classifier if the distribution of the data is known,\" this statement is false (Option B). While it's true that certain types of classifiers may not perform as well when the underlying distribution of the data is unknown or difficult to infer, there exist many other machine learning algorithms designed specifically for classification problems where the distribution of the data is known, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and support vector machines (SVM).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
