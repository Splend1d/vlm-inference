And although I have a farm of 50 acres close to the town, no doubt the crops and premises would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and I am now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place, who have done much damage all around.\"\nLetter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879\nWhich of the following reasons explains why European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867?\n\nA. The British crown offered incentives to those who would establish homesteads in the unsettled lands of South Africa.\nB. The Zulu created attractive trade ports along the Indian Ocean.\nC. The Berlin Conference clarified boundaries, thus making it logistically sound for Europeans to move to the African colonies.\nD. A diamond rush ensued following the discovery of diamonds on Zulu lands.\n"
