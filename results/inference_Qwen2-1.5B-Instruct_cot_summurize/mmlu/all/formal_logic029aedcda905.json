Some houses are bigger than some large apartments.\n\nThis interpretation follows the logical structure of the sentence and uses appropriate language to convey the meaning. The sentence states that there exists at least one large apartment (Lx) and at least one house (Hx). It also mentions that for every house (Hx), there exists at least one larger house (Bxy) which is bigger than it. Therefore, option D correctly translates this statement into English while maintaining the original meaning and logic."
