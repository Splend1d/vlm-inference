The minor paid $2000 down and agreed to pay the remaining $4000 in installments over the next two years. The minor had to have the car for work because he had no other means of support. The minor later crashed the car in an accident. He disaffirmed the contract, returned the damaged car, and demanded his down payment back. Does the seller have a right to obtain any consideration in this matter?\n\nA. No the seller must return the down payment because the minor has declared his disaffirmance of the contract.\nB. The seller cannot keep the down payment and cannot obtain any other benefit from the transaction.\nC. The seller can sue the minor for misrepresentation and fraud in not revealing his age prior to buying the car.\nD. The seller can obtain only the reasonable value of the use of the car in a restitution action.\n"

No, the seller must return the down payment because the minor has declared his disaffirmance of the contract.\n\nWhen a person buys something with the intent to resell it or exchange it for another item or money, they retain the ownership until the purchase price is paid off or the contract is terminated. In this case, the minor had agreed to pay off the balance of $4000 within two years, but the seller could not enforce that agreement due to the minor's disaffirmance. Therefore, the seller has no legal claim to the down payment or any other benefits derived from the transaction."
