The ability to provide credibility to the information distributed\n\nOnline newspapers often have the reputation of being more credible sources of news compared to social media sites because they are regulated by editorial boards and adhere to journalistic standards, whereas social media sites can be less controlled and may not always maintain high levels of accuracy or reliability in their reporting. Additionally, online newspapers tend to have larger audiences and greater reach, which allows them to distribute their information more widely and quickly than social media sites."
