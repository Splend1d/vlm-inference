The idea behind the concept of learned helplessness is that individuals who experience uncontrollable events are more likely to develop negative attitudes towards their lives, which may lead to depression or other psychological issues.\n\nWhen given solvable problems, the individual is able to take control of the situation and make progress, which leads to a shift in their perception of their ability to control their environment. This shift in locus of control from internal to external can be seen as a positive outcome for the individual, leading to a reduction in feelings of helplessness and depression.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer."
