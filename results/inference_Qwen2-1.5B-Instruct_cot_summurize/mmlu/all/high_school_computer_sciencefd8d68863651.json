If `a` does not equal zero, it assigns the value 20 to `b`.\nIf we change line 3 to assign `b` the value 10 instead of assigning 10 to `b`, then the code would still execute as expected since the condition `(a = 0)` is always false because `a` is never assigned a value in this case. Therefore, changing line 3 to assign `b` the value 10 will not affect the results when the code segment is executed.\nSimilarly, changing line 3 to assign `b` the value 10 or 20 will also not affect the results when the code segment is executed.\nChanging line 7 to assign `b` the value 20 or 10 will also not affect the results when the code segment is executed.\nTherefore, the only option that will affect the results when the code segment is executed is changing line 7 to assign `b` the value 10 or 20."
