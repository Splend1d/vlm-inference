First, she believes that the artificial assumptions used in these cases are not empirical claims and do not necessarily reflect reality. Second, she argues that the use of ticking bomb cases as a means of testing theories can be philosophically useless, as they may lead us to make false or misleading conclusions about the nature of reality. Finally, she suggests that the use of ticking bomb cases can give rise to the belief that torture is always permissible, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, it seems that all of the given options are relevant to her argument."
