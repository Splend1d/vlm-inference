So,\n\n\\[ 18 = \\frac{2\\pi(0.02)}{0.02} \\]\n\\[ 18 = \\frac{2\\pi}{0.02} \\]\n\\[ 18 = 20\\pi \\]\n\\[ 18 = 62.8317951 \\]\n\nSo, at the first point, the flow velocity is approximately 62.83 m/s.\n\nNow, we need to find the flow velocity at the second point, where the diameter is 3 cm or 0.03 m. Let's use the same formula but substitute the new values:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{2\\pi L}{D} \\]\n\\[ V = \\frac{2\\pi(0.03)}{0.03} \\]\n\\[ V = \\frac{2\\pi}{0.03} \\]\n\\[ V = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\times10^2 \\] (since \\(0.03\\) is equivalent to \\(3\\times10^{-2}\\))\n\\[ V = 20\\pi \\]\n\\[ V \u2248 20 \\times 3.141623729 \\]\n\\[ V \u2248 62.83 \\]\n\nTherefore, the flow speed at the second point is also approximately 62.83 m/s.\n\nComparing the two options, both A and B have a value greater than 62.83 m/s. However, since we are looking for the correct choice from among the given options, let's round these numbers to the nearest whole number:\n\n- Option A: 4 m/s\n- Option B: 6 m/s\n\nBoth A and B match the closest rounded value. However, since there was no option provided as \"None\", the correct answer must be \"None\" based on the given information. The question asks for the flow speed at another point in the pipe, not which of the two points has the highest flow speed. Therefore, the correct answer is \"None\"."
