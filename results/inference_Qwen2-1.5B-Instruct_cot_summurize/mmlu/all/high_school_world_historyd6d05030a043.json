They dwell in the dark,\nAnd upon the door and bolt, there lies dust.\nfrom Tablet VII, The Epic of Gilgamesh, Sumeria, ca. 2100 B.C.E.\nTruth is good and its worth is lasting.\nIt has not been disturbed since the day of its creator,\nWhereas he who transgresses its ordinances is punished.\nIt lies as a path in front of even him who knows nothing.\nWrongdoing has never yet brought its venture to port\u2026\nThose whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves.\nThose to whom they forbid passage will not be able to cross the river of life.\nfrom The Maxims of Ptahhotep, Egypt, ca. 2400 B.C.E.\nThe two texts best support which of the following conclusions?\n\nA. Ancient Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife than ancient Sumerians.\nB. Ancient Egyptians were more inclined than ancient Sumerians to view political obedience as morally proper.\nC. Ancient Egyptians were more patriarchal in their gender relations than ancient Sumerians.\nD. Ancient Egyptians suffered under a more rigid social hierarchy than ancient Sumerians.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the text provided, it seems that the two texts both discuss themes related to death and punishment. However, they differ in terms of their views on morality and societal structures.\n\nIn the Epic of Gilgamesh, the speaker describes the House of Darkness as a place where \"those who enter do not come out\" and \"those who dwell, do without light.\" This suggests that the speaker believes in an afterlife where punishment is severe for wrongdoing. Additionally, the text mentions that \"wrongdoing has never yet brought its venture to port,\" suggesting that the speaker believes in a just and impartial justice system.\n\nIn contrast, the Maxims of Ptahhotep describe the gods guiding those who know nothing and forbidding passage to those who seek to cross the river of life. This suggests that the gods play a role in determining one's fate and that moral behavior may have consequences.\n\nTherefore, based on the differences between the two texts, I would conclude that ancient Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife than ancient Sumerians. They believed in an afterlife where punishment was severe for wrongdoing, while the Sumerians may have viewed punishment differently or not believe in an afterlife at all."
