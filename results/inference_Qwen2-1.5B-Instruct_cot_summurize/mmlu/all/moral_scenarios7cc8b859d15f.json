However, in this case, the person did not keep or destroy the towels and returned them to the hotel pool, so it can be seen as less harmful than taking something more valuable like jewelry or money. \n\nScenario 2 involves taking money that is meant for the benefit of others, which is also considered morally wrong. The person took money out of the cash register without permission, but they returned it before any harm was done. Therefore, it depends on how much money was taken and what happened after the act. If there were no negative consequences and the money was returned, then it might be considered not wrong."
