To do this, a piece of dry limestone was weighed. Then carbon dioxide was collected until the limestone disappeared. The atmospheric pressure was measured at 0.965 atm. The temperature was 295 K. The volume of CO2 was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for the vapor pressure of water. The student continuously got low results from what was expected. Can you suggest why?\n\nA. Limestone is never pure CaCO3.\nB. Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2.\nC. Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water.\nD. Perhaps there was not enough acid to dissolve all the limestone.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the given information, it seems that option B - Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2 - is the most likely explanation for why the student's measurements were lower than expected.\n\nLimestone is composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), but also contains other minerals such as magnesium carbonate (MgCO3). These other compounds can interfere with the reaction between the acid and the limestone, leading to inaccurate measurements of the amount of carbon dioxide produced.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of impurities in the limestone can affect its reactivity with the acid. For example, if the limestone contains impurities like iron or aluminum, these metals can react with the acid, releasing gases that may not be fully accounted for in the measurement of carbon dioxide.\n\nTherefore, it is possible that the student was measuring the amount of calcium carbonate present in the limestone instead of the total amount of carbon dioxide produced by the reaction. This could result in a lower value of carbon dioxide compared to what would be expected based on the stoichiometry of the reaction."
