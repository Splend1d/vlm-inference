In this process, electrons are transferred from NADH+H to FADH2, which then transfers them to oxygen to generate ATP via the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane.\n\nDuring each cycle of the ETC, one molecule of NADH+H is reduced by one molecule of FADH2, generating two molecules of ATP. Therefore, for every molecule of FADH2 that passes through the ETC, five molecules of ATP are generated. This means that a pair of electrons carried by FADH2 and NADH+H collectively contain enough free energy to rephosphorylate 5 ATPs."
