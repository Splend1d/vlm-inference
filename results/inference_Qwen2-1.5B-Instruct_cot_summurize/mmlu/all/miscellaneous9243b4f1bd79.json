Having students determine whether the numbers of red and yellow apples are equal.\n\nThis task involves comparing two groups of objects (in this case, apples) based on their quantity rather than individual items. By asking students to identify if there are more or fewer apples of each color, they are practicing the concept of comparing quantities. This type of task helps students develop critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities, which are essential for understanding mathematical concepts."
