When a spouse transfers an interest in real property by a quitclaim deed without the other spouse's knowledge or consent, that transfer creates a voidable estate for the benefit of the other spouse. The other spouse has the option to rescind the transfer within a certain period of time (usually 2 years) after learning of it. Therefore, the aunt would not inherit any interest in the dairy from the wife's transfer."
