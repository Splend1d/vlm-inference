After conducting the sessions, the professor submitted an expense report to the owner of the bar review course. Her expense voucher included a $225 travel expenditure to a fourth city where the professor had attended a symposium unrelated to the bar review course. The professor also submitted the $225 travel expenditure to the administrator for the faculty at the law school where she teaches. The dean of the law school had previously approved the professor's appearance at the symposium. The owner paid the professor for the symposium-related expenditure but indicated that the expense item was improperly billed to his company. The professor was indicted for false pretenses. In her defense, she contends that the double billing was the result of a bookkeeping error. Her defense should be\n\nA. valid, if her mistake was reasonable.\nB. valid, if she didn't know that the billing to the bar review company included the symposium expenditure.\nC. invalid, if her bookkeeping error was unreasonable.\nD. invalid, because white-collar crime imposes absolute criminal liability.\n"

Invalid, because white-collar crime imposes absolute criminal liability.\n\nWhite-collar crime refers to crimes committed by individuals who hold high positions or responsibilities within their organizations, such as corporations or law firms. These individuals are held to a higher standard of conduct and are subject to strict penalties for committing fraudulent activities.\n\nIn this case, the professor was found guilty of false pretenses, which involves making false statements or representations with the intent to deceive someone into believing something that is not true. While it is possible that the double billing was due to a bookkeeping error, the fact that the professor submitted the bill to both the bar review company and the law school indicates that there may have been some intentional deception involved.\n\nTherefore, the professor's defense that the double billing was caused by a bookkeeping error would not be valid under the circumstances."
