However, even after one follow-up visit the interviewer is unable to make contact with anyone in 8 of these homes. Concerned about nonresponse bias, the researcher picks another simple random sample and instructs the interviewer to keep trying until contact is made with someone in a total of 50 homes. The average number of children is determined to be 1.73. Is this estimate probably too low or too high?\n\nA. Too low, because of undercoverage bias.\nB. Too low, because convenience samples overestimate average results.\nC. Too high, because of undercoverage bias.\nD. Too high, because convenience samples overestimate average results.\n"
