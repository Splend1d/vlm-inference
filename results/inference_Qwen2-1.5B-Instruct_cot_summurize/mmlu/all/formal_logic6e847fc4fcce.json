P - This means \"P\" which is not mentioned anywhere in the original proposition.\n\nB. N \u2283 ~O - This statement says that if N implies not O, but it doesn't give any information about whether there exists a conjunction between N and O. It only states the implication one way around.\n\nC. O \u2228 Q - This statement says that either O or Q is true. However, this is not a direct consequence from the original proposition.\n\nD. ~P - This means that if not P is true, which is not directly implied by the original proposition.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. N \u2283 ~O** because it provides a logical deduction based on the premise provided."
