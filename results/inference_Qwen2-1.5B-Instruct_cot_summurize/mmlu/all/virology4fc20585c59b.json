They are not considered to be the most abundant form of life on Earth or the cause of all human disease. Bacteria were discovered before viruses, but it's difficult to determine when they were first identified. D) viruses are not typically responsible for causing all human diseases; other factors such as genetics, environment, and lifestyle also play a role."
