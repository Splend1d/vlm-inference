An inferior alveolar nerve block is performed by injecting a local anesthetic into the submandibular space, which is located between the inferior alveolar nerve and the mandible. The needle should be inserted into this space, and then moved anteriorly and laterally to avoid damage to the inferior alveolar nerve."
