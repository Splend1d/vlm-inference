However, since every element is represented by some set of elements (generators), there must be an infinite number of such sets to represent all elements. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: \"Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.\"\nThis statement is also true. In the case of a free abelian group of rank 2 or more, we can consider the basis consisting of two generating vectors, which means we have two sets of elements that can form a basis. By repeating these sets, we can generate infinitely many different bases for the group. This is known as the basis theorem and holds for any free abelian group of rank greater than one. Therefore, both statements are true.\n\nThe correct answer is A. True, True."
