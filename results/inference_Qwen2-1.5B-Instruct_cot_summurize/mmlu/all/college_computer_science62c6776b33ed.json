In the worst case, all elements need to be compared to their correct position, resulting in O(n^2) comparisons.\n- Merge Sort: The average case running time is also O(nlogn), but the worst-case running time is still O(n^2) if the input is not sorted.\n- Selection Sort: The number of comparisons is O(n-1) + O(n-2) + ... + O(1) = O(n^2).\n\nTherefore, the sorting algorithm with the least dependency on the initial ordering of the input is **Insertion Sort**."
