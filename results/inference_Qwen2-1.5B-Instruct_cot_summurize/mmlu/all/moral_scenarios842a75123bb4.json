However, it could be seen as impolite if the person making the coffee did not ask for the addition.\nScenario 2: Recording the dressing room is clearly morally wrong because it violates someone's privacy and can cause them distress or embarrassment. It also goes against the principle of consent, as the person who owns the space has the right to control who enters and what they see inside.\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong."
