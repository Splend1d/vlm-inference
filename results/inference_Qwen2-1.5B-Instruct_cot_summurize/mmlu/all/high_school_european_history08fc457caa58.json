Lenin.\nThe independence of our country cannot be upheld unless we have an adequate industrial basis for defense. And such an industrial basis cannot be created if our industry is not more highly developed technically. That is why a fast rate of development of our industry is necessary and imperative. We cannot go on indefinitely, that is, for too long a period, basing the Soviet regime and socialist construction on two different foundations, the foundation of the most large-scale and united socialist industry and the foundation of the most scattered and backward, small commodity economy of the peasants. We must gradually, but systematically and persistently, place our agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, and bring it up to the level of socialist industry. Either we accomplish this task\u2014in which case the final victory of socialism in our country will be assured, or we turn away from it and do not accomplish it\u2014in which case a return to capitalism may become inevitable.\n\u2014Vladimir I. Lenin Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U., November 19,1928\nWhich of the following compromises of his New Economic Policy is Lenin saying needs to be fixed in the speech above?\n\nA. Compromising with free markets in rural areas after the civil war\nB. Sharing power with the provisional government\nC. Giving the government too much power to further communism\nD. Freeing the peasants from their landlords in exchange for their support\n"
