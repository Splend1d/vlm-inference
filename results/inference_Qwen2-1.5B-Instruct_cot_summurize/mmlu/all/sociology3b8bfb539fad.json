It suggests that gender inequalities are rooted in social structures based on power dynamics between men and women, rather than simply a lack of equal rights and opportunities. Men have historically held positions of economic, political, and sexual dominance over women, which has perpetuated gender inequality. This view sees patriarchy as an ongoing process that continues to shape society today."
