                    "text": "To calculate the expected resonant field positions of both lines in the X-band EPR spectrum, we can use the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\nu = f_{\\text{rad}} / 2\\pi \\]\n\nwhere \\(f_{\\text{rad}}\\) is the resonance frequency and \\(\\nu\\) is the resonant field position.\n\nFor the first line, we have:\n\n\\[ \\nu_1 = f_{\\text{rad}_1} / 2\\pi \\]\n\\[ f_{\\text{rad}_1} = \\frac{\\nu}{2\\pi} \\]\n\nFor the second line, we have:\n\n\\[ \\nu_2 = f_{\\text{rad}_2} / 2\\pi \\]\n\\[ f_{\\text{rad}_2} = \\frac{\\nu}{2\\pi} \\]\n\nGiven that \\(g_{\\text{iso}} = 2.005\\) and \\(m_I = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), we can find the magnetic field strengths required to produce two lines at 280 MHz using the Zeeman effect formula:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{g_{\\text{iso}} \\mu_B I}{2\\pi} \\]\n\nwhere \\(B\\) is the magnetic field strength, \\(\\mu_B\\) is the Bohr magneton (approximately 9.274 x 10^-24 T.m/A), and \\(I\\) is the magnetic moment of the electron.\n\nFor the first line, we need to solve for \\(B\\) when \\(m_I = -\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{2.005 \\times 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\times (-\\frac{1}{2})}{2\\pi} \\]\n\\[ B = -6.302 \\times 10^{-24} T \\]\n\nFor the second line, we need to solve for \\(B\\) when \\(m_I = +\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{2.005 \\times 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\times (+\\frac{1}{2})}{2\\pi} \\]\n\\[ B = 6.302 \\times 10^{-24} T \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected resonant field positions (\\(f_{\\text{rad}_1}\\) and \\(f_{\\text{rad}_2}\\)) as follows:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{rad}_1} = \\frac{\\nu}{2\\pi} \\]\n\\[ f_{\\text{rad}_2} = \\frac{\\nu}{2\\pi} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values of \\(\\nu\\) from above:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{rad}_1} = \\frac{9.5 \\times 10^9}{2\\pi} \\]\n\\[ f_{\\text{rad}_2} = \\frac{9.5 \\times 10^9}{2\\pi} \\]\n\nSince \\(\\nu\\) is given as 9.5 GHz, we can simplify this expression further:\n\n\\[ f_{\\text{rad}_1} = \\frac{9.5 \\times 10^9}{2\\pi} \\approx 4.77 \\times 10^{8} Hz \\]\n\\[ f_{\\text{rad}_2} = \\frac{9.5 \\times 10^9}{2\\pi} \\approx 4.77 \\times 10^{8} Hz \\]\n\nThus, the expected resonant field positions of both lines in the X-band EPR spectrum are approximately equal, but slightly different due to the slight difference in their magnetic moments. Therefore, none of the options provided directly matches the expected results. However, if you consider the relative differences between them, option C seems to be closest to the correct answer based on the provided information: \n\n\\[ |f_{\\text{rad}_1} - f_{\\text{rad}_2}| = |\\frac{9.5 \\times 10^9}{2\\pi} - \\frac{9.5 \\times 10^9}{2\\pi}| = 0 \\]\n\nThis means that the two lines would have identical resonant frequencies, which is consistent with the given information. Therefore, the correct answer might be option C, where \\(Bres\\) for \\(m_I = -\\frac{1}{2}\\) = 333.5 mT, and \\(Bres\\) for \\(m_I = +\\frac{1}{2}\\) = 343.5 mT."
