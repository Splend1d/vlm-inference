We harm the patient.\n\nOffering an option for euthanasia to a patient who expresses a desire for it does not necessarily mean that the patient will choose to end their own life. In fact, many patients who express a desire for euthanasia do not go through with it. Additionally, allowing someone to make such a decision without any support or guidance can lead to negative consequences for both the patient and their family members.\n\nIf the doctor is forced to provide euthanasia to a patient against their wishes, this could result in harm to the patient and potentially to the patient's family as well. The doctor may feel pressure to comply with the patient's request, which could compromise their professional judgment and integrity. Furthermore, if the doctor is coerced into providing euthanasia, they may be at risk of facing legal consequences or other forms of punishment.\n\nIn summary, offering an option for euthanasia to a patient who expresses a desire for it can have serious consequences for both the patient and their family, and it is important to approach these situations carefully and ethically."
