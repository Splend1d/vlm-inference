This approach emphasizes the importance of assessing the overall impact and benefits of an action in determining whether it is morally acceptable or not. \n\nDeontology, by contrast, is a theory that emphasizes the duty to follow rules and duties regardless of the consequences, while virtue ethics focuses on developing virtuous character traits such as honesty, compassion, and courage, rather than focusing on the consequences of actions. Egoism, on the other hand, is a theory that emphasizes self-interest and the maximization of one's own happiness and well-being, often at the expense of others."
