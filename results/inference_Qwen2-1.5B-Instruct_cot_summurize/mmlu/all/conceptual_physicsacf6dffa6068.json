The Earth's magnetic field at any point and the vertical.\n\nMagnetic inclination refers to the angle between the Earth's magnetic field at a particular location and the vertical. This angle helps determine the direction in which an object will move if it experiences the force of gravity, as well as the orientation of the magnetic needle on a compass. Magnetic inclination can be measured using various instruments such as magnetometers or geophones."
