This is known as the \"beatific vision\" or the \"unification with God.\" In other words, the ultimate goal for humans is to attain a state of union with God, which leads to eternal joy and happiness. The other options listed (pleasure, acts of the moral virtues, and contemplation) are all related to achieving happiness on this earthly plane but do not directly contribute to the ultimate happiness that can only be achieved through God."
