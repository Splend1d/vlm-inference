Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nOption B and C are incorrect because if the income elasticity is positive, it indicates that when incomes rise, consumers will purchase more of the good. As a result, increasing income should lead to higher consumption of DVDs. Option D is also incorrect because if the price of DVDs rises by 10%, then the quantity demanded will fall by a smaller percentage (10% / 1.5 = 66.7%). Therefore, the correct answer is option A."
