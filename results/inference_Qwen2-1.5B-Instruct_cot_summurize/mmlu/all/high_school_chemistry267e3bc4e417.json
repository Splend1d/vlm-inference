The atomic masses of these elements are as follows:\n- Carbon: 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen: 1.008 g/mol\n- Oxygen: 16.00 g/mol\n\nTo calculate the molar mass of cholesterol, we add up the atomic masses of all the atoms in the molecule:\n\\[ \\text{Molar Mass} = (27 \\times 12.01) + (4 \\times 1.008) + (1 \\times 16.00) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Molar Mass} = 334.198 + 4.032 + 16.00 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Molar Mass} = 344.2308 \\]\n\nTo find the mass of one molecule of cholesterol, we divide the molar mass by the number of atoms in the molecule:\n\\[ \\text{Mass per Molecule} = \\frac{\\text{Molar Mass}}{\\text{Number of Atoms}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Mass per Molecule} = \\frac{344.2308}{27} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Mass per Molecule} = 12.87698 \\]\n\nRounded to three significant figures, this value is approximately 12.88 g/mol.\n\nGiven that the correct answer should be close to 12.88 g/mol but not exactly 12.88 g/mol due to rounding errors, let's choose an option that is slightly higher or lower than 12.88 g/mol based on the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6.41 \u00d7 10^-22 g - This is too small compared to 12.88 g/mol.\nOption B: 1.5 \u00d7 10^-21 g - This is too large compared to 12.88 g/mol.\nOption C: 1.38 \u00d7 10^-21 g - This is within the range of possible values given in the options, making it the most likely choice.\nOption D: 3 \u00d7 10^-23 g - This is too large compared to 12.88 g/mol.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to 12.88 g/mol among the provided choices is Option C: 1.38 \u00d7 10^-21 g."
