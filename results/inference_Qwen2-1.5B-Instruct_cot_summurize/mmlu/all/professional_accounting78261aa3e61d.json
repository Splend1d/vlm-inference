The variable costs include manufacturing costs (which are 20% of the total cost) and selling and administrative costs (which are 40%).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total variable cost:\n\nVariable cost = (Manufacturing costs + Selling & Admin. Costs) x 20%\n= ($12 + $3) x 20%\n= $15 x 20%\n= $30\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost of production:\n\nTotal cost = Variable cost + Fixed cost\n= $30 + $8\n= $38\n\nNext, we'll calculate the target contribution margin:\n\nTarget Contribution Margin = Total Cost - Target Contribution Margin\n= $38 - 20%\n= $38 - $7.6\n= $30.4\n\nFinally, we can find the target selling price by dividing the target contribution margin by the variable cost percentage:\n\nTarget Selling Price = Target Contribution Margin / Variable cost percentage\n= $30.4 / 20%\n= $30.4 / 0.2\n= $152\n\nSince there are no options provided in the question, it seems there might be an error or inconsistency in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the calculations:\n\n- The total variable cost should be calculated as $12 + $3 = $15.\n- The total cost of production should be calculated as $15 + $8 = $23.\n- The target contribution margin should be calculated as $23 - 20% = $23 - $4.6 = $18.4.\n\nUsing these corrected values:\n- The target selling price = $18.4 / 20% = $92.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer would be option B, $18.75. However, this doesn't match any of the provided options. Please check the question again or provide additional information if necessary."
