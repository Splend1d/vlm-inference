Late for a business appointment, a businesswoman was driving north on a highway when she decided to pass the car in front of her. As she swung across the center line into the southbound lane, her vehicle collided with a fire engine. As a result of the accident, the fire engine was delayed in reaching an owner's house, which was entirely destroyed by fire. The owner's home was located approximately one mile from the accident scene. If the owner asserts a claim against thebusinesswoman, he will most likely\n\nA. recover the fair market value of his house before the fire.\nB. recover that part of his loss that would have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck.\nC. recover nothing, because the businesswoman was not responsible for causing the fire.\nD. recover nothing, because the traffic statute was not designed to protect against the type of harm that the owner suffered.\n"

However, this does not necessarily mean that the driver who caused the accident should be held responsible for all losses sustained by others as a result of their actions. In this case, the businesswoman did not cause the fire, but rather caused an accident that resulted in property damage and lost time for the fire department. Therefore, the owner may only recover that portion of his loss that could have been prevented if the businesswoman had not violated the traffic statute."
