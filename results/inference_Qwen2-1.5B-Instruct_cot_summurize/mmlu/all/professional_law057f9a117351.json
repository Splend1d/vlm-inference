This statement must be included on the face of the written offer or in a separate document attached to the original offer.\n\nIt is important to note that the UCC does not require that the offeror supply a form for the offer, but rather that the offer itself be in a clear and unambiguous form that clearly indicates that it is irrevocable. Additionally, the offer must be sent to at least one party who is capable of accepting or rejecting the offer, and the acceptance of the offer must be communicated to the offeror before the specified time expires."
