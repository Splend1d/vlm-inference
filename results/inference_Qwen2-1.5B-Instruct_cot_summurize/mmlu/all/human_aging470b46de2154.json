Telomeres are short, repetitive DNA sequences that protect the ends of chromosomes from deterioration and degradation during cell division. The exact mechanism by which telomeres shorten with each cell division is not fully understood, but it has been shown to be influenced by genetic factors such as telomerase activity and telomere maintenance genes."
