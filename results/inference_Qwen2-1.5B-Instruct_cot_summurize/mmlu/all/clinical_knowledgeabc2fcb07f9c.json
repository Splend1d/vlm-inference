The correct answer would be D: remove the catheter and recatheterize.\n\nIt is crucial to address this issue promptly as blood clots can cause serious complications such as blockages in major arteries or veins, which can lead to organ damage, stroke, or even death if not treated properly. Removing the catheter and recatheterizing may require medical intervention by a healthcare professional who will carefully assess the situation and determine the best course of treatment. In some cases, they may need to perform additional procedures to clear the blockage before reinserting the catheter. It is essential to follow their instructions carefully to ensure safe and effective treatment."
