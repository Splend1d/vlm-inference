In this sense, he opposes the idea of equal distribution of resources or opportunities, as it may lead to inequality and conflict between individuals.\n\nWhile some interpretations of Parfit's views suggest that he supports a certain level of equality, such as allowing people to have access to basic necessities like food and shelter, his overall stance is one of limited government intervention and prioritizing individual autonomy over collective well-being."
