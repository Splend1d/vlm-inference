The advertisement clearly states that the necklace is intended for women only, and therefore cannot be sold to a man without the consent of the owner or the agreement of the store. If the man were to bring suit against the store for refusing to sell him the necklace, he would need to prove that the advertisement was intended as an invitation to make an offer, which is not the case here."
