                    "text": "The correct answer is A: CTL exhaustion.\n\nWhen an individual becomes chronically infected with HIV, their immune system begins to attack the virus more aggressively than usual. This leads to the development of a robust and diverse CD8+ T cell response against the virus. However, over time, these T cells become exhausted and unable to effectively kill the virus.\n\nOne reason for this is that HIV has developed mechanisms to evade the immune system by changing its surface antigens, or \"epitopes,\" so that the T cells targeting them are no longer effective. This process is called \"epitope escape.\"\n\nAnother factor contributing to the failure of CD8+ T cell responses to eliminate the virus is the depletion of immune cells, including dendritic cells, which play a crucial role in presenting viral antigens to T cells. When there are fewer dendritic cells around, it can make it harder for T cells to find and target the virus-infected cells.\n\nSo, while both exhaustion and epitope escape contribute to the failure of CD8+ T cell responses, they are not mutually exclusive. The combination of these factors can lead to a situation where the T cell response is ineffective at eliminating the virus."
