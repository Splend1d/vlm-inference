Spontaneous mutations occur randomly during the replication process of DNA and do not require external factors such as carcinogens to occur. They can contribute to genetic diversity and evolutionary change over time. However, some mutations may lead to diseases or disorders if they result in a loss of function or incorrect protein synthesis."
