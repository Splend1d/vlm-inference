The nominal interest rate equals the real interest rate minus the inflation rate.\n\nThis is known as Fisher's equation, which describes the relationship between the nominal and real interest rates in an economy. According to this equation, if the expected inflation rate exceeds the expected real growth rate of the economy, then the real interest rate will be negative, leading to deflationary pressure on prices. Conversely, if the expected inflation rate is below the expected real growth rate, then the real interest rate will be positive, leading to inflationary pressures on prices."
