Another customer, who had not been threatened by the woman, forcefully grabbed the woman and locked her in the tavern's storeroom until the police could arrive. In the process, although the customer used reasonable force, the customer badly sprained the woman's wrist. Is the woman likely to recover in an action against the customer?\n\nA. No, because the customer's conduct was privileged as a defense of others.\nB. Yes, based on battery only.\nC. Yes, based on false imprisonment only.\nD. Yes, based on both battery and false imprisonment.\n"

Yes, based on both battery and false imprisonment.\n\nBattery occurs when one person causes another person physical harm or discomfort without their consent. In this case, the customer forcibly grabbed the woman and locked her in the storeroom, which constitutes battery.\n\nFalse imprisonment occurs when someone restrains another person unlawfully and without their consent. The customer forced the woman into the storeroom against her will, which also constitutes false imprisonment.\n\nTherefore, the woman may have a claim for battery and false imprisonment, which would allow her to recover damages from the customer. However, it is important to note that the specific legal issues and potential defenses in this scenario would depend on the details of the incident and any applicable laws in the jurisdiction where the case is being heard."
