Wage differentials can be based on various factors such as higher risk jobs, investment in human capital, racial discrimination, and other factors. The increase in production of SUVs may lead to an increase in demand for these vehicles, which could result in higher wages for workers involved in producing them. However, this does not necessarily mean that there is a wage differential between individuals who produce SUVs compared to those who do not. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a basis for wage differential."
