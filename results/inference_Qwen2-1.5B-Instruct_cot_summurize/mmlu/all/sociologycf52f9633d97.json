Global tourism has had some negative impacts on certain industries such as the sex industry, but it has also led to increased awareness and better regulation of these industries. It has also allowed for the development of new tourist destinations that may be less exploitative than those in poorer countries. However, it is still possible for there to be instances of exploitation and unfair treatment of workers in many parts of the world, even in developed countries."
