On the one hand, naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope and on the other hand, positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires\nB. While naturalism serves only the theory human rights law, positivism has a wider and more general scope\nC. Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such\nD.

It holds that laws and norms are grounded in natural realities such as justice, fairness, and morality, rather than being constructed through political processes.\n\nPositivism, on the other hand, is a philosophical perspective that emphasizes the importance of empirical evidence and rationality in understanding the world. According to positivists, knowledge is primarily derived from sensory experience and observation, and it should be based on scientific methods and principles. They argue that laws and regulations are created by states through a process of social construction and consensus-building, rather than being self-evident truths or inherent in nature.\n\nIn summary, naturalism is concerned with the intrinsic nature of actions and outcomes, while positivism is focused on the legal framework within which those actions and outcomes occur."
