Cliff-side nesting confers a higher fitness than does beach nesting.\nC. Chicks from cliff nests instinctively step off the cliffs at the appropriate time.\nD.

The other options do not necessarily support this conclusion. For example, if there were fewer chicks surviving the fall from the cliffs than were killed, then it could be argued that cliff-side nesting may not be as advantageous as originally thought. Similarly, if many more geese nest on the beaches than on the cliffs, then it would suggest that beach nesting is the preferred strategy rather than cliff-side nesting. However, without additional evidence or information about the specific conditions under which these birds nest, we cannot definitively say whether cliff-side nesting is adaptive or not."
