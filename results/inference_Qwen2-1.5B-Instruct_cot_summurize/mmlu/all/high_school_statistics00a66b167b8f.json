This is because the chi-square statistic is defined as:\n\n\u03c7^2 = \u03a3((Observed - Expected)^2 / Expected)\n\nwhere Observed is the observed frequency count and Expected is the expected frequency count for each cell. If any cell has an expected frequency count less than 5, then the chi-square statistic will be negative, which contradicts the definition of a chi-square distribution. Therefore, the expected value for each cell must be at least 5.\nStatement II states that in order to use \u03c72 procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom. This is because the chi-square statistic is a measure of how far away the observed frequencies are from their expected values, and the degrees of freedom represent the number of independent pieces of information used to estimate the expected values. Since the expected values depend on the observations, they cannot be estimated independently, so the degree of freedom is equal to the number of cells minus 1. Therefore, we need at least 2 degrees of freedom to estimate the expected values correctly.\nStatement III states that in a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table, the number of degrees of freedom is 3. This is not necessarily true. The degrees of freedom for a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table with fixed cells are 6, since there are 6 pairs of categories (row x column) and the row and column variables can be treated as random variables. However, if the rows and columns are not independent, then the degrees of freedom would be reduced by 1 (since there are now 5 pairs of categories). Therefore, it is possible to have a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table with 6 degrees of freedom, but it depends on whether the rows and columns are independent or not."
