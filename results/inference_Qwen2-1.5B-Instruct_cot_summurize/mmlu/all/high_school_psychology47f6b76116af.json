Meta-analysis\n\nMeta-analysis is a statistical procedure that combines results from multiple studies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of a phenomenon or outcome. It involves pooling the data from different studies, taking into account their individual variability while accounting for any common biases that may have affected the original findings.\n\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) is used when comparing means between two or more groups, whereas analysis of difference scores refers to comparing differences between two groups rather than comparing means. Multiple regression involves predicting one dependent variable based on several independent variables, but it does not combine data across studies in the way meta-analysis does.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Meta-analysis."
