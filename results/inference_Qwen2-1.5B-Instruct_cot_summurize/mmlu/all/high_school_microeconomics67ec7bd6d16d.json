As a firm produces more units of output, its total costs increase, but the marginal cost remains constant until it reaches a certain level where further increases in production result in an increase in marginal cost that outweighs the additional fixed costs associated with producing one more unit of output. At this point, the marginal cost curve begins to rise faster than the average total cost curve, indicating that the firm has reached its optimal production level and should stop producing additional units of output to minimize losses. Therefore, the intersection of these two curves occurs at the minimum point on the MC curve, which is also the minimum point on the ATC curve."
