This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid. And all lands, both islands and mainlands, found and discovered already, or to be found and discovered hereafter, by the said King of Portugal and by his vessels on this side of the said line and bound determined as above, toward the east, in either north or south latitude, on the eastern side of the said bound provided the said bound is not crossed, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King of Portugal and his successors.

                    "text": "The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, was a historic agreement between Spain and Portugal regarding the division of newly discovered land outside Europe. The technology that most directly caused the treaty to be signed would be related to navigation and exploration, rather than gunpowder weapons, steel, or germ theory.\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas established the principle of \"equity\" and \"balance of power,\" with Spain receiving the northern half of the newly discovered land, while Portugal received the southern half. It also outlined the boundaries of the Atlantic Ocean, dividing it into two zones: the Northern Zone, where Portugal's territory extended towards the equator, and the Southern Zone, where Spain's territory extended towards the equator. These boundaries were crucial for the development of trade routes and the establishment of colonial empires.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The compass, as it allowed for precise mapping of the oceans and accurate determination of distances between points."
