If the helium is evacuated into a larger container while the temperature is held constant, what will the effect on the entropy of the helium be?\n\nA. It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.\nB. It will decrease as the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask.\nC. It will decrease because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask less often than they did in the smaller flask.\nD. It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.\n"

The gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask, which means that the average distance between them will be greater, and therefore there will be fewer collisions per unit time. This will result in a decrease in the entropy of the system. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
