This practice is known as \"Naam Japna\" or \"Namdhyan.\" It involves repeating the name of God (Akaal) in order to purify the mind and heart, and to connect with the divine. Through this practice, Sikhs seek to overcome their egoistic tendencies and to cultivate a deeper understanding of the nature of reality."
