After several sessions with the boy and his family, you receive a letter from the school principal requesting information about the boy's condition, and a signed release from the boy's parents is included with the letter. As an ethical psychologist, you should:\n\nA. refuse to release the records to anyone but a licensed psychologist.\nB. refuse to release the records to anyone but the boy's parents.\nC. release only that information you believe to be relevant to the school's concerns.\nD. release photocopies of your complete file on the boy and his family.\n"

Therefore, I would recommend refusing to release the records to anyone except the boy's parents unless there is a clear legal or ethical reason for doing so.\n\nIt is also important to note that releasing sensitive information such as medical history or mental health diagnosis can have significant consequences for the client, especially if they are not informed of these risks beforehand. It is therefore crucial to obtain informed consent before sharing any personal information with others, including the school."
