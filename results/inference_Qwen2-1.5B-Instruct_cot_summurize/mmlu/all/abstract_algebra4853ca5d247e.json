In this case, \\(a = -3\\) and \\(b = 3\\), so \\(a^2 = (-3)^2 = 9\\) and \\(b^2 = 3^2 = 9\\), which shows that \\(a^2 = b^2\\).\n\nHowever, for a general group, this statement may not hold. For example, consider the group of integers modulo 4 under addition. Here, \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 1\\), but \\(a^2 = 0^2 = 0\\) and \\(b^2 = 1^2 = 1\\), showing that \\(a^2 \\neq b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false because it assumes a specific property of the group Z.\n\nStatement 2:\nThe set of rotations in a dihedral group does indeed form a cyclic subgroup. A dihedral group consists of all symmetries of a regular polygon, including reflections and rotations. Rotations around an axis through the center of the polygon can be represented by matrices with integer entries, where each rotation angle corresponds to a different element in the group. This means that every rotation is its own inverse, and the set of rotations forms a cyclic subgroup since any rotation can be written as the product of one or more rotations around the same axis.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is true.\n\nBased on these explanations, the correct answer is B. False, False."
