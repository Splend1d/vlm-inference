Damage to these regions can result in deficits or loss of vision, particularly in areas where the visual cortex is located. Therefore, damage to the occipital lobes of the brain would most likely affect vision. \n\nIt's important to note that other senses such as hearing, touch, and balance may also be affected by damage to the occipital lobes, but vision is typically the first sense affected due to its critical role in processing visual information."
