Since $m$ and $n$ are both odd integers, both $a$ and $b$ must also be odd integers.\n\nThe binomial coefficients ${n \\choose k}$ are always even numbers because they are combinations of integers from 0 to n. Therefore, all the terms in the expansion of $(m+n)^6$ will be of the form $a^3 b^n$, where $a=m$ or $b=n$, and $m$ and $n$ are odd integers.\n\nSince there are six variables ($a$ and $b$), and each variable appears three times (once for each power of $a$ or $b$), there will be a total of $3^6=729$ terms in the expansion of $(m+n)^6$.\n\nHowever, only the terms where $a$ and $b$ are both odd integers contribute to the number of odd terms. This happens when $a=m$ and $b=n$, so there are $2^6=64$ such terms.\n\nTherefore, the number of terms in the expansion of $(m+n)^6$ that are odd is $\\boxed{64}$."
