                    "text": "The correct answer is D: it does not have a metallic core.\n\nVenus, being closer to the Sun than Earth, experiences intense solar radiation and temperature fluctuations that can cause its outer layers to melt and expand. This expansion leads to the formation of a dense, hot atmosphere that is less conductive than iron or steel, which is required for a magnetic field to exist. The lack of a metallic core means that there is no natural source of magnetic material within the planet to generate a magnetic field. Therefore, option D is the most likely explanation for why Venus does not have a strong magnetic field."
