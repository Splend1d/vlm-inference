Epicurus believed that the highest goal in life was to find happiness and fulfillment through the relationships we have with others, particularly our friends. He emphasized the importance of social bonds and the need to cultivate friendships as a means of achieving inner peace and contentment. Honor and luxury may be important for some people, but they do not provide the same sense of fulfillment and well-being that comes from meaningful relationships with others. Good food can also contribute to overall health and well-being, but it is not a substitute for true friendship."
