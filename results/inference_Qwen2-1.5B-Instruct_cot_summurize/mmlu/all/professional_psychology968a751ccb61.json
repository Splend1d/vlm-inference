Sexual abuse is one of the situations where information disclosed by a child client to a psychologist may be kept confidential, even if the client does not report it to the psychologist. The therapist has a legal and ethical obligation to keep such information confidential unless there is a risk that harm will occur to the child or others.\n \nIt is important for therapists to understand their responsibilities under laws governing confidentiality in child protection cases. In some jurisdictions, therapists must report suspected instances of child abuse or neglect to authorities. However, they should only do so after obtaining consent from the child and ensuring that there is no risk of harm to the child.\n\nIn general, therapists should encourage children to disclose any concerns about their safety or well-being, but they should also provide support and guidance on how to handle those concerns appropriately. This can include providing information about available resources, helping the child develop coping strategies, and advocating for their rights as a child."
