The product is familiar and has been used in previous purchases, so there is less need for research or decision-making. This type of buying behavior is often associated with impulse buying because it involves making quick decisions without much thought or consideration. High involvement buying situations require more effort, as the product must be thoroughly researched and evaluated before purchase. New buying situations also require some effort, but they may not necessarily be routine. Impulsive buying involves buying products based solely on emotional responses rather than careful consideration."
