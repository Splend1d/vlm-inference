He signed an agreement with the local swimming club to use their swimming pool four times per week. The agreement, which had a duration of one year, stated that the man could use the poo1 four times per week for $250 per month, due on the first day of each month. For three months, the man paid the $250 on the first and made use of the swimming pool. Toward the middle of the third month, the man was involved in an automobile accident. Shortly thereafter, the man sent the following letter to the swimming club:\"Please be advised that because of injuries sustained in an automobile accident, my physician has advised me not to engage in any strenuous activities. Since I will not be able to make use of the pool anymore, no further payments will be forthcoming. \"Which of the following does not accurately state the immediate legal effect of the man's letter?\n\nA. The swimming club has the right to bar the man from any further use of the pooi.\nB. The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract.\nC. The man may retract his repudiation if he does so before the swimming club initiates legal action against him.\nD. The swimming club must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The swimming club has the right to sue the man immediately for breach of contract. \n\nWhen the man wrote to the swimming club, he did not formally terminate his agreement with them. Instead, he simply expressed a desire to stop using the pool. This is known as a repudiation. However, this act alone does not automatically end the contract. In fact, it only indicates that the man is no longer willing to fulfill his obligations under the contract.\n\nTo legally end the contract, the swimming club would need to take formal steps such as sending a notice of termination or taking legal action against the man. In this case, since the man has already started paying the monthly fees and used the pool, the swimming club cannot simply send a notice of termination without waiting for the next payment to arrive. Therefore, they must wait until the date of the next payment in order to sue the man for breach of contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is nothing in the scenario that allows the swimming club to bar the man from future use of the pool. Option C is also incorrect because the man can still retract his repudiation before the swimming club takes legal action against him. Option D is also incorrect because the swimming club needs to wait until the date of the next payment to initiate legal action, but the letter itself does not indicate that the man has stopped making payments."
