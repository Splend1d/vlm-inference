One evening, the guard saw a young man stealing a rake that a homeowner in the neighborhood had left outside in his yard. The guard ran toward the young man. Seeing the guard, the young man dropped the rake and began to flee. Believing that the young man was about to escape, the guard pulled out his gun and fired a shot at the young man. The bullet struck the young man in the arm. If the young man asserts a claim against the security company for damages for his injuries, the young man will\n\nA. prevail, because the guard used unreasonable force to protect the homeowner's property.\nB. prevail, because the guard did not give a warning that he had a gun and was about to shoot.\nC. not prevail, because the young man was trespassing on the homeowner's property.\nD. not prevail, because the young man was engaged in theft when he was shot.\n"

Theft is a criminal act, and if someone commits this crime while they are being protected from harm by law enforcement, they may not be able to recover damages from those responsible for their actions. In this case, the young man was committing theft, so he cannot sue the security company for damages related to the shooting."
