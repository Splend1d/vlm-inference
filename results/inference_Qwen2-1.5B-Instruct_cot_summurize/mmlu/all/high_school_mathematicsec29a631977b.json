                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of ways to choose any three cards from a standard 52-card deck and then calculate how many of those combinations result in a pair.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of ways to choose any three cards out of 52:\n\nThe formula for combinations is \\(C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\), where \\(n\\) is the total number of items, \\(k\\) is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose any three cards is:\n\\[C(52, 3) = \\frac{52!}{3!(52-3)!} = \\frac{52!}{3! \\cdot 50!} = \\frac{52 \\times 51 \\times 50}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 2210.\\]\n\nNext, we need to count the number of ways to choose three cards with the same rank. Since there are 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades), each suit has 13 cards. The number of ways to choose one card of each suit is \\(4 \\times 13 \\times 13 = 624\\).\n\nHowever, since the question specifies that we want a pair (two matching cards), we must subtract these combinations because they don't give us a pair. So, the valid ways to get a pair are:\n\\[C(4, 2) \\times C(13, 1) \\times C(13, 1) - 624 = 6 \\times 13 \\times 13 - 624 = 928 - 624 = 304.\\]\nThis means there are 304 valid ways to choose a pair among the 52 possible combinations of three cards.\n\nFinally, to find the probability of getting a pair, divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes:\n\\[P(\\text{pair}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \\frac{304}{2210} = \\frac{1}{7}\\].\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C**."
