GDP deflator.\n\nThe GDP deflator measures the relationship between nominal and real GDP, which helps economists understand how prices have changed over time. It is calculated by dividing nominal GDP by the GDP deflator for the base year, which can be either 2015 or 2016. The GDP deflator takes into account changes in prices and costs that affect the production of goods and services, allowing economists to compare economic performance across different periods. Therefore, the GDP deflator is used to measure inflation-adjusted GDP growth rates and to analyze trends in the economy."
