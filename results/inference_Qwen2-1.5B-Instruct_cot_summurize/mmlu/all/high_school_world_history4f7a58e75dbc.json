This chart shows that literacy rates among the Russian-speaking population of late Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union have significantly increased over time, from 24% in 1897 to 99.90% in 1955. This suggests that despite the challenges faced by the Soviet government, such as political repression and economic hardship, it was able to improve education and literacy rates among its citizens. Therefore, the historian sympathetic to Soviet communism would most likely use this chart as evidence to support proposition D."
