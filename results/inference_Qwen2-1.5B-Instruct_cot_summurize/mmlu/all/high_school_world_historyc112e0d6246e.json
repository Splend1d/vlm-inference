This verse is written in French, a language that was not commonly used during the time period being described (the early 20th century). Additionally, the reference to Senegal and its culture, as well as the allusion to African spirituality and tradition, suggest that this verse is part of a broader movement towards adapting Western literary forms to reflect non-Western perspectives and experiences."
