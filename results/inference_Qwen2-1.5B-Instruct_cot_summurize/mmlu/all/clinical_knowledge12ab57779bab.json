Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands\n\nCalcium metabolism refers to the regulation and utilization of calcium within the body, including its absorption from the intestines, storage in bones and muscles, and release into the bloodstream for various functions such as muscle contraction, nerve function, and bone formation. The parathyroids glands secrete hormones that regulate calcium levels in the blood, which can be either too high or too low due to factors such as dietary intake, exposure to sunlight, and hormonal imbalances.\n\nCalcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that helps maintain normal calcium levels in the blood by inhibiting the absorption of calcium from the intestine and promoting its excretion in the urine. This hormone has no effect on plasma calcium levels.\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is a condition where one or more parathyroid glands produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to an excess of calcium in the blood. Symptoms include increased urination, weakness, and bone pain. However, primary hyperparathyroidism is often asymptomatic until it leads to complications such as kidney stones or osteoporosis.\n\nOliguria is a condition characterized by decreased urine output, which can occur due to various reasons such as dehydration, infection, or structural abnormalities of the kidneys. It is not typically associated with hypercalcaemia, although it may occasionally be seen in patients with renal failure or other conditions affecting calcium homeostasis."
