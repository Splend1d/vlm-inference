If their mean diameter is under 1.23 centimeters or over 1.27 centimeters, the machinery is stopped and an engineer is called to make adjustments before production is resumed. The quality control procedure may be viewed as a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis H0: \u03bc = 1.25 and the alternative hypothesis Ha: \u03bc \u2260 1.25. The engineer is asked to make adjustments when the null hypothesis is rejected. In test terminology, what would a Type II error result in?\n\nA. A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery\nB. An unnecessary stoppage of the production process\nC. Continued production of wrong size ball bearings\nD. Continued production of proper size ball bearings\n"

In this case, if the engineer makes adjustments when the null hypothesis is not rejected, it means that the machinery was functioning properly despite producing balls with a diameter less than 1.25 cm or greater than 1.27 cm. This could lead to continued production of wrong-size ball bearings, which would result in wasted resources and potential damage to the machinery.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Continued production of wrong size ball bearings."
