As more of the strong acid is added, the solution becomes increasingly acidic due to the hydrolysis of the weak base. This results in a decreasing pH over time as the base is consumed by the acid. At the equivalence point (where the amount of base equals the amount of acid), the pH will be around 7, but it will continue to decrease slightly after this point due to the continued consumption of the weak base by the remaining strong acid. Therefore, the pH will initially decrease slowly before rapidly decreasing to below 7 at the equivalence point."
