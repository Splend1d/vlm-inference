On examination, there is bruising of the perineum and pain is elicited with motion of his pelvis. Blood is noted at the urethral meatus. There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption. Which of the following portions of the urethra would be at greatest risk for injury in this patient?\n\nA. Intramural (pre-prostatic)\nB. Membranous\nC. Prostatic\nD. Spongy\n"

The prostatic urethra is located just below the prostate gland and is vulnerable to injury from external forces such as blunt trauma or penetration. It is also less protected than the membranous urethra, which is found within the walls of the bladder. Therefore, it is more likely to be injured if the patient experiences a high impact injury, such as a car accident."
