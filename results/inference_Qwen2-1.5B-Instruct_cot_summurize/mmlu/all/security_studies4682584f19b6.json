Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their \"protectors\". This strengthens the argument for female soldiers to be engaged in certain types of peacekeeping work, particularly in post-conflict situations.\nB. Perpetuation of violence against women in post-conflict society has devalued the claim that violence is more prevalent in militarized societies. Women were as protected by men in pre-war society as they were in post-war society.\nC. Case studies revealed that in certain military families, levels of violence were dependent on the degree of psychological damage inflicted during fighting, however this was variable and dependent on the individual not on gender basis.\nD. Recent inquiry into the way in which women have been treated both in and after war has revealed a degree of ambiguity in the relationship between armed forces and civilian women. While women have often been the targets of violence by the enemy in conflict, it is also the case that they may suffer at the hands of their \"protectors\" which may actually undermine liberal feminists' case of the \"right to fight\".\n"

Recent inquiries into the treatment of women in post-conflict societies have highlighted the potential for violence against women from both sides of the conflict. Female soldiers who engage in peacekeeping efforts can help to reduce these risks by providing a buffer between opposing sides.\n\nB. The idea that violence against women is less prevalent in militarized societies than in non-militarized ones is likely to be challenged by cases where women have suffered from violence while serving in the military. This could undermine the feminist argument that women should not serve in combat roles.\n\nC. It's possible that some military families experience higher rates of violence due to factors unrelated to gender. However, this does not necessarily mean that violence is gender-specific, and it's important to consider other factors such as economic conditions, social norms, and personal experiences when analyzing violent behavior within military households.\n\nD. The suggestion that female soldiers can undermine liberal feminist arguments about the right to fight is unlikely to be accurate given that women have fought in many conflicts throughout history. Additionally, the idea that violence against women is more common among militaries than in non-military settings is based on limited evidence and is unlikely to hold up under scrutiny. Ultimately, it's important to consider all available evidence and perspectives when evaluating the impact of biology on gender security."
