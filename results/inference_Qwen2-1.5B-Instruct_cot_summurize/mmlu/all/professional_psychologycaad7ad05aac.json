Changes to a Maintenance Factor, Increasing as a Motivator\n\nMoney is often seen as a motivator that provides stability and security. When basic survival needs such as food, shelter, and clothing have been met, people may rely more heavily on money as a source of motivation rather than external rewards like praise or recognition. This can lead to increased motivation and productivity when faced with financial challenges.\n\nIt's worth noting that while money can provide a sense of security and stability, it should not be relied upon solely as a motivator. Other factors such as relationships, autonomy, and purpose also play important roles in motivating individuals."
