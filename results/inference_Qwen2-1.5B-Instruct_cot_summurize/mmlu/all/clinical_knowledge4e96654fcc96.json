Fracture of the radius and ulna at the wrist.\n\nColles fractures, also known as Galeazzi fractures or Barton's fractures, occur when the radial head is displaced backward and downward against the underlying ulnar styloid process. The most common type of Colles fracture is a compound fracture where the fracture involves both the radial head and the distal third of the radius. \n\nIt is important to note that a Colles fracture can be caused by a variety of factors such as falls, car accidents, or sports injuries. Treatment typically involves immobilization in a cast for several weeks until the bone heals. If left untreated, it can lead to long-term complications such as deformity, arthritis, or nerve damage."
