Philosophy\n\nPsychology emerged as an academic discipline in the 19th century, drawing on ideas from philosophy, biology, and neuroscience to understand human behavior and mental processes. However, it was primarily influenced by philosophical ideas about consciousness, free will, and individualism that were popular at the time. These philosophical perspectives provided the foundation for much of modern psychology's foundational theories, such as those related to motivation, personality, and cognitive processes."
