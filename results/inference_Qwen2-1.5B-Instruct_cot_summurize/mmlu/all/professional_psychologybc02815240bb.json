There is a statistically significant difference in the number of participants who drop out of the different treatment groups during the course of the study.\n\nStatistical regression can be a potential threat to a study's internal validity if it results in differences between groups that cannot be attributed to any specific variable being manipulated by the researcher. In this case, statistical significance of the difference in participant dropout rates between treatment groups suggests that other factors may be influencing the outcome of the study, such as selection bias or confounding variables. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider these factors and ensure that they do not introduce bias into the study design and analysis."
