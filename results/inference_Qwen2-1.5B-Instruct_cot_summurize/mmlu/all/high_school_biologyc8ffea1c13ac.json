All cells carry out cellular respiration in mitochondria.\n\nCellular respiration is a fundamental process that occurs within the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and is essential for providing energy for all living organisms, including humans. This process involves the breakdown of glucose to release energy, which is used for various functions such as growth, reproduction, and movement. Therefore, all cells that undergo cellular respiration must share this common biological function, indicating a degree of uniformity across different species."
