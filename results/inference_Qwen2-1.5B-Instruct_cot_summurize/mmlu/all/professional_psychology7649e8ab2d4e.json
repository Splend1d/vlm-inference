Self-serving bias refers to the tendency of individuals to attribute their successes and favorable outcomes to themselves and others, while attributing failures or unfavorable outcomes to external factors such as luck or chance. In this case, the employee may be attributing his boss's behavior to personal reasons rather than simply due to the actions of the individual.\n\nOverjustification hypothesis suggests that people tend to overestimate the extent to which they can control events or predict future outcomes. Fundamental attribution bias involves attributing success or failure to one's own efforts or characteristics, rather than to external factors such as luck or opportunity. Self-verification theory suggests that people seek out information that confirms their beliefs and attitudes, even if it contradicts other evidence.\n\nNone of these options fully account for the employee's expectation of greater consistency in the behavior of his boss than is warranted. Therefore, the correct answer is B. self-serving bias."
