According to the problem:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{9} = \\text{Number of students taking tap lessons} \\]\n\nThis means that for every student who takes tap lessons, there are 4 out of 9 students in total. We know there are 72 students in total on the dance team, so:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{4}{9} \\times 72 \\]\n\nNow we calculate \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{4}{9} \\times 72 = \\frac{4 \\times 72}{9} = \\frac{336}{9} = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, \\(36\\) students take tap lessons. The correct answer is:\n\nC. 63"
