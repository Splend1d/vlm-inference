                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The wave pulse's width has become smaller.\n\nWhen a wave hits an object like a wading child, the portion of the wave that reaches their ankles will be smaller than the portion of the wave that traveled through the entire pond. This is because as the wave moves away from the source (the rock), its amplitude (height) decreases and its wavelength increases. Therefore, the width of the wave pulse that hits the child's ankles will be narrower than the width of the wave pulse that traveled through the entire pond. \n\nOption B, \"The wave pulse's width has become greater,\" is incorrect because as the wave travels away from the source, its width or width of its peak-to-peak distance (P-P) decreases. Option A, \"The wave is moving more slowly,\" is also incorrect because the speed of the wave does not change significantly as it travels away from the source. Option D, \"The wave's height has become smaller,\" is incorrect because the height of the wave remains constant throughout its journey."
