Compensation theorem.\n\nReciprocity theorem states that if two systems have identical inputs and outputs, they must also have identical outputs for any input. However, in this case, the positions of the detector and source are interchanged, but the output remains unchanged. Therefore, this does not follow from reciprocity theorem.\n\nThevenin's theorem states that an equivalent circuit can be obtained by removing the sources from a network of resistors and capacitors, while keeping the internal resistance of each component constant. In this case, we do not need to remove any sources because the bridge remains balanced regardless of the positions of the detector and source.\n\nNorton's theorem states that an equivalent circuit can be obtained by replacing all the elements in a network with their equivalent resistance (R) and current (I). However, this theorem does not apply here because the bridge is already balanced without the use of any external components.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is compensation theorem."
