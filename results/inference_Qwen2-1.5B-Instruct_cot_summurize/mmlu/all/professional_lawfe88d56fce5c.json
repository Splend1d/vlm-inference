She was able to buy the house for a very good price because it was located directly across the street from a fraternity house known for its frequent late-night parties. The buyer knew of the fraternity's reputation before she bought the house. The reputation was well deserved, and the buyer found the noise from the parties extremely unpleasant and disruptive. The buyer has asked an attorney for legal advice regarding a possible nuisance claim against the fraternity. Which of the following responses would best express the applicable law?\n\nA. \"You have no nuisance claim, because the fraternity members have the right to use their property as they please.\"\nB. \"You have no nuisance claim, because you came to the nuisance.\"\nC. \"You might have a nuisance claim, but the fact that you bought the house fully aware of the fraternity's habitual late-night activities will count against your claim and could help defeat it.\"\nD. \"You will be able to recover damages in a nuisance action, because the late-night activities of the fraternity members violate your right to the quiet enjoyment of your property.\"\n"

You will be able to recover damages in a nuisance action, because the late-night activities of the fraternity members violate your right to the quiet enjoyment of your property. This means that if the buyer can prove that the noise from the parties is causing her to suffer a loss or damage to her property or health, she may be entitled to compensation for those losses or damages. However, it is important to note that the specific laws and regulations surrounding nuisances vary depending on the location and circumstances, so it is advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in nuisance claims in order to understand the specific requirements and limitations in this case."
