Additionally, if a leader were to reveal their nuclear program, it could lead to increased tensions and conflict with neighboring countries that might view the disclosure as an act of aggression. Finally, foreign monitors may not always be granted access to a country's nuclear facilities, making it difficult to verify whether or not a country has a nuclear program."
