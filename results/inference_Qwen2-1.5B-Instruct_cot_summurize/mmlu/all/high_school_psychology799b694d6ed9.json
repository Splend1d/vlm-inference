Superordinate goals\n\nThe Sherif's Robbers Cave study found that when individuals have shared superordinate goals, they are more likely to work together towards achieving those goals than when they have conflicting interests or personal goals. This is because superordinate goals provide a sense of purpose and meaning for the group, which can help reduce tension and conflict among members. Therefore, option A (superordinate goals) is the principle that best helps reduce tensions between groups in this context."
