It is possible that you are asking about the total cost of air conditioning all vehicles on the road in the United States, or perhaps the average cost per vehicle.\n\nWithout more context or information, it is difficult to provide an accurate answer. However, according to estimates from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the average cost of air conditioning one car is around $500-$700. Therefore, if we assume that this amount is applied to every single automobile on the road in the US, the total cost would be somewhere between $50 billion and $70 billion.\n\nIt's important to note that these figures are rough estimates and may vary depending on factors such as location, type of vehicle, and other economic conditions. Additionally, the cost of air conditioning vehicles can also depend on various factors such as government regulations, insurance policies, and consumer behavior."
