This is because the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another is determined by the speed of its communication channel (network). In this case, it's given that the network has the capacity to carry 1,000 packets per second and the CPU time required to execute the network protocol to send one packet is 10 milliseconds. Since there are 1,000 packets in a second, the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another is 1,000 x 1,000 = 100,000 bytes/second. However, since we only need to send one packet at a time, the actual rate at which one computer can send data to another is half of this value, or 25,000 bytes/second."
