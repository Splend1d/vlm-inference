                    "text": "The price level changes in response to changes in both nominal income and real income, but it does not change proportionally with either of them. Instead, it changes proportionally to the difference between the two variables.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Nominal income as \\(Y_N\\)\n- Real income as \\(Y_R\\)\n- Price level as \\(P\\)\n\nWe know that \\(Y_N = Y_R \\times P\\), where \\(Y_R\\) is constant (it's just real income). We're given that \\(Y_N\\) increases by 4% and \\(Y_R\\) decreases by 1%, so we can write:\n\n\\[Y_N = Y_R \\times P(1 + \\frac{4}{100})\\]\n\nSolving for \\(P\\), we get:\n\n\\[P = \\frac{Y_N}{Y_R} \\times \\left(\\frac{100 - 4}{100}\\right) = \\frac{Y_N}{Y_R} \\times \\frac{96}{100}\\]\n\nThis means that when nominal income increases, the price level changes in such a way that its percentage change matches the percentage change in real income. This is because the nominal income-to-price ratio stays relatively constant, while the real income-to-price ratio changes.\n\nSo, if nominal income increases by 4%, the price level must decrease by approximately 1% to maintain the same ratio of nominal income to price. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. \u00bc percent increase**."
