Picking up one's own dog's poop is seen as an act of responsibility and care for the environment, rather than littering. Therefore, picking up one's own dog's poop would not be considered morally wrong under this scenario. \n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 2 involves teaching someone else to drive in a private parking lot, which may or may not involve breaking any laws depending on the specific circumstances. However, even if there were no legal consequences, it could still be considered morally wrong to teach someone else to drive without proper training and experience. Teaching someone else to drive without ensuring they have the necessary skills and knowledge can lead to accidents and injuries. Therefore, while teaching someone else to drive in a private parking lot may not necessarily break any laws, it could still be considered morally wrong based on the potential risks involved."
