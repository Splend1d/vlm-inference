The composition contains several verses that describe Marduk as the creator and ruler of the universe, and as the embodiment of wisdom and knowledge.\nBased on this interpretation, the correct answer would be D: transcendent and immanent. The composition suggests that Marduk is not just an abstract concept but also present within the world, as he is depicted as the source of all wisdom and knowledge. This reflects the idea that Marduk is both transcendent (beyond human understanding and perception) and immanent (present and accessible to all people)."
