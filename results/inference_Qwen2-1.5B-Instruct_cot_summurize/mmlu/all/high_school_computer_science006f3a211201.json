However, when converting this binary number back into decimal form, we get 8. This is because the binary system has only two digits (0 and 1), so every time we add two ones together, we carry over one more digit.\n\nIn this case, since we're using 3 bits to represent our integers, each bit represents a power of 2 (since there are 3 bits total). So, when we convert the binary number 1010 back to decimal, we have:\n\n0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, when we add the decimal numbers 5 and 3, we should get a result of 8, which is 2 in binary. But due to the limitations of the 3-bit integer representation, the actual result is actually 5. \n\nThis is an example of a rounding error or approximation that occurs when working with limited precision representations, such as floating-point numbers used in computers. In this case, the result was rounded down to 5 instead of staying at 8."
