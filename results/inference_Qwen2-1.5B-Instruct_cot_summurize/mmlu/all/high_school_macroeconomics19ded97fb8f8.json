Government planners decide how best to produce goods and services.\n\nIn a centrally planned economic system, decisions about production, distribution, and allocation of resources are made by a central authority, such as a government or party. This means that there is no free market competition, and instead, all economic activities are regulated by the state. In contrast, a market economy allows for private ownership of resources and allows individuals and businesses to make their own decisions about what they produce and sell."
