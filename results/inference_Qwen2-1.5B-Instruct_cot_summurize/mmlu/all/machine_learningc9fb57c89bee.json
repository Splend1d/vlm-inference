True, False\n\nStatement 1 is true because the functional form of the decision boundary of a boosted classifier and its constituent weak learner(s) will indeed be the same. However, statement 2 is false because cross-validation does not directly affect the number of iterations in boosting. Instead, it helps to evaluate how well the model generalizes on unseen data, which indirectly affects the number of iterations needed for convergence during boosting. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect."
