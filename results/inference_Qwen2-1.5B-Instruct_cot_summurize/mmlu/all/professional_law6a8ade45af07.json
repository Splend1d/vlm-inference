                    "text": "A father died leaving a will by which he devised a 100-acre tract to his daughter. At the time of the father's death, he believed that he owned all of the 100-acre tract. However, the father actually owned 95 acres of the tract. The other five acres were owned by a farmer. After taking possession of the tract, the daughter executed and delivered a warranty deed to a buyer, purporting to convey all 100 acres of the tract. The agreed purchase price was $100,000. According to the terms of the sale, the buyer paid the daughter a down payment of $25,000, with the unpaid portion of the purchase price (i. e. , $75,000) secured by a mortgage. The mortgage instrument described the property interest as covering all 100 acres of the tract. After the daughter \u0080\u0094buyer transaction was completed, the farmer came forward and informed the parties that she was the true record owner of five acres of the 100-acre tract. Upon the farmer's threat to sue to quiet title, the daughter negotiated a deal whereby she paid the farmer $5,000 for the five-acre tract. As part of their agreement, the farmer executed and delivered a quitclaim deed quitclaiming to the buyer all of her interest in the five-acre parcel. Thereafter, the buyer defaulted on the mortgage debt, and the daughter properly consummated foreclosure proceedings, becoming the purchaser of the tract at her own foreclosure sale. The description of the deed in the foreclosure sale referred to the tract as consisting of all 100 acres. After the foreclosure sale was finalized, the buyer brought suit claiming title in fee simple to the five-acre tract, formerly owned by the farmer. In an appropriate action to determine the title to the said five-acre tract, the buyer will\n\nA. lose, because the daughter did not have good and marketable title at the time she purported to convey the 100-acre tract to the buyer.\nB. lose, because the doctrine of after-acquired title controls.\nC. win, because the deed from the farmer to the buyer was a quitclaim deed.\nD. win, because the quitclaim deed from the farmer to the buyer was subsequent to the deed from the daughter to the buyer and to the mortgage.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. lose, because the daughter did not have good and marketable title at the time she purported to convey the 100-acre tract to the buyer.\n\nAccording to the law of real estate, when a person acquires land through a conveyance, they must have good and marketable title to the land. Good and marketable title means that the person has clear legal ownership of the land and there are no disputes or encumbrances against it. Marketable title means that the person can easily sell the land and transfer title without any problems.\n\nIn this case, the daughter acquired the 100-acre tract through a conveyance to the buyer, but she did not have good and marketable title to the land. This is because the father only owned 95 acres of the tract, and the other five acres were owned by a farmer who had a claim to them. Therefore, the daughter's conveyance was invalid and lacked good and marketable title.\n\nThe doctrine of after-acquired title does not apply in this situation because the conveyance from the farmer to the buyer occurred before the conveyance from the daughter to the buyer, so the latter cannot be considered an after-acquired conveyance. Additionally, the conveyance from the farmer to the buyer was not subsequent to the conveyance from the daughter to the buyer, so the doctrine of subsequent conveyances does not apply either.\n\nTherefore, the buyer cannot win the title to the five-acre tract based on these grounds."
