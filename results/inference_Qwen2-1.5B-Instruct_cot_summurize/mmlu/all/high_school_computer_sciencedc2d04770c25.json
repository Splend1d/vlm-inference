We can then iterate through the first list, checking each element against the array we created. If an element is found, we append it to the result list.\n\nHere's how the code would look:\n\n```csharp\nbool[] found = new bool[inputList2.Length];\nfor (int i = 0; i < inputList2.Length; i++) {\n    int index = Array.IndexOf(inputList2, inputList1[i]);\n    if (index != -1) {\n        found[index] = true;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAfter running this code, `found` will contain information about whether each element from `inputList1` was found in `inputList2`. We can then use this information to create our final result list:\n\n```csharp\nresultList = new List<int>();\nforeach (int item in inputList1) {\n    if (found[item]) {\n        resultList.Add(item);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will give us a list containing only the elements that appeared in both `inputList1` and `inputList2`, since they have already been checked for duplicates.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Only elements that appear in both inputListl and inputList2."
