However, since there is no mention of any potential harm or damage resulting from this action, it can be assumed that the action is not explicitly morally wrong.\nScenario 2 is not wrong either.\nWatering one's own lawn and charging money for doing so is generally considered to be a charitable act and is often encouraged by neighbors who have been away for a long time. While it may not be ideal to charge someone for watering their lawn, it is not inherently wrong to do so. Additionally, the fact that the person charged for the work was willing to pay suggests that the act is not exploitative or unethical. Therefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 2 is not wrong."
