Regressive.\n\nRegressive taxes are those that tend to fall more heavily on lower-income individuals and families, as they have a higher proportion of their income spent on necessities such as food compared to higher-income individuals. In contrast, progressive taxes increase in amount for higher income levels while regressive taxes decrease. Therefore, a sales tax on food that falls on the lower-income individuals and families would be considered a regressive tax."
