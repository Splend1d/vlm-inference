A population pyramid, also known as an age-sex structure, does not provide information about the impact of wars on the population. This type of visualization helps to show trends in population size over time and can be used to identify demographic shifts such as aging populations, but it does not account for changes due to events like wars or other disasters that affect the population directly."
