After he lets go, the puck continues to travel across the table, coming to rest at position x = 1.2 m. When the puck is at position x = 1.0 m, which of the following is a correct assertion about the net force on the puck?\n\nA. The net force is in the negative direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down.\nB. The net force is down, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s^2 downward.\nC. The net force is in the positive direction, because the student\u2019s push caused the puck to speed up in the positive direction.\nD. The net force is zero, because the student\u2019s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.\n"

                    "text": "The net force on an object depends on its mass and the acceleration due to gravity (g). In this scenario, we can assume that the student's push is the only external force acting on the puck, so the only relevant forces are the normal force (N) and the force of friction (f).\n\nWhen the puck starts moving from x=0 to x=0.2 m, the normal force N causes the puck to accelerate upward with g, while the force of friction f opposes the motion and causes the puck to slow down.\n\nAt x=0.2 m, the puck has traveled a distance of 0.2 m and slowed down to a velocity of v_1. At this point, the normal force N still acts upwards with g, but now the force of friction f also acts downwards with -g.\n\nSince the puck has slowed down from a speed of v_1 to a final velocity v_f, we can use the equation:\n\\[v_f^2 = v_1^2 + 2a \\Delta x\\]\nwhere \\(v_f\\) is the final velocity, \\(v_1\\) is the initial velocity, \\(a\\) is the acceleration, and \\(\\Delta x\\) is the change in position.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\\[v_f^2 = v_1^2 + 2(-g)(0.2)\\]\n\\[v_f^2 = v_1^2 - 0.4g\\]\n\nNow, when the puck reaches x=1.0 m, it has traveled a distance of 1.0 m and stops. The only external force acting on the puck at this point is the force of friction f, which opposes the motion.\n\nAt x=1.0 m, the normal force N still acts upwards with g, but now the force of friction f also acts downwards with -g.\n\nUsing the same equation for the final velocity, we have:\n\\[v_f^2 = v_1^2 + 2(-g)(1.0)\\]\n\\[v_f^2 = v_1^2 - 2g\\]\n\nSince both equations give us the same result (\\(v_f^2 = v_1^2 - 0.4g\\)), the net force on the puck cannot be determined solely based on the information given. However, if we consider the fact that the student's push is constant throughout the motion, then the net force would be the sum of the normal force and the force of friction:\n\n\\[F_{net} = N - f\\]\n\nWe don't know the exact values of N or f, but we do know that the net force should be non-zero since the puck is accelerating.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: The net force is zero, because the student's push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction."
