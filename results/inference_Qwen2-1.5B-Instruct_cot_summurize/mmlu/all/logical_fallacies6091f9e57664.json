According to Jewish tradition, God is the creator of everything, including time, but it is not clear that God created time independently of any other beings or actions. Additionally, the idea that time is an accident of what is moved is not supported by biblical or rabbinic sources. Therefore, this statement appears to be a contradiction or inconsistency."
