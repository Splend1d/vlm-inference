He argued that without a creator or divine being, humans must find their own meaning and purpose in life through their actions and decisions.\n\nTherefore, even if there were no God, it is possible for individuals to develop their own sense of morality and ethical standards based on their beliefs, experiences, and interactions with others. So the answer is C. moral values still exist."
