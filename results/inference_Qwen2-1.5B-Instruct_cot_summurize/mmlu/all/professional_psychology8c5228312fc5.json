Confabulatory responses on the Rorschach test indicate that the examinee may be defensive or deny their own feelings or experiences in order to protect themselves from criticism or rejection. Overgeneralization from a part of an inkblot to the whole suggests that the examinee may have difficulty with self-reflection or may be struggling with understanding their own emotions and thoughts. Brain damage, intellectual disability, or emotional disturbance are not typically associated with such responses."
