Someone repeatedly buzzes his apartment ringer outside the building, but he doesn't answer it because he is very tired and wants to sleep. Later he hears the door to his apartment being kicked in and he is immediately accosted by a man with a gun, who waves the gun at him and says, \"You are getting me your cash or else.\" The man opens his safe and turns over the money. The perpetrator absconds with the money but is picked up by the police a few minutes later. What common law crimes has the perpetrator probably committed?\n\nA. Burglary and attempted murder.\nB. Robbery and attempted murder.\nC. Robbery, burglary and attempted murder.\nD. Robbery and burglary.\n"

Robbery and attempted murder.\n\nRobbery occurs when someone takes another person's property without their consent and force or threat is used to prevent resistance. In this case, the perpetrator entered the man's apartment through an unlocked door and took his money, which constitutes taking property from the man without his consent. Additionally, the man was threatened with violence by the perpetrator before the robbery occurred, which makes the act of taking the money more than just theft.\n\nAssuming that the man did not resist the robber during the commission of the crime (which is possible given the circumstances), the perpetrator also committed attempted murder by using a firearm on the man, even if only as a means of preventing the man from resisting the robbery.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Robbery and attempted murder."
