Bilateral constricted pupils. \n\nThis condition, known as ocular coloblastoma or congenital synechiae, is a neurosurgical emergency because it can cause significant visual impairment if not treated promptly. The condition affects the iris muscles, leading to constricted pupils that do not respond to light. It can also lead to retinal detachment and blindness. Treatment involves surgical intervention to remove the affected eye."
