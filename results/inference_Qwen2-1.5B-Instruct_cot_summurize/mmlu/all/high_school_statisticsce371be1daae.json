If properly designed, observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships just as strongly as properly designed experiments.\n\nObservational studies and controlled experiments are both methods used to investigate the relationship between variables. Observational studies involve collecting data on individuals or groups without manipulating any variables, while controlled experiments manipulate one variable while controlling for others to determine if changes in that variable lead to changes in another variable. Both types of studies can help establish cause-and-effect relationships, but they have different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWhile properly designed experiments can strongly suggest cause-and-effect relationships, a complete census (a survey of every individual) may not be possible due to practical constraints like cost and time. Observational studies can provide valuable information about population characteristics, but they do not allow researchers to manipulate variables. Therefore, it's important to use a combination of both types of studies to get a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between variables.\n\nRegarding D, increasing the sample size in an observational study could potentially strengthen its ability to detect causal effects, as having a larger number of participants increases the likelihood of observing differences that might not otherwise be statistically significant with smaller samples. However, this does not directly address how observational studies can establish cause-and-effect relationships, which requires careful design and analysis."
