We know he baked 6 pies for his family, which means \\(18 - 6 = 12\\) pies were left to be divided among the 4 school fundraisers. This is represented by the equation:\n\n\\[12 + 4p = 18\\]\n\nSimplifying this gives us:\n\n\\[4p = 6\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 4 gives us:\n\n\\[p = \\frac{6}{4}\\]\n\n\\[p = 1.5\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. \\(6+4 \\times p = 18\\)"
