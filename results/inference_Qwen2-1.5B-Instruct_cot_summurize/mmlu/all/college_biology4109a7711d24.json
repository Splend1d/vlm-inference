The symplastic pathway for the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem involves the transport through the phloem parenchyma and the transport through the sieve tubes. The bundle sheath is involved in transporting water and minerals from the xylem to the adjacent cells, while the companion cells transport sugars and other organic compounds between the leaves and the roots."
