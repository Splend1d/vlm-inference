The international system is shaped through colonized discourse that establishes notions of certain states as inferior to others.\n\nPostcolonial theory argues that the global order has been constructed by Western powers through colonial discourse and the imposition of their values on non-Western societies. This colonial discourse often portrays Western nations as superior and non-Western countries as inferior or uncivilized, leading to a hierarchy of cultures and states. This view challenges the idea that Western practices such as free trade and democracy are universally applicable or beneficial for all countries. \n\nTherefore, option A is correct, while options B, C, and D do not align with the core tenets of postcolonial theory."
