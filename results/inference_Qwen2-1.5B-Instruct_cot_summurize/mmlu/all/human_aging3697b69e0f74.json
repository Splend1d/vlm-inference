Congruence\n\nThe idea that the ability to complete a task depends on the fit between the environment and the person undertaking the task is a basic tenet of the congruence theory of aging, which posits that individuals who have a high level of congruency (i.e., a high degree of similarity between their personal characteristics and their environment) tend to age more healthily than those with low levels of congruency.\n\nOther options:\n\nA. Environmental: This refers to the environmental factors that influence an individual's physical and mental well-being, but it does not specifically relate to the concept of congruence as it pertains to aging.\nB. Ecological: This refers to the ecological systems in which an organism lives and interacts with its environment, but it also does not directly address the concept of congruence as it relates to aging.\nC. Fitness: This refers to the overall condition of an individual, which includes both physical fitness and mental capacity, but it does not specifically relate to the concept of congruence as it pertains to aging."
