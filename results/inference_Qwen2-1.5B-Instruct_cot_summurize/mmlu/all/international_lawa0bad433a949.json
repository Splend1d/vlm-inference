Standard-setting means setting certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties. \n\nStandard-setting refers to the process by which states agree on and adopt binding legal standards for protecting human rights. This can involve negotiating agreements between states, such as those found in international human rights treaties like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These standards can then be used by states to ensure that their actions align with these principles.\n\nOption A, putting forward binding legal standards, is not necessarily the function of standard-setting. While it may be part of the process, it does not fully capture the broader goal of setting certain standards of conduct.\n\nOption B, merely proposing binding legal standards, is also incorrect because while it is true that some states may propose new standards without actually binding them, this is not the same as establishing binding standards that must be followed.\n\nOption C, putting forward non-binding legal standards, is not accurate either. While it is possible for states to propose non-binding standards, these do not have the same force as binding standards that require states to comply.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most appropriate answer."
