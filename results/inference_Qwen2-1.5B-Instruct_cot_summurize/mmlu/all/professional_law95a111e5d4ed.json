The nephew and niece are tenants in common for the life of the first of them to die, the nephew and niece have contingent remainders in fee simple defeasible, and the gardener has an executory interest.\n\nThis means that the nephew and niece own the property as tenants in common, with the right to inherit it if one of them dies before the other. However, they do not have any rights to the property after the death of either of them, and the gardener will have an executory interest in the property until it is sold or transferred to someone else."
