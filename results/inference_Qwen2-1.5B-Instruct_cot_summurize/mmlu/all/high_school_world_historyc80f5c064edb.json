That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA.

They allowed individuals to invest in companies without having to own physical property or participate in day-to-day operations. This system was successful in promoting economic growth and innovation, but it did not contribute significantly to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 CE. \n\nWhile other options (such as the exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe) may have played a role in supporting Western European global dominance, they did so through different mechanisms and had less direct impact than joint-stock companies. Similarly, while the refinement of gunpowder technologies was an important step forward for military technology, it did not directly contribute to Western European global hegemony. The development and application of steam-powered technologies also had significant impacts on transportation and industry, but again, they did not play a central role in shaping Western European power dynamics during this period."
