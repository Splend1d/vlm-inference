They had relied on a business attorney in establishing the business. After the business failed, the plaintiff and the defendant disagreed about their respective obligations. At trial, both have hired new counsel. The plaintiff calls the business attorney to testify to representations the defendant made in meetings she had with the plaintiff and the business attorney. The defendant objects to the business attorney's testimony, invoking the attorney-client privilege. Should the court uphold the defendant's privilege claim?\n\nA. No, because the business attorney's professional relationship with the plaintiff and the defendant has ended.\nB. No, because the plaintiff and the defendant consulted the business attorney jointly.\nC. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may block disclosure of statements made during such meetings.\nD. Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may claim the privilege on behalf of the partnership.\n"

Yes, because either the plaintiff or the defendant may claim the privilege on behalf of the partnership.\n\nUnder the doctrine of joint tenancy, each partner in a partnership is considered an owner of the partnership property and has a right to share in its profits and losses. This means that if one partner makes a decision to disclose information or take action based on a statement made by another partner, the other partners can claim the privilege as well. Therefore, even though the business attorney's professional relationship with the plaintiff and the defendant has ended, the partnership itself retains the right to claim the privilege."
