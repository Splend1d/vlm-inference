In other words, a moral agent should only perform an action if it can be performed without causing any harm or suffering to anyone else, and if it could be universally applied to all humans.\n\nTherefore, Kantianism would consider using someone as a mere means unethical because it involves treating them as nothing more than a tool or means to achieve one's own ends, rather than respecting their autonomy and rationality.\n\nOn the other hand, consequentialism, utilitarianism, and natural law theory do not focus on the use of individuals as mere means; instead, they emphasize the consequences of actions and the overall happiness or well-being produced by those actions. Therefore, these theories would not apply directly to the concept of using someone as a mere means."
