We know from the problem statement that \\(x = \\frac{25}{30} \\times 150\\).\n\nFirst, simplify the fraction:\n\\[x = \\frac{25}{30} \\times 150 = \\frac{5}{6} \\times 150\\]\n\nNow, multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\) to solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[x = (150)(\\frac{6}{5}) = 30(6) = 180\\]\n\nTherefore, Pat will bounce the ball approximately 180 times in 150 seconds.\n\nThe correct answer is **C. 144**."
