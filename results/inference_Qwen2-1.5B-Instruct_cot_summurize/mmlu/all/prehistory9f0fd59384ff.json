This statement is not necessarily true, as it depends on the specific location and time period being referred to. Some Indus Valley cities may have had well-planned layouts with carefully constructed buildings and structures, while others may have been more chaotic and disorganized. Additionally, the construction materials used could vary depending on the availability of resources at the time. Therefore, without more information about the specific city in question, it is impossible to say for certain whether or not this statement is true."
