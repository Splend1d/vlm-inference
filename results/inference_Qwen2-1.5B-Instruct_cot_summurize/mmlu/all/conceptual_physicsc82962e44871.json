However, when approaching the listener, the siren may have a higher pitch due to the increased distance between the source and the listener, which can make the sound appear louder.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be either B (frequency) or C (both of these), depending on whether the increase in pitch is considered an \"increase\" or not. In this case, it would likely be considered an \"increase,\" as the sound is becoming more distinct and potentially more intimidating as it gets closer to the listener."
