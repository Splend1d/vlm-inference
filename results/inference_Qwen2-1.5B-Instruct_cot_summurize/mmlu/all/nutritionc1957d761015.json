Fast contractile speed\n\nType IIb fibers, also known as fast-twitch muscles, have high motor unit recruitment and are characterized by their slow contraction rate and low force production capacity. They are best suited for activities that require sustained effort or endurance, such as long-distance running, cycling, and swimming. Type IIb fibers have a lower oxidative capacity than Type I fibers due to their reliance on anaerobic metabolism during exercise. However, they do have higher fatigue resistance compared to Type I fibers."
