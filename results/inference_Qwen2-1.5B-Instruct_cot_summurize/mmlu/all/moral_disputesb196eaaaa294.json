This means that the SCNT individual is not genetically identical to its parent, but rather has some unique genetic material that is different from both parents. In contrast, in a normal sexual reproduction process, both parents contribute their genetic material to create offspring with a mix of genetic traits from each parent. Therefore, option A is correct: the SCNT individual has genetic material primarily from one person instead of two."
