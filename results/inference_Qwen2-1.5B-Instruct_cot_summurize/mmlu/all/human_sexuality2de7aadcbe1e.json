Reproduction\n\nSociobiologists believe that the primary function of sex in human societies is to facilitate reproductive success and ensure the continuation of the species through procreation. This belief is based on the idea that humans have evolved to mate with others who share genetic similarities, which helps to increase the chances of successful offspring. Therefore, the central function of sex is to support and promote reproduction."
