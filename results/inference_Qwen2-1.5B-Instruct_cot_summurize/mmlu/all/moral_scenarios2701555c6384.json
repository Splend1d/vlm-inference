This action goes against the principles of respect and responsibility towards others, as it involves intentionally harming someone else without their consent or intention.\nOn the other hand, Scenario 2, where the main character gives the students an F for the semester for answering the questions correctly, may not necessarily go against ordinary moral standards if the grading criteria are clear and consistent. However, if there is any doubt about whether the grading was fair or justifiable, then it could potentially be seen as morally wrong.\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
