False, False\n\nStatement 1 is false because if $K$ is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, it does not necessarily imply that $K$ itself is free abelian. A subgroup can be non-abelian even when the original group is free abelian.\n\nStatement 2 is also false because the quotient group $G/K$ is indeed free abelian. This is a direct consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups (which states that every finitely generated abelian group is a direct sum of cyclic groups). When you divide by a subgroup in an abelian group, you effectively reduce the size of the group and preserve its structure as an abelian group."
