All of the above\n\nHieroglyphics is the name given to the ancient Egyptian script, which dates back over 3000 years and has been used for religious and administrative purposes by the Egyptians for much of that time. It was not just a pictographic system, but also developed gradually over many centuries through a series of different forms. Hieroglyphics was indeed one of the earliest forms of writing known, although it predates the more well-known cuneiform script used by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia. The fact that hieroglyphics was still being used in Egypt long after other scripts had fallen out of use also suggests that it continued to be an important means of communication and record-keeping throughout this period. Therefore, all of these statements are correct in describing the Egyptian system of hieroglyphics."
