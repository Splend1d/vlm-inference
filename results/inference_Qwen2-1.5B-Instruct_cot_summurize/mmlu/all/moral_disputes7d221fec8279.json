Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that aims to help individuals identify and change negative thought patterns, beliefs, and behaviors that contribute to their emotional distress or psychological problems. By helping clients recognize and challenge their own faulty thinking, CBT can help them develop more realistic and adaptive ways of thinking about themselves and the world around them. This process is often referred to as \"cognitive restructuring,\" which involves identifying and challenging irrational or maladaptive thoughts and replacing them with more balanced and positive ones. CBT has been shown to be effective in treating a variety of mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and eating disorders."
