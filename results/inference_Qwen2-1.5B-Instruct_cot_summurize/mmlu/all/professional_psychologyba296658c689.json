However, generally speaking, if a selection test is valid and reliable, it should not discriminate against any particular racial group. If there is no evidence that the test is biased or discriminatory, then it can be assumed that it does not discriminate based on race. Additionally, if the test is designed to measure job-related skills and abilities, rather than personal characteristics such as race, then it may not be considered discriminatory. It is important to note that these are general guidelines and individual cases may require more detailed analysis."
