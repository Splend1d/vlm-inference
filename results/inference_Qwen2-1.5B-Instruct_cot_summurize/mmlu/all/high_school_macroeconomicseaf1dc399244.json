Higher consumer prices and a misallocation of resources away from efficient producers.\n\nAn import quota is a policy tool used by governments to limit the quantity of certain goods that can be imported into their country. This can lead to higher prices for these imported goods, as domestic producers may not have enough production capacity to meet the demand created by the quota. As a result, consumers may face higher prices for the imported goods they purchase. Additionally, if the quota is applied to a product that is an important part of the economy's output (such as food or energy), it could lead to a misallocation of resources away from efficient producers who might otherwise have been able to produce this good domestically. However, there may also be some positive effects, such as reduced imports and potential savings on tariffs, but these benefits would likely be offset by increased consumer prices and the resulting distortion of the market."
