The mall has a Social Security Office and the real estate is owned by the state. The grocery store pays rent to the state. Any type of picketers are prevented from entering the mall to picket inside by the owners of the mall, who also pay rent to the state for the land, and there is no outside entrance of the store at the mall where the picketers could strike. If the picketers go before the court to claim violations of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, will state action likely be found against the store and the mall owners?\n\nA. No, under the mantle of authority test there are not enough connections between the state and the private actions of the mall and the store.\nB. No, because a private actor can never be held liable in a constitutional rights claim that requires state action.\nC. Yes, because the equal protection balancing test shows that there is state action in renting the property to private actors who are discriminating.\nD. Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.\n"

Yes, because First Amendment violations require strict scrutiny, and here the connection between the state and the mall cloaks the mall and store with state action status.\n\nThe court would likely find that the mall and store are part of a larger public forum created by the government, which allows for expressive activity without requiring any special permission or regulation. In this case, the mall and store are simply acting as landlords, paying rent to the state for their use of the property. Therefore, they cannot be held liable for violating the First Amendment rights of those seeking to protest on their premises.\n\nAdditionally, the Equal Protection Clause may apply, as the mall and store have treated all tenants equally in terms of rent payments and other business dealings. This could potentially support an argument that the mall and store are being treated differently based on their political beliefs, leading to a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nHowever, the strict scrutiny standard applies, meaning that the court must evaluate whether the restrictions placed on the mall and store are necessary to serve a compelling governmental interest and are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. In this scenario, the interests served by preventing picketing on the mall's premises (preserving the peaceful enjoyment of the mall) and the narrow tailoring of the restrictions placed on the mall (preventing picketing) may justify the restrictions placed on the mall and store."
