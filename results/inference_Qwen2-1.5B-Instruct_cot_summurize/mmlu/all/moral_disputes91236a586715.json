According to this philosophy, a moral right is justified if it contributes to the overall well-being of society. Therefore, a utilitarian would argue that a moral right is one that is justified by the fact that its recognition will contribute to the maximization of overall welfare.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that a moral right is justified by the fact that its recognition will not diminish overall welfare, which is not necessarily true in all cases. For example, some rights may be necessary for basic human needs such as food, shelter, and safety, even though they do not directly contribute to overall welfare.\n\nOption A is also incorrect because it suggests that there are no moral rights, which is not true according to most ethical theories. Many ethical theories recognize certain moral rights, such as the right to life, liberty, and property.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
