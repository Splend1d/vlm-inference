                    "text": "C. The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis.\n\nNet primary productivity (NPP) refers to the total amount of carbon fixed by primary producers, such as plants, during a specific time period. This NPP can vary greatly between different ecosystems due to differences in climate, soil type, and other environmental factors. In general, warmer climates tend to support higher rates of photosynthesis due to increased light availability and temperature conditions that facilitate enzyme activity necessary for photosynthesis.\n\nIn contrast, cooler climates typically result in slower rates of photosynthesis because they are less favorable for these processes. Therefore, it stands to reason that regions with higher temperatures would have higher NPP compared to those with colder climates. \n\nThe tropics are characterized by high temperatures year-round, which supports higher rates of photosynthesis compared to temperate or arctic regions. Additionally, tropical rainforests are often characterized by high levels of rainfall throughout the year, which further enhances the ability of plants to photosynthesize efficiently. These combined effects contribute to an overall trend of increasing NPP towards the tropics."
