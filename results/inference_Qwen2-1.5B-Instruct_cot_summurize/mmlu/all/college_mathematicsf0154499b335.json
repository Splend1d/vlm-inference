True, False. \n\nStatement 1 is true because if A is connected, then it means that A can be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets U and V such that A = U \u222a V. The closure of A, denoted by cl(A), is defined as the union of A and its limit points. Since A is connected, all its limit points lie in A, so cl(A) = A. Therefore, cl(A) is also connected.\n\nStatement 2 is false because there exist continuous functions on unbounded intervals like (0, 1) or [0, 1] that do not have any fixed points. For example, consider the function f(x) = x + 1/2 for x \u2208 (0, 1). This function is continuous on (0, 1) but does not have any fixed points since every point in (0, 1) is an accumulation point of {x + 1/2 | x \u2208 (0, 1)}. Similarly, we can find continuous functions on other unbounded intervals that do not have any fixed points."
