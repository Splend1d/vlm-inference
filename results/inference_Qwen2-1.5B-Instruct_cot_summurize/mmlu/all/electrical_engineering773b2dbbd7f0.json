                    "text": "The relationship between Faraday's Law (also known as the Faraday-Bernstein equation) and Ohm's law is not directly proportional or inversely proportional, but rather they describe two different phenomena in electricity.\n\nFaraday's Law states that for every volt of voltage applied across an electric circuit, there will be a rate of change of charge passing through the circuit. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n\n\u0394Q = \u03b5\u0394t\n\nWhere:\n- \u0394Q is the change in charge,\n- \u03b5 is the emf (electromotive force),\n- \u0394t is the time interval over which the change occurs.\n\nOhm's Law, on the other hand, describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. It states that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it:\n\nV = IR\n\nWhere:\n- V is the voltage,\n- I is the current,\n- R is the resistance.\n\nSo, while Faraday's Law and Ohm's Law both involve the relationship between voltage and current, they do so using different units - Faraday's Law uses changes in charge per unit time, and Ohm's Law uses voltage per current.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. None of these."
