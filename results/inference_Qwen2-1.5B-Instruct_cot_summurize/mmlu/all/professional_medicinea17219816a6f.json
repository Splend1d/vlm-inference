She remembers injuring the knee while playing soccer last week, but she was able to finish the game. She has no history of rash or joint pain. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination of the right knee shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is limited. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Nuclear scan of the right knee\nB. MRI of the right knee\nC. Antibiotic therapy\nD. Arthrocentesis\n"

Antibiotic therapy\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management would be antibiotic therapy as the patient presents with symptoms consistent with an infection, such as fever and swelling of the right knee. Without additional information about the specific type of infection, it is difficult to determine which antibiotics would be most effective. However, if the patient does not respond well to initial treatment, further testing such as a nuclear scan or MRI may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of the symptoms. Arthrocentesis is not typically performed for this type of presentation."
