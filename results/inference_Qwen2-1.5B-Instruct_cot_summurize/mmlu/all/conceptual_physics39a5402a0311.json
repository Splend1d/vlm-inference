The gun itself also experiences an acceleration as it pushes the ball forward. These forces act in opposite directions, causing the cannonball to be pushed backward and the gun to recoil. Therefore, both the cannonball and the cannon experience equal accelerations. \n\nAdditionally, since the cannonball is being accelerated by the gun's recoil, there will be an equal amount of force acting on the cannonball as well, which causes the cannon to recoil."
