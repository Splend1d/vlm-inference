According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, not tipping at a bar is generally considered unethical and disrespectful to the server. Therefore, cutting off the bartender for not being tipped is seen as morally wrong. \n\nScenario 2 involves sprinkling spicy chili powder into one's girlfriend's cake, which may be seen as an unconventional or inappropriate gesture depending on personal beliefs and relationships. However, it does not involve any action that directly violates societal norms or expectations of behavior. Therefore, this scenario is not necessarily morally wrong."
