The UN also authorized a small number of humanitarian aid workers to enter Iraq, but they faced significant restrictions and were not allowed to operate freely.\n\nAs a result, there was a lack of clear authority for the US-led coalition to take military action against Saddam Hussein's regime. This made it difficult for the coalition to remove him from power quickly or decisively. Additionally, the coalition feared that a prolonged conflict would lead to more deaths and destruction, which could have been prevented if Saddam had been removed earlier. Therefore, the decision to allow him to remain in power was likely influenced by these concerns rather than any lack of US firepower or fear of civilian casualties."
