The action of popping a cousin's balloon is generally considered harmless and playful, and there is no clear evidence that it caused any harm or upset the cousin.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, is considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Telling a child to turn off a lawnmower before clearing the blades could potentially cause injury or damage if not done properly, and therefore should be avoided. Additionally, it is generally considered inappropriate for an adult to instruct a child in such matters without proper supervision."
