Examination of the tongue reveals wasting and fasciculation. Decreased deep tendon reflexes and fasciculation are noted in the left lower extremity. The deep tendon reflexes of the left upper extremity are hyperactive. The most likely diagnosis is\n\nA. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nB. Friedreich ataxia\nC.

This results in muscle weakness and loss of coordination over time.\n\nFriedreich Ataxia is another condition characterized by motor neuron degeneration, but it typically affects only one side of the body and is more common among males than females.\n\nPick Disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder caused by mutations in the PRKN gene. It primarily affects the basal ganglia and cerebellum, leading to Parkinsonism and other neurological abnormalities.\n\nProgressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare infection of the central nervous system that causes inflammation of the white matter in the brain and spinal cord. It can affect any part of the brain or spinal cord and usually occurs after organ transplantation or chemotherapy.\n\nBased on these characteristics, the most likely diagnosis for this patient would be Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), given its typical presentation of difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and muscle weakness."
