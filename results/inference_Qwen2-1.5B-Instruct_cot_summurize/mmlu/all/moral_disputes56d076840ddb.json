This means that in order to fulfill this duty, one must consider the consequences of their actions on others and strive to produce happiness for them. This includes not only the well-being of those around us but also the overall well-being of society as a whole. Therefore, the goal of producing happiness is a very important one when fulfilling the categorical imperative."
