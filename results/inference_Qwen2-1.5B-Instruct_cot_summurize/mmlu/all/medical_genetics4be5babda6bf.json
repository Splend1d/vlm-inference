                    "text": "None of the given options are correct.\n\nA. Some exons in protein-coding genes consist of noncoding DNA: This statement is incorrect. Exons are segments of DNA that are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translated into proteins. Noncoding DNA refers to regions of DNA that do not code for proteins or other functional RNA molecules.\n\nB. The first exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the translational start site: This statement is also incorrect. While it's true that the first few nucleotides of an mRNA transcript typically encode the amino acid sequence of the first amino acid in the polypeptide chain, this does not necessarily mean that the entire first exon contains the translation start site. In fact, the first exon may be flanked by intronic sequences that are not involved in transcription or translation.\n\nC. The last exon of a protein-coding gene always contains the normal termination codon: This statement is also incorrect. The last exon of a protein-coding gene does not always contain the normal termination codon. Depending on the gene and its regulatory elements, some exons may be deleted or modified, leading to changes in the length and composition of the final exon.\n\nD. A coding exon is always translated in just one of the three possible forward reading frames: This statement is incorrect as well. It is true that most genes have two coding exons, each with its own set of upstream intronic sequences, but these exons can be translated in more than one way depending on the direction of transcription. For example, in eukaryotic cells, the mRNA transcript can be translated in either the 5'\u21923' direction or the 3'\u21925' direction, leading to different proteins being produced from the same DNA template. Additionally, the choice between translating the mRNA transcript in one direction or the other can depend on the specific regulatory mechanisms present within the cell."
