With the permission bf the husband, the attorney's law clerk also sat in on the consultation to see how the attorney conducted these meetings. Shortly after this initial consultation with the attorney, the secretary quit. During the divorce trial, the wife's attorney seeks to call the secretary to testify about what the husband told the attorney during the initial client consultation. Upon objection, the secretary's proposed testimony will most likely be\n\nA. admissible, because her presence during the meeting destroyed the attorney-client privilege.\nB. admissible, because the law clerk's presence during the meeting destroyed the attorney- client privilege.\nC. inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege disqualifies the secretary from testifying to such confidential communications.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

In this case, the only exception that might apply is if the secretary's testimony would tend to prove or disprove a fact in issue in the case and is relevant to establishing the truth of the matter asserted. However, even then, the lawyer must have a good faith belief that the information was communicated to him by the client during the initial consultation, which did not happen here. Therefore, the secretary's testimony would not be admissible under any recognized exception."
