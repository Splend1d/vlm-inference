The LCM of two numbers is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n\nGiven \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5\\) and \\(-8 = -2^3 \\times 1\\), their LCM modulo \\(26\\) would be:\n\n\\[2^2 \\times 5 \\equiv 4 \\times 5 \\equiv 20 \\pmod{26}\\]\n\n\\[(-2)^3 \\times 1 \\equiv (-8) \\equiv 9 \\pmod{26}\\]\n\nThus, the product \\(20 \\times (-8)\\) can be computed as follows:\n\n\\[20 \\times (-8) = 4 \\times 9 = 36\\]\n\nHowever, since our goal is to find the correct option from the choices provided, let's calculate directly without resorting to modular arithmetic for brevity:\n\n\\[20 \\times (-8) = 160\\]\n\n\\[160 \\div 26 = 6...4\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is not listed among the options you provided. Given the direct calculation, it seems there was a misunderstanding or oversight regarding the nature of the problem presented. If you meant to ask about finding the multiplicative inverse of \\(20\\) modulo \\(26\\), which is not directly related to the question at hand, please clarify your intent so I may assist correctly."
