A low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features. \n\nHaematemesis, or vomit containing blood, can be caused by a variety of conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), stomach cancer, or bleeding disorders. However, it's important to note that other factors like alcohol consumption or certain medications can also cause haematemesis without any underlying gastrointestinal pathology.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nB. A pulse rate of 80/min in a patient taking Bisoprolol is reassuring.\nThis statement could be true if Bisoprolol is used for hypertension management. However, it does not directly relate to haematemesis. It might be related to the fact that Bisoprolol has been shown to lower heart rate and blood pressure, which can help with these symptoms. \n\nC. Abdominal pain is always present.\nAbdominal pain is usually associated with gastrointestinal diseases but may not necessarily indicate haematemesis. It's possible that the abdominal pain is unrelated to the haematemesis or it could be due to other causes.\n\nD. An alcohol history is not essential.\nWhile having an alcohol history might increase the risk of developing certain gastrointestinal issues, it doesn't directly correlate with haematemesis. The presence of haematemesis often indicates bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. However, if there is no other known reason for the haematemesis, then it could be related to the alcohol intake."
