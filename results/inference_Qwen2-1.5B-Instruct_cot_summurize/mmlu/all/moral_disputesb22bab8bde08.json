                    "text": "The principle of utility, as proposed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, states that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people. This can be seen as a straightforward and simple concept, but it also raises some ethical questions.\n\nOne common objection to utilitarianism is that the principle is too demanding because it requires individuals to make difficult choices based on what will bring about the most overall good. For example, a doctor might have to choose between saving one person who needs immediate medical attention or many people who could potentially benefit from a longer wait for treatment. Similarly, a politician may have to decide whether to pursue policies that benefit their constituents now, even if they do not necessarily lead to long-term benefits for everyone.\n\nAnother concern with utilitarianism is that it is too easy to satisfy, which means that there may be situations where actions that harm others are justified in order to achieve greater overall happiness. For example, a company may prioritize profits over worker safety in order to increase shareholder value. This can be seen as a form of moral relativism, where different cultures and societies may have different standards for what constitutes acceptable behavior.\n\nTherefore, option D (none of the above) is not correct. Option A (too complicated) is partially correct, as the principle of utility involves complex calculations and considerations. Option C (too easy to satisfy) is incorrect, as the principle seeks to maximize overall happiness, which is a challenging goal."
