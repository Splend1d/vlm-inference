Providing alternative formats such as text-based options or larger font sizes could help address this issue.\n\nOption B: Less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet. This means that many older adults may not have the technology or knowledge necessary to navigate the internet effectively. Providing accessible and user-friendly websites or mobile apps can help ensure that they can access the information they need.\n\nOption C: The internet is aimed at younger people. While this may be true in some cases, there are also many resources available specifically designed for older adults, such as senior centers, community centers, and government agencies that provide information and support services.\n\nTherefore, all of the above reasons suggest that careful consideration should be given to providing information sources for people aged over 65 on the internet, even if they may face some challenges."
