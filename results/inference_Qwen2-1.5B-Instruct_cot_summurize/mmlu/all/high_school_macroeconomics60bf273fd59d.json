Real GDP rises but the change in the price level is uncertain.\n\nThis is because when both short-run aggregate supply (SRSAS) and aggregate demand (AD) increase, it means that there is an excess demand for goods and services. This excess demand can lead to inflation if the quantity supplied does not keep up with the increased demand. In this case, the price level may rise, but the change in real GDP will depend on how much the quantity supplied increases relative to the amount demanded.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it implies that the price level would necessarily rise while real GDP falls, which is not necessarily true given the conditions described above.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because it assumes that both the price level and real GDP would rise, which contradicts the information provided about the relationship between SRSAS and AD.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because it suggests that the price level would rise but the change in real GDP is uncertain, which again goes against the information provided about the relationship between SRSAS and AD."
