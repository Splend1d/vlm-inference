Cardiac failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood throughout the body, leading to low oxygen levels and other complications that can affect the brain and other vital organs. These symptoms can also indicate other serious conditions such as stroke or aneurysm, but they are most commonly associated with cardiac failure."
