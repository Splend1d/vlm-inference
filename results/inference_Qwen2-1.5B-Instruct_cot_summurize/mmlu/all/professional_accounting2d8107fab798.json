This is because these revenues represent direct costs associated with providing public goods and services to citizens.\n\nProgram revenues, on the other hand, refer to funds received specifically for specific programs or projects that have been authorized by law or budgeted by elected officials. They are not directly related to charges for services but rather reflect funding dedicated to specific purposes."
