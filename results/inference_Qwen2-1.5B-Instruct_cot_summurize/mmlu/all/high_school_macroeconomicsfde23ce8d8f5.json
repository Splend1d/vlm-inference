The federal government spends less money.\n\nWhen the federal government spends less money, it reduces the amount of money that is available for circulation in the economy. This leads to a decrease in the money supply. \n\nOption A (the FED lowering the discount rate) and option D (the FED lowering reserve requirements) can both increase the money supply by encouraging banks to lend more money. Option B (the FED selling government securities in the secondary market) decreases the money supply because it reduces the amount of money that banks have to lend out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
