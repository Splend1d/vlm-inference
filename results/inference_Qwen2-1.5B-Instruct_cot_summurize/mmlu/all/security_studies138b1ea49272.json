Gender security is essentially an extension of the way in which we conceptualize the international political system. The analysis of gender security relations has only been made possible by the expansion of the traditional military definition of security in which national security in anarchical international society was the exclusive province of the male.\nB. To study gender security is to focus on the role of adult women in modern warfare, including industries related to warfare, and their inclusion or exclusion from combat roles.\nC. The issue of gender and security is understood as the practical conceptualization of ways in which women have a role in security related issues, and their relative inclusion and exclusion in military conflict and militarization.\nD. The study of gender and of gender security issues is a complex task, and both terms elude a uniform definition. The concept of gender security broadens terms of security beyond the military sector to also include 'human security'.\n"

This view is not entirely accurate, as gender security encompasses a broader range of topics such as economic security, social security, and environmental security.\n\nOption B focuses on the role of adult women in modern warfare and their inclusion/exclusion in combat roles. While this is important, it does not fully capture the complexity of gender security issues.\n\nOption C captures the essence of what gender security means: the understanding of how women's roles and experiences intersect with security-related issues, and their inclusion/exclusion in military conflicts and militarization.\n\nOption D is true in that gender security extends beyond the military sphere to encompass various aspects of human security, but it oversimplifies the concept by limiting it to just \"human security.\"\n\nIn summary, while all options are partially accurate, they do not capture the full scope of gender security. Gender security is a multifaceted concept that encompasses various domains and perspectives, including military, economic, social, and environmental security."
