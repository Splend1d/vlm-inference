Long-term expression: Adenoviruses can express genes for an extended period of time after injection into the body, potentially allowing for sustained treatment over longer periods of time compared to other viral vectors such as lentiviruses or adeno-associated viruses (AAVs).\n  B. Low risk of insertional mutagenesis: Adenoviruses have a relatively low risk of integrating into the host genome and causing insertional mutagenesis, which is a potential concern with some other viral vectors.\n  C. Low immunogenicity: Adenoviruses are generally considered to be less immunogenic than some other viral vectors, making them less likely to provoke an immune response in the host organism.\n  D. Easy assembly: Adenoviruses are typically easier to assemble and produce compared to some other viral vectors.\n\nThese factors make adenoviruses attractive for use in gene therapy applications where long-term expression and low immunogenicity are important considerations."
