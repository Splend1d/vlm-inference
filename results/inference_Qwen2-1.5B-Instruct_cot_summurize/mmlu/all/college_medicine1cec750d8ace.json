She observes a sharp rise in membrane potential when she first stimulates them, the the difference of 100mV. When she tries another stimulation immediately after the first, there is no response. However, when she increase the amount of voltage she supplies to the second shock, she observes a similar response to the first. What time period of stimulation would the second shock be characterized in regards to membrane potential?\n\nA. Depolarization\nB. Repolarization\nC. Hyperpolarization\nD. Resting potential\n"

This suggests that the neuron's membrane potential has undergone a change from resting to depolarized state. Therefore, the second shock can be characterized as a depolarization event."
