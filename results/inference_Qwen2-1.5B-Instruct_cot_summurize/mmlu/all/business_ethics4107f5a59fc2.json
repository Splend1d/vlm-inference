Interest, Certain, Speculative, Intangible assets.\nIslamic finance prohibits the charging or payment of interest (riba) and other forms of speculative investments. It also requires that all financial products be backed by tangible assets such as real estate, gold, or cash. This helps to ensure that the money invested is not used for purposes that go against Islamic principles, such as gambling or speculation. Additionally, the prohibition on certain types of investments helps to prevent conflicts of interest and ensures that the funds are used for the benefit of the community as a whole rather than just a select few."
