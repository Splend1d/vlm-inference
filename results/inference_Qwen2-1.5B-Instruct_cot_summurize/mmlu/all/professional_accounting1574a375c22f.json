Current year's depreciation expense was erroneously understated.\n\nThis explanation suggests that there may have been an error in calculating or recording the depreciation expense for the current year, resulting in an underestimation of the amount of depreciation recorded. This could be due to various reasons such as errors in estimating the useful life of the assets, incorrect accounting policies, or inaccuracies in the depreciation method used. By questioning management about this issue, the auditor can gain insight into potential misstatements and take appropriate action to correct them."
