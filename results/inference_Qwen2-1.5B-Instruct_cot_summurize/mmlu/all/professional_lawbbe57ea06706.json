The Fourteenth Amendment applies this principle to the states, ensuring that religious discrimination is prohibited by the federal government even if the state has laws that may violate the same principles.\n\nIn this case, the state statute allocates funds to pay for half of the salaries of teachers in private schools, regardless of whether they are public or private. This creates a financial incentive for these schools to adhere to certain standards set by the U.S. Department of Education, which could potentially lead to a religious mission or ideology being imposed on the school's curriculum, teaching methods, and administrative practices. Therefore, it would be considered an establishment of religion under the Establishment Clause.\n\nThe statute also seems to have no secular purpose, as it appears to favor one type of school over another based on their adherence to educational standards. It is thus unconstitutional as applied under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment."
