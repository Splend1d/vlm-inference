He wrote mainly about consumer issues, while acting like a watchdog exposing wrongdoers. He wrote one article about a female preacher with a local church that had no affiliations and only a local blog on the internet. He wrote that she was \"conspiring with the devil\" to figure out \"how to lead people's minds astray\" and to live a nice \"sheltered role of pure moral superiority at the expense of inferiors\" like himself and his readers. He called the woman's fashion Medieval and her hair style was like a bag of \"hot wires ready to electrocute anyone who dares come too close.\" The preacher was not amused, and she filed a defamation action claiming libel per se and demanding damages along with an injunction against the web site. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, because the defendant was expressing opinions more than factual assertions, and opinions in this context are constitutionally protected.\nB. Yes, because statements about religious beliefs or practices cannot be the subject of private defamation actions.\nC. No, because the preacher's allegations are based on serious factual distortions that will destroy her career if she doesn't get protection.\nD. No, because a defamation action cannot be subject to a motion to dismiss \u0080\u0093 the plaintiff is always entitled to present evidence to prove the tort.\n"

While the defendant's statements were certainly opinion-based, they also made specific factual claims about the preacher's alleged activities and conduct. These claims could potentially be proven false, which would constitute libel per se. Additionally, the defendant's statement about the preacher's fashion and hairstyle could be seen as a form of slander, which is also actionable under the law. Therefore, it is possible that the court may find that the plaintiff has a valid case for libel per se and will not grant the motion to dismiss."
