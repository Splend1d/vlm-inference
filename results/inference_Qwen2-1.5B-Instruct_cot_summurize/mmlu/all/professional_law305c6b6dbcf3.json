The teenager, 18 years old and 6 feet 3 inches tall, said a very short man placed a knife against her throat and unzipped her dress as she was walking down the street. She pulled a gun from her purse and shot him. The man died of a chest wound. Police said the man, who was 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 130 pounds, was an ex-felon, twice convicted of attempted rape. The teenager is charged with the murder of the man, as a result of the above described incident. At trial, the teenager wishes to offer evidence of the fact that the man was previously convicted of attempted rape. The evidence would be\n\nA. admissible, because it proves the man's disposition to commit rape.\nB. admissible, because the victim's prior convictions would be relevant on the issue of the defendant's self-defense.\nC. inadmissible, because the evidence is being used to prove propensity.\nD. inadmissible, because it violates the Dead Man's Statute.\n"

One exception allows evidence of a person's propensity to commit crime for purposes of defense only if the defendant has had a prior conviction for the same or similar offense. In this case, the woman has no prior conviction for attempted rape, so the evidence cannot be admitted under this exception.\n\nAnother exception allows evidence of a person's propensity to commit crime when the defendant has committed the specific act that is alleged to constitute a pattern of behavior indicating propensity. However, this exception also requires that there have been other acts by the defendant that indicate propensity.\n\nIn this case, there were no other acts by the defendant that indicate propensity, so the evidence cannot be admitted under this exception either.\n\nTherefore, the only exception that might allow the evidence to be admitted is the \"self-defense\" exception, but even then, the evidence must be limited to showing that the defendant acted in self-defense. The evidence about the man's prior conviction for attempted rape would not be relevant to the issue of self-defense.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C: Inadmissible, because the evidence is being used to prove propensity."
