Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, plays an important role in the synthesis of thymidylate, which is a precursor for DNA synthesis and repair. It also participates in the metabolism of amino acids, including the conversion of amino acids to amine neurotransmitters. Vitamin B6 is not involved in the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine or the carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate."
