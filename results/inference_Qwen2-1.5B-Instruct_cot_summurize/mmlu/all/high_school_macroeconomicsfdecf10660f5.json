Resource misallocation due to inflation. \n\nMenu costs refer to the opportunity cost of not using the resources in a particular way, which can be influenced by factors such as inflation and economic conditions. Inflation can lead to an increase in prices for goods and services, making it more expensive to purchase certain items or services. This can result in resource misallocation, where individuals or businesses may allocate their resources towards cheaper alternatives rather than higher-priced options. For example, if food prices rise due to inflation, consumers may choose to buy cheaper fast food instead of cooking at home."
