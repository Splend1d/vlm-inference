It goes against the principle of treating others with respect and consideration, as it involves using another person's vulnerability for personal satisfaction. This action could potentially lead to harm or suffering for the children involved, which is a violation of ethical norms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
