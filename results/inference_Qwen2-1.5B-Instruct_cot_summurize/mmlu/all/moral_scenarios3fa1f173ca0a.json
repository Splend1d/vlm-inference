However, it's generally considered impolite or wasteful to bring home so much without needing all of them.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is cutting and dividing the baby, which is not only cruel but also potentially harmful if done incorrectly, such as causing choking. This action goes against the basic principles of respect and kindness towards others, especially children."
