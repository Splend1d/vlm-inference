The physical health of armed forces is a paramount concern within the traditional security paradigm, and the threat of disease is exacerbated by the physical and sociological conditions under which military personal operate, particularly during combat.\nB. The innate human fear of microbes makes them particularly amenable to being portrayed not just as important health issues, but as national-security threats as well.\nC. Diseases that traditionally affect certain regions of the world, due to their epidemiologic nature or for socio-economic reasons, are increasingly perceived by national governments as potential threats as a result of globalisation.\nD. All of these options.\n"

Physical health of armed forces: The physical condition of soldiers is crucial for their ability to carry out their duties effectively. In times of conflict, soldiers may be exposed to hazardous environments where they could be at risk of contracting infectious diseases. Therefore, ensuring the health and safety of troops is essential for maintaining national security.\n\nB. Fear of microbes: As mentioned earlier, humans have an innate fear of microbes, which can make them more susceptible to the spread of infectious diseases. This fear can lead to increased surveillance and control measures, such as quarantine and border controls, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nC. Globalization: With the rise of globalization, infectious diseases have become more transmissible across borders. National governments must consider the impact of infectious diseases on international relations and the need to protect their citizens from potential health risks posed by other countries.\n\nD. All of these options: All of these factors contribute to the recognition of the importance of considering security dimensions of infectious diseases in the national security framework. By addressing the security implications of infectious diseases, governments can better prepare for and respond to emerging threats, maintain public health, and protect national interests."
