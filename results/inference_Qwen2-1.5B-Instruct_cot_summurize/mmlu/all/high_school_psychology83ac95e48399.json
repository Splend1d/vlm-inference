This type of sample would provide the most representative picture of male college students as it includes a diverse range of institutions and individuals with varying backgrounds and characteristics.\n\nOption A, which consists of thirty fraternity brothers from Penn State, is not representative because it only represents a small group of men who share a specific affiliation (fraternity) at one particular institution. Option B, which takes a random sample between classes in the business wing of various universities, may also have some representation but is less likely to capture the diversity of experiences and perspectives within the student body. Option C, consisting of sixty male members of each class from Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, and Columbia, while providing a good starting point, does not account for the different types of schools or programs that these colleges offer, leading to potential biases in the selection process. Option D, on the other hand, offers a more balanced approach by selecting twenty male members of each class from a variety of colleges and universities, ensuring a wider range of educational backgrounds and experiences."
