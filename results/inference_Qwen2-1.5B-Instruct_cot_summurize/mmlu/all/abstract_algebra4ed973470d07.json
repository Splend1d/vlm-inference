This shows that not every symmetric group of degree greater than or equal to 3 is abelian.\n\nStatement 2: If \\(a\\) is a permutation that is an \\(m\\)-cycle and \\(b\\) is a permutation that is an \\(n\\)-cycle, then \\(|ab|\\) = \\(lcm(m,n)\\).\nThis statement is true.\nThe order of a product of two permutations can be found by multiplying their orders and applying the fundamental theorem of finite Abelian groups. In this case, if \\(a\\) is an \\(m\\)-cycle and \\(b\\) is an \\(n\\)-cycle, then the order of \\(ab\\) is the least common multiple (lcm) of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). This follows from the fact that the lcm of two integers divides both of them, and the order of \\(ab\\) equals the lcm because it represents the smallest number that divides both \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(B) False, False**."
