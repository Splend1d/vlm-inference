Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the Ladies we are determined to foment a Rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation.\"\nAbigail Adams, in a letter to John Adams, 1776\n\"Special legislation for woman has placed us in a most anomalous position. Women invested with the rights of citizens in one section\u2014voters, jurors, office-holders\u2014crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In some universities girls enjoy equal educational advantages with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan and Africa are welcomed there. But the privileges already granted in the several States are by no means secure.\"\nSusan B. Anthony, \"Declaration of Rights for Women,\" July 4, 1876\nThe sentiments expressed in the first excerpt by Abigail Adams best exemplify which of the following ideologies?\n\nA. Second-wave feminism\nB. Jeffersonian democracy\nC. Republican motherhood\nD. Libertarianism\n"

Republican motherhood\n\nAbigail Adams's letter expresses the idea that women should have equal rights as citizens and not be treated as second-class citizens based solely on their marital status. This aligns with the ideals of Republican motherhood, which promotes the idea that women should prioritize their family responsibilities over political activism.\n\nSecond-wave feminism focuses on issues like reproductive rights, gender pay gap, and sexual equality. Jeffersonian democracy emphasizes individual freedom and limited government intervention in people's lives. Libertarianism advocates for minimal government interference in personal affairs. None of these ideologies directly address the issue of treating women as equals under the law."
