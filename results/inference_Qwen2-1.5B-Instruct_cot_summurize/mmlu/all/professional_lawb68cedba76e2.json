In this case, the resident aliens cannot be considered adjudicable because their rights may not be affected by the statute, nor will they suffer an immediate injury as a result of the defendant's actions.\n\nFurthermore, the court would need to determine whether the state has a compelling state interest to support the statute before determining if the resident aliens have standing to challenge it. If the state does have a compelling state interest, then the burden of proof would shift to the state to demonstrate why the statute is necessary and how it furthers its interests. If the state fails to meet this burden, then the court could find that the statute is unconstitutional and strike it down.\n\nTherefore, the court should rule that either resident alien has standing, but not both."
