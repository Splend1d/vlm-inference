In the deed, the grantee and her assigns were required by covenant to share proportionately in the paving of a road that abutted the property. The grantee conveyed the property to a married couple by special warranty deed that did not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road. The buyers did not have an attorney and did not do a title search. When the road was completed, the married couple buyers refused to pay the share that was demanded of them. The original sellers of the parcel sued the couple in an equity claim without a jury. The judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share of the paving. On appeal, will the appellate court affirm the trial judge's order?\n\nA. Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns\".\nB. Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.\nC. No, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.\nD. No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not.\n"

Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns\".\n\nIn a general warranty deed, the grantor (seller) guarantees against defects in title but does not guarantee against future events such as improvements to public roads or other developments on the property. However, if there is a condition or covenant in the deed that requires the grantee to contribute to improvements to a common area, the covenant runs with the land and can affect subsequent owners.\n\nIn this case, the original sellers included a covenant requiring the grantee and her assigns to share proportionately in the paving of a road abutting the property. This covenant ran with the land and affected the grantee and her assigns, even though they did not agree to the covenant when they purchased the property.\n\nTherefore, the appellate court would likely affirm the trial judge's order that the couple pay their share of the paving."
