This is because ethanol has a double bond between carbon atoms 2 and 3, which makes it more polar than the other options. The higher electronegativity of carbon atom 2 means that the bond between carbon atoms 1 and 3 is stronger than in the other options, resulting in a greater tendency for hydrogen atoms to be attracted towards the oxygen atom at the end of the bond. As a result, the molecules formed by these bonds tend to have higher boiling points due to increased hydrogen bonding."
