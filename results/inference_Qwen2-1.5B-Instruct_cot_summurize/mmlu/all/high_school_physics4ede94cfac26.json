                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The velocity of the object in motion changes whereas the acceleration of the object is constant.\n\nIn uniform circular motion, the velocity of an object remains constant along a circle but its acceleration is directed towards the center of the circle. This means that the net force acting on the object is not necessarily towards the center, which is why the centrifugal force is not considered as part of the action-reaction pair of the centripetal force.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it states that a satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is falling toward the center in a circular path. In reality, satellites orbiting Earth do not fall towards the center; they move in a circular path due to the gravitational pull of Earth.\n\nOption A is also incorrect because while there is a centripetal force acting on the object (due to gravity), there is no centrifugal force involved. Instead, the centripetal force acts in the opposite direction of the centripetal acceleration.\n\nTherefore, the only option that correctly describes the behavior of an object undergoing uniform circular motion is option C."
