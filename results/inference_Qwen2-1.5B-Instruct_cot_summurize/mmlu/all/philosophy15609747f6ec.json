Instead, he advocated for living a simple and frugal lifestyle, focusing on spiritual growth and pleasure in the present moment. He argued that true happiness comes from cultivating virtues such as wisdom, courage, and moderation, rather than from acquiring wealth or power. Therefore, while some people may have access to more resources than others, Epicurus believed that anyone could achieve a good life if they worked hard and pursued their own interests and passions."
