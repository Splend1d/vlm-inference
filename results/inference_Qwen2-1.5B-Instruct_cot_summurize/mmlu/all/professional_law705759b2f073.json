Upon entering the apartment, he violently assaulted her. Although she tried to resist, he overpowered and raped her. The man testified that during dinner, he and the victim drank two bottles of Champagne. When they returned to his apartment, he was so intoxicated that he honestly believed that she consented to the intercourse. The jury determined that the victim did not consent to the intercourse. The jury also found that the man, as a result of his intoxication, honestly but unreasonably believed that she was consenting. As a consequence, the defendant should be found\n\nA. not guilty, because he honestly believed that the victim consented.\nB. not guilty, because his intoxication negated his criminal intent.\nC. guilty, because rape is a general intent crime.\nD. guilty, because she did not consent, and his belief that she was consenting was unreasonable.\n"

In this case, the man had the specific intent to rape the woman, despite believing that she gave him permission to do so due to his intoxication.\n\nTherefore, even if the man genuinely thought that she consented based on his belief that they were drunk, and he genuinely intended to have sex regardless of whether she wanted it, he still committed rape under the general intent requirement of the law."
