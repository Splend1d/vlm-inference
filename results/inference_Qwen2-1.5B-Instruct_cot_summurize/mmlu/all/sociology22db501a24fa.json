White-collar crime, such as embezzlement, fraud, and embezzlement, often occurs in the workplace and goes unnoticed by many people. This is because white-collar criminals may be skilled at hiding their activities and avoiding detection. Additionally, many businesses have internal controls in place that help prevent fraudulent activity from occurring. However, even with these controls in place, white-collar crimes can still occur if someone is willing and able to commit them. Therefore, it is important for individuals and organizations to remain vigilant and report any suspicious behavior or activity they observe."
