Rotavirus is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that contains a double-stranded (ds) RNA genome within its capsid. This dsRNA genome encodes for the viral proteins necessary for replication and assembly of new virus particles. The dsRNA is not integrated into the host cell's genome, but it is instead packaged into new virions through reverse transcription.\n\nThe presence of this double-stranded RNA genome makes rotavirus highly susceptible to various antiviral drugs and treatments compared to other RNA viruses like influenza or poliovirus. Understanding the genetic makeup of rotavirus is crucial for developing effective vaccines and therapies against rotavirus infections."
