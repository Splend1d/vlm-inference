This belief was based on the idea that psychiatry was a branch of medicine that was funded and influenced by the pharmaceutical industry, which had a vested interest in promoting certain treatments over others. Anti-psychiatrists argued that this meant that psychiatrists were not truly objective or unbiased in their diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. They also suggested that the treatment of mental illness should be based on evidence-based practices rather than the influence of corporate interests."
