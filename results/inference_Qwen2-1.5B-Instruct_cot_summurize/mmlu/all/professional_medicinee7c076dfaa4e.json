He has had recurrent cervical lymphadenitis and pneumonia since infancy. Two years ago, a culture from an abscess in the cervical region grew Staphylococcus aureus. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination shows a tender, erythematous, edematous left ankle; there is point tenderness over the medial malleolus. A bone scan shows increased uptake in the left lower tibial metaphysis. Culture of bone aspirate grows Serratia marcescens. Nitroblue tetrazolium test shows no color change. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for these findings?\n\nA. Developmental arrest of maturation of B lymphocytes\nB. Dysmorphogenesis of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches\nC. Impaired chemotaxis\nD. Impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism\n"

Impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism\n\nThis condition is known as neutrophil engraftment syndrome or neutropenic sepsis. It occurs when the immune system fails to properly respond to infections, allowing bacteria to grow and spread throughout the body. This can lead to organ damage and severe systemic symptoms, such as fever, bleeding, and infection. In this case, the patient's immune system may not be able to effectively fight off the infection caused by Serratia marcescens, leading to the development of neutrophil engraftment syndrome."
