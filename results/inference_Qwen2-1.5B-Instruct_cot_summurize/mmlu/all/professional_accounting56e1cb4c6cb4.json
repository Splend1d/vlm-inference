Option A (A. $0) is also incorrect because there is no mention of any loss being recognized or not recognized in the year 1 statement of financial position. Option C (C. $50,000) is also incorrect because the question states that the $40,000 of the loss accrual related to a year 1 event and $50,000 related to a year 2 event. Therefore, the correct answer is B. $40,000."
