This action may be considered morally wrong because it could potentially cause harm or injury to the pedestrian. However, since there was no immediate danger or threat to the pedestrian's life, this act would not necessarily be considered illegal or harmful based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nScenario 2 involves taking someone else's wallet without their permission. This act is generally considered morally wrong because it involves theft and can have serious consequences for both parties involved. Even if the person who lost their wallet did not report it immediately, the fact that they were willing to give up their property suggests that they had trust in the individual who took it. Therefore, this scenario would typically be considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
