When a block of memory is accessed, the CPU can directly access the corresponding block frame in the cache without having to look up the block number. This makes direct mapping fast and efficient for accessing frequently used data.\n\nHowever, direct mapping also has some disadvantages. One of these is that it can cause a degradation in the hit ratio when two or more blocks use the same block frame in the cache. This happens because the cache misses will occur more often when there are multiple blocks using the same block frame. In such cases, the cache miss rate increases, which can lead to slower performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: the cache hit ratio is degraded if two or more blocks used alternately map onto the same block frame in the cache."
