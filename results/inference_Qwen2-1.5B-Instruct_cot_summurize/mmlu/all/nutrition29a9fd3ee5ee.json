It helps the body regulate fluid balance, which can help lower blood pressure by dilating blood vessels and reducing the workload on the heart.\n\nWhile sodium (salt) can also contribute to high blood pressure, it's important to note that too much salt intake can lead to water retention and contribute to high blood pressure indirectly through increased fluid volume in the body. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol, and other components have not been shown to directly improve or prevent hypertension in humans."
