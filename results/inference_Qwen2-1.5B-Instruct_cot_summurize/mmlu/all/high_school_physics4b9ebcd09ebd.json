This means that the net charge on the system after they have come into contact is equal to the sum of their individual charges. \n\nSo in this case, if we assume that the two spheres initially had a total charge of 5e and -6e, then after they come into contact, the net charge would be:\n\n(5e) + (-6e) = -e\n\nThis means that the net charge on the system after they have come into contact is -1e or -1/10 coulomb (C). Therefore, option A (+3e and -4e) cannot be the correct answer because it is not equal to -1e.\n\nOption C (both of the above) is also incorrect because it implies that the spheres could have different signs before and after the contact, which is not possible given the information provided.\n\nOption D (none of the above) is correct because there is no way for the spheres to end up with a net charge of -1e without having some combination of positive and negative charges before the contact."
