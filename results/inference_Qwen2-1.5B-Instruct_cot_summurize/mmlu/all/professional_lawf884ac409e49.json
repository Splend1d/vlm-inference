On the software's web page, she clicked a \"download\" button and downloaded the product successfully. She did that without seeing or clicking to any information about the software's contractual licensing terms. If she had first scrolled down to the next visible screen, she would have seen the following invitation: \"Please review and agree to the licensing terms of this software program.\" She used the program for several months until she discovered that it was applying tracking technology to surreptitiously send dozens of third-party promotional offers to her clients. The company ignored her requests to stop doing this. She sued it to stop the unauthorized tracking but the company responded by citing to its licensing terms which require all disputes be submitted to private arbitration. Will the federal district court likely dismiss the web designer's complaint and order arbitration as required by the software licensing terms?\n\nA. Yes, because the designer got the benefit of the program and it required compliance with its licensing terms.\nB. No, because the designer did not have sufficiently clear notice that she must accept the licensing terms prior to downloading and using the product.\nC. Yes, because the terms were obvious enough for anyone to find and she would have seen the notation if she had looked in a reasonable manner.\nD. No, because contracts formed online must be signed and executed with the same formality as paper contracts.\n"

As such, she did not have sufficient notice of the terms and conditions under which she was agreeing to use the software. This lack of clarity in the terms and conditions is one reason why the federal district court may well dismiss the web designer's complaint and order arbitration as required by the software licensing terms."
