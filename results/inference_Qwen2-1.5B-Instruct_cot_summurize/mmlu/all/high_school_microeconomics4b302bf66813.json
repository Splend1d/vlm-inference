More students graduating with the necessary skills for this labor market will increase the demand for labor, which will lead to a higher market wage.\n\nAs more people enter the labor force and seek employment, there will be increased competition for jobs, leading to higher wages as employers try to attract and retain skilled workers. This is because employers need to pay higher wages to compensate for the additional costs associated with hiring new employees who have specialized skills that are in high demand."
