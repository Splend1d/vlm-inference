The soil was waterlogged and provided conditions that allowed for the preservation of organic material.\nC.

This means that the spears were buried in an environment that prevented decomposition and preserved their organic materials. Acidic soil can help to preserve organic matter by reducing the rate of decay caused by bacteria and fungi. Additionally, the presence of oxygen in the soil helped to prevent the growth of anaerobic organisms that could decompose the wood over time."
