Review the former client's records to verify its compliance with debt and loan agreements.\n\nBefore reissuing an auditor's report, it is important for the CPA to ensure that all financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and that they accurately reflect the financial position and results of operations of the former client. This includes verifying that the former client has complied with any applicable debt and loan agreements, such as interest rates, payment terms, and collateral requirements. If the CPA finds any discrepancies or irregularities in the former client's financial statements, they may need to investigate further to determine if they affect the overall financial health and viability of the company."
