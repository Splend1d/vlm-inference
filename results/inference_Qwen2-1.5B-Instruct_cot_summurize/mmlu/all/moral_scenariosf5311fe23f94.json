This action goes against the principles of respect for others' property and consideration for others' feelings.\n\nIn scenario 2, putting the dead man in the coffin and nailing it shut is also morally questionable. It involves taking someone else's life, which is a very serious matter and goes against the principle of not taking another person's life without their consent.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that can be considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The correct answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong."
