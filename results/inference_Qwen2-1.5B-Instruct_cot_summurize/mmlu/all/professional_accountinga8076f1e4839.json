This includes having to recover the costs associated with providing services, such as capital costs, through taxes or other forms of revenue. \n\nOption A is not necessarily true because not all enterprises are primarily government-owned. Option B is also not necessarily true because not all enterprises charge fees and charges to recover their costs. Finally, option C is not necessarily true because not all enterprises finance themselves by debt."
