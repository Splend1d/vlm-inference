Blinding prevents the server from using the CRT optimization, which is essential to the timing attack.\nB. Blinding changes the p and q primes that are used, so an adversary cannot learn the server\u2019s true p and q values.\nC. Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary\u2019s input and the timing differences.\nD. Blinding adds a random amount of time to the decryption due to the multiplication and division by the blinding random value r, which obscures the timing differences used in the attack.\n"
