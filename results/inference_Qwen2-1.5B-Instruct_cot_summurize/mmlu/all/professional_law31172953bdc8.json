He had succeeded in arranging for a tryout at the baseball team's training facilities in a neighboring state. Short on funds and needing a way to get to the training facilities, the athlete approached his friend and said, \"If you will drive me to and from the baseball team's training facilities for my tryout and pay for our housing and meal expenses during our stay, I will assign to you 10 percent of my first-year earnings. \" The friend agreed and drove the athlete to the training facilities. After the tryout, the baseball team offered the athlete a contract to play baseball for the team at $100,000 per year. When the friend asked when he would be receiving his 10 percent, the athlete replied that $10,000 was much more than the friend deserved and he would pay the friend $1,000 for his efforts. The friend then filed suit to enforce the assignment. If the court holds the assignment unenforceable, the most applicable legal principle would be\n\nA. a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.\nB. a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.\nC. the friend did not detrimentally rely on the assignment prior to the attempted revocation of the assignment by the athlete.\nD. a gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.\n"

A gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.\n\nGratuitous assignments are agreements where one party gives up their rights without any consideration (i.e., money or other valuable consideration). In such cases, the assignor has the right to revoke the assignment at any time before it becomes effective.\n\nIn this case, the athlete gave up his right to receive payment for his effort in exchange for an assignment of 10% of his first-year earnings. However, the friend paid for the athlete's housing and meals during their stay, which means that the friend did not benefit from the assignment. Therefore, the friend can revoke the assignment at any time before it becomes effective, and the right of the assignee (the friend) is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.\n\nTherefore, the most applicable legal principle in this scenario is D. A gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation."
