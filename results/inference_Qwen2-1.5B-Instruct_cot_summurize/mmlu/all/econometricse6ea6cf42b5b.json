OLS minimizes the sum of the squared vertical distances from the points to the line.\n\nOLS estimates the parameters in an equation by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals, which are defined as the difference between the observed and predicted values for each data point. In other words, it aims to find the best-fit line that minimizes the average squared error or prediction error across all observations. The squared distance between each point and the regression line (the \"vertical\" distances) reflects how far each observation deviates from the estimated line, hence B is the correct choice."
