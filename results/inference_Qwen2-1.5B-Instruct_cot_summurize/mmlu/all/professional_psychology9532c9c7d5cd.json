They may also provide guidance to the public on how to choose a psychologist and ensure their safety and well-being. Additionally, they can take disciplinary action against psychologists who engage in unethical or illegal behavior. However, their main function is not to develop laws that govern the practice of psychology, nor to provide sanctions for unethical and illegal behavior on the part of psychologists. Licensing boards do not accredit graduate programs in psychology."
