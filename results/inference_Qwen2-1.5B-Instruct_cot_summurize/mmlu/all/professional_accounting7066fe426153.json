The formula for depreciation expense is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Depreciation Expense} = \\frac{\\text{Original Cost} - \\text{Salvage Value}}{\\text{Estimated Useful Life}} \\times \\text{Number of Years} \\]\n\nGiven that the original cost is $12,000, the salvage value is $1,500, and the useful life is 3 years, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Depreciation Expense} = \\frac{12000 - 1500}{3} \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Depreciation Expense} = \\frac{10500}{3} \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Depreciation Expense} = 3500 \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Depreciation Expense} = 10500 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes that the remaining value after 3 years will be used in future years as well, but it's not clear from the information provided whether this assumption is correct or if there's a different method being used for calculating the depreciation expense.\n\nThe closest answer choice that aligns with the given information (assuming the remaining value after 3 years is used) would be B. $7,000. However, without further clarification on how the remaining value is calculated, we cannot definitively choose between A, B, C, or D based on the given information alone. If the remaining value is indeed used for subsequent years, then the calculation would differ significantly from the one provided above."
