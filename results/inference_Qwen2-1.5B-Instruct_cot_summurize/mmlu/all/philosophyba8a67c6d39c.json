For example, we know what triangularity is not from comparing sensible triangles but by thinking of the ideal of triangularity in terms of which these sensible figures are recognized as triangles.  From this Plato concludes that all knowledge (as opposed to opinion) is innate, because:\n\nA. from the moment we are born we know what things are in the world in terms of ideas that we get through our senses.\nB. since we are born with senses (that is, our senses are innate), we can know things about the sensible world with certainty as long as we rely on the senses alone.\nC. our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\nD. since our absolutely certain knowledge of things cannot be based on the changing things in sensible experience, it must merely be triggered by sensible experience.\n"

Our knowledge of the world is not really of the sensible world itself but of the world grasped mathematically and ideally.\n\nPlato argues that our knowledge of the world is innate, meaning that we have knowledge of things before we are born and before we ever see them with our senses. He believes that this innate knowledge comes from the Forms, which are eternal and unchanging ideas that exist independently of the material world. These Forms are what we recognize as being true when we see things in the world, such as triangles or numbers.\n\nPlato's argument against empiricism is that it relies too heavily on sensory experience and does not provide enough justification for our innate knowledge. Instead, he suggests that our knowledge is rooted in the innate Ideas that exist outside of the material world. This knowledge is not based on sensory experience, but rather on an understanding of the mathematical and ideal forms that underlie the material world.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer. The other options are either incorrect or do not fully capture Plato's argument. Option A is not accurate because Plato argues that our knowledge of the world comes from the innate Forms, not from sensory experiences. Option B is also incorrect because it assumes that our senses are innate, which Plato argues against. Option D is also incorrect because it misunderstands Plato's argument and suggests that our knowledge of the world is based solely on sensory experience, which is not supported by Plato's arguments."
