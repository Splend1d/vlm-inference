Cohen is a philosopher who has proposed several theories about the nature of animals and their relationship to humans, but his work is not widely recognized or studied by many scholars. Therefore, without further context or additional information, I cannot definitively state whether animals are moral agents, amoral, abstract reasoners, or any other category listed."
