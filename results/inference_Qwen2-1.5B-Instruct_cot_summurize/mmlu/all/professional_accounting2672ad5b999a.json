The ASC includes both standards and updates that provide guidance on how financial statements should be prepared. When the FASB issues an update to the ASC, it typically means that there has been significant change in GAAP that requires further clarification or adjustment. These updates are issued as Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs)."
