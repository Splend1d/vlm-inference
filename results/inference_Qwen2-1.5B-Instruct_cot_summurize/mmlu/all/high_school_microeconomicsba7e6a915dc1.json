The price will rise and each firm's output will fall as firms exit the industry.\n\nWhen the price is below the minimum average total cost (MAATC), it means that for a given level of output, the costs are higher than the revenue from selling that output. This situation creates disequilibrium in the market, where some firms cannot cover their variable costs while others still have profits. As a result, some firms may decide to exit the industry voluntarily due to lower profitability or due to external factors such as competition or technological changes.\n\nIn the long run, when the market clears and all firms exit the industry, the remaining firms will face a situation where they need to recover their fixed costs by raising prices above the breakeven point. This will lead to an increase in the price of the good being produced, which will cause the supply curve to shift leftward until the new equilibrium price is above the breakeven point. At this point, the demand curve will be upward sloping relative to the old equilibrium, allowing the remaining firms to sell at higher prices without losing money on every unit sold. Therefore, option A is the most accurate prediction based on the information provided."
