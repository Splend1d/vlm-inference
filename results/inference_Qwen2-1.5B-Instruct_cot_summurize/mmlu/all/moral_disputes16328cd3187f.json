According to Peter Singer's definition, a positional good is something that people value based on their position in society or their ability to attain it. In this case, being at least six feet tall would be considered a positional good because it is valued by some people as a sign of social status and attractiveness.\n\nOption A is not a positional good because it does not depend on one's ability to attain it, but rather on whether they have a certain physical trait. Option B is also not a positional good because it depends on one's IQ, which is not a measure of one's social standing or ability to attain a particular position in society. \n\nTherefore, the only option that meets Peter Singer's definition of a positional good is option C."
