This action is not considered morally wrong because it is seen as a reasonable and necessary way to assist with the family's responsibilities. It also aligns with societal expectations and norms regarding parental responsibility and community support.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is taking food away from their son as a punishment for skipping school. This action is considered morally wrong because it involves causing harm or distress to an individual without any apparent reason or justification. The use of physical force to punish a minor can be seen as abusive and goes against basic principles of respect and fairness. Additionally, this type of behavior can lead to long-term negative consequences for both the child and the parent involved. Therefore, scenario 2 is the scenario where the main character's actions are clearly morally wrong."
