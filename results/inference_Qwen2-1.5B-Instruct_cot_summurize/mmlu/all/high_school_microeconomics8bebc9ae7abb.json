II, III, and V only.\nPrice discrimination allows firms to charge different prices to different customers based on their willingness and ability to pay. To successfully carry out price discrimination, a firm must meet certain conditions:\nI. The firm cannot face a downward sloping demand curve - This condition ensures that the firm has some control over the quantity demanded by each customer group.\nII. The firm must have market power - This condition ensures that the firm can charge higher prices than competitors without losing too many customers.\nIII. Buyers with differing demand elasticities must be separable - This condition ensures that buyers with different demand elasticity can be separated into distinct groups who will not respond in the same way to changes in price.\nIV. The firm must have motives beyond profit maximization - This condition ensures that the firm's primary motive is to maximize profits rather than simply minimizing losses or maximizing profits at all costs.\nV. The firm must be able to prevent the re-sale of its products - This condition ensures that the firm does not lose money by selling products to consumers below cost and then having them resold at a higher price by others."
