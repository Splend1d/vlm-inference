SCNT should be allowed when it falls within the range of risks that is accepted by ordinary people in sexual reproduction.\n\nThis statement implies that the decision to allow or deny SCNT should be based on whether the benefits outweigh the potential risks, and that these risks should be acceptable to society as a whole. It also suggests that there may be some level of risk associated with SCNT, but this risk should be considered in the context of the overall benefits and ethical considerations."
