                    "text": "The answer is B: highly inelastic demand curve. When rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase, it means that the demand for their products remains relatively constant or even increases slightly. This behavior is known as price discrimination and can lead to a perfectly elastic demand curve if all consumers respond to price changes by changing their purchasing habits accordingly. In this case, the demand curve would be perfectly horizontal, with no change in price elasticity. However, if only some consumers respond to price changes, the demand curve may still be somewhat inelastic, indicating that the supply curve is more important than the demand curve in determining the market price."
