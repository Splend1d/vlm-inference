Goldthorpe was a sociologist who studied the social structure of society in England during the 19th century. He identified three main classes of people in society: the nobility, the middle class, and the working class. The working class included people like servants and domestic workers who were not part of the aristocracy or the middle class but still had to work hard for their living. Goldthorpe's study of the working class led him to identify them as the \"service class.\""
