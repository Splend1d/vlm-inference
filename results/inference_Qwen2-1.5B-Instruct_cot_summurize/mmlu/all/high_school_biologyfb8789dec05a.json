The ability of populations to undergo modification as they adapt to a particular environment.\n\nDarwin's theory of evolution by natural selection states that species evolve over time through a process called natural selection, which occurs when individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce than those without them. If the HMS Beagle had not visited the Galapagos Islands, Darwin would not have been able to observe the specific adaptations and diversification of species on those islands, such as the finches on the Gal\u00e1pagos island of Santa Cruz, which showed different beak sizes and shapes adapted to different food sources. Without this observation, he would not have been able to formulate his theory of evolution by natural selection."
