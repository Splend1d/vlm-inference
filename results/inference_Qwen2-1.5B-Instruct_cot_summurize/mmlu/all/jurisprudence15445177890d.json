They also argue that the concept of 'neutrality' is problematic, as it implies that there is no inherent difference between different races and that all individuals should be treated equally regardless of their race.\n\nFinally, some Critical Race Theorists argue that the idea of 'truth' is not always reliable, as it can be subject to interpretation and manipulation by those with power and influence. As a result, they prefer to focus on strategies for challenging and dismantling systems of racism rather than trying to achieve perfect equality."
