In this case, Tina's good grades, involvement in extracurricular activities, and typical success in everything she does suggest that she may be a responsible and competent driver. When she causes an accident on her second day of driver's ed., it is likely that her instructor would find it difficult to believe that she could have done such a thing given the impression of her past successes."
