K-W-L chart\n\nK-W-L (What, Why, and How) charts are a useful tool for teachers to gather information about student learning objectives, what they know or do not know, and how they can improve their understanding. By creating a K-W-L chart, teachers can identify areas where additional support is needed and tailor their instructional strategies accordingly.\n\nThe other options listed may also be useful in collecting data for instructional purposes:\n\nA. Concentric circles: These visual aids can help visualize relationships between concepts but are less likely to provide specific data on student needs.\nC. Book pass: While this activity can be used to assess reading comprehension, it does not directly inform instructional decisions based on student needs.\nD. Reciprocal teaching: This method involves two-way communication between students and teachers, which can be beneficial for collaboration and understanding, but it does not provide direct data on student needs."
