The symptoms began after returning from a camping trip in New Mexico. He appears ill and lethargic and can barely answer questions. His temperature is 39.2\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows generalized scattered black maculae. Examination of the right upper extremity shows an erythematous, solid, tender mass on the underside of the upper extremity just above the elbow; the mass is draining blood and necrotic material. The most effective antibiotic for this patient\u2019s disorder will interfere with which of the following cellular processes or enzymes?\n\nA. DNA helicase\nB. Glucuronosyltransferase\nC. Proteasomal degradation\nD. Ribosomal assembly\n"

Proteasomal degradation\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest that they may have a condition called myositis ossificans, which is characterized by inflammation and damage to muscles and connective tissue. This can cause muscle weakness, tenderness, and pain, as well as the formation of nodules or masses. Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial infections associated with myositis ossificans, but they do not directly affect the cellular processes involved in protein synthesis or degradation. However, certain antibiotics, such as penicillins, may interfere with the activity of proteins involved in the breakdown of cell walls, which could potentially lead to the formation of these nodules or masses."
