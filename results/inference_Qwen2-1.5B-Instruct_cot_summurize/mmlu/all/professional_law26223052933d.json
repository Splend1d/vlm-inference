They signed a contract that said that if they purchased new items on the account, they would not own the old purchases until the new ones were paid in full. That provision was in fine print on the reverse side of the papers. When husband lost his job, they had by that time paid for everything purchased on the account except for one chair they bought a few weeks earlier. The store sued, trying to repossess all furniture ever sold to the couple. Will the couple likely prevail on a defense of unconscionability?\n\nA. No, because they might be able to find another store to sell them furniture, which proves that there was no lack of bargaining power.\nB. No, because the store was nice enough to extend credit, and the couple should be expected to pay for everything before they own any of it.\nC. Yes, because any time a seller puts terms in fine print it is proof of bad faith and unconscionability.\nD. Yes, because a combination of factors makes it likely that the court will recognize unconscionability under these circumstances.\n"

Lack of Bargaining Power: It is possible that the couple may have been at a disadvantage due to their poor credit history or financial situation. If this is the case, then the fact that the store included a clause requiring them to pay off all previous purchases before acquiring new ones could be seen as exploitative.\n\n2. Unfair Terms: The fact that the terms of the contract were put in small print on the reverse side of the papers could also be considered unfair. This implies that the couple did not have adequate time to read and understand the entire document, leading to an imbalance of information.\n\n3. Lack of Consideration: The couple's purchase of the chair without paying for the rest of their purchases could also be seen as lacking consideration. In order for a contract to be valid, both parties must agree voluntarily and freely to enter into it.\n\n4. Impracticable Performance: The couple's inability to make payments on the remaining purchases due to their job loss could be considered impracticable performance. This means that they cannot perform their contractual obligations as agreed upon, which can lead to the conclusion that the contract is unconscionable.\n\nTherefore, the couple is likely to prevail on a defense of unconscionability based on these factors."
