Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, giving Annie a bouquet of daisies is not explicitly against any known laws or norms regarding allergies, but it may be considered insensitive and potentially harmful if Annie has an allergy to daisies that she doesn't know about. Therefore, this action can be seen as morally questionable.\n\nIn scenario 2, playing the drums loudly in the basement is generally considered acceptable behavior since it's a common noise level for musical performances and activities like watching music videos or listening to podcasts. However, if someone is sensitive to loud noises, they might find it uncomfortable or disruptive. This could be seen as a violation of their rights to privacy and quiet enjoyment."
