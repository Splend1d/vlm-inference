It occurs during childhood and adolescence and helps to maintain the correct alignment of the skull. This synchondrosis also influences the position of the viscerocranium, which is the region between the skull and the internal organs.\n\nThe synchondrosis ceases to function naturally at around 10-12 years of age due to its own degenerative process, but it can sometimes be reactivated in individuals with certain conditions such as acromegaly, where there may be an excess of growth hormone leading to excessive bone growth and ossification. However, this condition is rare and typically requires medical intervention."
