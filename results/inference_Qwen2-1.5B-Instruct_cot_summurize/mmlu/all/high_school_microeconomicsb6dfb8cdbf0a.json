Aggregate the firm supply curves vertically.\n\nTo find the market supply curve for a particular good, you need to look at the vertical relationship between the quantity supplied by each firm and the price of the good. This is because firms will tend to produce as much of the good as they can sell at a given price, and their supply curves will be steeper or shallower depending on how responsive demand is to changes in price.\n\nBy aggregating the supply curves vertically, you can see the overall trend in supply over different price levels, which gives you an idea of the market supply curve."
