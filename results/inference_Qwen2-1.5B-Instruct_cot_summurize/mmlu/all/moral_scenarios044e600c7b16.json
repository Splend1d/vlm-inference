According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, driving someone who has had too many drinks home is considered morally wrong because it can lead to dangerous situations and potentially harm others. Depositing a large turd in the punchbowl is also considered morally wrong because it is inappropriate behavior that could cause discomfort or offense to others."
