The local remedies rule aims on the one hand to restrict the volume of petitions to international tribunals while at the same time building up the capacity of local courts.\n\nThe local remedies rule, also known as the principle of exhaustion of local remedies, is a legal principle that requires individuals or organizations seeking redress under international law to exhaust all available domestic remedies before bringing their case to an international tribunal. This means that if someone believes they have been wronged by a state or other actor and wants to take legal action against them, they must first try to resolve the issue through the courts of the country where the alleged wrongdoing occurred.\n\nThe rationale behind this rule is to ensure that the international community does not become bogged down with frivolous or unmeritorious claims that do not truly require intervention by international bodies. By requiring individuals to first seek redress through their own national courts, it can help prevent abuse of the system and allow countries to develop their own legal systems and institutions. Additionally, it allows domestic courts to build up their capacity and expertise in handling such cases, which can ultimately benefit both the individual seeking justice and the broader society."
