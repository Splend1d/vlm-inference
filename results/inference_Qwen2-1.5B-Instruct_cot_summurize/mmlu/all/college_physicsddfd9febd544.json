Therefore, if the proton was originally moving in the +z-direction, it will still move in that direction after passing through the regions with the electric and magnetic fields. However, if the potential difference is doubled, the electric field strength also doubles, so the proton will be deflected in the opposite direction due to the change in the force acting on it. Since the proton is initially moving in the +z-direction, it will now be deflected in the -z-direction. This means that the proton will be deflected in the +x-direction (opposite to the initial direction) and in the -y-direction (in the opposite direction of the original electric field)."
