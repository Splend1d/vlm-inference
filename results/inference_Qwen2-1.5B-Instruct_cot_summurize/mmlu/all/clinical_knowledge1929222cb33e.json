This occurs when a patient is placed on a ventilator and develops an infection due to the use of the ventilator. VAP can be caused by a variety of bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is important for healthcare providers to take steps to prevent VAP, such as properly cleaning and disinfecting equipment and ensuring that patients receive appropriate care and medication."
