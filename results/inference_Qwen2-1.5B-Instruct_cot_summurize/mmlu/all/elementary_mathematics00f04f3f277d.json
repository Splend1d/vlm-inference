Surveying people who do not live in the home team's city or those standing in line for tickets may also provide some information about the teams' popularity, but it is less reliable as it does not reflect the actual fan base attending the game. Surveys from cheerleaders or ticket holders may not be representative of the entire crowd and could introduce bias."
