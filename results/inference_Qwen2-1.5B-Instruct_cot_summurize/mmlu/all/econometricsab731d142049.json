In an MA(q) model, the PACF for lags greater than q will not be zero, as it includes the effect of the error term that has already been explained by previous lags in the model.\n\nStatement iii) is also true. For an AR(p) model, the PACF for lags greater than p will be zero, as it represents the effect of the past errors on the current observation.\n\nStatement iv) is true. For an MA(1) model, the ACF and PACF will be the same at lag two, since the first lag is included in both the ACF and the PACF."
