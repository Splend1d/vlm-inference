He made a sharp distinction between his frequently reiterated personal wish that 'all men everywhere could be free' and his official duties as a legislator, congressman, and president in a legal and constitutional system that recognized the South's right to property in slaves. Even after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation he continued to declare his preference for gradual abolition. While his racial views changed during the Civil War, he never became a principled egalitarian in the manner of abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass or Wendell Phillips or Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner.\"\n\u2014Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial, 2010\nHow did President Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the Civil War?\n\nA. The war came to a swift conclusion because the Proclamation made the Confederacy realize the futility of their cause.\nB. The war grew in scope because the Proclamation caused Great Britain to join the fight on the side of the Union.\nC. President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy vowed massive resistance to any Union effort to free the slaves.\nD. The war aims of the United States were no longer exclusively focused on the preservation of the Union.\n"

                    "text": "The Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Abraham Lincoln altered the course of the Civil War in several ways:\n\n1. It shifted the focus of the war from preserving the Union to freeing the slaves: Before the Proclamation, the primary goal of the Union was to preserve the union and prevent secession. However, with the Proclamation, the Union began to see slavery as a burden on the country's economic stability and political integrity.\n\n2. It had a significant impact on the Confederacy: The Confederacy saw the Proclamation as a violation of its sovereignty and a threat to its existence as a slaveholding nation. As a result, they began to resist the Union more actively, leading to increased military conflict and the eventual end of the war.\n\n3. It gained international support: The Proclamation was seen as a moral victory for the Union, and it gained support from other nations around the world, including Great Britain, France, and Russia. This support helped to shift public opinion against the Confederacy and contributed to their defeat.\n\n4. It weakened the Confederacy's position: By the time the Confederacy had received word of the Proclamation, they already had a significant amount of military resources and manpower. However, the Proclamation made it clear that the Union would continue fighting until all slaves were freed, which put additional pressure on the Confederacy to negotiate terms that would allow them to retain their slaves while still remaining part of the Union.\n\nIn summary, the Emancipation Proclamation shifted the war's objectives, gained international support, weakened the Confederacy's position, and ultimately led to their defeat."
