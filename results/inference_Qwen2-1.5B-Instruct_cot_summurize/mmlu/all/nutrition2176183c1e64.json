Salmonella and Campylobacter\n\nThese bacteria can cause serious illnesses, including diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dehydration. They are commonly found in raw or undercooked poultry, beef, pork, eggs, and seafood. \n\nIt is important to note that while these two bacteria are the most common causes of foodborne illness in the US and Europe, other factors such as cross-contamination, improper handling, and inadequate cooking temperatures also contribute to the risk of foodborne illness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Salmonella and Campylobacter."
