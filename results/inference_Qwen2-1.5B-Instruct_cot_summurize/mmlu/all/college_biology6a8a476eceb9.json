Therefore, option A is correct. \n\nThe other options are not correctly classified as nektons:\n\n- B. Barnacle: While barnacles are often found on rocks or other surfaces in marine habitats, they are sessile organisms and do not move through water.\n- C. Cyanobacterium: This is a type of bacteria that can be found in both freshwater and marine environments. However, it does not belong to the nekton class as it is not a fish-like animal.\n- D. Protist: Protists are a diverse group of single-celled eukaryotic organisms that can range from single-celled amoebae to complex multicellular organisms like slime molds and ciliates. Not all protists are nektons, so this option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Whale."
