So, the probability of not diagnosing a patient with Condition A is \\(1 - 0.15 = 0.85\\).\n\n2. **Diagnosed with Condition B**: The probability of diagnosing a patient with Condition B is 70%, so the probability of not diagnosing a patient with Condition B is \\(1 - 0.70 = 0.30\\).\n\nSince these events are mutually exclusive (they cannot happen simultaneously), we add their individual probabilities together to get the total probability of being diagnosed with at least one of the conditions.\n\nThe total probability is:\n\\[P(\\text{At least one condition}) = P(\\text{Diagnosed with Condition A}) + P(\\text{Not diagnosed with Condition A and Diagnosed with Condition B}) + P(\\text{Not diagnosed with both Conditions})\\]\n\n\\[= 0.15 + 0.85 \\times 0.70 + 0.85 \\times 0.30\\]\n\n\\[= 0.15 + 0.605 + 0.255\\]\n\n\\[= 0.91\\]\n\nSo, the probability that a patient with the given symptoms will be diagnosed with at least one of the conditions is approximately \\(0.91\\) or \\(0.91\\) when expressed as a percentage, which rounds to \\(0.91\\%\\). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(C) 0.765**."
