Therefore, statement I is true.\n\nStatement II is not necessarily true, because an ambiguity in a grammar does not automatically make it unsuitable for top-down parsing. In fact, many grammars with ambiguities are still suitable for top-down parsing if they have well-defined rules for choosing between the possible interpretations.\n\nStatement III is also not necessarily true, because even though the grammar may be ambiguous, it could still be suitable for bottom-up parsing if it has enough information about the structure of sentences to guide the parser. However, without more information about the intended use of the grammar, it is difficult to say whether it will be suitable for bottom-up parsing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. I only."
