False, True\n\nStatement 1 is false because the junction tree algorithm does not guarantee that the inference results will be the same as variable elimination. While it can sometimes lead to similar results, it is not always equivalent.\n\nStatement 2 is true because if two random variables X and Y are conditionally independent given another random variable Z, then in the corresponding Bayesian network, the nodes for X and Y are d-separated given Z. This means that the conditional independence between X and Y implies that they are separated by at least one other node in the network."
