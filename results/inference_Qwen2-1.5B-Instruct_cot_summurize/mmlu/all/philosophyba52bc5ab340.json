He argues that even if we accept the idea of free will, there may still be circumstances in which our actions are determined by factors outside of our control. This could include external events or factors beyond our control, such as genetic predispositions, environmental conditions, etc. In this sense, Nagel suggests that the problem of moral luck and the problem of free will are interconnected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be B. freedom of the will."
