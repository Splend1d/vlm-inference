This can be due to a variety of factors, including mental health conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, as well as other factors such as substance abuse or trauma. While the term \"insanity\" has been used in the context of mental health for many years, it is important to note that it is not a legal term and does not have a specific definition within the psychiatric community."
