Already at the Council of Ferrera (1438), which nominally reunited the Eastern and Western churches, there was a debate in which the Byzantines maintained the superiority of Plato to Aristotle. Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were both addicted to Plato; Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Florentine Academy, which was largely devoted to the study of Plato&\u2026The humanists of the time, however, were too busy acquiring knowledge of antiquity to be able to produce anything of value.\"\nBertrand Russell, British philosopher, History of Western Philosophy, 1946\nAccording to the information in the text, the schools founded by the Medici family most favored a philosophy known as\n\nA. Neoclassicism\nB. Scholasticism\nC. Renaissance humanism\nD. Neoplatonism\n"

However, from the text, we can infer that the Medici family was interested in studying Plato's works, which suggests that they may have been influenced by Neoplatonism. Therefore, the answer would be D. Neoplatonism."
