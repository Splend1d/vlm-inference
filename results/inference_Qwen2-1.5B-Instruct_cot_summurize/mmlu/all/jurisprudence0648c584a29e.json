Donny will be liable for assault and for battery.\nD. Donny will not be liable for either assault or battery because this is only a criminal matter.\n"

Battery refers to actual physical contact between two people. In this case, Sally saw the knife, which could reasonably be perceived as a threat, causing her to feel fear. Therefore, Donny is liable for both assault and battery.\n\nIt's important to note that in civil cases such as this, the defendant (in this case, Donny) can still be held responsible even if there is no direct evidence of physical harm. The key factors here are whether the defendant intended to cause harm and whether the victim had a reasonable apprehension of harm."
