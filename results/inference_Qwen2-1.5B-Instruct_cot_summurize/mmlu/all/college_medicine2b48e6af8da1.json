Glucose, also known as glucose-6-phosphate or 2-deoxyglucose, is a monosaccharide that serves as the primary source of energy for cells. When it is completely oxidized, it produces ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the primary form of energy stored and used by cells. This process can release up to 38kJ (8.5 kJ/g) of heat per mole of glucose, making it the most energy-dense compound among the options provided.\n\nOn the other hand, palmitic acid is a fatty acid with 16 carbon atoms and 18 oxygen atoms, and it does not contain a functional group like glucose to be oxidized. Therefore, it cannot directly convert into ATP through the oxidation pathway. Similarly, leucine is an amino acid that is not involved in metabolic pathways that produce ATP. Alcohol, such as ethanol, can also be oxidized in the liver to generate ATP, but this is a complex biochemical process involving multiple enzymes and pathways.\n\nThus, based on the given information, one gram of glucose is the release of the most energy when completely oxidized in the body."
