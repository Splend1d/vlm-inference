I and II only.\nAn object is in static equilibrium when it is at rest or moving with constant velocity, and the net external force acting on the object is zero. This means that the vector sum of all forces acting on the object must be zero, but it does not necessarily mean that the vector sum of all torques acting on the object must also be zero (although it could be true if there are no external torques acting on the object). Additionally, an object may be in static equilibrium even if its potential energy is non-zero, as long as its kinetic energy is zero (since the object is stationary).\nTherefore, only options I and II are necessary for an object to be in static equilibrium. Option III is not necessary for static equilibrium, as the sum of the object's potential and kinetic energies can still be zero without the object being in motion."
