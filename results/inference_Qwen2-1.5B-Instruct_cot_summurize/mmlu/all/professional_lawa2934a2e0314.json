The man's possession has at all times complied with the requirements of the applicable adverse possession statute in effect. Twelve years after the man took possession, the woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as her only surviving heir. Nine years after the woman's death, when the son was 15, the son's guardian discovered that the man was in possession of the tract. Assume that the statutory period of adverse possession is 20 years and the age of majority is 18. Which of the following correctly describes the state of title to the tract?\n\nA. The man has acquired title by adverse possession.\nB. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.\nC. The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional eight years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.\nD.

The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12 years, or nine years after the son attains the age of 18.\n\nAdverse possession allows a possessor to acquire title to real property if they possess it continuously and openly and habitually for the statutory period (in this case, 20 years). However, there is a requirement that the possessor must have had actual possession for a certain number of years before being able to acquire title outright. In this scenario, the possessor has been in possession of the tract for twelve years, which means that the man cannot acquire title without continuing in adverse possession for an additional eight years (9 years after the son attains the age of 18).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
