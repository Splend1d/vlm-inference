Use of a confounding variable to control the placebo effect\n\nWhile it's true that controlling for confounding variables can help reduce bias and improve the validity of an experiment, it is not necessary for all designs. For example, in a study where you want to compare two treatments, you could use random assignment to assign subjects to each treatment group without explicitly controlling for any potential confounders. This approach would allow you to assess the difference between the treatments directly, while still accounting for any differences in the groups due to factors other than the treatments (e.g., baseline characteristics)."
