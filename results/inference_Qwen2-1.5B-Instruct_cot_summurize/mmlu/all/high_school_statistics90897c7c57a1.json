Yes, but only if there is a single entrance to the school.\nC. Yes, because the 24 out of every 25 students who are not selected will form a control group.\nD. No, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\n"

No, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nThe selection process for the survey involves selecting every 25th student entering the school in the morning, which means that some students may be selected multiple times and others may not be selected at all. This could lead to unequal representation among different groups within the population being surveyed, making it a non-random sampling method. Therefore, the researcher's plan does not guarantee that the sample will accurately represent the entire student body of the high school."
