Some argue that this is due to the lack of a codified legal system or the difficulty of enforcing laws in an agrarian society.\n\nWeber suggests that the English legal system may be better understood by considering certain features that facilitate the development of capitalism. For example, the use of equity rather than strict liability for damages may have encouraged entrepreneurs to take risks and invest in new businesses. Additionally, the concept of \"legitimate domination,\" where power is not absolute but can be exercised within certain limits, may have helped to create a more flexible legal framework that accommodates different forms of social organization.\n\nTherefore, option C (by distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism) is the most accurate answer to how Weber would solve the \"English Problem.\""
