Reducing the overall gain: This can limit the effectiveness of the system in achieving its desired output. \n\n  B. Complexity and cost: Closed-loop control systems can be more complex to design and implement than open-loop systems, which may require additional components and wiring. Additionally, they often come with a higher upfront cost due to their specialized hardware and software requirements.\n\n  C. Oscillation response: In certain situations, such as when the feedback signal is unstable or noisy, a closed-loop control system may experience oscillations that can lead to instability in the system's performance.\n\n  D. All of the above: Therefore, all of these options accurately describe the disadvantages of using a closed-loop control system."
