This can lead to inflated standard errors of the coefficients, which can cause the estimated coefficients to be unreliable. In addition, it can also make it difficult to interpret the significance of individual predictor variables, as their relationship with the dependent variable may not be meaningful if they are highly correlated with each other.\n\nIt's worth noting that multicollinearity is a problem specific to multiple regression models, while collinearity in linear regression models refers to the situation where two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other, regardless of whether they are part of a multiple regression model or not."
