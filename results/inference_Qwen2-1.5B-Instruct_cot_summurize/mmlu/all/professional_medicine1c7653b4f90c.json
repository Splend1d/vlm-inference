Two days ago, she began to feel hot, but she has not taken her temperature. Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has no history of allergies. She does not smoke cigarettes. BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 116/74 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?\n\nA. Eustachian tube dysfunction\nB. Mucosal edema\nC. Nasal polyps\nD. Oral contraceptive use\n"

The combination of estrogen and progestin in oral contraceptives can cause changes in the mucosa lining of the nose, leading to increased mucus production and potential inflammation or irritation of the nasal passages. This can result in symptoms similar to those described in this case study, including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sore throat. Additionally, the use of oral contraceptives may increase the risk of developing chronic sinusitis due to its effect on the immune system and overall health. It is recommended that the patient consult with their healthcare provider to determine if there is an underlying medical condition causing their sinusitis and to discuss appropriate treatment options."
