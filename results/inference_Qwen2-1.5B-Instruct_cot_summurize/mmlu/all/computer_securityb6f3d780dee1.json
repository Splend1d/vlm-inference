The paper does not provide specific details about the costs associated with switching acquiring banks for spammers, but it suggests that these costs may vary depending on the type of bank used by spammers.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\nA. Spammers run their spam-advertised web sites on compromised user machines that are part of a botnet - This statement is generally considered true, as botnets are often used to distribute spam messages. However, it is important to note that this option alone does not fully capture the complexity of the spam value chain, as there are many other factors at play such as the use of phishing websites, malware distribution, etc.\n\nB. Spammers need to register domain names in order for their spam-based advertisements to be effective - While registering domain names can help protect against IP blocking, it is not necessarily required for all spam operations. Some spammers may use free or low-cost domains that do not require registration.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D, which combines both A and B."
