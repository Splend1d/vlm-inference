Factors such as the level of affection, attention, and love received from caregivers during this time can shape a child's identity and preferences.\n\nIt is important to note that while genetics play a role in sexual orientation, it is not the only determinant. Hormones released during puberty do affect sexual attraction and behavior, but they are not solely responsible for someone's sexual orientation. Additionally, other environmental and psychological factors also contribute to an individual's sexual orientation."
