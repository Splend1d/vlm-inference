We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\nThis means that we have a 90% chance of being correct in estimating the population mean based on our sample data. The confidence interval provides an estimate of the population parameter within which the true value lies at a given level of confidence. In this case, the 90% confidence interval estimates that the average cost of running for office is between $117,500 and $132,500."
