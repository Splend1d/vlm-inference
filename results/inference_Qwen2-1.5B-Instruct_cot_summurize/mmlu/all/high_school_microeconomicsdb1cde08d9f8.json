This means that there is no monopolistic power or control by any one firm. As a result, the price (P) is equal to the marginal cost (MC), which is also equal to average total cost (ATC). In other words, each firm's output level is determined by its marginal cost, and the price they charge is the same as their marginal cost. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
