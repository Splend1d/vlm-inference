Mercury(II) oxide, also known as mercuric oxide or mercuric trioxide, is highly toxic and can cause severe damage to the nervous system if ingested or absorbed through the skin. It is also highly reactive with other chemicals and can react violently with water or oxygen, leading to explosive fumes. Therefore, it is important to handle mercury safely and follow proper precautions when working with it."
