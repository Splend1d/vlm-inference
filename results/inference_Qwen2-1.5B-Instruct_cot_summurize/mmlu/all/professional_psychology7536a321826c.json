During the first session with Hermann, you find out that his political views are completely repugnant to you, and you feel that you would not enjoy working with him. As an ethical psychologist, you should:\n\nA. consult with another psychologist during the course of treatment to make sure your feelings don\u2019t interfere with your objectivity.\nB. discuss the difference in political views with Hermann only if they become relevant to the psychotherapy process.\nC. see Hermann in therapy until his current crisis is over and then make a referral if necessary.\nD. provide Hermann with appropriate referrals.\n"

In this case, it may be appropriate for you to consider discussing the difference in political views with Hermann only if they become relevant to the psychotherapy process. However, it is also important to keep in mind that you cannot force someone to continue therapy if their views do not align with yours. It is ultimately up to Hermann whether or not he wants to continue therapy with you. If you decide to terminate therapy based on this conflict, it is important to ensure that there is a clear and respectful explanation for why this decision was made."
