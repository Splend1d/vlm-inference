The infraorbital nerve is a terminal branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for sensory and motor functions in the region of the eye and eyelids. It does not carry parasympathetic secretomotor neurons to the lacrimal gland or innervate the inferior part of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Therefore, options B, C, and D are incorrect."
