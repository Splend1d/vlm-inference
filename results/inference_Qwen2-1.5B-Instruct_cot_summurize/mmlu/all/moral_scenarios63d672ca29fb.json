This action would be considered morally wrong because it fails to show kindness and consideration for others.\n\nScenario 2 involves taking property without permission, specifically using hotel stationery as a souvenir. This action may be seen as morally wrong because it violates the concept of respecting others' belongings and can lead to feelings of resentment or guilt.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that go against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, but they differ in terms of their specific nature."
