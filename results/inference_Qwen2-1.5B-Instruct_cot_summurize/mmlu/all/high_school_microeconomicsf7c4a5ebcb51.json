Marginal cost (MC) intersects Average Variable Cost (AVC) and Average Total Cost (ATC) at their minimum points.\n\nThis occurs because as the firm increases production, the additional units of variable input (in this case, labor or raw materials) require more fixed costs (such as factory rent or machinery depreciation). As a result, the additional output requires an increasing amount of fixed costs per unit produced, leading to a decrease in average total cost. This means that the marginal cost curve must eventually become steeper than the average variable cost curve before it intersects with the average total cost curve at a minimum point. At this point, the marginal cost is equal to the average variable cost, which is the lowest possible level of total cost for any level of output."
