                    "text": "To find how long it takes for the sphere to come to rest under these conditions, we can use Newton's second law and conservation of energy.\n\nFirst, let's consider the rotational motion of the sphere. The torque provided by the friction force on the sphere's outer surface causes it to slow down. We'll use the equation for torque:\n\n\u03c4 = I\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the torque, I is the moment of inertia (which includes both mass and radius squared), and \u03b1 is the angular acceleration.\n\nThe moment of inertia of a sphere about its center of mass is given by:\n\nI = (2/5)mr\u00b2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the sphere and r is its radius.\n\nThe friction force provides a torque equal to the moment of inertia times the angular acceleration. The friction force itself is constant, so its torque must also be constant. Therefore, we have:\n\n2.0 N * 0.30 m = (2/5)kg * 0.06 kg*m\u00b2/s\u00b2 * \u03c9\u00b2\n\nSolving for \u03c9\u00b2 gives us:\n\n\u03c9\u00b2 = 1.75 rad/s\u00b2\n\nNext, we need to convert this angular velocity into linear velocity using:\n\nv = \u03c9r\n\nwhere v is the linear velocity and r is the radius.\n\nSubstituting in our values:\n\nv = (1.75 rad/s\u00b2) * 0.30 m \u2248 0.525 m/s\n\nNow, we know that the net external force acting on the sphere must equal the change in momentum over time. The net external force is the sum of the gravitational force and the applied friction force:\n\nFnet = m * g - Ff\n\nwhere Fg is the gravitational force, which is zero since the sphere is stationary relative to Earth, and Ff is the friction force. We know that the friction force is 2.0 N and it acts perpendicular to the linear velocity, so we can write:\n\nFf = ma\n\nwhere a is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the sphere is moving downward with respect to the ground, a = -9.8 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSubstituting in our values:\n\n2.0 N = m * (-9.8 m/s\u00b2)\n\nSolving for m gives us:\n\nm = 2.0 N / (-9.8 m/s\u00b2) \u2248 0.20 kg\n\nPlugging in our values:\n\nFnet = 0.20 kg * 9.8 m/s\u00b2 - 2.0 N = 1.96 N\n\nNow, we can use Newton's second law again to solve for time. The net external force equals the change in momentum over time:\n\n1.96 N = m * (v\u00b2 - vo\u00b2)/t\n\nwhere vo is the initial velocity, t is the time, and m is the mass. We already calculated vo as 0.525 m/s. Plugging in our values:\n\n1.96 N = 0.20 kg * (0.525 m/s)^2 / t\n\nSolving for t gives us:\n\nt = (0.20 kg * (0.525 m/s)^2) / 1.96 N \u2248 0.03 s\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 0.03 s."
