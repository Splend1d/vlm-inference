Calculate the total cost of goods sold (TCGS) for May.\n3. Calculate the weighted average cost per unit using the formula: TCGS / (total number of units).\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of units sold in May:\n- May 4 sales = 20 units\n- May 17 sales = 80 units\n\nTotal units sold in May = 20 + 80 = 100 units.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total cost of goods sold (TCGS) for May:\n- Initial inventory = 200 units * $1250 = $250,000\n- Purchases for May = 116.00 + $440.00 = $456.00\n- Total purchases = $456.00 / 100 units = $4.56/units\n- Weighted average cost per unit = $4.56/units * 100 units = $456.00\n\nNow, we can calculate the WACOGS for May:\n- TCGS = $250,000 + $456.00 = $250,456.00\n- WACOGS = $250,456.00 / 100 units = $25,045.60\n\nThe closest answer choice is **$62.10**."
