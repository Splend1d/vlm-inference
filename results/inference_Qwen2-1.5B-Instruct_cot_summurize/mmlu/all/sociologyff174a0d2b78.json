In the past, there was a strong association between drug use and certain groups, such as young people or those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. However, this pattern has shifted in recent years, with drug use becoming more widespread among all age groups and socioeconomic classes. The rise of legal highs and the increasing availability of prescription drugs also contribute to this trend.\n\nWhile Ecstasy remains one of the most commonly used recreational drugs in Britain, its popularity has declined compared to other drugs like cocaine and heroin. Teenage girls are not more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys, but they may be more likely to engage in drug use due to factors such as peer pressure and cultural influences. Overall, the use of illegal drugs is still relatively uncommon in Britain, but it has become more widespread and diverse over time."
