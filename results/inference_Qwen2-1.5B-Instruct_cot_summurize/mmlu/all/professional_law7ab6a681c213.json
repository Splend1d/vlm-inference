The prosecution alleges that he murdered his wife by giving her a massive injection of succinylcholine while she was asleep. Succinylcholine is a drug used in small quantities by anesthesiologists as a muscle relaxant. The prosecution claims that the fatal dose given to the wife so totally relaxed her lung muscles that she suffocated. During the trial, a toxicologist, who had no previous knowledge of the case, sat in court and heard all of the evidence about the wife's death and autopsy. As part of the doctor's defense, his attorney calls the toxicologist to give his opinion on the cause of the wife's death. May the toxicologist so testify?\n\nA. Yes, because he can identify the data upon which his opinion is based.\nB. Yes, because an expert may base his opinion on facts made known to him at the trial.\nC. No, because he has no personal knowledge of the wife's death.\nD. No, because the cause of death is an issue to be decided by the jury.\n"

Yes, because an expert may base his opinion on facts made known to him at the trial.\n\nAn expert witness like the toxicologist can provide their opinion on the cause of death based on the information presented during the trial. In this case, the toxicologist would have been aware of the details of the autopsy report and the testimony from the doctors involved in the case. Therefore, they could offer an informed opinion based on the available evidence.\n\nHowever, it is important for the jury to make their own decision after considering all the evidence presented during the trial, including the opinions of the experts, not just rely solely on the testimony of one individual. This ensures that the verdict reflects a fair assessment of the evidence presented."
