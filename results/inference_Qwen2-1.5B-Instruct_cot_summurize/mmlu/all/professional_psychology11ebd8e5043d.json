Research suggests that children's adjustment to the divorce of their parents is most related to the quality of the parent-child relationships before the divorce, as this provides a foundation for understanding and navigating the new family dynamics. Prior to the divorce, strong and supportive parent-child relationships can help children feel secure and provide them with emotional support during the transition period. However, it is important to note that other factors such as the age of the child, the nature of the divorce, and the parenting styles of both parents also play a role in a child's adjustment to the divorce."
