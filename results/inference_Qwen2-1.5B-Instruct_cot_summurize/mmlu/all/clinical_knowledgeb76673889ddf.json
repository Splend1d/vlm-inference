Bleeding from first-degree haemorrhoids may sometimes cause mild discomfort or pain, particularly if it occurs during defecation. However, second-degree haemorrhoids can indeed be returned to the anal canal, although this procedure is typically done under anesthesia and involves making small incisions in the skin around the anus."
