But we can still proceed by calculating the t-score using the given values and then determining whether it exceeds 1.54.\n\nGiven the sample data: 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, the mean is approximately 300 mg, and there seems to be some variation between the weights (the standard deviation is around 3.8). However, since we don't have enough information to calculate the exact standard deviation from these data points, we'll proceed with the assumption that the standard deviation is 3.8 based on the given range of weights.\n\nThus, the t-score for this sample is:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{300 - 300}{3.8 / \\sqrt{7}} \\approx \\frac{0}{3.8 / \\sqrt{7}} = 0 \\]\n\nSince \\( t = 0 \\), which means \\( \\bar{x} - \\mu = 0 \\), we can conclude that the mean of the sample is exactly equal to the population mean.\n\nTherefore, the null hypothesis states that the population mean weight of the tablets is 300 mg. If the alternative hypothesis were true, we would expect to see a different mean weight, and thus a non-zero difference in the sample mean compared to the hypothesized mean.\n\nThe test statistic \\( t \\) here is simply 0 because the sample mean is equal to the population mean. Therefore, the distribution of the t-statistics will follow a Student's t-distribution with 6 degrees of freedom.\n\nFor a two-tailed test at the 5% significance level, the critical value for \\( t_{0.05}^{(df=6)} \\) is approximately 2.083. Given that \\( t = 0 \\), we can state that the observed t-statistic (0) falls within the critical region, meaning that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level.\n\nHence, the correct answer is **B. 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 6**."
