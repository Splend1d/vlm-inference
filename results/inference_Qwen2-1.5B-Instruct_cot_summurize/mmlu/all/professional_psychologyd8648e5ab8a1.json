While it has been effective in treating these conditions, its long-term use can lead to the development of tardive dyskinesia, a condition characterized by involuntary movements or abnormal body movements.\n\nTardive dyskinesia is not a common side effect of chlorpromazine, but it can occur in some individuals who have taken the drug for extended periods. The exact cause of tardive dyskinesia is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to changes in the brain caused by the prolonged use of the medication.\n\nIf you suspect that you or someone else is experiencing tardive dyskinesia, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. Treatment options for this condition include medications to reduce dopamine levels in the brain and other treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy and physical therapy."
