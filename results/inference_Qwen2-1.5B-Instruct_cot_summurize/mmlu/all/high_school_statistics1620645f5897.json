When done correctly, a stratified random sampling process has less variability from sample to sample than a simple random sample.\n\nStratified random sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups or strata based on some characteristic (such as age, income, occupation) and then randomly selecting samples from each subgroup. This allows us to estimate the characteristics of the entire population within each subgroup while also providing estimates for the overall population.\n\nSimple random sampling involves selecting individuals from the population without regard to any specific characteristic, which means that we cannot make assumptions about the characteristics of different groups within the population. Therefore, a simple random sample may have more variability from sample to sample due to differences between the individuals in the sample and the population.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that stratified random sampling can still be biased if the subgroups are not representative of the population as a whole. Additionally, a stratified random sample can still have variability from sample to sample, but it will be less than that of a simple random sample when done correctly."
