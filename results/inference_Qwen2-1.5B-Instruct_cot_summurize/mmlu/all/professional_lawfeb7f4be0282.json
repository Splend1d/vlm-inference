One day, the man set out driving his truck, heavily loaded with lumber, down a mountain road. Sitting next to the man in the passenger seat was a 19-year-old helper. During the course of the trip, when the truck was going down a long hill, the brakes failed. The man shouted to the helper to jump, but the teenager refused to do so and shouted back to the man that he should try to steer the truck down the hill. The man then opened the door on the passenger's side of the truck and negligently pushed the helper out. The helper, who suffered a broken leg, was rushed to the hospital where he was treated for his injury. As the helper was recuperating, a nurse inadvertently mixed up his chart with that of the female patient in the next room. The nurse gave the helper a fertility pill that made him sterile. If the helper brings suit against the man to recover damages for his sterility, the man will\n\nA. recover, because it is foreseeable that a hospital can be negligent in its care of patients.\nB. recover, because the man was negligent in pushing the helper out of the truck.\nC. not recover, because the nurse's act was a supervening superseding cause.\nD. not recover, because it is not foreseeable that a patient would be injured in such a manner.\n"

Not recover, because it is not foreseeable that a patient would be injured in such a manner.\n\nIn this scenario, the man's negligence in pushing the helper out of the truck caused the helper to suffer a broken leg and become infertile. This outcome was not foreseen or intended by either party involved. Therefore, the man cannot recover damages from the helper for his sterility.\n\nIt is important to note that foreseeability is a key element in determining causation in personal injury cases. If the harm could have been reasonably anticipated by one of the parties involved, they may be held liable for the harm. In this case, there was no reasonable anticipation that the man's negligence would result in the helper becoming sterile, making recovery unlikely under most circumstances."
