                    "text": "An avid stamp collector had amassed a large and valuable collection. Many of his stamps were extremely rare and highly coveted. On numerous occasions the collector had rejected offers to sell his prized collection. Finally, on December 1, the collector sent his cousin, who was also a stamp collector, the following letter:\"I've decided to part with my stamp collection. Since I want to keep it in the family, I'll sell you my entire collection for $75,000. \"The collector had dictated this letter to his secretary, who mistakenly typed \"$75,000,\" instead of $78,000 that the collector had specified. After typing the letter, the secretary gave it to the collector, who hastily signed it without noticing the mistaken price. The cousin received this letter on December 3. On December 5, the cousin sent a letter accepting the collector's offer. Which of the following correctly states the agreement's price term and its legal effect?\n\nA. The price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.\nB. The price term is $78,000, and it is enforceable.\nC. The price term is $75,000, but the court will reform the price to $78,000 in order to correct a mistake in integration.\nD. The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.\n"

The price term is $75,000, but either party can rescind the contract, because there was a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption of fact.\n\nIn this scenario, the collector made an error in specifying the price for his stamp collection. He intended to sell his collection for $78,000, but he accidentally typed $75,000. This is a fundamental mistake regarding the essential terms of the contract. As a result, the collector cannot rely on the contract as originally written due to the mutual mistake in identifying the true value of the property being transferred.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), when a contract contains an error, one of two things may happen:\n\n1. The mistake is rectified by a subsequent writing or communication between the parties that discloses the true meaning of the original instrument; if no such writing exists, then the mistake must be corrected through judicial proceedings.\n2. If neither of these remedies is available, the contract may be rescinded under certain circumstances, including where one party has relied upon the other party's mistake.\n\nIn this case, the collector could potentially rescind the contract under UCC Section 2-209(a) because he relied on the typographical error in the initial price. If the cousin accepts the offer at the incorrect price, they would have the option to rescind the contract based on the mutual mistake doctrine.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that rescission requires both parties' consent and may not always be possible depending on the specific facts of the situation. In this hypothetical scenario, the cousin would likely need to accept the rescission offer from the collector before any legal action could proceed."
