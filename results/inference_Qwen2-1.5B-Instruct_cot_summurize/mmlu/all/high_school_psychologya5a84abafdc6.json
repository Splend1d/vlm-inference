They argue that when individuals do not meet their basic physiological and psychological needs, they may develop emotional distress and become susceptible to mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and personality disorders. This perspective emphasizes the importance of addressing underlying needs in order to promote overall well-being and prevent the development of mental health issues."
