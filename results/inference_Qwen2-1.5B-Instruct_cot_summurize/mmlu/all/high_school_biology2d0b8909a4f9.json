This can lead to the emergence of new traits or phenotypes that are not present in either parent population but may be advantageous for survival or reproduction under different conditions.\n\nIn this scenario, the new variant is likely an adaptation that allows the fern to survive better in its specific environment compared to the original phenotype. The fact that breeding the original phenotype with the new one results in no offspring suggests that the new variant is not an acquired trait but rather a true evolutionary change that has emerged through natural selection acting on the genetic variation available in the population."
