                    "text": "The statement \"ED have decreased their prevalence over the last decades\" is incorrect.\n\nEating disorders (EDs) can be more prevalent in certain populations, such as those who are overweight or obese, but they do not occur exclusively among individuals who are obese. In fact, individuals of any body size can develop EDs, including young children and adolescents.\n\nIt is also important to note that eating disorders can have a range of symptoms, not just being solely about food intake or weight loss. Some common symptoms of EDs include distorted body image, restrictive eating habits, excessive exercise, and purging behaviors.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n\n- The statement \"AN has the highest mortality across all mental disorders\" is partially true. Anorexia nervosa is one of the most severe forms of ED, and individuals with this condition often die from starvation-related complications.\n  \n- BED does not occur exclusively in obese subjects; people of all body sizes can develop BED, which stands for binge-eat-disorder.\n\n- The statement \"Individuals with BN are predominantly impulsive and have comorbid borderline personality disorder\" is partially true. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by traits like impulsivity, unstable relationships, and emotional instability. However, not everyone with BPD will have BN, and the relationship between BPD and BN is complex and multifaceted. People with BN may have comorbid conditions such as anxiety or depression, while others may not have comorbid conditions at all.\n\nIn summary, none of the statements provided are entirely accurate. It's essential to understand that EDs can affect anyone regardless of body size, age, gender, or socioeconomic status, and treatment should be tailored to each individual's specific needs."
