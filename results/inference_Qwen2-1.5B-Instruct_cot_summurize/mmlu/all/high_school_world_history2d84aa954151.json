The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.\nIbn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185\nThe first passage tends to support which of the following traditional historical assumptions?\n\nA. That the majority of Muslims were more peaceful than Christians during the crusading era\nB. That most Muslims were interested only in protecting their own territory during the crusading era\nC. That many Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent\nD. That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era\n"

That the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era\n\nBased on the passages provided, it can be inferred that the majority of Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent, as evidenced by the actions of Muslim rulers who pursued the jihad and attempted to conquer the world. This is supported by the quote from Robert Irwin stating that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam. Additionally, Ibn Jubayr's statement that not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories also suggests that many Muslims during the crusading era were motivated by religious zeal rather than simply defending their own territory. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
