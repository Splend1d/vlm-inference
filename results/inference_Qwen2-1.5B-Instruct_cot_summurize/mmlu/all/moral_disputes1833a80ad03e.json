However, it is possible that he may be referring to duties that are particularly strict or severe when it comes to helping those in need, regardless of their nationality.\n\nIf this is the case, then option C (negative duties towards the global poor) could be the most appropriate interpretation. Negative duties refer to obligations or responsibilities that one has towards others, even if they are not related to their own interests or well-being. In other words, one has a duty to help others, even if doing so may cause harm to oneself.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this is just one possible interpretation of Pogge's statement, and there may be other ways to understand his meaning. Ultimately, whether someone has negative duties towards the global poor depends on their individual beliefs and values, as well as their understanding of the situation at hand."
