                    "text": "To find the fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface of the fluid, we can use Archimedes' principle which states that an object completely submerged in a fluid experiences buoyancy equal to its weight. The buoyant force on the cube will be equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the cube.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of water displaced by the cube when it is fully immersed:\n\nVolume of water displaced = Density * Volume of cube\n\n= 1200 kg/m\u00b3 * 0.5 m\u00b2 = 600 m\u00b3\n\nNow, since the cube has a side length of 0.5 m and it is made of uniform density, the volume of the cube is also 600 m\u00b3.\n\nNext, we need to calculate how much of the cube is above the surface of the fluid. Since the cube is uniform and all sides have the same area, we can divide the volume of the cube into three parts: one part above the surface, two parts below the surface. \n\nThe fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface of the fluid is thus:\n\nFraction of volume floating above = (Volume above / Total volume) * 100%\n\n= [(600 m\u00b3 - 2*0 m\u00b3) / 600 m\u00b3] * 100%\n\n= [600 m\u00b3 - 200 m\u00b3] / 600 m\u00b3 * 100%\n\n= 400 m\u00b3 / 600 m\u00b3 * 100%\n\n= 400 / 600 * 100%\n\n= 200 / 60 * 100%\n\n= 20 / 6 * 100%\n\n= 100 / 3 * 100%\n\n= 100 / 3 % or approximately 33.33%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 2.0/3."
