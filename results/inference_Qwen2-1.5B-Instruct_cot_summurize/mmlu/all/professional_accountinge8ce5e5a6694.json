The Suretyship Statute provides that if a person becomes mentally incompetent and is unable to fulfill their obligations, the Surety (in this case, Brown) is discharged from their obligation to pay the debt. Therefore, Brown would not be held liable to pay the note even if it falls due before Royal's mental incompetence is resolved. \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Not liable to pay State because Royal's incompetency discharges Royal as a surety."
