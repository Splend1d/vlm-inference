The question asks for a minor premise that, if true, would lead to a valid conclusion.\n\nOption A suggests that the speaker will not do well on the test, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether the person will also feel bad about their performance. Therefore, option A cannot lead to a valid conclusion based on the given information.\n\nOption B suggests that the speaker will not take the test at all, which contradicts the major premise stating that the person will either do well or be mad. This option directly contradicts the major premise and therefore cannot lead to a valid conclusion.\n\nOption C provides no additional information beyond what is already stated in the major premise. It simply states that someone's birthday is today, which does not provide any new information about whether the person will do well on the test or feel mad.\n\nOption D combines options A and B (which contradict each other) and C (which provides no new information). However, since option D itself contradicts the major premise, it cannot lead to a valid conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the only option that leads to a valid conclusion based on the given information is:\n\nD. Both A and B."
