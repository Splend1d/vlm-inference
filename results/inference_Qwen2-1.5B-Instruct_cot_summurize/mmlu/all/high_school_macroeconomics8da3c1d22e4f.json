The CPI is then calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{CPI} = \\frac{\\text{Nominal Income}}{\\text{Nominal Expenses}} = \\frac{100,000}{100,000} = 1 \\]\n\nThis means that you have the same amount of money but with higher prices for goods and services.\n\nNow, if the CPI increases by 2 percent, the new CPI becomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{New CPI} = 1 + 0.02 = 1.02 \\]\n\nUsing the formula for calculating the percentage change in nominal income, we can find the new nominal income after a 2 percent increase:\n\n\\[ \\Delta\\text{Nominal Income} = (\\text{New CPI} - 1) \\times \\text{Nominal Income} = (1.02 - 1) \\times 100,000 = 0.02 \\times 100,000 = 2,000 \\]\n\nSo, the nominal income has increased by 2 percent.\n\nHowever, since nominal income does not account for changes in purchasing power, we cannot directly compare the nominal income before and after the 2 percent increase without considering the impact of inflation on real income.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\n**C. Increased by 6 percent.**\n\nThe question asks about the effect of an increase in the CPI on real income, which requires understanding how nominal income is affected by the CPI while keeping in mind that real income is not directly comparable due to its reliance on purchasing power."
