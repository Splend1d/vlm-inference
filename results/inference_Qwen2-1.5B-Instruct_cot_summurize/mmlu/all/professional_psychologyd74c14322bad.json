Konrad Lorenz's research on imprinting, which involves the initial stages of life when animals are particularly receptive to learning from their environment, led him to investigate the concept of \"social referencing\" in humans. This refers to the ability of infants to learn about and respond to their caregivers' behaviors and emotional states through observation and imitation. The sensitive period for social referencing suggests that certain aspects of social behavior may be more easily learned during specific developmental periods."
