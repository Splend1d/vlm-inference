This means that the coefficient of $x^3$ on the right side must be zero, because there can't be any other terms with $x^3$ if the polynomial's degree is $2$. So we have the equation $7+q=0$.\nSolving for $q$, we get $q=-7$.\n\nSubstituting $q=-7$ into the equation $30+3q=0$, we get $30-21=29$, and thus $q=-7$.\n\nFinally, to find $p+q$, we substitute $q=-7$ into $p+q$ to get $p-7$.\n\nBut we don't need to do that. We already found that $p+q=-7$, so $p+q=\\boxed{-7}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{-7}$."
