The artist was an established designer of collectible ceramic dinnerware, and the studio did production work for many artists who created ceramic dinnerware. The price and quantity term of the contract read: \"2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery.\" The contract contained a merger clause. The studio produced the cups and saucers and delivered them along with a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 per piece). The artist refused to pay more than $10,000 (2,000 sets at $5 per set). At the trial of the studio's action against the artist for breach of contract, the studio introduced evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis. Is the studio's evidence admissible?\n\nA. No, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term of the contract.\nB. No, because the agreement was completely integrated.\nC. Yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible.\nD. Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.\n"

Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.\n\nTrade usage refers to the custom or accepted practice that exists within a particular industry or profession. In this case, the studio's evidence of their established practice of pricing cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece basis rather than a per-set basis could be considered as admissible evidence to give meaning to the contract. This would allow the court to understand the terms of the contract based on the industry standard and avoid any ambiguity regarding the number of sets being sold. Therefore, the studio's evidence is admissible."
