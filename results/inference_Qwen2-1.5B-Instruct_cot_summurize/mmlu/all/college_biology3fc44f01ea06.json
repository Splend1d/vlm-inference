                    "text": "The correct answer is A. It increases the concentration of OH-, causing the mitochondria to pump H+ to the intermembrane space.\n\nWhen the external pH is lowered, it causes the release of protons (H+) from the mitochondrial inner membrane into the intermembrane space. This creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane that drives the transport of protons back into the matrix through the proton pumps. The high concentration of H+ in the intermembrane space helps to maintain the high pH of the matrix environment, which is necessary for the production of ATP by the electron transport chain."
