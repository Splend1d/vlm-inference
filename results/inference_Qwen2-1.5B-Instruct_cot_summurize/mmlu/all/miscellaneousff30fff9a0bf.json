Absorption lines in the solar spectrum are consistent with the presence of sodium.\n\nSodium is one of the most abundant elements in the universe, and it can be detected in the Sun's atmosphere through absorption lines in its spectrum. These absorption lines have been used to determine the abundance of sodium in the Sun's atmosphere, which is higher than expected based on previous predictions. This provides strong evidence for the presence of sodium in the Sun's atmosphere."
