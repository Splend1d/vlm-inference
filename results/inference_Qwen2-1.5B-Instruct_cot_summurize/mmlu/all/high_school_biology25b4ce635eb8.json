This is because phagocytosis involves engulfing large particles or cells by pinching off a membrane from the cell surface and wrapping it around them. When this membrane wraps around a foreign particle, it triggers a series of events that ultimately leads to the fusion of the membrane with a lysosome, a organelle responsible for breaking down foreign material in the cell. Therefore, the correct answer is B: the vesicle merges with a lysosome."
