This means that less current is required to maintain the same voltage drop across each lamp. Therefore, the current flowing through each lamp remains relatively constant, regardless of the number of lamps being used. The power source (e.g., a battery or generator) still provides the same amount of energy per unit time to all lamps, so there is no need for more energy to be supplied."
