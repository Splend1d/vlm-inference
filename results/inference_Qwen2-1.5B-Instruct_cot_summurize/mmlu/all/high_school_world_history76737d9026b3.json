The text mentions that the Safavids believe in the ancient obligation of extirpation, extermination, and expulsion of evil innovation, but it does not provide any context or explanation for the reasons why they were targeted by these empires. Therefore, option A (were an expansionist empire geographically located between two other expansionists) is not supported by the given information. \n\nOption B (rejected the central tenets of Islam) is also not supported by the given information. The text mentions that the Safavids reject evil innovation, but it does not suggest that they rejected the central tenets of Islam. \n\nOption C (slavery) is not mentioned in the given text at all, so it cannot be ruled out as a possible reason for the Safavids' targeting by Islamic empires. However, there is no evidence provided in the given text to support this claim.\n\nOption D (Ismail proclaimed himself to be a Caliph) is also not mentioned in the given text at all, so it cannot be ruled out as a possible reason for the Safavids' targeting by Islamic empires. However, there is no evidence provided in the given text to support this claim either."
