After several hours, both the friend and the defendant passed out. In the middle of the night, the defendant awoke with a headache. He went down to the kitchen and poured himself another shot of whiskey. The defendant also felt hungry and decided to make himself some eggs. After fixing his snack, he inadvertently forgot to turn off the stove. A gas leak occurred, causing a fire that burned down the house. If the defendant is charged with arson, he will be found\n\nA. guilty, because the defendant was reckless.\nB. guilty, because the defendant was criminally negligent.\nC. not guilty, because the defendant did not commit a felony.\nD. not guilty, because arson requires the presence of malice.\n"

Malice aforethought (premeditation) is required for intent to kill or harm someone, but it is not necessary for arson. \n\nIn this case, the defendant was drunk and passed out in his friend's house. It is possible that he may have forgotten to turn off the stove, leading to a gas leak and subsequent fire. However, without additional evidence showing that the defendant had malicious intent to cause damage to property, he cannot be convicted of arson.\n\nTherefore, the defendant should be found guilty based on his actions being reckless rather than criminally negligent."
