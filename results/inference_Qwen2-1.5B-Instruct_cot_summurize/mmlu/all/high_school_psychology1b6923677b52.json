Providing acceleration for gifted students, especially within the areas of their interests and skills\n\nAcceleration allows gifted students to learn at their own pace while still keeping up with the rest of the class. This can help them build confidence in their abilities and develop a growth mindset. Additionally, it provides opportunities for gifted students to explore their interests and strengths more deeply, which can lead to increased motivation and engagement in the subject matter. \n\nUsing heterogeneous grouping and cooperative learning can also be effective, but they may not provide the same level of acceleration as providing acceleration directly to gifted students. Independent research projects can be beneficial for some students, but they do not address the specific needs of all gifted students."
