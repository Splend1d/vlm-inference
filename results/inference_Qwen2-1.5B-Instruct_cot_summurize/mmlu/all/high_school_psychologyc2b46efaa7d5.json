Variance.\n\nVariance measures the dispersion or spread of data points around their average (mean). It gives you an idea of how far each score falls from the average in terms of its deviation from the mean, which can be calculated by subtracting the mean from each score and squaring the result. The square root of the variance then gives you the standard deviation, which is another measure of spread that is often easier to interpret than absolute values like variance.\n\nRange, on the other hand, only tells you the difference between the highest and lowest scores without giving any information about how these scores compare to one another. Median doesn't provide any information about the shape of the distribution either; it's just the middle value when the scores are arranged in order."
