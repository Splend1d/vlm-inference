Without more context, it is difficult to determine which specific text or scriptures would be considered sacred literature.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the question is referring to a specific religion or tradition, then the answer would depend on that particular tradition's beliefs and practices. For example, in Hinduism, the Bhagavad Gita is often cited as one of the most important sacred texts due to its teachings on dharma (duty), karma, and the nature of reality. In Buddhism, the Buddha's discourses and teachings are also considered sacred literature.\n\nWithout further information, it is impossible to accurately identify which of the given options corresponds to sacred literature."
