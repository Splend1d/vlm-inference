They have also developed various forms of technology, such as agriculture, which allowed them to cultivate crops and support larger populations. Additionally, they have evolved physically to be more efficient at hunting and gathering food, which has allowed them to thrive in diverse habitats. Therefore, the ability to adapt is one of the key factors that contributed to the survival and success of anatomically modern humans."
