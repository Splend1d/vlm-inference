                    "text": "The correct answer is A. The forward static friction force of the ground on the horse is greater than any friction forces acting backward on the cart, providing a forward acceleration.\n\nWhen a horse is attached to a cart and both are at rest on a flat surface, there will be no net external force acting on the system (conservation of momentum). However, if we apply a force to one part of the system (e.g., the cart) and allow it to move, then the other part of the system (the horse) will experience a reaction force that opposes the motion. This reaction force causes the cart to move in the direction opposite to the applied force.\n\nIn this scenario, the force exerted by the horse on the cart is not sufficient to cause the cart to accelerate due to the lack of sufficient opposing force. The only way for the cart to accelerate is through the action of the ground, which applies a forward force to the cart (static friction) that exceeds the backward force of the cart on the ground. As a result, the cart experiences a forward acceleration.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct explanation for how the horse-cart system can accelerate from rest when the horse applies a force to the cart but does not provide enough force to overcome the backward forces acting on the cart."
