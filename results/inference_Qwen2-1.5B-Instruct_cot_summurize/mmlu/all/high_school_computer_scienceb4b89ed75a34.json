Selection sort can still perform well even when the array is already sorted in descending order. For example, if we have 50000 items, and each item is greater than all other items by at least one, then selection sort could potentially make many comparisons but would only need to move a few items around.\n\nFor B: It is not necessarily true that the number of comparisons for selection sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements. In fact, the number of comparisons needed to sort an array with n elements is proportional to n^2, so it does depend on the initial arrangement of elements.\n\nFor C: It is not necessarily true that the number of comparisons for insertion sort is independent of the initial arrangement of elements. Insertion sort works by repeatedly moving larger elements to the beginning of the array until the entire array is sorted. Therefore, as long as there are any elements in the array that are not already in their correct position, there will always be some comparisons made to insert them correctly.\n\nFor D: It is not necessarily true that the number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements. Selection sort works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it at its correct position in the sorted portion. However, this operation involves shifting elements around within the sorted portion of the array, so there may be a small amount of data movement involved depending on how the array is initially arranged."
