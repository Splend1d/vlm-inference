Heuristics are algorithms that rely on heuristics (heuristic functions) to find solutions to problems. In this case, the program uses a heuristic to determine the optimal path for the driver, rather than relying solely on brute force search or other methods. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem being solved, and different algorithms may be more appropriate depending on the context and requirements of the task at hand."
