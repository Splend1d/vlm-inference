Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nThe free flow of plants and animals, as well as trade goods, between Europe and the Americas is referred to by historians as the Columbian Exchange, and affected the Europeans in which of the following ways?\n\nA. Economic opportunities were reduced.\nB. They were subjugated and destroyed.\nC. Economic opportunities were created.\nD. They were enriched through trade in Native American slaves.\n"

Economic opportunities were created.\n\nThe Columbian Exchange refers to the widespread exchange of plant species, animal species, and other items between Europe and the Americas during the period from the late 15th century until about the mid-18th century. This exchange had several impacts on both continents:\n\n1. Economic opportunities: The exchange allowed for the introduction of new crops and animals that could support European diets and economies. For example, wheat, potatoes, tobacco, and horses spread across the New World, while sugar, coffee, and chocolate became major exports.\n\n2. Social structures: The exchange also impacted social structures, particularly among Native Americans. Some tribes adapted to new agricultural practices, while others were displaced by settlers or forced into slavery. The exchange also introduced diseases that decimated Native American populations, leading to significant demographic changes.\n\n3. Trade relations: The Columbian Exchange facilitated the growth of colonial trade networks, allowing Europeans to engage directly with indigenous peoples and gain access to resources previously unavailable.\n\n4. Cultural diffusion: The exchange also resulted in cultural diffusion, as various elements of pre-Columbian cultures mixed with those of the Americas. However, it's important to note that this process was often accompanied by violence, exploitation, and displacement of indigenous populations.\n\nTherefore, option C (economic opportunities were created) best represents the overall impact of the Columbian Exchange on both Europe and the Americas."
