The letter stated, \"I want to sell my antique Ford Roadster for a price above $20,000. If you are interested please contact me.\" Three days later Bobby sent a letter to Susan stating \"I agree to pay your asking price of $20,000 for the 1932 Ford Roadster.\" The next day Susan sold the car to Harriet Higherprice for $25,000. If Bobby brings suit against Susan for breach of contract, the likely outcome is\n\nA. For Bobby, since her acceptance was timely under the mail box rule.\nB. For Susan, because her letter to Bobby was not an offer.\nC. For Susan, because the sale to Harriett was made before Susan was aware that Bobby had accepted.\nD. For Bobby, because her communication met the full price which Susan was asking for the automobile.\n"

For Bobby, because his communication with Susan meeting the full price she was asking for the automobile meets the requirements of an acceptance.\n\nAn acceptance is an expression by the offeree that the offer has been accepted and that the offeror will be bound by it. In this case, Bobby's letter accepting Susan's price of $20,000 for the 1932 Ford Roadster is an acceptance because it clearly states that he agrees to pay that amount and indicates that the transaction is complete. Therefore, Bobby can sue Susan for breach of contract based on his acceptance."
