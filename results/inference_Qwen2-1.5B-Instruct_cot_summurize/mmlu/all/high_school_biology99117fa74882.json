None of the individual insects should have possessed genomes that made them resistant to DDT.\n\nInsect resistance to pesticides like DDT can develop over time through various mechanisms such as genetic mutations or natural selection. Therefore, if all individuals within a population were susceptible to DDT, it would not have been possible for the pesticide to effectively eliminate the pests. However, if only some individuals were resistant, the rest could still be killed by other means such as predators or competition with non-resistant individuals. \n\nThe effectiveness of an insecticide like DDT depends on several factors including its mode of action (e.g., contact with skin or eggs), the duration of exposure, and the availability of alternative hosts or predators. It's important to note that while DDT has been effective historically in controlling certain types of insect pests, there are now numerous alternatives available that can be used more sustainably and safely."
