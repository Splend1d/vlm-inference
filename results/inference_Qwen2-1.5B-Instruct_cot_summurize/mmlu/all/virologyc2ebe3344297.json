These viruses mutate and hence emerge.\n\nEmerging viruses, such as Zika and Ebola, often emerge from wild animal reservoirs or from animals that have been infected with these viruses but remain asymptomatic for some time. This means that these viruses may not always cause symptoms in humans and therefore may not trigger an immune response until they enter the human population. Additionally, emerging viruses may also undergo genetic mutations that make them more virulent or able to infect different host species.\n\nTherefore, it is important to monitor and control the habitats of wildlife that may harbor these viruses, as well as to develop effective vaccines and treatments to prevent their emergence and spread."
