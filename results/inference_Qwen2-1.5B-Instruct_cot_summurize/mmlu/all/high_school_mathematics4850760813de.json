Therefore, the slope of this line is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSimilarly, for the second line $ax + 2y + 3 = 0$, we get $2y = -ax - 3$, so $y = -\\frac{a}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}$ or $y = -\\frac{a}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, the slope of this line is also $-\\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nFor these two lines to be perpendicular, their slopes must satisfy the condition that their product is $-1$. So we have:\n\n$$\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right) = -1.$$\n\nSimplifying the left side gives $\\frac{a}{4} = -1$, which implies $a = -4$.\n\nSo the value of $a$ is $-4$. The answer is: A. -4"
