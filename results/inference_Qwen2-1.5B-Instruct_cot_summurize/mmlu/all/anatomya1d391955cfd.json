The ileum is the final segment of the small intestine before it transitions into the large intestine (colon). It is responsible for absorbing nutrients from food that have been broken down in the duodenum and jejunum. \n\nThe ascending colon and sigmoid colon are both part of the large intestine and not the small intestine. The sigmoid colon is located at the transition between the large and small intestines, while the ascending colon is located at the top end of the small intestine just below the stomach."
