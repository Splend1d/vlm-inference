They ascribe to the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human, and suppose what they did to be beyond amendment\u2026.But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.\"\nThomas Jefferson, 1816\nWhich of the following best describes a contributing factor in the crafting of the United States Constitution?\n\nA. Individual state constitutions written at the time of the Revolution tended to cede too much power to the federal government, leading to a call for reform on the part of Anti-Federalists.\nB. The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation led James Madison to question their efficacy and prompted a formation of the Constitutional Congress in 1787\nC. Difficulties over trade and foreign relations led to a repeal of overly restrictive tariffs required by the Articles of Confederation.\nD. Washington's embarrassing failure at the Whiskey Rebellion led to Federalist demands for a new framework for federal power.\n"

He argued that the Articles of Confederation were inadequate because it allowed for too much power to be concentrated in the hands of the states rather than being distributed among the three branches of government. In 1787, he proposed the creation of a stronger central government to replace the Articles of Confederation. This proposal was supported by other Founding Fathers such as Alexander Hamilton, who believed that a strong central government was necessary to prevent the rise of dictators and maintain national unity. The Constitutional Convention in 1787 was held to create a new constitution that would address these issues and establish a more powerful central government."
