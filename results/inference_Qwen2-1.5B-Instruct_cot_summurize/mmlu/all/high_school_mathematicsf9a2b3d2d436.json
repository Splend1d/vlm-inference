Each of the five chosen numbers must have a distinct tens digit.\nTo count the number of ways to choose 5 numbers with distinct tens digits out of the 5 possible choices, we use combinations. The formula for combinations is $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items and $k$ is the number of items to choose.\nSo the number of ways to choose 5 numbers with distinct tens digits is $\\binom{5}{5} = \\frac{5!}{5!(5-5)!} = 1$.\nThe total number of ways to choose any 5 numbers from the given range (between 20 and 69) is $\\binom{58}{5} = \\frac{58!}{5!(58-5)!} = \\frac{58*57*56*55*54}{5*4*3*2*1} = 2500$.\nTherefore, the probability that the 5 chosen numbers all have distinct tens digits is $\\frac{1}{2500}$.\nThe answer is: D. \\(\\frac{2500}{52969}\\)"
