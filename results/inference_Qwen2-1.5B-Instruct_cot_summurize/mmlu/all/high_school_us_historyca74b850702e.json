We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, \"A plague on both your houses.\" \u2026 Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.\n\u2014Senator George McGovern, \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\nThe sentiments expressed in the speech above most directly influenced which of the following?\n\nA. The passage of the War Powers Act of 1973\nB. The Tet Offensive of 1968\nC. The resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974\nD. The emergence of a youth counterculture\n"

The Tet Offensive of 1968\n\nThe statement expresses a strong anti-war sentiment against the Vietnam War, specifically criticizing the use of bombing and aerial warfare tactics by the United States. This sentiment likely influenced Senator George McGovern's call for an end to bombing in his speech, as well as the subsequent passage of the War Powers Act of 1973, which limited presidential authority to commit armed forces without congressional approval.\n\nThe other options do not reflect the sentiment expressed in the text:\n\n- A. The passage of the War Powers Act of 1973: This act did not address the specific concerns expressed in the text regarding the use of bombing and aerial warfare tactics.\n- C. The resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974: While Richard Nixon is mentioned, the context suggests that the speaker is addressing the broader issue of the Vietnam War, rather than focusing on any individual political figure.\n- D. The emergence of a youth counterculture: This option does not relate to the specific issues raised in the text about the Vietnam War."
