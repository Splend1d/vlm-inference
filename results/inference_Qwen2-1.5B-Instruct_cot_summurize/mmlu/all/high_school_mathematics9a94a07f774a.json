                    "text": " The probability that Bob rolls a composite number (2, 3, or 5) on a single roll of a six-sided die is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability that Bob rolls a prime number (2, 3, or 5) on a single roll of a six-sided die is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nIn a non-leap year, there are 365 days.\nFor each day, there is a $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$ chance that Bob will roll a composite number or a prime number.\nSo, in a non-leap year, the expected number of times Bob will roll his die is $365 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}) = 365 \\cdot 1 = 365$. However, this is not one of the given options.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem. We know that Bob rolls a die every morning and eats either sweetened cereal or unsweetened cereal depending on whether he rolls a composite or prime number. There are 3 possible outcomes for each roll: a composite number, a prime number, or a 1 followed by another roll. Since we want to find the expected number of times Bob rolls his die in a non-leap year, we need to calculate the average number of times he rolls his die over all 365 days.\n\nThe probability of rolling a composite number is $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the probability of rolling a prime number is also $\\frac{1}{2}$. So, the expected number of times Bob rolls his die per day is:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}.$$\n\nTo find the total number of times Bob rolls his die in a non-leap year, we multiply the daily expectation by the number of days in a non-leap year, which is 365:\n$$365 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 121.\\overline{3}.$$\nThis is not an option, so let's reevaluate our calculations.\n\nUpon revisiting the problem, we realize that we made a mistake in calculating the expected number of times Bob rolls his die per day. The correct calculation should be:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}}{3} = \\frac{1}{3},$$\nbut we should multiply this by the number of days in a non-leap year, which is 365, to get the total number of times Bob rolls his die in a non-leap year:\n$$365 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = 121.\\overline{3}.$$\nThis is still not one of the given options.\n\nUpon further review, we realize that we misunderstood the problem statement. The problem asks for the expected number of times Bob rolls his die in a non-leap year, not the total number of times he rolls his die. The expected number of times Bob rolls his die in a non-leap year is simply the probability of rolling a composite number multiplied by the number of days in a non-leap year.\n\nThe probability of rolling a composite number is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and the number of days in a non-leap year is 365. Therefore, the expected number of times Bob rolls his die in a non-leap year is:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 365 = 182.5.$$\nHowever, since the number of times Bob rolls his die must be a whole number, we can conclude that the expected number of times Bob rolls his die in a non-leap year is 182.5, but it cannot be more than this because it would imply that Bob rolls his die infinitely many times in a year. Therefore, the expected number of times Bob rolls his die in a non-leap year is 182.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $\\boxed{1825/4}$."
