They are particularly useful for generating sine waves at specific frequencies within the range of 100 kHz to 500 MHz.\n\nIt's important to note that LC oscillators can be used to generate a wide range of other waveforms, including square waves, sawtooth waves, and triangular waves, but the frequency ranges listed above are typical applications of LC oscillators."
