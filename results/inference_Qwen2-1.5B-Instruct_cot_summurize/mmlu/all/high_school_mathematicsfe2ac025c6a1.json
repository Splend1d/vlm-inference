Then we have the given ratio $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nWe want to find the ratio of $x$ to $y$, which can be written as $\\frac{x}{y}$.\nFrom the equation $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{2}{3}$, we can cross multiply to get $3a = 2b$.\nNow, let's substitute $a = 2x - y$ into this equation: $3(2x - y) = 2(x + y)$.\nExpanding both sides gives $6x - 3y = 2x + 2y$, or $6x - 2x = 3y + 2y$, or $4x = 5y$.\nDividing both sides by $4y$ (since $x/y = 5/4$), we get $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nSo the answer is A. \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{4}}\\)."
