Therefore, doubling the frequency would have no effect on the separation between the bright fringes.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**No change in the separation of the bright fringes**\n\nThis means that if the frequency of the laser light is doubled, the separation of the bright fringes remains at 1.0 millimeter (which is equivalent to 0.01 meters).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1.0 mm."
