The international recognition of human rights after WWII.\n\nThe International Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations were established following World War II, which recognized the importance of respecting individual rights and dignity, including those of prisoners of war, civilians, and political opponents. This recognition led to an increased awareness of the need for universal human rights, and the development of legal frameworks that protected these rights. As a result, there was a renewed emphasis on natural law principles in the 20th century, particularly in Western democracies."
