Hormones produced by the placenta can affect the fetal brain development, which in turn can impact the emotional behavior of the child later in life. Additionally, stress and other negative emotions during pregnancy have been linked to increased risk for certain conditions in the newborn, including low birth weight and preterm birth. However, it is important to note that these effects vary from person to person and can be influenced by various factors."
