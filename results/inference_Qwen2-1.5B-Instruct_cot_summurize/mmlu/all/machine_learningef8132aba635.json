Higher variance.\n\nIn machine learning, when you train a model on more and more training examples, it tends to produce more complex models with higher accuracy but also higher variance - meaning that the predictions made by the model can be very different from one example to another, even if the underlying relationship between features and target variable remains constant. This is because as the dataset grows, the model has access to more information and can make better predictions on average, but this comes at the cost of making predictions outside the range of the training data. Therefore, while the variance may decrease slightly in the long run due to the law of large numbers, the overall variability of the model's predictions will increase over time."
