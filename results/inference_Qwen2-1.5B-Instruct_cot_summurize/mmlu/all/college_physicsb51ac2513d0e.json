The length of the rectangular aperture is given as 0.14 meters. \n\nTo find the order of the diffraction pattern, we need to solve for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ \\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{0.14}{0.14 + 1} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{0.14}{1.14} \\]\n\\[ n = 2 \\]\n\nThis means there are two orders of diffraction patterns present in the diffraction pattern.\n\nNow, let's calculate the wavelength of the sound wave at the speaker:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = v = f \\cdot \\nu \\]\n\\[ \\lambda = 350 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\\[ \\nu = \\frac{\\lambda}{f} = \\frac{350}{f} \\]\n\nFor each order of diffraction pattern, the corresponding frequency \\( f \\) is calculated by:\n\n\\[ f_1 = f \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2f \\]\n\\[ f_2 = f \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}f \\]\n\nThe sum of these frequencies should equal the total frequency \\( f \\) of all orders of diffraction patterns:\n\n\\[ 2f + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}f = f \\]\n\\[ \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}f = f \\]\n\\[ f = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 1.96 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nSince \\( \\nu = \\frac{350}{1.96} \\), we get:\n\n\\[ \\nu = 1,750 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 1,750 Hz."
