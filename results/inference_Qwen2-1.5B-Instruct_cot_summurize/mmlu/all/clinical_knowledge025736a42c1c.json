The answer to which of the following statements about the spine is true depends on the specific statement being asked.\n\nA. False: While back pain can be a common complaint, it is not uncommon for people to experience back pain at some point in their lives.\nB. True: Schober's test is a clinical examination used to assess the range of motion (ROM) of the lumbar spine. It involves applying pressure to the lower back and observing how far the person can bend forward without causing pain or discomfort.\nC. False: Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine and joints, but it does not directly cause hypermobility of the spine.\nD. True: Pregnancy can cause changes in the curvature of the spine, leading to a decrease in the lordosis of the lumbar spine. This is known as gestational kyphoscoliosis and can cause back pain and other symptoms. However, pregnancy is also associated with other changes in the spine, such as increased muscle tone and greater flexibility, which can help prevent spinal disorders."
