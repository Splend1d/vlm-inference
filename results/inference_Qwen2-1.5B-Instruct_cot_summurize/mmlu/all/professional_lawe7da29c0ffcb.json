The rule against perpetuities.\n\nThe rule against perpetuities is a common law principle that prohibits certain types of transfers from passing through to future generations without an end date. In this scenario, the conveyance to the heirs of the owner is considered to be perpetuating, as it does not have an end date. Therefore, under the rule against perpetuities, the conveyance is invalid and the deed results in a life estate to Friend with a reversion back to Owner."
