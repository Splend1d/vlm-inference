It also eliminates waste products from the fetus. The placenta is made up of three layers: the syncytiotrophoblast, which forms the innermost layer; the trophoblast, which lines the outside of the placenta; and the myometrium, which lines the inside of the uterus. The placenta is essential for the survival of the developing embryo."
