This is because port states have the responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their territorial waters, including preventing the illegal activities of foreign vessels. While some crimes may be committed by foreign vessels in port, such as smuggling or piracy, these offenses are typically handled through diplomatic channels or international agreements rather than local law enforcement."
