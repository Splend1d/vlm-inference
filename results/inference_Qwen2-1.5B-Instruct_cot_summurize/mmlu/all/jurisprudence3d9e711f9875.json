This type of solidarity tends to produce conflict within society as people struggle to maintain their own interests against those of others. In this context, mechanical solidarity leads to conflict and repressive laws.\n\nOrganic solidarity, on the other hand, is based on mutual dependence and interdependence among individuals. It involves a sense of belonging and shared values among members of a group, which helps to foster cooperation and reduce conflict. Organic solidarity leads to a more harmonious society and the development of restitutive laws rather than repressive ones.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Mechanical solidarity produces conflict in society. Organic solidarity leads to greater social harmony."
