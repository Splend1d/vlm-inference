This is because the body has mechanisms to compensate for the loss of blood volume by adjusting heart rate and blood pressure. However, if the blood loss is too severe, these compensatory mechanisms may not be sufficient to maintain adequate blood flow to vital organs. In such cases, more significant losses may require immediate medical intervention."
