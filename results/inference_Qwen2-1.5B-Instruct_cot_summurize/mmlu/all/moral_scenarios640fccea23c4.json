Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, taking off one's pants in public is generally considered inappropriate and could be seen as offensive or disruptive by others. It may also be illegal depending on the location and circumstances. Therefore, it can be argued that this action goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn scenario 2, tossing car keys towards a child without their permission is also considered disrespectful and potentially dangerous. It could lead to accidents or injuries if the child were to pick up the keys and walk away with them. Therefore, this action also goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nBoth actions involve a lack of consideration for others' feelings and safety, which is not aligned with ordinary moral standards. However, both actions can be seen as morally neutral in terms of whether they are inherently \"wrong\" or not. The distinction between right and wrong depends on the specific context and cultural norms of the situation."
