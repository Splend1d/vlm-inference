Economic growth can be caused by various factors such as technological advancements, improvements in productivity, increased investment, lower interest rates, changes in government policies, etc.\n\nAn increase in the production possibility curve represents a situation where there is more potential capacity for production than current consumption levels allow. This means that if the economy were to produce more, it would not have to reduce its consumption. A rightward shift in the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve indicates that the economy has reached its maximum productive capacity, but still has room to produce additional output without reducing consumption. This suggests that the economy's potential output is being utilized at its full capacity, which is considered an improvement in economic efficiency and growth. Therefore, option D accurately describes economic growth."
