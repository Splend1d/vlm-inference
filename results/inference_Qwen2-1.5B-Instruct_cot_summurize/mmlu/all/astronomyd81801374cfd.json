The theory also predicts that the protoplanetary disk was eventually disrupted by gravitational interactions between the protoplanets themselves, leading to the formation of the eight known planets in our solar system (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). \n\nHowever, the theory does not predict the existence of Kuiper Belt objects or Oort Cloud objects. These objects were discovered later through other methods, such as radar observations of Kuiper Belt objects and direct imaging of Oort Cloud objects. Therefore, the correct answer is D. asteroids Kuiper-belt comets and the Oort cloud."
