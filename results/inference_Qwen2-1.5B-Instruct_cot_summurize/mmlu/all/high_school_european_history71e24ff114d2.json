All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter; Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French radicals and German police spies.\nTwo things result from this fact.\nI. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power.\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\"\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nIn this passage, Marx and Engels seem to be chiefly preoccupied with\n\nA. provoking fear to drive their readers to action\nB. attacking the extreme communists who threatened to sink the entire movement\nC. demonstrating the understanding of the others in point of fact\nD. explaining the reasons for debunking opponents of communism\n"

In this passage, Marx and Engels are using the specter of Communism as a metaphorical tool to scare their readers into believing in the necessity of their own beliefs. They are not primarily concerned with attacking or debunking opponents of communism, nor are they trying to demonstrate the understanding of others in point of fact. Instead, they are using the specter of Communism as a means of rallying support for their cause and creating a sense of urgency among their readers."
