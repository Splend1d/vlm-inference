In other words, it measures how closely related two individuals are. According to Hamilton's rule, an altruistic trait can evolve if the fitness cost to the donor (c) is less than or equal to the fitness benefit to the recipient (b), which is equivalent to having a positive value for r. This condition ensures that the altruistic trait will be favored by natural selection because it increases the likelihood of passing on its beneficial effects to future generations."
