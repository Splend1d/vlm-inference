Involuntary manslaughter.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter occurs when someone causes death by committing an act that is not intentional or voluntary but results in harm due to circumstances beyond their control. This could include a situation where someone unintentionally causes harm through no fault of their own, such as a car accident caused by road conditions or a medical error resulting from a doctor's negligence. In this case, the defendant's intent was not to cause harm, but the accidental injury occurred due to unforeseen circumstances, which is why he cannot be charged with murder under the legal definition. Therefore, the most serious charge would be involuntary manslaughter."
