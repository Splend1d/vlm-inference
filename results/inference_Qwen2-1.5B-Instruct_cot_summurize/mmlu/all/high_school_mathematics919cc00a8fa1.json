We want to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down (\\(r\\)) when the foot of the ladder is 10 ft from the building, i.e., \\(x(0) = 10\\).\n\nDifferentiating both sides of the equation for \\(x\\) with respect to time \\(t\\):\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{d(h)}{dt} = -r \\]\n\nNow, differentiate \\(h(t)\\) with respect to time \\(t\\):\n\\[ \\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{d(x+L-L\\sin(\\theta))}{dt} = \\cos(\\theta) \\]\n\nSince \\(x(0) = 10\\), we substitute \\(x(0) = 10\\) into the equation for \\(h(t)\\):\n\\[ h(t) = 10 + L - L\\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\\[ h(t) = 10 + L(1 - \\sin(\\theta)) \\]\n\nSubstitute this expression for \\(h(t)\\) back into the equation for \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\) and solve for \\(r\\):\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = -r \\]\n\\[ -r = \\cos(\\theta) \\]\n\nThe cosine function has a period of \\(2\\pi\\), but since we only care about the rate of change at a particular point in time (when \\(x(0) = 10\\)), we can divide both sides by \\(2\\pi\\) to get:\n\\[ \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\]\n\nHowever, we don't need to solve for \\(r\\) directly; instead, we need to express it in terms of \\(r\\). Since the rate of change of the base of the ladder with respect to time is constant, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} \\cdot \\frac{dr}{dt} \\]\n\\[ -r = \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} \\cdot r \\]\n\\[ -r^2 = r \\cdot \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} = -\\frac{r}{r} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} = -1 \\]\n\nThus, the rate of change of the base of the ladder with respect to time is negative one, meaning the base of the ladder is moving towards the building at a rate of 1 ft/s. However, we were asked to find the rate of change when the top of the ladder is moving down (\\(r\\)). Since \\(r\\) represents the rate of change of the top of the ladder, and we've determined that the base of the ladder is moving towards the building at 1 ft/s, we must have made a mistake in our interpretation or calculation. \n\nUpon reevaluation, recognizing that the question asks for the rate of change of the top of the ladder, not the base of the ladder, I realize there was a misunderstanding in my approach. Let me correct this:\n\nWhen the top of the ladder is moving down (\\(h(t)\\)), the rate of change of the top of the ladder is \\(r\\) ft/s. This means the rate of change of the height of the ladder above the ground is \\(r\\) ft/s. To find the rate of change of the base of the ladder (which would be the rate at which the foot of the ladder moves away from the building), we need to consider the relationship between \\(h(t)\\) and \\(x(t)\\).\n\nGiven \\(h(t) = x(t) + L - L\\sin(\\theta)\\), we differentiate both sides with respect to"
