This refers to the ability of a virus to infect and replicate in host cells, leading to illness or death. Other factors such as the size of the virus (geometry), number of proteins it contains, and the chemistry of its genetic material can also be considered, but they do not directly determine the pathogenicity of a virus. Therefore, C is the correct answer."
