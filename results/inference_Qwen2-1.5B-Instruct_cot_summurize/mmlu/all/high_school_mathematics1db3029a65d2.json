However, since we're looking for divisibility by $3$, this condition alone does not guarantee divisibility by $3$.\n  \n- For divisibility by $3$, consider the sum of all digits. Since the last digit is $0$, we only need to worry about the sum of the remaining digits.\n\n- Among the given integers: \n  - $2$: The sum of digits (2) is divisible by $3$.\n  - $3$: Divisible by both $1$ and $3$ but not by $3$ itself.\n  - $4$: Not divisible by $1$ or $3$.\n  - $5$: Not divisible by $1$ or $3$.\n  - $6$: Divisible by both $1$ and $3$.\n  - $8$: Divisible by both $1$ and $3$.\n  - $9$: Divisible by both $1$ and $3$.\n\nThus, among these numbers, $2, 6, 8$ necessarily divide any number ending in $0$ whose sum of digits is divisible by $3$. Therefore, the answer is **B. 2**."
