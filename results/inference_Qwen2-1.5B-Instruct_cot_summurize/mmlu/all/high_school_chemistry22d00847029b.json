                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The \u2013O\u2013H bonds in nitric acid are much weaker than in nitrous acid due to the electron withdrawing of more oxygen atoms on nitric acid.\nNitrous acid (NH3) is a strong acid that dissociates completely into ammonia and hydrogen gas when it is dissolved in water. Nitric acid (HNO3), on the other hand, is a weak acid that only partially dissociates in water, with most of the H+ ions remaining unreacted.\nThe reason for this difference in acidity lies in the electronegativity differences between the nitrogen atoms. Nitrogen is a highly electronegative element, which means that it attracts electrons more strongly than other elements. This makes it difficult for the negative charge of the hydrogen ion to fully withdraw from the nitrate ion in nitrous acid.\nIn contrast, nitric acid contains three oxygen atoms, each of which is bonded to two nitrogen atoms. This results in a larger number of negatively charged oxygen atoms compared to nitrous acid, which allows them to more easily attract and withdraw electrons from the hydrogen ion.\nOverall, the electron-withdrawing effect of the more oxygen atoms in nitric acid leads to a weaker bond between the nitrate ion and the hydrogen ion, resulting in a less acidic solution."
