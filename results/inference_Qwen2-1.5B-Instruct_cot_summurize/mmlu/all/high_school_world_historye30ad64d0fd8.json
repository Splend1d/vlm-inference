And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat evidence is there in the passage that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously?\n\nA. The genealogy is derived from the maternal side.\nB. They study Islamic law faithfully.\nC. The men do not yield to sexual jealousy.\nD. They enjoy friendship with all, regardless of gender.\n"

                    "text": "The passage provides several pieces of evidence that suggest the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously:\n\nA. The genealogy is derived from the maternal side: This suggests that the Malians value tradition and continuity within their religious beliefs, which could indicate a serious commitment to Islam.\n\nB. They study Islamic law faithfully: The mention of studying \"fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence) implies that the Malians are actively seeking knowledge about their religion, which shows a deep respect for its teachings.\n\nC. The men do not yield to sexual jealousy: Sexual jealousy is a taboo in many cultures, and the fact that the Malians do not experience it indicates a strong adherence to traditional values regarding sexuality and marital fidelity.\n\nD. They enjoy friendship with all, regardless of gender: While this statement may seem unrelated at first glance, it could also suggest a high degree of respect for the diversity of human relationships and the importance of maintaining positive connections across different genders. However, without additional context or specific examples, this statement alone does not provide direct evidence of their seriousness towards their faith.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The men do not yield to sexual jealousy."
