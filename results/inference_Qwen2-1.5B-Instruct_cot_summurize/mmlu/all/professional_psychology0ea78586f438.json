When Dr. Vasquez finds that he does not have time to see all of the clients who want to begin therapy with him, he begins referring some of them to Dr. Banquist and charges her 30% of the fee that Dr. Banquist collects from these referred clients. Acording to the ethics codes published by the American and Canadian Psychological Associations, charging more for referred clients is:\n\nA. \"unethical because it violates the prohibition against \u201cfee splitting.\"\"\"\nB. unethical because it creates an unacceptable multiple relationship.\nC. ethical only if the higher fee for referred clients re\ufb02ects the actual costs associated with the referrals.\nD. \"ethical because referral fees are prohibited only when they are \"\"clearly exploitative.\u201d\"\n"
