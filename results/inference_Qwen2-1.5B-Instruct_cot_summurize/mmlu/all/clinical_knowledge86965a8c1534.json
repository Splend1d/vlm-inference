Urea and uric acid.\n\nDuring intense physical activity, such as sprinting, the body breaks down ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is used to generate energy for muscle contractions. This process releases ADP (adenosine diphosphate) into the bloodstream, which then undergoes degradation to release ammonia, urea, and uric acid.\n\nAmmonia is an intermediate product in the breakdown of amino acids and can be released from the brain or liver. It is toxic and must be filtered out by the kidneys before it can be excreted. Uric acid is also formed through the breakdown of purines, which are found in the diet and are broken down in the body to produce uric acid. Excess uric acid can build up in the blood and lead to gout, a painful condition caused by high levels of uric acid in the joints.\n\nCreatine phosphate is another compound that can be degraded to produce these byproducts, but it does not play a significant role in the production of ATP during sprinting."
