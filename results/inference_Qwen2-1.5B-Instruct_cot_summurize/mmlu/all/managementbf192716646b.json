Productivity\n\nThe 'rational goal' model of management emphasizes productivity as the primary goal of organizations, focusing on efficiency and output rather than on worker welfare, health and safety, or interpersonal relationships. This approach is often characterized by a focus on individual performance metrics such as production rates, quality standards, and cost savings. While other aspects of management (such as worker welfare, health and safety, and interpersonal relationships) may also be important to consider in achieving organizational goals, they are not typically given as much emphasis in the rational goal perspective."
