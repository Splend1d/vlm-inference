He is receiving intravenous 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium. Twelve hours after the operation he develops circumoral numbness and paresthesias in his fingertips, and he becomes very anxious. Vital signs are temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.7\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses a dry neck dressing and no stridor. Extremities are warm, with brisk capillary refill time. Additional physical examination is most likely to show which of the following?\n\nA. Babinski sign present bilaterally\nB. Chvostek sign\nC. Deviation of the tongue to the left side\nD. A drooping left shoulder\n"

This could be due to the fact that he is receiving high doses of 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium, which can cause electrolyte imbalances such as hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can lead to muscle weakness and paralysis, including the drooping of the left shoulder. Therefore, the correct answer is D. A drooping left shoulder. \n\nThe other options do not seem to be related to the symptoms described in the question. The Babinski sign involves the sensory examination of the foot, while the Chvostek sign is used to evaluate the function of the facial nerve. The deviation of the tongue to the left side would indicate a problem with the cranial nerves, but it is not directly related to the symptoms described."
