This means that if we have a number k such that S(k) is true, then S(k+1) is also true. \n\nFurthermore, there exists some positive integer n0 such that S(n0) is not true. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that S(n0+1) is not true because if S(n0) was true, then S(n0+1) would also be true by our first condition. Similarly, we can conclude that S(n0-1) is not true because if S(n0) was true, then S(n0-1) would also be true by our first condition.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude that S(n) is not true for any n<=n0 or that S(n) is not true for any n>=n0 based solely on this information. We need more information to make these conclusions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nNone of the above."
