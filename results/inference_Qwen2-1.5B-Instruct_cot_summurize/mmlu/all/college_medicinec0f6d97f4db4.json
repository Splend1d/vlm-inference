                    "text": "The correct answer is B: converted into alanine and glutamine and released from the muscle.\n\nDuring protein catabolism (i.e., when proteins are broken down for energy), the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine are first deaminated by enzymes in the liver to form the corresponding \u03b1-keto acids. These \u03b1-keto acids then enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and are oxidized to form carbon dioxide and water, along with the formation of two molecules of alpha-ketoglutarate.\n\nAlpha-ketoglutarate then enters the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle) and is reduced back to oxaloacetate. This process releases carbon dioxide and produces two molecules of succinate.\n\nIn the mitochondria, succinate is further reduced to fumarate, which can be further reduced to malate or is directly converted to acetyl-CoA. The latter is then transported out of the mitochondria and enters the glycolytic pathway, where it can either enter the citric acid cycle or enter the pentose phosphate pathway to produce ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH.\n\nRibose-5-phosphate can be further processed in the pentose phosphate pathway to form diphosphorus ribulokinase, which catalyzes the reduction of 2,6-dichloro-indol-3,4-dione to 2,6-dihydroxyindole-3-carboxylate. This intermediate can be further reduced to 3-methyl-d-aspartate (MMDA), which can be further reduced to 3-methyl-d-glutamate (MMG). MMG can be further reduced to 5-hydroxymethyl-furanose (HMF), which can be further reduced to 5-hydroxymethyl-2-deoxyglucose (HMDD).\n\nHMDD can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-1-pentulose (G1P), which can be further reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be further reduced to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), which can be further reduced to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), which can be further reduced to lactate, which can be further reduced to ethanol, which can be further reduced to carbon dioxide, which can be further reduced to carbon dioxide, which can be further reduced to carbon dioxide, which can be further reduced to carbon dioxide, which can be further reduced to carbon dioxide, which can be further reduced to carbon dioxide, which can be further reduced to carbon dioxide, which can be further reduced to carbon dioxide, which can be further reduced to carbon dioxide, which can be further reduced to carbon dioxide, which can be further reduced to carbon dioxide"
