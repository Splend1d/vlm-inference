If the plates move apart along a transform fault, this can lead to the formation of new mountain ranges or ridges in the region. This type of geological process is often associated with the formation of mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains in North America.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all collisions between continental and oceanic plates will result in mountain formation. Other types of geological processes can also occur when two tectonic plates collide, such as the creation of deep-sea trenches or the formation of rift valleys. The specific outcome depends on various factors, including the composition of the underlying rock layers and the amount of stress being applied during the collision."
