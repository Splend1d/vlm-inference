Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and starts to fit the noise in the data rather than the underlying patterns. Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that encourages simpler models. Therefore, increasing \u03bb will help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model on new, unseen data, which means that the testing error will likely decrease as well. So, the correct answer is D. will never increase."
