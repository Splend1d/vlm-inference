Therefore,\nNumber of moles of AgNO3 = 2 * Number of moles of Cl- \u2248 2 * 0.012 mol = 0.024 mol\n\nTo convert grams to moles, use the conversion factor:\nMass of AgNO3 = 0.024 mol * 171 g/mol = 4.044 g\n\nTherefore, the molar ratio of AgNO3 to AgCl is 1:1, meaning all 0.024 mol of AgNO3 reacted completely with the 0.435 g of AgCl.\n\nThe percentage of chlorine in the sample is then calculated using the molar mass of Cl-:\nPercentage of Cl = (Number of moles of Cl- * Molar mass of Cl- / Mass of sample) * 100%\n\nPercentage of Cl = (0.012 mol * 35.52 g/mol / 2.35 g) * 100% \u2248 18%\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 18%."
