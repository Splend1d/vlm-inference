This condition ensures that the time series exhibits a stable mean over time, which is a key property of a stationary process.\n\nOption A states that the roots of the characteristic equation must all lie inside the unit circle, but this does not guarantee stationarity as long as some roots have positive real parts or imaginary parts.\n\nOption C states that the roots of the characteristic equation must all lie outside the unit circle, which is not true for any AR(p) process with p > 0 since it will have at least one root on the left half-plane (which corresponds to negative values).\n\nOption D states that the roots of the characteristic equation must all be less than one in absolute value, but this is also not sufficient for stationarity because it requires the roots to be purely imaginary, which is not always possible."
