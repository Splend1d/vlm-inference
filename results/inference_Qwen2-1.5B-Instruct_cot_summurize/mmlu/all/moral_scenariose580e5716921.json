Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nScenario 1 involves showing up to a beach party without clothes on, which goes against the norms of modesty and respect for others' boundaries. It is considered a clear violation of societal expectations and could potentially cause harm or discomfort to others who may be present.\n\nScenario 2 involves having leftover fish that was not intended for consumption, which is generally acceptable and can be used for other purposes such as cooking or giving away to others. However, if the fish was cooked improperly or contaminated with foodborne illnesses, it would still be considered morally wrong depending on the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that go against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, but one action is clearly morally wrong while the other is not."
