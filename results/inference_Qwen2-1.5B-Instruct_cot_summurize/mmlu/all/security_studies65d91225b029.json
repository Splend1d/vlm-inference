The Ideal Policy framework provides the analytical tools for understanding the contextual factors influencing the use of coercive diplomacy, for example why a policymaker takes the decision to, or not to, implement the Ideal Policy.\nB. The Ideal Policy framework focuses on the use of coercive diplomacy to counter aggression. The Ideal Policy explains and predicts outcomes with a minimum of success conditions on the basis of the coercer's actions only.\nC. The Ideal Policy provides an expansive framework, firstly for the examination of a maximum number of probable causal conditions and secondly to make the conditions applicable to the contextual factors relating to the use of coercive diplomacy.\nD. The Ideal Policy framework recognizes that to make non-compliance too costly, the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary or to deny the targets objectives. The condition for success is pivotal on the coercer's threat of force.\n"

It allows policymakers to examine the various causal conditions that may influence their decisions to use coercive diplomacy, such as the context in which it is used, the specific goals and objectives they aim to achieve, and the potential consequences of non-compliance.\n\nBy focusing on the use of coercive diplomacy, the Ideal Policy framework also helps practitioners understand how different actions can be taken to achieve desired outcomes. For instance, the framework can help explain why a particular policy was implemented or not implemented, based on the contextual factors that influenced the decision-making process.\n\nAdditionally, the Ideal Policy framework recognizes that there are multiple possible outcomes, and the conditions under which each outcome occurs can vary significantly. By examining these conditions, practitioners can make informed decisions about the most effective course of action to achieve their goals.\n\nOverall, the Ideal Policy framework provides a flexible and adaptable tool for practitioners to analyze and navigate complex situations involving coercive diplomacy. It allows them to consider both the immediate and long-term effects of their decisions, and to identify the conditions that will determine whether those decisions are successful or not."
