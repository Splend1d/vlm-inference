The three operating segments described by Swift (A, B, and C) meet this definition because they are distinct groups of assets or activities with their own reported profits or losses, assets, and revenues. Therefore, each segment requires separate disclosure in Swift's general-purpose financial statements for the year ended December 31 year 2."
