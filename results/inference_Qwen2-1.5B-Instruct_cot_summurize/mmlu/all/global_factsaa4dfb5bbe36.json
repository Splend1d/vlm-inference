However, it is generally believed that a significant portion of voters may support a candidate's bid for a second or third term if they believe the incumbent has demonstrated strong leadership, improved policies, and made progress on key issues. The exact percentage would depend on various factors such as the state of the economy, public opinion towards the incumbent, and the overall political climate at the time of the election."
