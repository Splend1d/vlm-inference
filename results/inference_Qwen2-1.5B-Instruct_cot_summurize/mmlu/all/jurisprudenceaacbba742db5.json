Law as medium' consists of the manner in which law is presented by the media; 'law as institution' describes the courts.\nC. Law as medium' concerns the manner in which the law expresses its rules in simplified terms; 'law as institution' refers to the formal declaration of laws by legislative bodies.\nD. Law as medium' is defined as the intermediate stage of legal development; 'law as institution' is the advanced stage.\n"

Law as medium' describes law as a body of formal, general rules that control the state and the economy; 'law as institution' inhabits the 'lifeworld' and expresses its shared values and norms in institutional form.\n\nThis distinction reflects Habermas's view that law can be understood not only through its formal or codified structure but also through its social and cultural context, particularly how it relates to everyday life and shared values. In other words, law is not just about abstract rules but also about how these rules are implemented and lived out in society."
