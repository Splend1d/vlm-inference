Virtue ethics.\n\nRoss's moral theory is a version of virtue ethics, which emphasizes the importance of character and moral virtues in making ethical decisions. This approach contrasts with other theories such as consequentialism, which focuses on maximizing overall happiness or well-being, and the ethics of prime facie duty, which prioritizes duties that seem most pressing at any given moment. Kantian theory also places a strong emphasis on duty and consequences, but it does not provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating moral actions."
