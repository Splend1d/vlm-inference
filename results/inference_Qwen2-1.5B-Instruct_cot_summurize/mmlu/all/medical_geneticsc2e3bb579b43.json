                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Codominance.\n\nCodominance refers to the situation where an individual has two dominant traits (in this case, dark blue and light blue) but only expresses one of them depending on environmental factors such as temperature or lighting. In the given scenario, the F1 offspring have light blue flowers due to the combination of dark blue and bright white flowers, which shows codominance.\n\nEpistasis occurs when different genes interact differently under different conditions, causing unpredictable phenotypes. Incomplete dominance involves two alleles for a trait being expressed at different levels depending on the environment. Inbreeding depression occurs when the frequency of homozygous recessive genotypes increases over generations due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations within a population. These phenomena do not fit with the given results of the F1 offspring having light blue flowers."
