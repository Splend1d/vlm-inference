Two days after his funeral, the boy's mother saw a television program about gang violence and was shocked to see video of herself weeping over the boy's body. The video had been shot by the television reporting team while the boy's body was still lying on a public street. The mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of seeing the video. If the mother sues the television station for invasion of her privacy and that of her son, will the mother be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because a person has no right to privacy after his or her death.\nB. No, because the street was open to the public and the subject was newsworthy.\nC. Yes, because the mother did not give permission to have the video used in the program.\nD. Yes, because the mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of viewing the video.\n"

Yes, because the mother suffered severe emotional distress as a result of viewing the video.\n\nUnder common law principles of invasion of privacy, an individual may sue for damages if their privacy rights are violated by someone else. In this case, the mother's privacy rights were violated when she saw the video of her deceased son's body being displayed on a public street. The fact that the footage was taken without her consent does not negate the claim of invasion of privacy.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the footage was part of a news report about gang violence suggests that it was considered newsworthy and that there was a reasonable expectation that the footage would be shared with the public. However, even if the media organization had a reasonable expectation of sharing the footage, the mother's emotional distress is still relevant to whether she can recover damages.\n\nTherefore, the mother is likely to prevail in her lawsuit against the television station for invasion of her privacy and that of her son."
