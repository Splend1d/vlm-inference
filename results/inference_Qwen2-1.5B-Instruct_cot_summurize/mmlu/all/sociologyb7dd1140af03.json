Socialization into working-class families and communities.\n\nButler and Stokes argue that working-class support for the Labour Party arises from the process of socialization, which occurs within working-class families and communities. This process involves learning the values, beliefs, and attitudes associated with being a member of the working class, such as solidarity, discipline, and hard work. By participating in these activities and engaging in discussions about the issues facing working-class people, individuals can develop a sense of belonging to their community and form relationships with others who share similar experiences and perspectives. As a result, they may be more likely to support policies and programs that benefit them and their community."
