In this case, we have four nodes: H (head), U (upstream), P (parent), and W (witness). The edges represent conditional dependencies between the nodes.\nTo determine how many independent parameters are needed for this Bayesian Network, we need to consider the number of parameters associated with each node.\nFor the head node H, there is only one parameter: the probability of observing H given all other variables.\nFor the upstream node U, there are two parameters: the probability of observing U given H and the probability of observing U given all other variables except H.\nFor the parent node P, there are three parameters: the probability of observing P given all other variables, the probability of observing P given U, and the probability of observing P given all other variables except U.\nFor the witness node W, there is one parameter: the probability of observing W given all other variables.\nTherefore, the total number of independent parameters needed for this Bayesian Network is 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 8.\nThe answer is C. 8."
