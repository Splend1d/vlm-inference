The image moves toward the mirror and gets shorter.\n\nWhen an object is moved closer to a concave mirror, the focal length of the mirror decreases. As a result, the image becomes larger and farther away from the mirror. This means that the image will move towards the mirror and become smaller in size. \n\nIn contrast, when the object is moved further away from the mirror, the focal length increases, causing the image to move closer to the mirror and become larger in size. However, this effect is not linear; instead, it follows an inverse square relationship with distance. So, as the object approaches the focal point (or near the mirror), the image moves toward the mirror and gets taller, but only if the object is sufficiently close to the mirror for the magnification to be significant."
