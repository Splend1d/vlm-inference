After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nThe perspective of the passage above would most directly support which of the following political goals?\n\nA. Women's suffrage\nB. Trust-busting\nC. Greater rights for unions\nD. Weakening political machines\n"

However, the passage does mention the creation of a boarding club as a solution to the problems faced by striking women workers, which suggests that the focus is on improving living conditions and addressing issues related to poverty and inequality. Therefore, option C (Greater rights for unions) might indirectly support the idea of creating a club-like organization to address these issues, although this is not explicitly stated in the passage."
