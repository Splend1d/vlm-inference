The witness can only confirm for the prosecution that a car was stolen, the model and type of car, and that it was missing from the property on a certain date. The defense asks witness \"isn't it possible that my client did not steal the car, that someone else did it, and that the police are lying about the charges against him? The prosecution objected to the question. Will the court likely sustain the objection?\n\nA. Yes, because this is an objectionable question based on pure speculation.\nB. Yes, because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence.\nC. No, questioning about the possibility of other perpetrators, or about police misconduct, is always permissible.\nD. No, because the witness may know something that he is not revealing and for that reason, a cross-examiner is given wide latitude in questioning.\n"

Yes, because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence.\n\nIn criminal cases, questions about the credibility of witnesses or law enforcement officers are generally limited by the burden of proof required in the case. In most legal systems, the prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, meaning they must present sufficient evidence to establish the defendant's guilt with confidence. This means that any doubts about the truthfulness of the witness or the accuracy of the evidence presented cannot be used as grounds to reject their testimony or conclusions drawn from it.\n\nTherefore, the defense's objection to asking whether the defendant stole the car would likely be sustained if the prosecution had no concrete evidence to support the claim that the defendant committed the crime. If there were substantial evidence pointing towards the defendant's guilt, such as eyewitnesses, physical evidence, or confessions, then it would be appropriate for the defense to challenge the prosecution's credibility.\n\nIt is important to note that in some jurisdictions, particularly those with strict evidentiary rules, the defense might have more leeway to question the credibility of witnesses, especially when the prosecution has failed to present enough evidence to overcome their initial doubts. However, this would typically occur under very specific circumstances where the prosecution's case lacks critical elements like direct evidence or corroborating testimony."
