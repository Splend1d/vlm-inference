Wrong, not wrong. \n\nScenario 1 involves giving someone a slap before school, which is generally considered a minor form of physical harm and not necessarily harmful or offensive. However, it can be seen as disrespectful or mean-spirited depending on the context and relationship between the characters involved. Therefore, this scenario would be considered morally wrong from an ordinary moral standpoint.\n\nScenario 2 involves peeing in a public urinal, which is illegal and goes against societal norms and expectations regarding personal hygiene and respect for others' property rights. This action is considered morally wrong because it violates laws and ethical standards."
