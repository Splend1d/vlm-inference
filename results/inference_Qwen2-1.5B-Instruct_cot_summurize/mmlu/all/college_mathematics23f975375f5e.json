This can be rewritten as $e^x = 2 - x$.\n\nThis is a transcendental equation which has no closed-form solution for general values of $x$, so it doesn't have any real solutions within the interval $[0, 1]$. Therefore, there are no real solutions to this equation within the given interval.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. k = 0 and n = 1"
