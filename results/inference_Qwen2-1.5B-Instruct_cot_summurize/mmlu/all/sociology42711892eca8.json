Decommodifying social welfare through state provision\n\nThe market model of state welfare, also known as the welfare state or social insurance, is based on the principle of providing welfare services through the state rather than allowing individuals to buy them privately. This approach is characterized by the idea that welfare should be provided to everyone, regardless of their income level, and that it should be financed through taxes and contributions from individuals.\n\nIn this model, the government provides a range of benefits such as unemployment benefits, healthcare, pensions, housing assistance, and education grants. These benefits are typically funded through taxes and contributions from employers and employees, and they are designed to help people who are unable to work due to illness or disability, have low incomes, or live in poverty.\n\nThe goal of the welfare state is to provide a basic standard of living for all citizens, which can include food, shelter, and healthcare, among other things. The aim is not just to eliminate poverty but also to ensure that individuals and families have access to essential services and support when they need it most.\n\nOverall, the market model of state welfare is based on the idea that welfare should be provided through the state, rather than allowed to operate in the private sector, and that it should be financed through taxes and contributions from individuals."
