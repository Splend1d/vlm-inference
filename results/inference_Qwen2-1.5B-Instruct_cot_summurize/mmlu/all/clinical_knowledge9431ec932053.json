When muscles contract, the SR releases calcium ions into the cytosol, which then bind to troponin and activate myosin ATPase, allowing myosin to detach from actin filaments and shorten, causing muscle contraction. Conversely, when muscles relax, the SR sequesters excess calcium ions back into the SR, preventing them from binding to troponin and damaging the muscle. Therefore, the storage of calcium ions is one of the key functions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells."
