Taking logarithms of each variable and adding lagged values of the variables to the regression equation can help to stabilize the variance of the errors and reduce residual autocorrelation. Using dummy variables to remove outlying observations can also be useful in reducing residual autocorrelation by removing those observations that have large residuals. Finally, trying a model in first differenced form rather than in levels can help to stabilize the variance of the errors and reduce residual autocorrelation."
