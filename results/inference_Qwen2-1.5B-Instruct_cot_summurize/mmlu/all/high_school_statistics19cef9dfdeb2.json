To estimate the total stock investment by students in this school, two plans are proposed. Plan I would sample 30 students at random, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Plan II would sample 30 students at random from among the 132 who have investments in the market, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Which is the better plan for estimating the total stock market investment by students in this school?\n\nA. Plan I\nB. Plan II\nC. Both plans use random samples and so will produce equivalent results.\nD. Neither plan will give an accurate estimate.\n"

                    "text": "To determine which plan is better for estimating the total stock investment by students in this school, we need to compare the two plans based on the information provided.\n\nPlan I:\n- Sample size: 30 students\n- Confidence interval estimate: The average investment can be estimated using the formula for a simple random sample (SRS) with n = 30, where the standard deviation of the population is known. The formula for a SRS is:\n\n\\[ \\bar{x} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\bar{x} \\) is the sample mean, \\( z_{\\alpha/2} \\) is the critical value for the chosen level of significance (\\( \\alpha \\)), \\( s \\) is the sample standard deviation, and \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n\nFor Plan I, the sample mean \\( \\bar{x} \\) is the average investment made by all 1650 students, while the sample standard deviation \\( s \\) is unknown but can be approximated by dividing the standard deviation of the student population by the square root of the sample size. Since we don't know the exact standard deviation, we cannot directly calculate \\( s \\). However, since the sample size is small (30), we can assume that the standard deviation of the population is large enough to approximate it as \\( s \\).\n\nThe formula for calculating the confidence interval for the sample mean without knowing \\( s \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\bar{x} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\]\n\nSince we do not know the population standard deviation \\( \\sigma \\), we substitute \\( s \\) for \\( \\sigma \\):\n\n\\[ \\bar{x} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}s/\\sqrt{30} \\]\n\nWe also know that the sample mean \\( \\bar{x} \\) is the average investment made by 30 students out of 1650, which gives us:\n\n\\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{132 \\times 1650}{30} = 4700 \\]\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\n\\[ 4700 \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{30}} \\]\n\nThis gives us two intervals: one that includes the true average investment and one that does not include it. We can multiply these intervals by 1650 or 132, respectively, to get an upper and lower bound for the total investment by all students.\n\nPlan II:\n- Sample size: 30 students\n- Confidence interval estimate: Find the average investment of the 30 students sampled, then multiply both ends of the confidence interval by 132 to get an interval estimate for the total investment.\n\nBoth plans involve sampling 30 students, so they would likely produce similar estimates when used correctly. However, Plan II requires knowledge about the distribution of the population of students with investments, whereas Plan I does not require such knowledge.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, neither plan will give an accurate estimate of the total stock market investment by students in this school. The choice between Plan I and Plan II depends on whether you believe the population of students with investments has a normal distribution or not. If you think the distribution is approximately normal, then Plan I might be more appropriate. If you believe the distribution is not normal, then Plan II might be more appropriate because it uses the sample data to estimate the population parameters.\n\nHowever, without additional information about the distribution of the student population, we cannot definitively say which plan is better. It's important to note that the choice between the two plans depends on your assumptions about the underlying distribution of the student population."
