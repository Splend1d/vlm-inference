Sometimes, a drug's effects can be directly influenced by what one expects from it.\n\nShapiro argues that our expectations about drugs play a significant role in how they affect us. For example, if someone expects a drug to have certain effects on them (e.g., feeling more energetic or having a heightened sense of pleasure), they may feel those effects even when they don't actually take the drug. This is because their expectations have already taken hold in their minds before they actually consume the drug.\n\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily mean that drug effects are solely determined by our expectations. There are also many factors that influence how we perceive and respond to drugs, including things like genetics, environmental factors, and personal experiences. So while expectations can certainly shape our experience of drugs, they are just one piece of the puzzle."
