The man took the agent to the home of a drug dealer, who sold the agent four pounds of marijuana. At trial, the drug dealer claimed the defense of entrapment and demanded that the informant's identity be disclosed and that he be produced. At no time prior to trial did the drug dealer seek to subpoena the man. However, the man was a fugitive from justice the whole time, and no subpoena could have been served. The government claims a right to protect the informant's identity. Should the government's claim be honored?\n\nA. Yes, because an informant has a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\nB. Yes, because informants would not assist in crime prevention unless they were reasonably certain that their identities would be kept secret.\nC. No, because under the Fifth Amendment, a defendant has the right to be confronted by witnesses against him.\nD. No, because under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant has the right to a fair trial.\n"

No, because under the Fifth Amendment, a defendant has the right to be confronted by witnesses against him.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides that \"No person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" This means that a defendant has the right to remain silent if they choose to do so, without fear of being subjected to self-incriminating questions or evidence. Therefore, the government cannot compel an informant to testify about the identity of the man involved in the drug transaction, as this would violate the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights."
