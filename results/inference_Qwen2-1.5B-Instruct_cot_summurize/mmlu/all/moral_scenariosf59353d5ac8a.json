This is because paying someone else to do your work defeats the purpose of learning and understanding the material yourself.\nIn scenario 2, when the neighbor's secret recipe is shared with the protagonist's sister, it is not necessarily morally wrong if the recipe was meant to be kept confidential or was given without permission. However, if the recipe was meant to be shared among friends or family members, then sharing it without asking for permission would be considered disrespectful and could potentially harm the relationship with the neighbor."
