                    "text": "It seems like you may have accidentally mixed up two different concepts or arguments from Kant's philosophy. The first statement you mention, \"Kant argues that because sexual attraction involves seeing another person as the object of one's appetites,\" is not an argument but rather a claim about human behavior and emotions.\n\nThe second part, however, is an argument from Kant, which states: \n\n\"A categorical imperative is a principle that we should follow regardless of our desires. If we desire something, then we must do everything possible to make this desire happen. This includes actions that violate our duty towards others if they would be morally wrong if we were acting out of self-interest.\"\n\nThis argument suggests that sexual attraction can lead us to act against our own moral duties (which Kant calls 'self-love') when we see someone else as the object of our appetites. In other words, we might engage in activities that go against our moral principles simply to satisfy our physical desires, without considering how these actions affect others around us. \n\nSo while Kant does indeed argue that sexual attraction involves seeing someone else as the object of our appetites, his main concern is with how this emotion influences our decision-making processes. It doesn't imply that all sexual relationships are therefore immoral or that there is a universal law of attraction. Instead, he is concerned with ensuring that our actions align with what is considered ethical and moral by society at large."
