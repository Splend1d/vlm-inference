In this context, \"invasion\" implies that new residents come in and take over an existing population, while \"succession\" suggests that the new residents gradually replace the original group.\n\nOption A, B, and C do not accurately describe the process of invasion and succession. Option A describes the physical act of tearing down and rebuilding housing units, which can occur during a natural disaster or urban renewal project. Option B describes peaceful coexistence between new and old residents, which is possible but not necessarily part of invasion and succession. Option C assumes complete assimilation, which may be true for some communities but not always the case."
