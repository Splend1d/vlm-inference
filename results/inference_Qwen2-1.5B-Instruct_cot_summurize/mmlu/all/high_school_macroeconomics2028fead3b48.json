An increase in net exports\n\nAn expansionary monetary policy, such as increasing the federal funds rate or buying government securities with excess reserves, can lead to increased demand for credit and higher levels of aggregate spending. This can stimulate economic growth and potentially boost net exports if there is no immediate increase in imports. However, this is a more theoretical scenario, and actual outcomes can be influenced by many other factors, including changes in international trade agreements and exchange rates."
