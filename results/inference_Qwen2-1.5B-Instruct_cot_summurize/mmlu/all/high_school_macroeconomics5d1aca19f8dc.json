                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Money in household savings accounts can now buy fewer goods and services.\n\nWhen prices rise, people's purchasing power decreases, meaning that they can only afford fewer goods and services with the same amount of money. This can lead to inflation, which means that the value of money decreases over time. As a result, households may need to spend more money on the same goods and services, leading to higher prices for consumers and businesses alike.\n\nHousehold incomes may also be affected by rising prices if they cannot keep up with the increased cost of living. In some cases, this can lead to economic hardship for individuals or families who struggle to make ends meet. Borrowers may also find it more difficult to repay their loans as the value of the currency they receive from lenders declines.\n\nOption B is incorrect because household incomes generally do not rise with prices when there is an increase in prices. Option C is also incorrect because the economy does not necessarily run out of money if prices rise. Instead, it simply becomes harder for people to afford the things they want and need. Finally, option D is incorrect because borrowers do not have to repay loans with more dollars; instead, they typically pay off their debts using the same amount of money they borrowed."
