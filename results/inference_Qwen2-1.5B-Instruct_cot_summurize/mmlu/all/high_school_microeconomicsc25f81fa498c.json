This results in higher prices for consumers and lower profits for the firm, as the price is set too high relative to its value.\n\nThe deadweight loss occurs when the price is set above marginal cost because it leads to a situation where there is no efficient allocation of resources. In other words, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently due to the high prices charged by the monopolist.\n\nOption B (setting the price above average total cost) also contributes to deadweight loss, but not directly. Average total cost refers to the total cost divided by the quantity produced, while marginal cost refers to the additional cost incurred for producing one extra unit of output. Setting the price above average total cost does not necessarily lead to a deadweight loss, as it can still result in an efficient allocation of resources if the market is perfectly competitive or near perfect competition. However, setting the price above marginal cost always leads to deadweight loss, regardless of whether the market is perfectly competitive or not."
