It is produced by the breakdown of uranium in rocks and soil. Radon can enter your home through cracks or holes in your foundation or walls, as well as through your floors, windows, and other openings.\n\nOnce radon gets into your home, it can travel through the air and settle in your basement or crawl space. If you have any type of radon mitigation system installed, such as a radon detector or a radon abatement system, the gas will not pose a risk to your health. However, if you do not have a mitigation system in place, you should test for radon regularly and take steps to remove it from your home."
