It was addressed to the manager. He read it, put it in a private drawer, and did not read it again. Later, he tried to sue the competitor for defamation as a result of the letter. Will the court likely grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, and on what grounds? Base your answer on the common law definition of defamation.\n\nA. Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.\nB. Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the language is not damaging to the manager's reputation.\nC. No, it will not dismiss because the circumstances show that all of the elements of defamation are all present.\nD. No, it will not dismiss because a plaintiff in a defamatory action has an absolute right to a jury trial to prove defamation.\n"

Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.\n\nThe common law definition of defamation involves making false statements about someone with the intent to harm them. In this case, the letter was clearly meant to damage the manager's reputation by accusing him of being incompetent and implying that he is one of the worst businessmen in town. The fact that the letter was only intended for the manager suggests that there was no intention to spread the statement widely or to cause any significant harm. Therefore, the court would likely grant the defendant's motion to dismiss based on the specific facts of the case."
