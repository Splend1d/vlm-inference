The epiglottis, a small muscle at the back of the throat, plays a crucial role in preventing food from entering the larynx (voice box) during this process.\n\nWhen the tongue and teeth crush the food or liquid as it enters the mouth, the epiglottis contracts to push food away from the larynx. This prevents food from entering the larynx and damaging the vocal cords, which are responsible for producing speech sounds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: upward movement of the epiglottis."
