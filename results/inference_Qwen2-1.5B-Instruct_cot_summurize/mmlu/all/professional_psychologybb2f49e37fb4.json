Exploring what it means to be White and confronting own biases\n\nThe pseudoindependent stage of White racial identity typically involves individuals who have not fully developed an awareness of their own privilege and how it affects them and others, but are still struggling with understanding and confronting their own biases and prejudices. This stage often includes exploring one's own cultural background and the role that white people play in perpetuating systemic racism, as well as grappling with the complexity of these issues. While some may attempt to resolve moral dilemmas associated with this awareness, the primary focus seems to be on developing a deeper self-awareness and confronting personal biases."
