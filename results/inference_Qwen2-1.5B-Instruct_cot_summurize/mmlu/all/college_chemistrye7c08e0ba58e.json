The energy density of an electron is directly related to its charge and mass.\nFor a 13C atom, the total charge is approximately 2e (since there are two protons), and the mass is approximately 4.4 x 10^-26 kg. Therefore, the energy density of an electron is approximately 4.4 x 10^-26 J/kg.\nUsing this information, we can calculate the magnetic field:\nB = \u03bc_0 * I / L\nwhere B is the magnetic field, \u03bc_0 is the permeability of free space (4\u03c0 x 10^-7 H/m), I is the current (in this case, 13C has no net charge so it's considered a neutral particle), and L is the length of the wire carrying the current.\nSince the polarization is given as 2.5 x 10^-6 C/m^2, we can use Faraday's law of induction to find the induced emf:\nE = -dPhi/dt\nwhere E is the induced emf, Phi is the flux linkage, and dt is the time derivative.\nSince the polarization is constant, the flux linkage is also constant. Using Faraday's law, we can write:\nE = -dPhi/dt = -2.5 x 10^-6 C/m^2 * (2pi * 298 K) = -2.9 T\nTherefore, the magnetic field responsible for the polarization is 2.9 T.\nThe correct answer is C. 2.9 T."
