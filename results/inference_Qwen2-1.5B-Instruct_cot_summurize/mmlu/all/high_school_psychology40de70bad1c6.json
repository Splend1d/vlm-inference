Of the following approaches to diagnostic assessment, the most appropriate is one that\n\nA. uses an interpreter who is fluent in the language of the country in which the student was born\nB. uses the results of at least two Englishlanguage intelligence tests\nC. accounts for sociocultural and adaptive behavior in the process of identifying skills and abilities\nD. includes parent interviews and classroom observations as well as the results of an intelligence test\n"

This approach takes into account both the student's linguistic and cultural background and their adaptive behaviors, while also using intelligence testing to identify any potential learning or cognitive differences. It is important to note that the use of an interpreter may not always be feasible or appropriate depending on the specific circumstances and resources available. Additionally, it is not necessary to include at least two English-language intelligence tests, although they could be useful if there are concerns about the student's language proficiency or cognitive abilities."
