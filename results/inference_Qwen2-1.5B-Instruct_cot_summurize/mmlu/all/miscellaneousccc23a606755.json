Poverty is not solely determined by the amount of money one earns, but rather by their relative position within society in terms of income and wealth. The United States government defines poverty as individuals or families whose income falls below a certain threshold, which can vary depending on the location and circumstances of the individual. This definition takes into account the impact of other factors such as health care, education, and housing, as well as the economic environment in which they live."
