She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3 months. She does not smoke. There is no history of lung disease. She weighs 54 kg (120 lb) and is 163 cm (64 in) tall. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough?\n\nA. Decreased plasma renin activity\nB. Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations\nC. Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations\nD. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\n"

Increased serum bradykinin concentrations.\n\nBradykinin is a small peptide that can cause vasoconstriction and vasodilation, which can lead to bronchoconstriction and increased mucus production. In patients with hypertension like this one, they may have elevated levels of Bradykinin due to the antihypertensive medication Enalapril.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations."
