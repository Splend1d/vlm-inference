The difference between consecutive terms is not consistent; it changes from 5 in the first term to 5 + 5 = 10 in the second term. This does not match the skip-counting rule of skipping by 5 in this case.\n\nB. 13, 18, 23, 28, 33...\n\nThis sequence starts with 13 and then adds 5 to each subsequent term. The difference between consecutive terms is consistent, increasing by 5 each time. This matches the skip-counting rule of skipping by 5 in this case.\n\nC. 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...\n\nThis sequence starts with 12 and then adds 5 to each subsequent term. However, there seems to be an error in the sequence, as it should start with 12 and increment by 5 for each term, but it's actually starting at 13. Let's correct this:\n\nCorrected C: 12, 27, 42, 57, 72\n\nThis sequence also follows the skip-counting rule of skipping by 5, except that it starts one step ahead of the original sequence.\n\nD. 15, 30, 40, 55, 65...\n\nThis sequence starts with 15 and then adds 5 to each subsequent term. The difference between consecutive terms is consistent, increasing by 5 each time. This matches the skip-counting rule of skipping by 5 in this case.\n\nTherefore, the number pattern that follows the same rule as the given sequence (5, 20, 35, 50, 65) is **D. 15, 30, 40, 55, 65...**"
