It's a summary offense carrying a $50 fine and no imprisonment. On the third offense, the fine is $500 and there is a 5-day jail sentence. The statute does not mention any requirement of criminal intent. John and his family are coming back from a weekend picnic when his children throw bags of refuse and the remains of their lunch out of the rear window of the moving vehicle. John is stopped and given a $50 ticket. Can he succeed with a defense that he didn't know what his children were doing and that he had no criminal intent to break any laws?\n\nA. No, because this is likely a strict liability law that does not provide for defenses based on mental state.\nB. Yes, because he didn't know what his children were doing in the back seat and he had not participated in the violation nor did he know that they did it or were going to do it.\nC. Yes, because the police have no way of proving who in the car threw the garbage out the window.\nD. No, because his criminal intent is clearly established by the circumstances of the events.\n"

In this case, littering is considered a strict liability crime because it involves simply throwing trash or other matter into the road without regard for the consequences. Therefore, even if John didn't intend to break the law, he would still be found guilty under the strict liability standard.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the children threw the garbage out of the window while in motion suggests that they knew what they were doing was wrong and were attempting to violate the law. This knowledge is sufficient to establish criminal intent, even though John himself may not have been aware of what was happening at the time."
