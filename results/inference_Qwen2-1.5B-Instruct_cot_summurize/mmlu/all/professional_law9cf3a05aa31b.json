Additional terms that are proposed in the acceptance and do not materialize or change the terms of the original offer cannot be considered as part of the contract. The merchant must explicitly agree to the new terms or reject them before they can be included in the contract. Therefore, option C is incorrect. Option A is also incorrect because it suggests that any additional terms proposed by the merchant become part of the contract without the need for explicit agreement. Option D is also incorrect because it suggests that the merchant has no right to object to additional terms proposed in the acceptance if they are not material changes to the original offer. Instead, the merchant should accept or reject the additional terms as agreed upon in the original offer."
