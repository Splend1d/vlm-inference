A large number of hidden nodes can result in a higher bias as there will be more parameters to learn, but it may also help to reduce variance by capturing more complex relationships between features and the target variable.\nOn the other hand, a small number of hidden nodes can lead to a high variance as the model may struggle to generalize well to new data points due to limited capacity to capture complex patterns.\nTherefore, the answer is not necessarily related to the other options listed. However, it's important to note that the optimal number of hidden nodes depends on the specific problem being solved and the characteristics of the dataset."
