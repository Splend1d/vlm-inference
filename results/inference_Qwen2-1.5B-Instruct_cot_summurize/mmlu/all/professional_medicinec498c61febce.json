                    "text": "The most likely diagnosis is D. Mitral valve prolapse, also known as coarctation of the aorta or truncus arteriosus. This condition occurs when there is an abnormal narrowing (stenosis) of the mitral valve that allows blood to flow backwards into the heart instead of flowing normally through the ventricles. The resulting pressure gradient between the two atria can cause a wide-spread systolic murmur along the upper sternal border, which is what is described in this scenario. Additionally, the presence of a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower sternal border may indicate that the right ventricle is also involved in the circulation of oxygenated blood, further supporting the diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse. It's important to note that the absence of other abnormalities on physical examination suggests that the child has mild to moderate disease severity. However, it is always best to consult with a healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations."
