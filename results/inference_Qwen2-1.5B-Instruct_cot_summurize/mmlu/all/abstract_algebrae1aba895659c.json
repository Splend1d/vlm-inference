Therefore, it's an extension field of Z_2.\nStatement 2 is also true because every non-constant polynomial with coefficients in a field F has at least one root in F itself. This follows from the fact that if p(x) is a non-constant polynomial with coefficients in F, then for some x in F, p(x) = 0, which means p(x) has a root in F. So, every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. True, True."
