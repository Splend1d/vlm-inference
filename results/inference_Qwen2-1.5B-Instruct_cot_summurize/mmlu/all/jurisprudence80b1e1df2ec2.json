This means that Ajax had actual or constructive knowledge that the Sipep could contain dead insects due to the presence of such insects in the can itself. The fact that Bill noticed the dead insects after consuming the Sipep does not automatically mean that Ajax was aware of the defect, as it may be possible for the dead insects to have been there before Bill consumed the Sipep. Additionally, if Ajax had prior notice of other similar problems with Sipep products, this would also support a finding of negligence on their part. However, without specific evidence to show that Ajax knew or should have known about the dead insects, none of the options listed would necessarily establish a claim under product liability law."
