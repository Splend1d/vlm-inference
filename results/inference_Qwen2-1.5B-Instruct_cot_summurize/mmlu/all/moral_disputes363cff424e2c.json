More harmful on average than legally permitted harmful activities: This is not explicitly stated in Huemer's argument.\n\nB. Differing from the harms of other legally permitted harmful activities: Huemer does not specifically state that drug use has different harms compared to other legal harmful activities. However, he does argue that drug use can have unique and potentially negative effects, which may differ from those associated with other legal activities.\n\nC. More detrimental to a person's character than otherslegally permitted harmful activities: Again, this is not explicitly stated in Huemer's argument.\n\nD. All of the above: As discussed above, Huemer does not provide specific evidence or reasoning for why drug use is more harmful than other legal harmful activities, nor does he claim that drug use differs in terms of its harmfulness compared to other legal activities.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by Huemer, the answer would be:\n\nD. All of the above."
