When the friend refused to return the card during a later conversation in a bar, the man pointed a handgun at the friend, held his finger on the trigger, and said, \"Give it back!\" A bystander screamed and threw a beer bottle at the man. The bottle struck the man's hand and caused the gun to discharge, killing the friend instantly. The man was convicted of murder in a jurisdiction that follows the common law of homicide. On appeal, he argues that the evidence, which essentially set out the facts above, was insufficient to support a verdict of murder. Should the man's conviction be reversed?\n\nA. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.\nB. No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.\nC. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger.\nD. Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.\n"

Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.\n\nIn this case, the man used force against his friend without any intention to kill or cause serious bodily harm. He threatened to shoot his friend if the friend didn't give up the debit card. This behavior does not meet the criteria for murder, as there was no premeditation or planning involved. Therefore, the man's conviction should not be overturned based on the evidence presented.\n\nIt is important to note that murder charges can be complex and involve multiple factors such as motive, opportunity, means, and opportunity. In this specific case, the man's actions were not intentional, and therefore, the conviction cannot be overturned solely based on the evidence provided."
