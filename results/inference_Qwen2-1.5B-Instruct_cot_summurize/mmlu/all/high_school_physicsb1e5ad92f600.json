Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\n\nWhen you increase the tension in a string, the frequency of the standing waves increases. This means that the wave speed decreases and the wavelength increases. So, if the tension is increased while keeping the other parameters constant (such as the length of the string), the wavelength will become longer compared to the original standing waves."
