If inflation is rising faster than the growth rate of wages or salaries, it can erode the purchasing power of borrowers' fixed-rate loans and savings. This means that while borrowers may receive less in principal repayment over time, they will still have to make payments that correspond to the real value of the money borrowed, which can be more burdensome as prices rise. Similarly, workers who have negotiated cost-of-living raises into their contracts may find that these increases are not enough to keep up with the rising costs of living, particularly if inflation is high. For renters of apartments who have signed a lease holding rent constant for two years, unexpected inflation could lead to higher rent bills, making it difficult for them to afford housing in the future."
