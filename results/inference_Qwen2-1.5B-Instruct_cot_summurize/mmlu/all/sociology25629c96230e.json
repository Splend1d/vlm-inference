Glass ceiling\n\nThe glass ceiling refers to the invisible barrier or \"ceiling\" that prevents women, minorities, and other underrepresented groups from reaching certain levels of advancement within an organization. In this context, Giselle may be experiencing a glass ceiling due to the fact that she has been consistently promoted into higher-level positions without seeing any male colleagues who have surpassed her in terms of seniority. This could indicate a systemic issue where women are being passed over for promotions simply because they belong to a marginalized group."
