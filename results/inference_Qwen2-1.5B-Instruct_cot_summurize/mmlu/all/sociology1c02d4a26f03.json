This was known as indentured servitude, where individuals were sold into slavery or debt bondage by their families or communities to work on plantations or farms in the Americas, Asia, or Africa for a period of time (usually 7-10 years) in exchange for freedom at the end of the contract. The indenture system was used in many parts of the world during the 19th century."
