Since \\(f\\) is linear, it preserves addition and scalar multiplication of vectors.\n\nGiven that \\(f(1, 1) = 1\\), this means that when we add any vector \\((x, y)\\) to the origin (0, 0), we get back its image under \\(f\\). This implies that for any point \\((x, y)\\), \\(f(x + y, x + y) = (x, y)\\).\n\nFor example:\n- If we have \\(f(1, 1)\\), then \\(f(1, 1) = f(0, 0) + f(1, 1) = (1, 1)\\).\n- Similarly, \\(f(-1, 0) = f(0, 0) + (-1, 0) = (0, -1)\\).\n\nNow, let's consider \\(f(3, 5)\\):\n\\[f(3, 5) = f(0, 0) + f(3, 5).\\]\n\nSince \\(f(0, 0)\\) is the origin, adding it to itself will not change its direction or magnitude. Therefore, \\(f(0, 0) = (0, 0)\\).\n\nThus,\n\\[f(3, 5) = f(3, 5).\\]\nWe can now use the properties of linearity to find \\(f(3, 5)\\):\n\n\\[f(3, 5) = f(3, 5) + f(0, 0) = f(0, 0) + f(3, 5).\\]\n\nFrom our previous analysis, we know that \\(f(0, 0) = (0, 0)\\) and \\(f(3, 5) = (3, 5)\\). So,\n\\[f(3, 5) = (0, 0) + (3, 5) = (3, 5).\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(f(3, 5) = (3, 5)\\), which corresponds to option D."
