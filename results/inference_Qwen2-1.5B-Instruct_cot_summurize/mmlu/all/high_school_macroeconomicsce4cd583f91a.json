The value of the dollar will tend to appreciate.\n\nWhen interest rates rise in the United States, it means that the US government is borrowing money at a higher rate than other countries, which can lead to an increase in demand for dollars and a depreciation of their value against other currencies. This can make imports more expensive and exports less competitive, potentially leading to economic strain for some industries or sectors. However, this effect on the value of the dollar itself would depend on how quickly other countries respond with their own policies and actions."
