Decreases by a factor of 9.\n\nThis is because the amount of energy emitted from a blackbody (or any other source) follows the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the total power emitted per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the surface temperature. If we increase the temperature by a factor of 3, the new power emitted will be:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{new}} = P_{\\text{old}} \\times (\\frac{T_{\\text{new}}}{T_{\\text{old}}} )^4 \\]\n\nwhere \\(P_{\\text{new}}\\) is the new power and \\(P_{\\text{old}}\\) is the old power. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{new}} = P_{\\text{old}} \\times (\\frac{3}{27})^4 = P_{\\text{old}} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^4 \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{new}} = P_{\\text{old}} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{81}\\right)^4 \\]\n\nTherefore, if the absolute temperature increases by a factor of 3, the energy radiated per second per unit area decreases by a factor of 9."
