The promotional material claimed patented methods and nutritional supplements that were a \"miraculous discovery\" that would work for anyone within 24 months. The cost was $1,000 per month; the woman paid a total of $24,000 for two years but she lost only 6 pounds and remained excessively obese. A former program employee told her that there was no patent, no miraculous discovery, and the supplements were the same as a common vitamin brand. She sued the program for misrepresentation. Will she likely prevail?\n\nA. No, because statements that are mere \"puffing\" or opinions cannot be the basis for misrepresentation.\nB. Yes, because the program had a fiduciary duty to make full disclosure to her of all of the facts.\nC. No, because she did not justifiably rely on the incredible representations that were made.\nD. Yes, because the program knowingly made false factual representations that the customer relied on.\n"

Yes, because the program knowingly made false factual representations that the customer relied on.\n\nThe key aspect in this case is that the person who signed up for the weight loss program believed that they could lose their excess weight quickly and effectively without having to change their lifestyle habits. This belief was based on the fact that the program offered patented methods and nutritional supplements that it claimed were a \"miraculous discovery.\" However, when the person realized that these claims were unfounded and the supplements were actually similar to a generic brand, they sued the company for misrepresentation.\n\nMisrepresentations can include false statements about a product's performance, safety, efficacy, or other characteristics. In this case, the person believed that the weight loss program would help them achieve their goal of losing weight, which is what misrepresentations should aim to do. If the person had been aware that the program was making false statements, then they might have decided not to sign up, but instead sought out alternative options that could provide better results. So, even though the person did not rely solely on the information provided by the program, they still had an expectation that the program would deliver on its promises, and if those promises turned out to be false, the person may have grounds for a lawsuit."
