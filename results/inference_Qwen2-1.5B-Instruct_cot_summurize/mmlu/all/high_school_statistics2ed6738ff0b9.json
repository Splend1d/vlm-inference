In conducting a hypothesis test, it is possible to simultaneously make both a Type I and a Type II error.\n\nThis is because when we conduct a hypothesis test, we typically reject the null hypothesis (Type I error) if the evidence against the null hypothesis is strong enough, but fail to reject the null hypothesis even though there is evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis (Type II error). Therefore, making a Type I error means rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, while failing to reject the null hypothesis when it should be rejected also results in a Type II error."
