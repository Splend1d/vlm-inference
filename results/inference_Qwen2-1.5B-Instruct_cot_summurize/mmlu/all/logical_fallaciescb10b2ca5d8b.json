This can be seen as a tactic used to avoid having to defend their own arguments. It involves shifting the focus away from the core issue and instead introducing unrelated topics or positions. For example, if someone claims that they support a policy but avoids discussing how the policy would actually work, they may be using this fallacy.\n\nOther options are not typically associated with evading the issue:\n\n- A. arguing that someone should do something only because of ill will towards someone else: This type of argument might involve a logical appeal or emotional appeal rather than simply evading the issue.\n- B. characterizing an opponent's position in a way that makes it seem ridiculous: This is a form of rhetorical criticism where one argues against the logic or credibility of an opponent's position.\n- D. attempting to gain agreement based only on the feelings aroused in the message: This could also be considered a form of evasion, but it specifically refers to the lack of substance behind the argument itself."
