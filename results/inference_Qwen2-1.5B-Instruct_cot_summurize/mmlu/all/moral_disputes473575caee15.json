Controlled use refers to the legal use of substances such as alcohol and tobacco, which are regulated by law in order to prevent their abuse or misuse. The argument for why drug laws should be stricter (i.e., more stringent) in terms of regulating access to illegal drugs is often based on the idea that controlled use is less prevalent than unregulated use, and therefore drug laws need to be implemented to protect public health and safety. So while it's true that drug laws can limit access to illegal drugs, they may also help to prevent people from using them inappropriately or in dangerous ways. Therefore, the standard view seems to argue that drug laws should be strict in order to control and regulate access to illegal drugs, rather than just focusing on reducing access altogether."
