However, simply stating that the witness is not currently in court or that they have died does not necessarily prove their unavailability.\n\nTo establish unavailability, you must demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made to procure the witness's presence. This means that you should investigate whether there were any obstacles preventing the witness from attending the trial and take appropriate measures to overcome those obstacles if possible. If the witness refuses to attend for any reason, this can also be considered an indication of unavailability."
