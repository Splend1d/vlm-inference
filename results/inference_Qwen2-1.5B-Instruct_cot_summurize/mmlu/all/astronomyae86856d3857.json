The atmosphere of Mars is composed mainly of carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes it inhospitable to humans as they would not be able to breathe in its presence. \n\nMars has an extremely thin atmosphere, with only about 96 parts per million by volume of oxygen (O2). This is compared to Earth's atmosphere, where O2 makes up around 78% of the air. Mars' atmosphere also contains small amounts of other gases such as nitrogen (78%), argon (10%), and helium (1%). \n\nHowever, due to its low pressure and lack of liquid water, Mars is not considered a suitable location for human colonization at this time. While there have been some proposals for space tourism to Mars, it remains highly speculative and unlikely that humans will establish a permanent settlement anytime soon."
