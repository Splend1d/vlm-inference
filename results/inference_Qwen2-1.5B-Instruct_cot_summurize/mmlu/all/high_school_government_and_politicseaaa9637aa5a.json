Congressional oversight activities most often take place at the committee and subcommittee levels.\n\nCongressional oversight refers to the legislative bodies' responsibility for ensuring that executive agencies, federal courts, and other government entities are operating within the law. It involves monitoring and evaluating their actions, policies, and programs to ensure they are fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities effectively. This process typically occurs through committees in both houses of Congress (House of Representatives and Senate), where members can investigate, hold hearings, and pass resolutions or bills aimed at improving accountability and transparency. Constituent input plays an important role in shaping these oversight efforts, as it helps lawmakers understand public concerns and priorities."
