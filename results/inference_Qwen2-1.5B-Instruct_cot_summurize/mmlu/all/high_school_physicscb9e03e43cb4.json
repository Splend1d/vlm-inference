The equation for this relationship is:\n\n\\[ W = Q + \\Delta U \\]\n\nFor an isothermal expansion, \u0394U = 0 because the temperature remains constant. Thus, we can rearrange the equation to solve for Q:\n\n\\[ Q = W - \\Delta U \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation gives:\n\n\\[ Q = 150 J - 0 = 150 J \\]\n\nTherefore, 150 J of heat was removed from the gas during the isothermal expansion. Option B is correct."
