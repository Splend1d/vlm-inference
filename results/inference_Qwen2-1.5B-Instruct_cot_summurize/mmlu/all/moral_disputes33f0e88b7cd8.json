All of the above.\n\nFeminist rhetoric has indeed obscured the harms of noncoerced, consensual sex by implying that because what is coerced is bad, what is noncoerced is good. It has also obscured the harms of rape by equating all sex with non-consensual sex. Additionally, it has failed to acknowledge a distinction between what is good and what is non-coerced, leading to the acknowledgment of the harms of consensual sex."
