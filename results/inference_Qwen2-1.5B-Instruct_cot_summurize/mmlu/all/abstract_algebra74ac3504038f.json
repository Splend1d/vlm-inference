Zero has no inverse.\n\nIn a group, for every element \\(a\\) in the set, there must be an element \\(b\\) such that when multiplied by \\(a\\), the result is the identity element (usually denoted as 1 or e). For example, if we consider the set of integers under addition, the identity element is 0 because adding any integer to 0 gives us the same integer back. \n\nHowever, in the set of real numbers under multiplication, the identity element is 1 (since multiplying any real number by 1 results in itself). But 0 does not have an inverse because it cannot be multiplied by another number to get back to 1 (which is the multiplicative identity).\n\nTherefore, option D is correct."
