And as each machine will do as much work in twelve hours, as ten men can in that time do by hand, \u2026 [And, as the machines do] as much work in one day as would otherwise employ twenty men, \u2026 [a] full four thousand men are left to shift for a living how they can, and must of course fall to the Parish, if not timely relieved. \u2026 How are those men, thus thrown out of employ to provide for their families; and what are they to put their children apprentice to, that the rising generation may have something to keep them at work, in order that they may not be like vagabonds strolling about in idleness? \u2026 Many more evils we could enumerate, but we would hope, that the sensible part of mankind, who are not biased by interest, must see the dreadful tendency of their continuance; a depopulation must be the consequence; trade being then lost, the landed interest will have no other satisfaction but that of being last devoured.\nLeeds Woolen Workers Petition, 1786\nThe sentiments expressed by the Leeds woolen workers illustrate which of the following historical trends?\n\nA. The social effects of industrialization\nB. The rise of nationalism\nC. Imperial expansion\nD. Cultural changes in a material age\n"

The social effects of industrialization\n\nThe Leeds woolen workers' petition highlights the impact of industrialization on employment and livelihoods, with many losing jobs due to the use of machinery instead of manual labor. This illustrates the social disruption caused by the transition from artisanal production to mass manufacturing in the late 18th century. The petition also discusses the economic hardship faced by these workers and the potential consequences of this trend, such as population decline and loss of trade, which were significant issues during the Industrial Revolution in England."
