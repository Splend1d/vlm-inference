This can be done through various means such as:\n\n1. Providing public goods: Governments can provide public goods such as roads, parks, libraries, and healthcare services to ensure that everyone has access to them.\n\n2. Ensuring availability: Governments can also ensure that public goods are available to everyone who needs them by setting up systems to distribute them evenly across the population.\n\n3. Encouraging voluntary contributions: Governments can encourage voluntary contributions to public goods by offering incentives such as tax credits or subsidies for individuals who contribute to public goods.\n\n4. Promoting competition: Governments can promote competition in the market by encouraging private companies to offer similar services at lower prices than public goods.\n\n5. Monitoring and regulating: Governments can monitor and regulate the provision of public goods to ensure that they are being used efficiently and fairly.\n\nTherefore, option C (supplying public goods using tax dollars) is the best answer to avoid a free rider problem."
