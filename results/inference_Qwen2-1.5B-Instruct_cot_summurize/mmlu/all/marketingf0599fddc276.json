Behavioral learning.\n\nClassical conditioning and operant conditioning involve changes in behavior through reinforcement or punishment, but they do not apply to providing free samples of perfumes as part of marketing efforts. Social learning involves imitation and modeling behaviors, but it does not directly relate to offering free samples for scent testing. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D. Behavioral learning."
