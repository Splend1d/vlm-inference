Gout, also known as\u75db\u98a8 (t\u00f2ng x\u016bn), is a type of uric acid crystal deposition disorder that can be caused by certain medications such as diuretics and some antibiotics. Difficulty rising from a chair is not necessarily diagnostic of polymyalgia reumatica (PMR), but it can be a symptom of other conditions related to PMR. Joint stiffness lasting for more than five minutes does suggest an arthropathy, which is inflammation of the joints."
