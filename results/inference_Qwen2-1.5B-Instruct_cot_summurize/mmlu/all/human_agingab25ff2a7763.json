Tai Chi is a gentle form of exercise that focuses on slow, controlled movements and deep breathing, which can help improve balance and coordination.\n\nB. Aerobic exercise such as walking or cycling can also help improve balance by increasing muscle strength and flexibility.\n\nC. Weight lifting can also be beneficial for improving balance, but it should be done under the guidance of a fitness professional to avoid injury.\n\nD. Walking briskly is a simple way to improve balance and cardiovascular health, but it may not specifically target balance improvement in the same way as other forms of exercise.\n\nOverall, incorporating a combination of activities from all of these categories into an exercise routine can provide a well-rounded approach to improving balance for older adults."
