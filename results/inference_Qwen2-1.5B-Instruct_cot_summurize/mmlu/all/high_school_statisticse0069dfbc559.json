Patients in the other group are given blindfolds and played soft music at bedtime. Each patient is attached to a machine that records breathing patterns. From the patterns, it is possible to determine if the patient is awake or asleep. The data will be used to decide which method is more effective in helping patients with sleep disorders. Which of the following statements is correct in the context of this experiment?\n\nA. It is not possible for this experiment to be single-blind or double-blind, because human subjects are involved.\nB. This is only a single-blind experiment because the experimenters did not include a control group that received neither medication nor a blindfold and soft music.\nC. This is only a single-blind experiment because patients will know which treatment they are receiving, although the examining doctor might not.\nD. This is a double-blind experiment because the experimenters could prevent both groups of patients from knowing what sort of treatment the other group is receiving.\n"

This is a double-blind experiment because the experimenters could prevent both groups of patients from knowing what sort of treatment the other group is receiving.\n\nDouble-blind experiments involve random assignment of participants to either the treatment or placebo group without them knowing which group they are in. In this case, the researchers would randomly assign the patients to receive either medication before bedtime or blindfolds and soft music at bedtime, but neither the patients nor the researchers would know which treatment each patient received. This ensures that any differences between the treatments are due to the specific conditions being studied and not to the experimental design itself."
