However, since this scenario does not involve any harm or wrongdoing towards others, it would not be classified as morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves discrimination based on race, which goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The act of triggering an alarm upon encountering a black person who might be planning to rob the store is a clear example of prejudice and discrimination, which is widely condemned and illegal under many jurisdictions. Therefore, this scenario would be considered morally wrong."
