The statute will be applicable to all leasehold contracts hereafter entered into between landlords and tenants involving residential and commercial properties. The new federal statute is intended to protect tenants from spiraling rents and \"profiteering\" by landlords without curtailing the supply of rental units or depriving landlords of substantial constitutional rights. The new federal statute would be most clearly constitutional as applied to\n\nA. the rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business.\nB. the rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.\nC. the rental of an apartment located by a real estate company to an individual tenant.\nD. the rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord.\n"

It also does not involve any governmental entity (state-owned office building) or the operation of a city (office building rented to a city), which would not fall within the scope of the statute's application. Therefore, it seems like the best fit for this scenario based on the given options."
