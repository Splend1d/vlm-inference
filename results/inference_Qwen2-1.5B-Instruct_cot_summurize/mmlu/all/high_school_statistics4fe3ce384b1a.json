I only\n\nIncreasing the sample size will increase the power of a hypothesis test because it increases the degree of freedom in the sampling distribution, making it more likely that the observed data will come from the true population parameter. This leads to a larger p-value for the null hypothesis, thereby increasing the power of the test.\n\nDecreasing the sample size would decrease the power of the test by reducing the variability in the data and decreasing the likelihood of observing an effect when one exists (Type II error). Increasing the significance level does not directly affect the power of a hypothesis test but can make it easier to reject the null hypothesis if there is no real difference between the groups being compared (false positive results).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. I only."
