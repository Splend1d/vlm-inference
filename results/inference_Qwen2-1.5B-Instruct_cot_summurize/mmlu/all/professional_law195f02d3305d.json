He then filed a motion to discharge on December 1. Since the date of his arrest (February 1) plus the date of his release (March 1) equals 176 days, which is greater than 175 days, the court must consider the 175-day period before considering the defendant's motion for discharge. Therefore, the defendant should be discharged based on this calculation."
