They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.\"\nJohn Kerry, 1971\nThe most important factor in the defeat of Democratic presidential candidates in the elections of 1952 and 1968 was\n\nA. the American public's desire to avoid conflict and return to a more conservative political and social life\nB. the Democratic Party platform pledge to increase taxes in order to pay off the national debt\nC. the Democratic candidates' controversial positions on civil rights legislation\nD. the Democratic Party's unequivocal support of the Equal Rights Amendment\n"

They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart.\" This suggests that many Americans did not understand or care about the differences between different political ideologies or economic systems, which made it difficult for Democrats to appeal to them. The American public's preference for a more peaceful and stable political climate may have contributed to their failure to elect a Democratic candidate in either election."
