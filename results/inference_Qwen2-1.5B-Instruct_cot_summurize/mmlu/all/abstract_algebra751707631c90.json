A homomorphism exists only when $f(0) = 0$. This is because in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, the operation is modulo 2, so any element multiplied by 0 will result in 0. Therefore, $f(0)$ must map to 0.\n   \n2. For $f(1) = 1$, since $1 + 1 = 0 \\mod 2$, the image of 1 needs to be mapped to 1 as well. So, $f(1)$ can take on any value except 0, but must map to some other integer, which corresponds to the possible values of $b$ in the equation $f(1) = b \\mod 2$.\n\n3. We cannot have $f(-1) = -1$ or $f(-1) = 1$ because then $f(1) = 1$ would not hold true. \n\n4. Finally, $f(-1)$ can map to either 0 or 1, depending on whether $f(1)$ maps to 0 or 1 respectively. However, this is also dependent on how $f(1)$ maps to 0 or 1.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only way for a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ to exist is if $f(1)$ maps to 1. Thus, the total number of homomorphisms from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is 1.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. 1**."
