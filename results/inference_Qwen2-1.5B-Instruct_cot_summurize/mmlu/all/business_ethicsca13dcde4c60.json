Gig, Risk, Flexibility, Autonomy\n\nThis answer choice refers to a \"gig\" economy, where individuals work as independent contractors or freelancers for short periods without a long-term contract. This type of employment provides flexibility but also carries risks, such as fluctuating income and less social welfare support compared to traditional employment models. The term \"autonomy\" suggests that workers have more control over their work and personal life, another advantage of gig work."
