During the riot, a defendant was walking along the street when he paused in front of an appliance store. He picked up a portable television set that was lying on the sidewalk and started to walk off quickly. A police officer who was standing in front of the shop rushed after the defendant and arrested him. The defendant, an indigent, was charged with grand larceny, a felony carrying the maximum penalty of seven months imprisonment and a S 1,000 fine. At his arraignment, the judge advised the defendant of his right to have counsel appointed for him. The defendant, however, told the judge that he wanted to represent himself and waive his right to a jury trial. The judge then questioned the defendant at length about his demands. The defendant indicated that he had no previous legal experience. He told the judge that the reason he didn't want a court-appointed attorney to represent him was because he didn't trust lawyers. The judge did not find the defendant's reasons for representing himself to be persuasive and appointed an attorney to represent him. Thereafter, an attorney was appointed by the court to represent the defendant. The attorney told the court that the defendant wanted a non-jury trial. However, at the prosecution's request, the court impaneled a jury. The defendant was subsequently convicted by the jury and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In addition, the defendant was ordered to reimburse the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This reimbursement order was made pursuant to a relevant statute in effect at the time of the defendant's arrest. The defendant appeals both the conviction and the reimbursement order. The appellate court should\n\nA. affirm both the conviction and the reimbursement order.\nB. affirm the conviction, but not the reimbursement order.\nC. reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.\nD. reverse both the conviction and the reimbursement order because the defendant was denied the right to represent himself.\n"

Reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order.\n\nIn this case, the defendant was denied his constitutional right to a non-jury trial under the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This means that the court should have conducted the trial without a jury present, as required by law. The defendant was represented by an attorney, but the judge did not allow him to select a jury, which is a fundamental aspect of the criminal justice system. Therefore, the defendant was denied his right to a fair trial, which is a violation of due process.\n\nHowever, the defendant waived his right to a jury trial and chose to represent himself, despite the judge's objection. As a result, the defendant's conviction stands, but it should be reversed based on the denial of his right to a non-jury trial.\n\nRegarding the reimbursement order, the defendant was ordered to pay back the state $450 to cover the cost of his attorney. This is a consequence of the defendant's conviction and not related to any constitutional rights violation. Therefore, the reimbursement order is not affected by the reversal of the conviction.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C. Reverse the conviction because he was denied the right to a non-jury trial, but not the reimbursement order."
