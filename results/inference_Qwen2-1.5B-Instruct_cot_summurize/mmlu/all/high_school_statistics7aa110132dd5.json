Which of the following best describes the difference in the percentages obtained from the newspaper poll and the vote itself?\n\nA. It is an example of nonresponse bias, the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to refuse to answer a survey question.\nB. It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons.\nC. It is the difference between the same statistics computed from two different samples.\nD. It is the difference between the statistic and the truth due to use of a random sample.\n"

The results showed that 58% of the people did not want the annexation. However, during the actual vote, only 56% of those who responded to the newspaper poll actually voted against the annexation. This means there is a discrepancy between what the public thought and what actually happened in the voting process. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the people who responded to the newspaper poll may have been more likely to support the annexation than those who actually voted. Therefore, the difference in percentages is due to the way the data was collected and analyzed, rather than a true difference in the population's opinion."
