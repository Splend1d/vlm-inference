Vestibule training is a type of job-specific training that helps pilots become familiar with their aircraft and procedures, and can be particularly useful for air traffic controllers who work in a similar environment. Word processors do not typically require this level of specialized training, and salespeople may need to learn about customer service or product knowledge, but not necessarily how to fly an airplane. Clinical psychologists may benefit from vestibule training if they work with patients who have aviation-related issues, such as anxiety disorders or traumatic brain injuries."
