All countries cooperating to change the existing incentive structure by introducing a system of enforceable sanctions to curb climate change.\n\nThis option describes a scenario where multiple parties (countries) come together to address a common problem (climate change) and work towards a solution that involves voluntary actions but also includes some level of enforcement through international agreements and penalties for non-compliance. This approach allows for cooperation between different nations without necessarily requiring them to make identical commitments or have a mutual understanding about what those commitments should be. It also acknowledges that some nations may not be able or willing to fully comply with the agreed-upon standards due to economic or other reasons, which can lead to some degree of flexibility in implementation."
