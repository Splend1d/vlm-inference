                    "text": "The correct answer is A: The court will allow the records because they were kept in the ordinary course of business. \n\nUnder Federal Rule of Evidence 801(b), hearsay statements made by a party-opponent or a witness for the opposing party must be considered only if the statement falls within one of several exceptions listed in Rule 801(a). One such exception is Rule 801(c)(2), which allows an admission of a business record created or compiled by or for a party-in-interest (i.e., someone who has a financial interest) to rebut a presumption of unreliability.\n\nIn this case, the defendant offered the computer business records as part of his defense against the government's claim that he had failed to monitor the accounts properly. He testified that these records were kept regularly in the ordinary course of business, without providing any additional explanation about how the records were collected or verified. Therefore, the court could conclude that the records were created and compiled by or for the defendant, and therefore fall within the exception for business records under Rule 801(c)(2).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that even with this exception, the court may still exercise its discretion to exclude the records if they would otherwise violate other rules of evidence or if they lack sufficient foundation to support their probative value. For example, the court might exclude the records if there was no chain of custody showing how the records were obtained, or if the records were not signed or dated by the person who created them. In those cases, the court could still admit the records, but only after ruling on whether the records meet the requirements for admissibility under Rule 801(c)(2)."
