They are considered to be the highest form of international law because they represent the consent of the states parties to create new rules that bind them all.\n\nCustoms, on the other hand, refer to the customs or practices of individuals or groups that arise from repeated action over time. While customs can influence international behavior, they do not have the same legal force as treaties.\n\nGeneral principles of law, such as those enshrined in the United Nations Charter, also have some weight in international law, but they are generally seen as being more aspirational than enforceable.\n\nTherefore, the hierarchy of sources of international law is:\n\n1. Treaties\n2. Customary international law (which includes general principles of law)\n3. International conventions\n\nIt should be noted that the relationship between these sources is complex and subject to interpretation, depending on the context and the specific issue under consideration."
