Have they simply become IR and lost their position that defines them as security studies?\n\nA. The next generation is likely to develop their arguments in engagements with policy questions and in direct interaction with policymakers and think tanks.\nB. Policy knowledge reflected in terms of theories, when an interaction emerges between the US and European thinkers, the theoretical context will be the same.\nC. The set up continues to be one in which security studies is located between the IR discipline and technical experts and practitioners.\nD. European security studies will be treated as a form of (policy) knowledge, whereas security theory in the US will treat this as the main empirical source for critical analysis.\n"

They have helped to challenge traditional assumptions about security and have led to a greater emphasis on human rights, social justice, and environmental concerns in security studies.\n\nWhile it is true that some aspects of these critical approaches may overlap with other areas of security studies, such as international relations or technical expertise, there is still value in distinguishing security studies from other disciplines. Security studies remains distinct because it focuses on understanding and addressing the complex interplay of political, economic, and social factors that shape state behavior and security outcomes.\n\nIn addition, the critical schools have also contributed to a broader discussion around the role of security studies in shaping policy and practice. By highlighting the importance of ethical considerations and the need for interdisciplinary approaches, they have helped to bring attention to the limitations of traditional security paradigms and the need for more comprehensive and inclusive frameworks.\n\nOverall, while the critical schools may influence the direction of security studies research and policy-making, they remain distinct from other fields within the discipline and continue to provide valuable insights into the complexities of contemporary security challenges."
