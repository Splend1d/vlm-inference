Six months later, when the man was still in possession, he conveyed the land by quitclaim deed as a gift to a friend, who knew nothing of the deed to the cousin. The friend did not record his deed. The man then vacated the land, and the friend took possession. The recording act of the jurisdiction provides as follows: \"No unrecorded conveyance or mortgage of real property shall be good against subsequent purchasers for value without notice, who shall first record.\" Recently, the cousin learned about the friend's deed and possession, immediately recorded her deed, and sued the friend for possession and to quiet title. The friend then recorded his deed and raised all available defenses. For whom is the court likely to decide?\n\nA. For the cousin, because she was first in time and the friend was not a purchaser.\nB. For the cousin, because the friend failed to first record.\nC. For the friend, because a subsequent good- faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.\nD. For the friend, because he was first in possession.\n"

For the friend, because a subsequent good-faith donee has priority over a prior donee who fails to record.\n\nIn this scenario, the cousin conveyed the land to the friend six months after the man conveyed it to him, but the friend never recorded his deed. Therefore, the friend cannot assert that the man's deed is invalid due to non-recordation.\n\nHowever, the friend did record his own deed before the cousin learned about it. In jurisdictions with recording statutes like the one described in the question, if the friend records his deed before the cousin does, the friend's deed will trump any claim by the cousin.\n\nTherefore, the friend can sue the cousin for possession and to quiet title, and the court is likely to decide in favor of the friend, since the friend was the first person to record and thus had the right to bring an action for possession and quiet title."
