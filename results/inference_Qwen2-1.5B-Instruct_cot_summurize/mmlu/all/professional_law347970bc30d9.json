Subsequent to the statute a resident alien enters into a contract to buy 50 acres of land located in the state. Assume that the statute empowers the state to bring an ejectment action against any alien who owns more than 10 acres of land. If the resident alien brings an action in federal court to enjoin the state from enforcing the statute against him, his best argument is\n\nA. the statute violates the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. the statute violates the contract clause.\nC. the statute violates the commerce clause in that it interferes with land ownership.\nD. the statute violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n"

In this case, the state's statute would be unconstitutional because it discriminates against residents of the state by denying them the same property rights as citizens.\n\nTherefore, the resident alien's best argument for enjoining the state's enforcement of the statute would be that the statute violates the privileges or immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
