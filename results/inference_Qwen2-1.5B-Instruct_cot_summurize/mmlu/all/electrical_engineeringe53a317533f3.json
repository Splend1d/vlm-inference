The type of network can be determined by analyzing the sign of the imaginary part of the poles.\n\nIf all the poles have a negative imaginary part (i.e., they lie to the left of the origin), then the network is a RL network. If all the poles have a positive imaginary part (i.e., they lie to the right of the origin), then the network is an RC network.\n\nTherefore, if the poles and zeros are arranged alternately on the negative real axis, then the network is most likely an RL network. However, without additional information about the specific parameters of the circuit, it's not possible to definitively determine the exact type of network based solely on this arrangement of poles and zeros."
