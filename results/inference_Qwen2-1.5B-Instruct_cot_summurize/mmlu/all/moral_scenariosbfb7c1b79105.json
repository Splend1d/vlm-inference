According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, lying about one's age to get a discount on an airline ticket would be considered morally wrong. Lying is generally not considered acceptable behavior and can lead to negative consequences for both oneself and others. In this case, the main character lied about his age to obtain a discount on an airline ticket, which goes against ethical principles. The other scenario, where the main character quickly turned away from her mother-in-law when she needed to sneeze, is not morally wrong because it was necessary to avoid infecting her with germs."
