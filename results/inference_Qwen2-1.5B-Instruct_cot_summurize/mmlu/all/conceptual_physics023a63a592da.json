Bernoulli's principle\n\nBernoulli's principle states that the total pressure in a fluid is constant, and that it can be divided into three distinct regions: static pressure (the pressure at rest), dynamic pressure (pressure caused by movement), and velocity head (pressure due to changes in speed). In the case of a blimp flying through the air, this principle explains how the blimp maintains its shape and altitude while also maintaining its lift.\n\nArchimedes' principle states that an object immersed in a fluid experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object; this principle does not apply directly to blimps as they do not displace any fluid.\n\nPascal's principle states that if a pressure difference exists between two points in a confined space, then the same pressure difference will exist on either side of the barrier separating the two points; however, this principle only applies when the volume of the space remains constant, which is not the case for a blimp.\n\nBoyle's law states that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure when temperature is held constant; again, this principle does not apply to blimps since their shape and dimensions change with altitude and temperature.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Bernoulli's principle."
