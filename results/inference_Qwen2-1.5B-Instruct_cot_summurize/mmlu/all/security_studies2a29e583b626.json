Redistribution as a means of denial to the power structure in the form of \"elite disenfranchisement\" which may include diversion of resources, disarmament and denial of access to commercial activity routes.\nB. Lacking infrastructural capacity and wider social legitimacy, weak state elites are often forced to rely on coercive power. However, a key dilemma is that the instruments of violence can be a threat to the regime requiring the deliberate undermining of armed forces.\nC. Elites attempt to foster a new politics of identity in which ethnic consciousness is superseded by ideologies orientated around the myth of the regime.\nD. Weak states have cultivated international sponsorship and have initiated processes of democratic reform so as to gain popular legitimacy internally whilst bolstering its international legitimacy externally.\n"

Redistributing resources: Elites might use their power to redistribute resources or wealth from certain groups to others. This could involve giving more resources to the elite group, such as through tax breaks or subsidies, while withholding them from lower-income groups.\n\nB. Coercive power: Weak state elites might rely on coercion, such as through military force or repression, to maintain control over their territory and population. They might also use propaganda and other forms of manipulation to try to undermine the authority of the government.\n\nC. Fostering a new politics of identity: Elites might try to foster a new politics of identity that focuses less on ethnicity and more on ideology, such as nationalism or socialism. This could involve promoting the values and beliefs of the elite group and using these values to justify their rule.\n\nD. Strengthening international legitimacy: Weak states might seek to strengthen their international legitimacy by engaging with foreign powers and participating in international organizations. This could involve negotiating treaties and agreements with other countries, or by seeking recognition and support from global institutions like the United Nations.\n\nIt's important to note that these options are not mutually exclusive and that different elites may prioritize different strategies depending on their goals and the circumstances they face. Additionally, there may be no single strategy that works well across all contexts, and it may be necessary to consider multiple options when developing an internal security policy."
