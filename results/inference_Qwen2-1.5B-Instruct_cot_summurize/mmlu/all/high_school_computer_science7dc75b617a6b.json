An e-mail from a merchant asking that you click on a link to reset your password is least likely to indicate a phishing attack because it does not ask for personal information such as your date of birth or social security number. Phishing attacks often use other tactics, such as fake websites or emails with malicious attachments, to trick users into providing sensitive information. It is important to be cautious when clicking on links in unexpected emails and to carefully review any requests for personal information before providing it."
