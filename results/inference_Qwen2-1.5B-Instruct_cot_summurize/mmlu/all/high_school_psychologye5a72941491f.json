In classical conditioning, the learner learns to associate a new stimulus (the conditioned stimulus) with a previously neutral or unconditioned stimulus (the unconditioned stimulus). This association leads to the formation of a conditioned response, which is a specific behavior that is elicited by the conditioned stimulus. The conditioned response can be positive or negative depending on the context in which it was learned."
