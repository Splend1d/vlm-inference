Since there are d people buying salads, the total cost of salads is d * $3.99. Similarly, since there are p people buying soups, the total cost of soups is p * $2.99. Therefore, the total cost of all the meals is the sum of these two quantities:\n\nTotal cost = d * $3.99 + p * $2.99 = 3.99d + 2.99p\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 3.99p + 2.99d."
