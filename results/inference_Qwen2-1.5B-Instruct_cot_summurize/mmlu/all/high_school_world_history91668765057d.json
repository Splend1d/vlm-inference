Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!\nOlympe de Gouges, \"Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,\" 1791\nThe independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fear\u2014but apart from that, nothing has changed.\nHalima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence\nWhich of the following observations about revolutions and gender is best supported by the first passage?\n\nA. Revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality.\nB. Women typically assume leadership roles during times of revolution.\nC. Women rarely support revolutions and therefore receive little benefit from them.\nD. Revolutionary movements are generally uninterested in women's rights.\n"

In the first passage, Olympe de Gouges expresses her frustration with the lack of progress made towards women's rights during the French Revolution, while Halima Ghomri, who lived through Algeria's war of independence, states that she was never able to access education or receive benefits from the revolution despite being a woman.\n\nTherefore, both passages suggest that revolutionary movements may not always focus on addressing gender inequalities, which supports option A."
