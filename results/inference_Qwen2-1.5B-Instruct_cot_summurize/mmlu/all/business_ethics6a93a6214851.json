Little power, Major contribution, Corporate social responsibility. \n\nThis sentence implies that businesses have some level of influence or power in society but also have the potential to make positive contributions through their actions if they choose to do so responsibly. On the other hand, businesses can also cause harm by engaging in unethical practices such as business malpractice. Therefore, the sentence suggests that businesses should prioritize corporate social responsibility and strive to make a major contribution to society while minimizing harm to individuals, communities, and the environment."
