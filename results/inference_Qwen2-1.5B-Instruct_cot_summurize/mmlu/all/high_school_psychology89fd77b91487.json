However, since there are only three students with specific scores (47, 55, and 62), it's not possible for any single student to have a mode.\n\nSkewness refers to the asymmetry of a distribution around its mean. A positive skew suggests that the data are skewed to the right, while a negative skew suggests that the data are skewed to the left. This information alone does not help us determine if these scores are outliers or if they are part of the normal distribution.\n\nVariance measures how spread out the values in a dataset are from their average value. Again, we don't have enough information here to determine if the scores are outliers based on variance alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC. Outliers."
