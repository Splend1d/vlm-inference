PKU (phenylketonuria) is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body. This accumulation can cause neurological damage and lead to intellectual disability, mental retardation, seizures, and eventually death if not treated.\n\nPKU can be prevented through dietary management, as it requires the elimination of foods that contain tyrosine, a precursor to phenylalanine. This prevents the production of excess phenylalanine in the body and reduces the risk of neurological damage.\n\nTay-Sachs syndrome is an autosomal recessive inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the SLC26A4 gene, which encodes for the alpha-1,3-glucosidase enzyme. The enzyme is essential for the breakdown of beta-glucan, a complex carbohydrate found in milk, meat, and other dairy products. A deficiency in this enzyme can result in the accumulation of beta-glucomannans, which damages nerve cells and causes progressive motor neuron degeneration.\n\nHuntington's disease is also caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene, which codes for a protein involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. The disease is characterized by progressive neuronal loss, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms. \n\nDown syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 or 18, resulting in an abnormal structure of the cell nucleus and increased levels of certain proteins. It is associated with intellectual disability, growth retardation, heart defects, and various medical conditions."
