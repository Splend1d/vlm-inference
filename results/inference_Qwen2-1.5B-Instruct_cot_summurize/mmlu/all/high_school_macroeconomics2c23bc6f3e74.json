So, if real GDP per capita was $10000 in 1990 and $15000 in 2000, then the increase from 1990 to 2000 is:\n\n$15000 - $10000 = $5000.\n\nThis means there was an increase of $5000 in real GDP per capita over this time period. To find the percentage increase, you divide the increase by the original value (in this case, $10000) and multiply by 100:\n\n($5000 / $10000) * 100 = 5%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 5% growth."
