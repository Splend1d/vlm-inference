In this case, since the tank is a cylinder with a fixed volume (50 gallons) and it fills up in 20 seconds, the height \\(h\\) is simply 20 seconds.\n\nThe volume of the tank is given by:\n\\[ V = 50 \\, \\text{gallons} \\]\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 \\cdot 20 \\]\n\nWe need to solve for \\(r\\):\n\\[ 50 = \\frac{\\pi}{20} \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 20 \\]\n\\[ 50 = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{2} \\]\n\\[ 100 = \\pi r^2 \\]\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{100}{\\pi} \\]\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{\\frac{100}{\\pi}} \\]\n\nNow that we have the radius, we can calculate the flow rate (\\(Q\\)) which is the volume divided by the time:\n\\[ Q = \\frac{V}{t} = \\frac{50}{20} = 2.5 \\, \\text{gallons/second}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 2.5 gallons per second."
