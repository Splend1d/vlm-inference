The divine command theory holds that God's commands are given directly by God and are therefore infallible and should be followed without question. However, critics argue that this theory leads to an inconsistent understanding of what constitutes right and wrong behavior, as it suggests that God's commands are arbitrary and not based on any moral principles or universal standards. Therefore, the theory implies that God's commands are arbitrary."
