An increase in the price of forklifts imported into the United States from Belgium would likely increase the consumer price index (CPI) but not necessarily the GDP deflator.\n\nThe CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. When the price of goods increases, it can lead to an increase in the CPI.\n\nOn the other hand, the GDP deflator is a measure of inflation that adjusts nominal gross domestic product (GDP) figures to account for changes in prices. It takes into account both the price level and the quantity of output produced, so a rise in the price of goods could potentially reduce the GDP deflator.\n\nTherefore, while there may be some indirect effects on the economy as a whole, such as increased production costs passed down through supply chains, the immediate impact on the CPI would depend more on how quickly prices adjust to the higher cost of imported forklifts rather than on whether the overall economy experiences inflation."
