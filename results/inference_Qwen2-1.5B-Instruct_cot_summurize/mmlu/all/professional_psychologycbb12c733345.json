However, psychologists must also exercise discretion when interpreting and presenting raw data, especially if they suspect that there may be potential pathology or other sensitive information that could harm the client or others. In such cases, it is important to limit the amount of raw data that is included in the report and to provide only the most relevant and necessary information."
