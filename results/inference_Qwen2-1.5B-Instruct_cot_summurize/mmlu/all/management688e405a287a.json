Retaining the status quo suggests that organizations should continue with their current practices without making any changes or improvements. However, CSR frameworks recognize that businesses have an obligation to contribute positively to society and the environment, which means they need to adapt and evolve over time.\n\nTherefore, retaining the status quo is not a characteristic of a typical CSR framework. It is more aligned with a business as usual approach rather than actively seeking to improve and innovate."
