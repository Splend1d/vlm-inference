A nonsense mutation results in the premature termination of translation, leading to truncated proteins with no functional consequence. A thymine dimer mutation does not cause any change in the DNA sequence and would not affect the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein. A missense mutation, on the other hand, involves the substitution of one amino acid for another within a single codon, which can lead to altered protein function."
