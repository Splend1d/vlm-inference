This can lead to feelings of anxiety and discomfort when faced with unfamiliar situations or interactions. The mother's reaction to the child's behavior also supports this assessment, as it may indicate that the mother feels uncomfortable or anxious around the child due to the child's avoidance behavior. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Insecure avoidant."
