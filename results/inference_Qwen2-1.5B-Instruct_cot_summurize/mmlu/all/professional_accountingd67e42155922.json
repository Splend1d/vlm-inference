Include the paragraph immediately after the opinion paragraph in the audit report.\n\nAn emphasis-of-matter paragraph is included in an audit report to highlight a matter that is considered material to the financial statements and requires further explanation or clarification for users to understand the financial statements properly. The purpose of including such a paragraph is to ensure that users have sufficient information to make informed decisions about the financial statements.\n\nIt is not necessary for the auditor to indicate in the audit report that the emphasis-of-matter paragraph is required by law or regulation or notify the appropriate regulatory authority if the auditor's opinion was modified on the basis of the matter. Nor is it necessary to modify the introductory paragraph to direct the reader to the emphasis-of-matter paragraph.\n\nFinally, modifying the opinion paragraph does not change the overall conclusion of the audit, so it is not necessary to include the emphasis-of-matter paragraph in the same section as the opinion paragraph. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect because notifying the appropriate regulatory authority would require additional steps beyond simply including the emphasis-of-matter paragraph in the audit report."
