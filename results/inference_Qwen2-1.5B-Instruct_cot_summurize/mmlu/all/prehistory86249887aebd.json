Migrating out of Africa into Western Europe between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago and then spreading into Asia, Australia, and the Americas.\n\nThis theory has been widely accepted by paleoanthropologists as the most likely scenario for the origin and distribution of anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens). The evidence supporting this theory includes the genetic diversity found in modern human populations, which shows distinct genetic lineages originating from Africa, and the archaeological evidence showing the presence of Homo sapiens fossils in Asia, Australia, and North America.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests an evolutionary timeline starting in Asia before migrating to Africa, which does not align with the known fossil record or genetic data. Option C also contradicts the known genetic and archaeological evidence, suggesting that all modern humans originated in one place and migrated elsewhere at once. Option D is also incorrect because it suggests a migration route that was not supported by the available evidence."
