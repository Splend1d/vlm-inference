The formula for conditional probability is:\n\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\]\n\nwhere \\(P(A|B)\\) is the probability of event \\(A\\) occurring given that event \\(B\\) has already occurred.\n\nIf events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent, then the joint probability of both events occurring can be calculated as the product of their individual probabilities:\n\n\\[P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{P(A) \\cdot P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A)\\]\n\nSo option (A) is incorrect because it does not take into account that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent events.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because independence only implies that \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\\), but it does not necessarily imply that \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)\\). Independence simply means that knowing one event does not affect the likelihood of another event occurring.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because mutual exclusivity refers to two events happening simultaneously, whereas independence implies that the occurrence of one event does not affect the other's probability.\n\nIn summary, only option (D) correctly reflects the relationship between independent events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)."
