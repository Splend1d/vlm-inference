Her data showed that over half of the squirrels born did not survive to reproduce, because of competition for food and predation. In a single generation, 90% of the squirrels that were born lived to reproduce, and the population increased to 80. Which inference(s) about this population might be true?\n\nA. The amount of available food may have increased.\nB. The number of predators may have decreased.\nC. The squirrels of subsequent generations should show greater levels of genetic variation than previous generations, because squirrels that would not have survived in the past will now survive.\nD.

The amount of available food may have increased.\nThe population is never smaller than 30 squirrels, so there must be some way for them to obtain more resources or find new habitats where they can live without being eaten by predators or competing with other species.\n\nB. The number of predators may have decreased.\nIf the population is increasing, it suggests that there are fewer predators than before. This could happen if the population has become more resilient to disease or predation, or if there is less competition for resources.\n\nC. The squirrels of subsequent generations should show greater levels of genetic variation than previous generations, because squirrels that would not have survived in the past will now survive.\nThis is because when a certain trait becomes advantageous, it increases its frequency in the population. So if squirrels that wouldn't have survived in the past do now survive, their offspring will inherit those advantageous traits, leading to greater genetic diversity in the next generation.\n\nTherefore, all of the above options can be inferred from the given information."
