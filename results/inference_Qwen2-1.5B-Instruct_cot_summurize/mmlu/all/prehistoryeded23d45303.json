All of the above.\n\nThe Upper Paleolithic period (approximately 300,000-10,000 years ago) saw significant advancements in tool technology compared to the Middle Paleolithic period (approximately 400,000-200,00 years ago). Some key differences include:\n\n- Flakes became more common and sophisticated, with different types of flake techniques used for different purposes.\n- Blades were developed as specialized tools for tasks such as cutting wood or bone, and were often made from multiple pieces of stone.\n- Core tools, which are shaped by shaping the stone while it is still hot, continued to be produced but were likely less complex than those found in the Middle Paleolithic.\n- The use of animal bones and antler tusks as raw materials was widespread, reflecting changes in hunting practices that allowed people to exploit new resources and adapt to changing environments.\n- There was also an increase in the production of other types of stone artifacts, including pebble tools, hand axes, and composite tools made from several pieces of stone.\n\nOverall, the Upper Paleolithic period marked a major turning point in human technological evolution, with the development of specialized tools and a greater ability to manipulate and shape stone."
