This behavior is considered morally wrong because it promotes criminal activity and undermines law enforcement.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character sings a romantic song for their wife during her father's funeral, which can be seen as a form of expression or support. While this may not be universally accepted, it is generally considered not to be morally wrong."
