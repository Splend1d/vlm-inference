However, this also meant that wages for entry-level workers were not keeping up with the rising cost of living, leading to income inequality.\n\nAs a result, many workers found themselves struggling to make ends meet, while others saw their incomes grow significantly. This trend contributed to the growth of income inequality in the 1980s."
