The dealer lived approximately two miles from the theater. After picking up the marijuana, the classmate then drove to the concert. As he was driving to the concert, the classmate smoked two marijuana cigarettes so that he could be \"high\" for the show. While the car was parked outside the theater, through no fault of the classmate, it was struck by another car and damaged. Repairs will cost $750. The driver of the vehicle that struck the student's car fled the scene and cannot be identified. If the student asserts a claim against the classmate for the damage to the student's car, the plaintiff will recover\n\nA. the value of the car before it was damaged because the car was damaged while under the classmate's dominion and control.\nB. the value of the car before it was damaged because the classmate used the car for a purpose other than that for which it was lent.\nC. the cost of repairing the car because the car was damaged while under the classmate's dominion and control.\nD. nothing, because the classmate was not negligent in causing the car's damage.\n"

In this case, the student lent his car to the classmate with the expectation that it would be driven to the theater and back without any modifications or alterations. However, the classmate engaged in illegal activity (buying marijuana) and used the car for a purpose other than what was intended when it was lent. Therefore, the student has a cause of action against the classmate for the damage to the car. The court will assess the value of the car before it was damaged based on its condition after the accident, rather than before it was lent, since the car was damaged while under the classmate's dominion and control."
