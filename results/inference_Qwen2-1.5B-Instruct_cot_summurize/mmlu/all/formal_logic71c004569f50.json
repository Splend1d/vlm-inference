O = T (True)\n   - P = F (False)  \n   - ~O \u2283 P = F (False)\n   - O \u2228 P = T (True)\n\n2. O = F (False)\n   - P = T (True) \n   - ~O \u2283 P = T (True)\n   - O \u2228 P = F (False)\n\nSo, the truth table is as follows:\n\n| O | P | ~O \u2283 P | O \u2228 P |\n|---|---|-----------|-------|\n| T | F |       F     |    T   |\n| F | T |       T     |    F   |\n\nNow let's look at the second proposition:\n~O \u2283 P and O \u2228 P\n\nFrom our truth table, we can see that both expressions have different truth values when either variable O or P is True. This means that the two propositions are not logically equivalent.\n\nSince the first proposition has only one true case and the second one has multiple true cases, it also cannot be contradictory.\n\nHowever, since the first proposition does not hold under all circumstances while the second one holds in every scenario, we can conclude that they are inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Inconsistent."
