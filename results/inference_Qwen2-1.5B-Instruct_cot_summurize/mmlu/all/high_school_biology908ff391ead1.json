However, since there's only one copy of the gene in each individual, half of these individuals will be heterozygous for the trait (one copy of the recessive allele) and one copy of the dominant allele.\n\nSince we're assuming that the trait is recessive, half of the heterozygous individuals will express the trait (since they have both copies of the recessive allele). This leaves half of the heterozygotes who are carriers but do not express the trait.\n\nGiven that the frequency of the trait is 1%, it means there are approximately 10 individuals in the population who are carriers of the trait. Out of these 10, half (5) would express the trait, while the other half (5) are carriers.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of the population that are carriers but do not express the trait is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{10} = 0.5\\%\\]\n\nThe correct answer is **(D) 50%**."
