The most important characteristics of weak states are their frequent inability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence. Even within states with well developed coercive power they do not always retain absolute loyalty and are faced with a real possibility of military intervention. Whilst armed forces are ill-equipped, poorly managed and prone to factional divisions, social actors are powerful enough to resist governance. Therefore, monopoly over the instruments of violence is infrequent.\nB. Weak states possess high levels of social-political cohesion which is correlated to the hegemonic enforcement idea of the regime, which in turn becomes accepted to the point of being legitimized as the social norm.\nC. Weak states have a monopoly on the instruments of violence and have the coercive capability to force compliance even when social actors attempt to resist. The regimes lack popular legitimacy, the integrity of the regime's survival is consolidated by power resulting in the naturalization of violence within society.\nD. Weak states do not utilize coercive capabilities in normal policy. State institutions typically have a developed bureaucracy which legitimizes the regime's ability to rule. Paradoxically, however, the more a weak state exercises its coercive power the more it reinforces its infrastructural power but reduces its ability to rule.\n"

Weak states have a monopoly on the instruments of violence and have the coercive capability to force compliance even when social actors attempt to resist. The regimes lack popular legitimacy, the integrity of the regime's survival is consolidated by power resulting in the naturalization of violence within society.\n\nWeak states are characterized by their inability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence, despite having well-developed coercive power. They face a real possibility of military intervention due to the ill-equipped, poorly managed, and prone-to-factional-divisions armed forces. Social actors, while powerful enough to resist governance, often fail to exert significant influence on the state's policies or decisions.\n\nIn contrast, strong states have the ability to establish and maintain a monopoly of control over the instruments of violence and have the coercive capability to enforce their will on the population without difficulty. Strong states enjoy high levels of social-political cohesion, which leads to the acceptance of the regime's authority as the social norm. Weak states may experience a decline in popular legitimacy due to the regime's failure to deliver on its promises and the consolidation of power through the naturalization of violence within society."
