As he did so, the passenger became very frightened and fell backward. She struck her head against the window and was knocked unconscious. In the commotion, Defendant dropped the pocketbook and hurriedly exited the subway car empty-handed.

In this case, the defendant grabbed the pocketbook without permission and then fled the scene, which constitutes the actus reus (the commission of an act) required for robbery. The fact that the victim fell backward and hit her head against the window also indicates that she suffered physical harm due to the incident. Therefore, the correct answer is D. robbery."
