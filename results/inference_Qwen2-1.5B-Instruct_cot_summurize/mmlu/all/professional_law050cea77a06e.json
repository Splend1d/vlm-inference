He contacted several companies and asked them to submit bids for the installation work. An alarm company decided to submit a bid and, in turn, requested bids from several wholesalers for the burglar alarms it planned to use if it was awarded the job. A supplier submitted a bid to the alarm company that the latter used in computing the bid that it was preparing for the builder. On September 1, the alarm company sent the builder its bid, in which it proposed to install the security systems for $100,000. On September 9, the supplier notified the alarm company that it would be unable to supply any burglar alarms to them. On September 11, the builder sent the following fax to the alarm company: \"I hereby accept your offer to install the security systems for $100,000. \"The alarm company had to pay another wholesaler $10,000 above the price quoted by the supplier for the burglar alarms. As a result, the alarm company advised the builder that the total price for the job would have to be increased to $10,000. The builder replied that he would hold the alarm company to the initially agreed price of $100,000. The alarm company installed the security systems, but the builder has not yet paid them anything. In an action by the alarm company against the builder for services rendered, the alarm company will probably be able to recover\n\nA. $100,000, because that was the contract price.\nB. $110,000 because of an unanticipated changeof circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract.\nC. only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.\nD. only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.\n"

Only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.\n\nIn quantum meruit, the court will look at whether there were any unforeseen events that caused one party to breach the contract. In this case, the alarm company repudiated the contract by increasing the price without permission from the builder. This constitutes a breach of contract, so the builder can seek damages from the alarm company. However, the bellwether principle states that when a party breaches a contract, the other party must prove actual damage before they can claim damages. In this case, the builder did not actually suffer any financial loss until the increase in price occurred, so the alarm company cannot recover the entire amount demanded ($110,000). Instead, the builder can only recover the difference between the original contract price and the price charged (in this case, $100,000 - $110,000 = -$10,000).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder."
