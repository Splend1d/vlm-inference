Therefore, any conflict between them must be resolved in favor of the constitutional provisions, which are considered supreme over all other forms of law. This approach assumes that the Constitution or other foundational documents are the ultimate source of authority for the state's legal system and should not be overridden by international or domestic laws unless specifically authorized by those documents."
