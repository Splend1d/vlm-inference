This can include access to extracurricular activities, mentorship programs, or community service opportunities that can help students develop important life skills and increase their motivation to learn.\n\nFurthermore, partnerships between schools and communities can also help to create a sense of belonging and connection among students, which can have positive effects on their social-emotional development and overall well-being. By working together, schools and communities can create a supportive environment that encourages students to pursue their goals and excel academically."
