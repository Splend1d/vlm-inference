The distance between the two observers is given by \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}(v_1 + v_2)\\).\n\nThe time difference in the observation is given by \\(\\Delta t = \\frac{x}{c} - \\frac{(v_1 + v_2)x}{c^2}\\), where \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\nSince both sources flash simultaneously for the observer at rest (O), we have \\(\\Delta t = \\frac{x}{c}\\) for both sources. Thus, for the first source, \\(\\Delta t = \\frac{0}{c} = 0\\) ns, and for the second source, \\(\\Delta t = \\frac{10}{c}\\) ns.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for the time difference:\n\n\\[0 = \\frac{0}{c} - \\frac{(v_1 + v_2)(0)}{c^2}\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[0 = -\\frac{v_2}{c}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v_2\\):\n\n\\[v_2 = c\\]\n\nThus, the speed of the second observer relative to the first is \\(c\\), which corresponds to an option B."
