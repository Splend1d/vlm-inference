Types 14, 16, 18, 31, 45\n\nThe human papillomavirus (HPV) virus is a sexually transmitted infection that can lead to various types of cancers, including cervical cancer. The most common types of HPV associated with cervical cancer are HPV types 16, 18, and 31, which are also known as high-risk HPV types.\n\nType 14 and type 18 have been linked to other types of cancer, but not to cervical cancer. Type 45 is not considered an oncogenic HPV type, meaning it does not typically cause cancer on its own. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Types 14, 16, 18, 31, 45."
