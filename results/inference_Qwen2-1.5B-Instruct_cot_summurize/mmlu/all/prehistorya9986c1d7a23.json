The isotopic ratios of strontium in the teeth of people buried at Cop\u00e1n suggest that they were members of a ruling class that was closely connected to the state and its institutions. This is consistent with the idea that the Maya elites were able to maintain their power by controlling access to resources such as food and water, and by maintaining social order through strict laws and rituals. It is unlikely that the rulers would have been foreigners from other regions or that they would have eaten mainly vegetables and fish, nor would it be accurate to say that they would have learned about pyramid building from Egyptians."
