                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The heat of solution for cerium(III) sulfate is endothermic.\n\nThis conclusion can be drawn from the fact that cerium(III) sulfate is less soluble in hot water than in cold water. This implies that the solubility product (Ksp) of cerium(III) sulfate increases with temperature, which means that the dissolution process becomes more exothermic as the temperature increases. Therefore, the heat of solution for cerium(III) sulfate is endothermic at higher temperatures.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the heat of solution is typically associated with the dissolution process, not with the hydration of ions. Option B is also incorrect because the hydration energy of ions is not directly related to their solubility. Option D is also incorrect because the solubility of cerium(III) sulfate does not necessarily indicate whether or not it is an ideal solution."
