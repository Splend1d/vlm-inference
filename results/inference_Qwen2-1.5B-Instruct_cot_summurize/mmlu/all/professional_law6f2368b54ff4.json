One day, while loading a heavy tractor tire onto a truck by himself, he experienced a sharp and excruciating pain in his lower back. He did not report the incident to his employer, but continued to work. A week later, after work, he went to the doctor for treatment. The man then sues his employer, alleging that the employer failed to provide him with adequate assistance, safety equipment, and training to load heavy tractor tires, thereby contributing to his injury. The employer alleges that the man is merely trying to obtain compensation for an old back injury, unrelated to his employment. At trial, the man's doctor testified that the man told her that his back began hurting while he was loading the tire on the truck. The doctor's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as expert testimony.\nB. admissible as a statement for the purposes of medical diagnosis.\nC. inadmissible as a violation of the physicianpatient privilege.\nD. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

As a licensed medical professional, the doctor has expertise in diagnosing and treating injuries, including those related to manual labor such as lifting and carrying heavy objects like tractor tires. Therefore, the testimony about the man's claim of a new injury is relevant and competent evidence for the jury to consider when evaluating the case."
