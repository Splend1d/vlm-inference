Nitrogen (N\u2082), hydrogen (H\u2082O), carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), and ammonia (NH\u2083) were all present in the early Earth's atmosphere.\n\nNitrogen made up about 78% of the atmosphere at first, while oxygen (O\u2082) was only around 1%. Carbon dioxide was also significant, making up about 0.03% of the atmosphere. Methane and ammonia were trace amounts of gas, but they played important roles in the formation of the ozone layer and the Earth's climate system, respectively."
