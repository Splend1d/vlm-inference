Environmental security entails a consideration of the security of the global environment, as well as its nested sub-systems and social systems beyond the boundaries of the nation state.\nB. Environmental security is a critical security project in that it questions who and what is to be secured and from what threat by orthodox security policies, or whether linkages between environmental, security and development issues can be made.\nC. Environmental security is a practical endeavour to assess how environmental change causes violent conflict within and between countries, and the ways in which environmental security can undermine national security.\nD. All of these options. The environment is both an object to be secured and a source of risk, although it may mean different things to different people. Whilst deepening the concept of security it has both critical and practical dimensions although the utility of the concept is contested.\n"

Climate Change: Global warming caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels is causing climate change, leading to extreme weather conditions like droughts, floods, hurricanes, etc., which can cause loss of life and property damage.\n\n2. Biodiversity Loss: Deforestation, pollution, overfishing, etc., are causing significant loss of biodiversity, which can lead to ecological imbalances, loss of ecosystem services, and potential threats to food security.\n\n3. Water Scarcity: Lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities can lead to health problems and economic losses due to disease outbreaks, malnutrition, and lost productivity.\n\n4. Air Pollution: Air pollution caused by industrialization, transportation, and other human activities can lead to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and premature death.\n\n5. Nuclear Weapons: While nuclear weapons represent a major threat to international security, their production, storage, and use could have far-reaching consequences on the environment, including contamination of soil, water, and air.\n\n6. Resource Depletion: Overexploitation of natural resources such as forests, fisheries, and minerals can lead to depletion of these resources, which can affect food security, energy supplies, and economic growth.\n\n7. Ecological Imbalance: Changes in ecosystems, such as deforestation, habitat destruction, and climate change, can disrupt ecological balance, leading to biodiversity loss, species extinction, and ecosystem collapse.\n\n8. Disaster Risk Management: Natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, etc., can have severe impacts on infrastructure, public health, and economic activity, which can pose a threat to national security.\n\nTherefore, the environment is not only a subject for security but also a potential threat to it. Security practitioners need to consider the impact of environmental changes on national and international security."
