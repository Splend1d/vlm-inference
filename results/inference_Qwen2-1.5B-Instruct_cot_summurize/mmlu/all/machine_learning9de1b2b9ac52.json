Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details of the training data too well, resulting in poor generalization to new, unseen data. This can happen when the model becomes too complex or when there are not enough samples in the training set. In the case of your decision tree, it may have become too complex and learned the noise in the training data instead of the actual patterns.\n\nTo address this issue, you should try increasing the depth of your decision tree (option A) or reducing the number of features used in the training process (option B). Alternatively, you could consider using techniques such as regularization or cross-validation to prevent overfitting. It's also possible that you need more training data or a different approach altogether. Without further information about your specific implementation and dataset, it's difficult to say for certain what might be causing the problem."
