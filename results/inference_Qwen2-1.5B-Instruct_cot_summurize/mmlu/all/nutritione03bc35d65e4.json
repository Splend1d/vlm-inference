All older people living in Western countries have low vitamin D status.\n\nThis statement is not accurate. Vitamin D deficiency is more common in older adults, particularly those with limited sun exposure or who use sunscreen frequently due to skin concerns. However, it's important to note that while vitamin D deficiency is higher in older adults, it's also more common among younger populations as well. Additionally, vitamin D levels can vary widely within an individual based on factors such as age, sex, and lifestyle choices. Therefore, it's essential for older adults to consider their vitamin D intake through diet and/or supplementation, especially if they don't get enough from sunlight or other sources."
