Famine relief efforts have actually led to improvements in living standards and decreased rates of population growth in many parts of the world where they have been implemented. For example, the implementation of food aid programs in Ethiopia helped to reduce the number of people dying from hunger by 30% between 1986 and 2005, while simultaneously reducing population growth rates. Additionally, research has shown that providing food assistance can lead to increased fertility rates due to improved nutrition and health, which may contribute to population growth rather than reduction. Therefore, famine relief efforts are not only effective at alleviating suffering, but also promote long-term sustainability and poverty reduction."
