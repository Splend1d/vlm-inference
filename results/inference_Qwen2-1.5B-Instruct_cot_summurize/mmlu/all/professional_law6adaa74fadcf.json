The neighbor's predecessor had received an easement from the woman's predecessor in title to cross the woman's land for access to the public highway. This access was desired even though the neighbor and his predecessor had other access to public roads. Recently, the woman erected a large solar collector on a portion of her land subject to the easement, even though the woman has other power resources. The location was essential to acquire the maximum sunlight. However, by erecting the collector there, the woman effectively cut off the neighbor's ability to use the easement. The local zoning code permits the use of solar collectors. The neighbor immediately sued to compel the woman to remove the solar collector. Must the solar collector be removed?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor has other means of access.\nB. No, because the zoning code permits the use of solar collectors.\nC. Yes, because the easement remains valid.\nD. Yes, because the woman has other power resources.\n"

Even though the neighbor may have alternative ways to reach the highway, such as using the public road or another private road, the easement exists and must be respected until it is terminated or modified according to local laws and regulations. In this case, the woman's installation of the solar collector has effectively blocked the neighbor's access to the highway through the easement, which is why the neighbor is seeking to have the collector removed."
