Mediation is usually conducted by a person appointed with the consent of the parties, while conciliation involves a commission, which proceeds to an impartial examination of the dispute and proposes settlement terms.\n\nConciliation is a process where two or more parties involved in a dispute come together to resolve their differences through discussion and negotiation. The goal is to find a mutually acceptable solution to the conflict. If a resolution cannot be reached, conciliation can continue until one party concedes or if the issue becomes too complex for further discussion.\n\nMediation, on the other hand, is a voluntary process where a neutral third party helps the disputing parties reach a voluntary agreement. The mediator does not have any power to compel either party to accept the proposed solution. Instead, the mediator works to facilitate communication and help the parties understand each other's positions. If a resolution is reached, it is binding and must be followed.\n\nIn summary, conciliation involves a commission proceeding to an impartial examination of the dispute and proposing settlement terms, while mediation is a voluntary process where a neutral third party helps the disputing parties reach a voluntary agreement."
