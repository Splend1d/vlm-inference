In general, the elasticity of supply is greater when producers have more time to respond to price changes. This means that as prices rise, producers will be able to adjust their supply more quickly and efficiently, leading to a higher elasticity of supply. On the other hand, if producers have less time to respond to price changes, they may not be able to adjust their supply as quickly, resulting in a lower elasticity of supply. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
