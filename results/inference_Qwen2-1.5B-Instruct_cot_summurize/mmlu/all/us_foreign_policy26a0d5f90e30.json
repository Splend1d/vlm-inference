This system also emphasized the importance of a strong military, which was seen as necessary to protect against external threats and maintain order within the country.\nAnother reason for the connection between the Philadelphian System and American exceptionalism is that it was designed to reflect the values and aspirations of the colonists who founded the United States. The colonists were seeking a new way of life based on individual freedom and self-governance, and they believed that their new nation would serve as an example for other nations around the world.\nOverall, while the Philadelphian System had its limitations, it did represent a significant departure from traditional European political systems, and it helped to establish the United States as a unique and distinct entity in world history."
