Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?\n\nA. Infraspinatus\nB. Pectoralis\nC. Subscapularis\nD. Supraspinatus\n"

Supraspinatus. \n\nThe supraspinatus muscle is responsible for external rotation of the shoulder and is commonly involved in shoulder pain caused by rotator cuff injuries. This muscle can be inflamed due to repetitive movements such as chopping wood, leading to pain and difficulty in external rotation. Therefore, it is most likely to be affected in this patient's case."
