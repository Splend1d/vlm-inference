When using more than one claim in a proposition, this can create a complex structure that makes it difficult for others to understand and evaluate the argument's validity. This type of fallacy is known as a \"compound proposition.\" \n\nThe other options do not apply here because:\n\n- A complex question refers to an argument that is too complicated or confusing to be understood.\n- An appeal to ignorance involves making a false assumption about something being true simply because someone believes it to be so without any evidence or proof.\n- An extension does not refer specifically to adding more claims to a proposition but rather to expanding or altering the scope of a claim by introducing additional information or examples."
