This process occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, not in the sarcoplasm. The conversion of pyruvate to lactate does not occur through this complex, and the conversion of lactate to pyruvate does not occur naturally within cells but rather under certain conditions, such as during anaerobic respiration in muscle cells."
