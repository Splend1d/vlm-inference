Universalizability and prescriptivity\n\nThese two features are crucial for understanding how moral judgments can be both universally applicable (universalizable) and prescriptive (prescriptive). A prescriptive judgment is one that states what should or should not be done, while a universalizable judgment is one that applies to all people in all situations. For example, the statement \"Stealing is wrong\" is a prescriptive judgment because it tells us what we should not do, whereas the statement \"Stealing is wrong everywhere\" is a universalizable judgment because it applies to everyone at any time."
