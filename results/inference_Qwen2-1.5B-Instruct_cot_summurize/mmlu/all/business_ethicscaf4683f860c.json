Professional, Individual, Personal, Organizational.\n\nConflict of interest in a business-to-business context can occur between the interests of individuals within a company versus those of the organization itself. This could involve a conflict of professional ethics between an employee's personal interests and the ethical standards set by their employer, or a conflict of personal interests between a company's own objectives and its employees' personal goals.\n\nSimilarly, there can be a conflict of organizational interests when an individual's personal interests diverge from those of their employer, potentially leading to a situation where the interests of both parties are not aligned.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Professional, Individual, Personal, Organizational."
