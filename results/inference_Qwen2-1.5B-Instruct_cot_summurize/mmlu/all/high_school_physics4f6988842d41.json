                    "text": "The answer is D. Such a situation is impossible as the net force between the two particles cannot be 0.\n\nExplanation:\nIf the net force between two charged particles is zero, it means that the electric field between the particles is zero. This implies that the magnitude of the electric field due to one particle on another particle is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. However, the electric field does not change with position, which contradicts our assumption that the particles are isolated from all influences.\n\nTherefore, option A (the particles must have the same sign of charge) is correct because the net force between the particles would depend on their charges.\n\nOption B (if the distance between the particles changes, the force will no longer be 0 N) is also correct because the electric force depends on the distance between the particles, so if the distance changes, the force will change accordingly.\n\nOption C (the particles must have the same mass) is incorrect because the presence of other charges or forces could affect the masses of the particles, making them different.\n\nOption D (such a situation is impossible as the net force between the two particles cannot be 0) is correct because we have shown that the net force between the particles cannot be zero under certain conditions."
