The whole part is 4, and the fractional part is 0.95.\n\nSo, the mixed number would be:\n\\[ 4 \\frac{0.95}{1} = 4 \\frac{95}{100} \\]\n\nThis can also be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.\n\\[ 4 \\frac{95}{100} = 4 + \\frac{95}{100} = 4 + \\frac{95}{100} = 4 \\frac{95}{100} \\]\n\\[ = 4 \\frac{95}{100} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C**. 4 and 1/20."
