Micro-managing the workforce\n\nMicro-management refers to overly controlling and micromanaging employees, which can lead to decreased productivity and employee morale. This challenge is often associated with traditional management practices, rather than being specifically recognized as one of the modern challenges for managers. Modern managers typically focus on empowering their teams, fostering collaboration, and promoting a culture of continuous improvement through learning organizations."
