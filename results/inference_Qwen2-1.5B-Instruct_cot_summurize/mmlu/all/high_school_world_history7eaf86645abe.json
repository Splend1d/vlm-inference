One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists. Since then their rulers have been given the title of al-musulmani .\n\u2014The Book of Routes and Realms , by Abu Ubaydallah al-Bakri, eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer\nAccording to the passage, which statement below correctly describes the economy of Ghana?\n\nA. The king of Ghana's subjects are engaged in salt mining.\nB. The Ghanians raised cattle for meat and hides.\nC. The king of Ghana taxed salt and copper imports and exports.\nD. The Ghanians had a self-sufficient farming economy.\n"

Therefore, option A (salt mining) does not accurately describe the economy of Ghana during that period.\n\nOption B (cattle raising) seems unlikely given the description of the king's role as ruler and the mention of the king taxing salt and copper imports and exports.\n\nOption C (taxing salt and copper imports and exports) could be inferred, though without more specific details about how the taxes were collected or distributed, we cannot definitively say that this was part of the economy.\n\nHowever, option D (self-sufficient farming economy) is not supported by any evidence from the text. The passage states that the king's revenue came from taxes on salt and copper imports and exports, indicating that Ghana did indeed engage in trade and commerce.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. The Ghanians had a self-sufficient farming economy."
