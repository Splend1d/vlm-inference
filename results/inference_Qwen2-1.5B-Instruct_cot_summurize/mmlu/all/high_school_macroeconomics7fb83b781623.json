Interest rates will remain relatively constant.\n\nWhen both expansionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policies are used simultaneously, it can lead to a situation where the economy experiences an increase in demand for goods and services, which can result in higher inflation if not managed properly. This can cause interest rates to rise as central banks attempt to control inflation by raising interest rates, which can slow down economic growth and reduce spending.\n\nHowever, if these policies are implemented correctly, they can stimulate the economy by increasing aggregate demand, which can help to create jobs and boost economic activity without necessarily leading to high inflation or unemployment. The exact outcome depends on how quickly and effectively these policies are implemented and how closely they are monitored and controlled."
