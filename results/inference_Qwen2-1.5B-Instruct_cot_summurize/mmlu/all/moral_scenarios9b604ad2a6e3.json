It was an appropriate response to noise pollution and public disturbance. In scenario 2, pushing an elderly woman across a busy highway was also not a morally wrong act. The elderly person could have been injured or killed by moving her without their consent. However, both actions may be seen as inappropriate or insensitive depending on the context and circumstances."
