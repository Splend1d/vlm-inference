The oldest known rock art in the world was discovered in the Karoo region of South Africa and dates back around 140,000 years ago. This artwork includes simple etchings and paintings that depict animals, humans, and abstract designs. These findings provide valuable insights into the prehistoric cultural practices and artistic abilities of early human societies."
