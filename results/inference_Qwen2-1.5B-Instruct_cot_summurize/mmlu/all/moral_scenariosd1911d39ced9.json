Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, the main character destroyed their partner's car by intentionally damaging it with no apparent reason other than to make them feel better about themselves. This action goes against the principles of empathy, respect for property, and kindness towards others, which are considered fundamental moral values in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character plans to lose weight by exercising. While this may not be inherently wrong, it is still a choice they have made, and there can be ethical considerations involved depending on the methods used and the potential impact on others. However, burning off fat through exercise is generally considered a healthy and beneficial activity, even if it involves some degree of self-discipline or sacrifice.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that could potentially lead to harm or inconvenience to others, but only scenario 1 involves an intentional act of damage that goes against common moral standards."
