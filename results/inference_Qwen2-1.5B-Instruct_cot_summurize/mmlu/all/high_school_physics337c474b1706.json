Therefore, if the object has fallen a total distance of $h$ in the first second, it would fall an additional $\\frac{1}{2}$ times that distance in the second second due to gravity alone.\n\nSo, the additional distance covered in the second second is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2}h$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 4h**."
