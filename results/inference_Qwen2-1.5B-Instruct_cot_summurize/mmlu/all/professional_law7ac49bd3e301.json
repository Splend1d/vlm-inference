She found no disturbance but did witness the two male residents engaging in consensual sexual relations with each other. She arrested and charged them with \"deviate sexual intercourse\", a state law that prohibits two persons of the same sex from engaging in mutual sexual relations. After conviction and unsuccessful appeals in the state courts, the men appealed to the United States Supreme Court. What is the likely holding and reasoning of the Supreme Court?\n\nA. The statute violates the men's right to liberty encompassed within the constitutional guarantee of substantive due process.\nB. The federal constitution cannot be used to interfere with a state's right to regulate sexual morality.\nC. The statute is unconstitutional primarily because it infringes the men's right to freedom of expression under the First Amendment.\nD. The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.\n"

The relationship in question is not protected by the right to privacy and is subject to a state's criminal regulation.\n\nThis is because the court would find that the statute at issue is a valid exercise of state authority to regulate sexual conduct between consenting adults, even if it conflicts with certain fundamental rights such as the right to privacy or freedom of expression. The court would hold that the men's right to liberty is limited by the state's power to regulate sexual behavior, particularly when the behavior involves consensual activity between individuals who have reached the age of consent. Additionally, the court would note that the state has a legitimate interest in promoting social order and protecting public morals through laws regulating sexual conduct."
