Bb bb\n\nThis is because in genetics, when two individuals have different alleles at the same gene locus, they can produce offspring with combinations of traits based on those alleles. In this case, one parent has the allele B (brown fur) and the other has the allele b (silver fur), so their offspring will be heterozygous for the trait being studied (i.e., they will have one copy of the dominant allele B and one copy of the recessive allele b).\n\nTherefore, if we take the example of two individuals (one with Bb and one with bb), their offspring would have 50% chance of inheriting the dominant allele (B) from each parent, resulting in brown fur, and 50% chance of inheriting the recessive allele (b) from each parent, resulting in silver fur.\n\nSo the set of genotypes that represents a cross that could produce offspring with silver fur from parents that both have brown fur is:\n\nBB BB\nBb bb"
