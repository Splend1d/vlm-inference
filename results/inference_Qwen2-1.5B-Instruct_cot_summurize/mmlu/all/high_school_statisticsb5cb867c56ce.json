The value of the random variable of interest is the number of trials until the first success occurs.\n\nIn a binomial setting, each trial is considered either a success or a failure with equal probability (p). The trials are independent and there is a fixed number of trials. However, the value of the random variable of interest is not necessarily the number of trials until the first success occurs. In a binomial setting, the random variable of interest is typically the number of successes out of a fixed number of trials. For example, if you flip a coin 10 times, the random variable of interest would be the number of heads, which can only be either 0 or 1."
