                    "text": "A. is defined as the ratio of VO2 divided by VCO2.\n\nThe respiration quotient (RQ) is a measure used in sports science and physiology that represents the balance between aerobic metabolism (VO2) and anaerobic metabolism (VCO2). It is calculated as:\n\nRQ = VO2 / VCO2\n\nB. Decreases on a high carbohydrate diet: This statement is not entirely accurate. While carbohydrates can provide energy during short-term bursts of exercise, they do not directly increase the RQ. In fact, the RQ generally decreases during high-intensity exercise due to the increased production of lactic acid, which leads to a decrease in VO2 but an increase in VCO2. However, this effect may be less pronounced during longer-duration activities or at lower intensities.\n\nC. Increases with fasting: The RQ does not typically increase with fasting, although it can vary depending on individual factors such as genetics and physical condition. Generally speaking, the RQ tends to remain relatively constant throughout most of the day, fluctuating only slightly with changes in intensity or duration of activity.\n\nD. Goes beyond a value of 1.0 when exogenous carbohydrate is converted to endogenous fat: This statement is also incorrect. The RQ should never go beyond 1.0 because this would indicate that more ATP is being generated from non-carbohydrate sources than is necessary for aerobic metabolism. In reality, the RQ will always be below 1.0 unless there is an excess of carbon dioxide produced compared to oxygen consumption, which occurs during anaerobic glycolysis or fermentation."
