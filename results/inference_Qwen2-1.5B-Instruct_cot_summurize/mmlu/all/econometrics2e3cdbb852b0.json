In-sample forecasting ability is a poor test of model adequacy.\n\nThis is because in-sample forecasting refers to making predictions based on historical data, while out-of-sample forecasting refers to predicting future outcomes using new data not used during model development. In-sample forecasting does not provide information about how well the model will perform when applied to new or unseen data, which is why it is considered a poor test of model adequacy. \n\nHowever, structural forecasts and mis-specified models can both lead to inaccurate forecasts if they do not accurately capture the underlying economic relationships. Therefore, it's important to consider both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting methods when evaluating forecast accuracy."
