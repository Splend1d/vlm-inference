Providing factual accounts in testimony explaining positions taken during the performance of any services provided to the client.\n\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, accounting firms must maintain independence from their clients and be able to provide objective and unbiased opinions on financial statements. The act prohibits accountants from providing certain types of services that could impair their independence, such as providing legal advice or advocacy for a client's interests. Therefore, providing factual accounts in testimony does not fall within this prohibition and is therefore allowed for an issuer audit client."
