Extramedullary hematoma, also known as a subdural hematoma or a periventricular hematoma, occurs when blood leaks from the cerebral arteries into the subarachnoid space (between the dura mater and the meninges) or directly into the ventricular system. The MRI scan detects this by showing the presence of blood in the subarachnoid space or within the ventricles."
