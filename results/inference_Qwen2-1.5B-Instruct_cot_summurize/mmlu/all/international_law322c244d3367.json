This means that sovereign immunity applies to actions taken by a state within its own borders, regardless of whether those actions were carried out by a private individual or a public official.\n\nIn other words, the act of State doctrine holds that actions taken by a state in its own territory or on behalf of the state are immune from suit by individuals or entities outside the state's jurisdiction. The doctrine recognizes that sovereign states have inherent power to govern themselves without external interference, and that such self-governance includes the ability to determine what actions can be taken within the boundaries of the state.\n\nThis doctrine has important implications for the exercise of diplomatic immunity, which is the protection provided to diplomats and their staff when they enter into another country. Under the act of State doctrine, actions taken by a diplomat while abroad are generally considered to be immune from suit by individuals or entities seeking to hold the diplomat personally responsible for those actions.\n\nOverall, the act of State doctrine serves to protect the autonomy and sovereignty of states, while also providing some degree of legal certainty and predictability for diplomatic relations and international business activities."
