Your father's firm makes computers and exports them to China.\n\nIf you lose money from gambling or repair work, those transactions do not affect GDP because they do not involve the production or consumption of goods and services by individuals or businesses. \n\nOn the other hand, if your father's firm makes computers and exports them to China, this activity contributes to GDP because it involves the production and sale of goods by a business, which creates jobs and generates income for workers and investors.\n\nTherefore, option C has the greatest effect on GDP."
