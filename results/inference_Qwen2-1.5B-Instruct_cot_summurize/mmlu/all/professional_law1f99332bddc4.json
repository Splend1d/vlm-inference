S. for the wholesale distribution of the guitars. A warehouse located in a city handles the distribution of guitars for several state areas. The guitars and guitar strings are shipped separately to the city warehouse. The guitar strings are mingled, stacked, and stored in the warehouse along with various other guitar strings. The guitars, on the other hand, arrive completely assembled in their shipping crates and remain on the loading docks. The city imposes an ad valorem property tax on the guitars and strings. The power of the city to impose an ad valorem tax on the foreign company's guitars and/or strings would most likely be upheld under\n\nA. the commerce clause.\nB. the reserved power of the states as granted under the Tenth Amendment.\nC. the necessary and proper clause.\nD. the import and export clause.\n"

The reserved power of the states as granted under the Tenth Amendment.\n\nUnder the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the powers not delegated to the federal government nor prohibited to the states are reserved to the states or the people. In this case, the power to impose an ad valorem property tax on imported goods like guitars and guitar strings lies within the reserved powers of the states. Therefore, if the city has the authority to impose such taxes, it would be upheld under the Tenth Amendment."
