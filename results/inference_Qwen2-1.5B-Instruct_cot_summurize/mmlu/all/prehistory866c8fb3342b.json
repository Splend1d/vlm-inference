This specialization allows for the development of complex societies with advanced technologies such as irrigation systems and agricultural techniques. The need to defend oneself against predators also drives the development of military and defense strategies, which require complex social structures and organization. Additionally, the ability to store surplus food allows for the accumulation of wealth, which can be used to fund further technological advancements and the development of larger cities and settlements. Therefore, all of these factors contribute to the complexity of modern societies."
