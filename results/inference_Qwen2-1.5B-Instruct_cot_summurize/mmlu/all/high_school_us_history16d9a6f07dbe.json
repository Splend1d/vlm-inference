The United States was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing\u2026the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack\u2026.The attack yesterday\u2026has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. Very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas\u2026.As Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.\"\nPresident Franklin D.

The bombing of Nagasaki\n\nBased on the information provided, President Roosevelt's radio address of December 8, 1941, mentioned the \"severe damage to American naval and military forces,\" \"very many American lives have been lost,\" and \"American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas.\" This directly led to the bombing of Nagasaki as part of the Manhattan Project's efforts to develop atomic bombs. Therefore, the immediate consequence of these events is the bombing of Nagasaki. \n\nOptions A (trade embargoes with Japan) and B (the Battle of Normandy) were not the immediate consequences mentioned in the excerpt, while C (the internment of Japanese-Americans) was mentioned but does not relate to the direct actions or impacts described in the excerpt."
