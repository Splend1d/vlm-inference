                    "text": "To find the equation of the torus generated by revolving the circle \\(C\\) around the \\(z\\)-axis, we can use the formula for the equation of a torus:\n\n\\[ \\text{Torus Equation} = \\left( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} + \\frac{z^2}{c^2} \\right) + d \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the radii of the two major circles that make up the torus.\n- \\(d\\) is the distance between the centers of the two major circles.\n\nFor our given circle \\(C\\), with radius 1 centered at the origin, its center is at \\((0, 0, 3)\\). The other circle is centered at \\((-1, 0, 3)\\), so its radius is also 1. Therefore, \\(a = b = 1\\) and \\(c = 2\\).\n\nThe distance \\(d\\) between these two circles is calculated as follows: \n\\[ d = |(-1 - 0)| = |-1| = 1 \\]\n\nSo, the torus equation becomes:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{x^2}{1^2} + \\frac{y^2}{1^2} + \\frac{z^2}{2^2} \\right) + 1 \\]\n\\[ = \\left( \\frac{x^2}{1} + \\frac{y^2}{1} + \\frac{z^2}{4} \\right) + 1 \\]\n\\[ = \\left( x^2 + y^2 + \\frac{z^2}{4} \\right) + 1 \\]\n\\[ = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nHowever, we need to express this equation in terms of \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8\\), which is not possible directly because it does not match any of the options provided. This indicates there might have been an error in interpreting or applying the problem's requirements. \n\nIf we consider the original equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\\), which represents the circle itself, then the correct expression should be derived from considering the center of the circle \\(C\\) and the position vector of its center relative to the origin:\n\nThe position vector of the center of the circle \\(C\\) is \\(\\vec{r}_C = (0, 0, 3)\\) and the position vector of the origin is \\(\\vec{r}_O = (0, 0, 0)\\). The vector connecting the origin to the center of the circle \\(C\\) is \\(\\vec{v}_{OC} = (-0, -0, 3)\\).\n\nSince the circle is revolved around the z-axis, the resulting torus will have a radius \\(a\\) equal to the distance from the origin to the center of the circle, which is 3 units. However, without knowing the exact value of \\(a\\), we cannot determine the correct expression for the torus equation based on the information provided.\n\nGiven the nature of the question and the context, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation or application of the problem's conditions. The options provided do not match the expected result of deriving the torus equation from the circle \\(C\\), suggesting either a misinterpretation of the problem or a lack of necessary information to proceed correctly."
