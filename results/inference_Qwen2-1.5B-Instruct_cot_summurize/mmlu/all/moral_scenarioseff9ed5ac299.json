However, it is less clear-cut than Scenario 1 since there are different opinions about whether it's okay to have sweets after meals, especially if they're unhealthy choices like candy or sugary drinks. Additionally, it's important to note that this scenario involves parental responsibility and decisions made regarding what is best for their children's health and development. Therefore, while it may be considered morally questionable, it is not necessarily considered morally wrong in all cases."
