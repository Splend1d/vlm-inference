                    "text": "To calculate the percentage change in GDP per capita between 1950 and 2016 in South Korea, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the average annual GDP growth rate over this period.\n2. Adjust the growth rate to account for inflation using the purchasing power parity (PPP) adjustment.\n\nLet's assume that the nominal GDP in 2016 was $X$ and the nominal GDP in 1950 was $Y$. Then, the real GDP can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Real GDP} = \\frac{\\text{Nominal GDP}}{(\\text{Inflation Rate})^N } \\]\n\nwhere N is the number of years from 1950 to 2016.\n\nThe average annual growth rate can then be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Annual Growth Rate} = \\left( \\frac{X}{Y} \\right)^{1/N} - 1 \\]\n\nAfter calculating the average annual growth rate, we adjust it for inflation using the PPP. The formula for PPP adjustment is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Adjusted Real GDP} = (\\text{Real GDP}) \\times \\left(1 + \\text{Inflation Rate}\\right)^{-1/N} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values into the above equations gives us:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Annual Growth Rate} = \\left( \\frac{X}{Y} \\right)^{1/20} - 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Adjusted Real GDP} = X \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\left(1+0.03\\right)^{20}}\\right)^{-1/20} \\]\n\nUsing an approximate value for the inflation rate, say 3%, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average Annual Growth Rate} = \\left( \\frac{X}{Y} \\right)^{0.5} - 1 \\approx 0.017 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Adjusted Real GDP} = X \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{1.03^{20}}\\right)^{-1/20} \\approx X \\times 1.017^{-1/20} \\approx X \\times 1.017^{20/20} \\approx X \\times 1.017^{1} \\approx X \\times 1.017 \\]\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of X and Y to find the final result:\n\n\\[ \\text{Adjusted Real GDP} \\approx 1.017 \\times 2016 \\approx 2033.36 \\]\n\nFinally, to convert this adjusted GDP back to nominal terms, we multiply by the PPP-adjusted nominal GDP in 1950:\n\n\\[ \\text{GDP per capita} = \\frac{\\text{Adjusted Real GDP}}{\\text{Nominal GDP in 1950}} \\approx \\frac{2033.36}{Y} \\]\n\nThis will give us the actual GDP per capita in 1950. Since the question asks for the percentage increase, we divide the difference between the adjusted GDP and nominal GDP in 1950 by the nominal GDP in 1950 and multiply by 100%:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{2033.36 - Y}{Y} \\right) \\times 100 \\% \\]\n\nSubstituting the nominal GDP in 1950 ($Y$), we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{2033.36 - 1950}{1950} \\right) \\times 100 \\% \\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{83.36}{1950} \\right) \\times 100 \\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage Increase} = 4.34\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. by 4 fold."
