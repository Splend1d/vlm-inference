Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, wearing a mask to the store to avoid catching anything is not explicitly stated as morally wrong, but it can be seen as a reasonable precautionary measure given the current situation with COVID-19. However, if someone were to intentionally wear a mask without any valid reason or intention behind it, such as to look fashionable or make others feel uncomfortable, this could be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, asking permission to use the restroom during an exam and then using that time to call a friend and return to complete the exam is also not explicitly stated as morally wrong. However, if someone were to cheat by doing so, such as by giving answers or discussing questions with another person, this would be considered morally wrong."
