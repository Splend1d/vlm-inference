Provide the person with arguments against her beliefs and weak refutations of those arguments.\n\nInoculating someone against a persuasive message involves exposing them to counterarguments or refutations of the message's claims. This can help them critically evaluate the validity of the argument being presented and make an informed decision about whether they should accept it as true or not. Providing information that supports their current beliefs, on the other hand, may reinforce their existing biases rather than challenge them. Strong arguments against their beliefs could also be effective in changing their mind, but this approach does not necessarily inoculate them against future persuasive messages. Weak refutations of those arguments, while informative, do not directly challenge the original claim, which is what inoculation aims to achieve."
