Therefore, implementing a similar education program for all children will improve them in the future opportunities for success in school education. Which of the following best illustrates the logical loopholes summarized above?\n\nA. Children's cognitive abilities are constantly changing at the age of 3-5\nB. Establishing such education and training programs on a national basis requires a special public expenditure\nC. Many parents mistakenly believe that early formal education will occupy the time that children would have been able to better explore the world independently\nD. Investigators are unaware that they include a large group of children who have previously received another education\n"

Early formal education can provide children with valuable skills and knowledge that can be used to better understand and navigate the world around them, but it does not necessarily prevent them from exploring the world independently. Additionally, some children may benefit more than others from early formal education, so it is important to consider individual differences when designing educational programs."
