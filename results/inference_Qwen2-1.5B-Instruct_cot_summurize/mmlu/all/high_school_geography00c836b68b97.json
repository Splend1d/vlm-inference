A slash-and-burn agricultural society\n\nThis is because slash-and-burn agriculture is characterized by deforestation, which can lead to soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. This can have negative impacts on the environment and can result in population pressure as people may be forced to move elsewhere or face other challenges due to the destruction of their homes and livelihoods. \n\nThe other options do not necessarily indicate high population pressure. Industrial societies often have high levels of consumption and waste, but this does not necessarily mean they have high population pressure. Similarly, a highly mechanized agricultural sector can be efficient and productive, but it may also contribute to environmental degradation and land use changes that could have negative effects on human populations. Non-ecumene societies may also experience population pressure due to factors such as conflict or social instability."
