The circumstances suggest that the killing was done under \"reckless disregard\" for human life. This would likely result in a conviction of murder. However, there is also a possibility that the man could have been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter if the shooting occurred accidentally, without any intent to kill. The jury would need to consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident to determine whether the man's actions were intentional or accidental."
