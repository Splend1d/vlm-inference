Validity, on the other hand, refers to the extent to which a test measures what it claims to measure.\n\nTherefore, while a reliable test may still be invalid (i.e., it may fail to accurately assess what it was designed to measure), an invalid test will also lack reliability (i.e., its results will vary widely across administrations)."
