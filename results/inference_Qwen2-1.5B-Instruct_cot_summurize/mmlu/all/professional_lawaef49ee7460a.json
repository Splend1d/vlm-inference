In this case, the manufacturer is alleged to have acted with apparent authority or control over the installer, who was a franchisee of the manufacturer. As such, the manufacturer could be held responsible for the actions of the installer, even though the installer was not an employee of the manufacturer.\n\nTherefore, based on the facts provided, the homeowner may have a claim against the manufacturer for injuries sustained as a result of the defective roof."
