Let the jury in the case decide which state law of punitive damage should apply based on their analysis of the relative culpability of the parties.\n\nPunitive damages are typically awarded when there has been intentional or reckless conduct by the defendant, such as gross negligence or malice. In cases involving accidents or injuries caused by negligent or wrongful actions, it may be appropriate for the plaintiff to seek punitive damages under the laws of the state where the injury occurred. However, if the plaintiff is a resident of another state, they can still pursue punitive damages under the laws of that state.\n\nIn this scenario, the plaintiff is suing for punitive damages after being injured at a manufacturing plant in California. Since California has a prevailing party rule allowing for punitive damages, the court should apply that rule even though the plaintiff is a resident of Washington. This would ensure that the plaintiff is able to recover punitive damages for their injuries, regardless of whether they were injured in California or Washington."
