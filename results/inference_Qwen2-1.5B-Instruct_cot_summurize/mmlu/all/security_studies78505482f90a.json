The theory and knowledge that underpin each approach are fundamentally at odds with one another. Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.\nB. Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach.\nC. Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach. However, the Copenhagen School views security as a socially constructed entity that denies the validity of an objective approach.\nD. Neither Critical Security Studies nor the Copenhagen School account for the changing nature of society and its impact on the construction of security.\n"

While both Critical Security Studies and the Copenhagen School focus on understanding the concept of security, they do so from different perspectives.\n\nCritical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, meaning it emphasizes how ideas shape our perceptions of reality and the way we understand security. This perspective challenges traditional views of security as a stable, objective phenomenon, arguing that security is not just about physical safety but also includes social, political, economic, and cultural dimensions.\n\nOn the other hand, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology, which means it adheres to a positivist approach where the only valid knowledge comes from empirical observation and evidence. This approach tends to view security as an objective issue that can be studied without regard to subjective interpretations or beliefs.\n\nTherefore, while both approaches recognize the importance of security as a complex social phenomenon, their fundamental differences lie in their respective theoretical frameworks and methodologies."
