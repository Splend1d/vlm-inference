When there is an increase in output (i.e., an increase in the quantity supplied of goods and services), the economy may experience deflation or stagflation, depending on whether the decrease in price level is associated with a reduction in inflationary pressures (deflation) or an increase in inflationary pressures (stagflation). If the decrease in price level is due to a decrease in aggregate demand (option D), then it would not create the trade-off depicted by the Phillips curve. Similarly, if the decrease in price level is due to an increase in aggregate supply (option A), then it would also not create the trade-off depicted by the Phillips curve. Finally, if the decrease in price level is due to an increase in input costs that corresponds with an increase in unemployment (option B), then it would not create the trade-off depicted by the Phillips curve either."
