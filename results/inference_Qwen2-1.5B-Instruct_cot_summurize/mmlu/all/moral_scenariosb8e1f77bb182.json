The scenario also shows that the main character cared about their own well-being by prioritizing their own needs over those of the baby.\n\nScenario 2 is considered morally wrong because spending money on oneself is generally seen as selfish and wasteful, especially if one has enough money to buy necessities or gifts for others. Additionally, the amount spent on candy could be seen as excessive or unnecessary given the circumstances."
