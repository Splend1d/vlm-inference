In high predation ponds, selection has favored the evolution of a body shape that enables rapid bursts of speed. In low predation ponds, another body type is favored\u2014one that is well-suited to swim for long periods of time.\n\nA. Reproductive isolation caused geographic isolation.\nB.

This occurs when different populations of individuals become isolated from each other due to physical barriers such as mountains or rivers, and they then develop different traits in response to their new environment. In this case, the populations of mosquito fish were separated by physical barriers (ponds) and developed different body shapes based on their needs for swimming or chasing prey in different habitats."
