In the context of Darwin's observations about the living plants of South America, biogeographers would have been interested in understanding how these plants adapted to the different climates and environments found throughout the continent. This knowledge would be crucial for predicting future patterns of plant distribution and potentially explaining why some plants evolved into having leaves while others developed fruits or seeds."
