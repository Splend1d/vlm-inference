This goes against the principle of honesty and integrity, which is considered a basic moral standard in the US as of 2020. Taking someone else's property without their permission is also morally wrong, regardless of whether the property owner has given consent for its use.\n\nScenario 2 involves taking someone else's property with their permission, but still being dishonest about why you need it. However, this action is not as harmful as lying about having a headache, since the property owner would be aware of the situation and may even be grateful for the help."
