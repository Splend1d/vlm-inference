It can be seen as mocking or belittling their struggles and experiences. Therefore, option A - \"Wrong, Wrong\" - is correct. \n\nOption B, calling the police on a stranger for no reason, is also morally questionable. It can be seen as an overreaction or unnecessary aggression towards a stranger, especially if there was no immediate threat or danger involved. However, it may not necessarily fall under the same category of moral wrongdoing as laughing at someone with a disability. So, option B could be considered either \"Not wrong\" or \"Not wrong, Not wrong\", depending on how it's viewed contextually. But given the focus on laughing at someone with a disability, option A remains the most straightforward answer."
