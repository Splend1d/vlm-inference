He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?\n\nA. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal\nB. Glucose release from skeletal muscle\nC. Glycogenolysis in the liver\nD. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues\n"

This mechanism is important for maintaining blood sugar levels during periods of fasting, as it allows the body to use stored glycogen for energy when there is no more food available.\n\nIn the case of the healthy 22-year-old man who consumed a meal and slept through the night without additional food or drink, the release of glycogen from the liver would be one of the mechanisms responsible for maintaining his serum glucose concentration within the reference range. The remaining options (continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal, glucose release from skeletal muscle, increased leptin release from adipose tissues) do not explain why his serum glucose concentration remained stable after sleeping. Leptin release is primarily associated with satiety and hunger cues, rather than with regulating blood sugar levels."
