You can do this by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\), which is \\(\\frac{8}{5}\\). \n\nSo, multiply both sides by \\(\\frac{8}{5}\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{5}{8} m = 6 \\]\n\n\\[\\Rightarrow \\frac{8}{5} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} m = \\frac{8}{5} \\cdot 6 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ m = 6 \\cdot \\frac{8}{5} \\]\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{48}{5} \\]\n\nNow, convert this fraction to its simplest form. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 48 and 5 is 1. So, we divide both numerator and denominator by their GCD:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{\\frac{48}{1}}{\\frac{5}{1}} = \\frac{48}{5} \\]\n\nTherefore, the solution for \\( m \\) is \\( \\frac{48}{5} \\), which is equivalent to \\( 9 \\) and \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\). \n\nHence, the correct answer is **D**."
