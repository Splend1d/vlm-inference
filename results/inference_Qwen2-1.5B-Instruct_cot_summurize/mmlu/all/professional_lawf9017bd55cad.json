It was a late autunm afternoon, and the football team was practicing for its upcoming game against its archrival. While the team was practicing, the skies darkened as a storm approached. Minutes later, it began to rain heavily. Even though the storm intensified, the coach did not stop the practice because he had no reason to believe the storm presented a danger to his players. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck and killed the team's star player. This jurisdiction has abolished governmental immunity, and a school board may be sued as a private entity. If the player's parents bring a wrongful death action against the coach and the high school board, will they prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the player was injured while engaged in a school activity.\nB. Yes, because under the circumstances the coach would be strictly liable.\nC. No, because the coach was not negligent by continuing the practice.\nD. No, because lightning is an act of God.\n"

The coach's failure to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of his players could be considered as negligence.\n\nSecondly, the fact that the coach was a physical education teacher at the school further emphasizes his responsibility to ensure the safety of his students during athletic activities. As such, the coach's actions cannot be excused simply due to the nature of his employment.\n\nLastly, the jurisdiction has abolished governmental immunity, meaning that even public entities can be held liable in civil suits if they acted negligently or otherwise violated their duties to their employees or customers.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, the answer is:\n\nB. Yes, because under the circumstances the coach would be strictly liable."
