Blue whales are known for their powerful vocalizations, which can reach frequencies of up to 200,000 Hz and are used for communication with other whales in the ocean. They also have a unique sound called the \"whale whistle\" that they use to communicate over long distances. The loudest animal on Earth is not an elephant or a sperm whale, but rather a blue whale."
