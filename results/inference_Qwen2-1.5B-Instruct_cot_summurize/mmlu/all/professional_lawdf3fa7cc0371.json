On March 25, as the landscaper was almost finished with the work on the front yard, the homeowner said to the landscaper, \"I'm very pleased with your work to date. If you are willing, I would like you to landscape my backyard, on the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 1. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time. \" The landscaper replied, \"Agreed. Let's shake hands on it. \" They shook hands. What is the probable legal effect of the landscaper's promise on March 25 to landscape the backyard?\n\nA. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable unilateral contract.\nB. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.\nC. The landscaper's promise was voidable, since it was not in writing.\nD. The landscaper's promise was illusory, thereby creating an unenforceable contract.\n"

A unilateral contract is a contract where only one party has the right to perform their obligations and the other party has no obligation to perform their obligations. In this case, the landscaper has agreed to perform the landscaping work for the homeowner, but the homeowner has not agreed to pay for the work or provide any consideration for the landscaper's services. Therefore, the landscaper's promise is most likely considered a unilateral contract. \n\nOption A (the landscaper's promise created an enforceable unilateral contract) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A."
