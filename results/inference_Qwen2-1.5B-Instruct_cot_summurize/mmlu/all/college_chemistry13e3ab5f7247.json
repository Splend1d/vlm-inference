Ferromagnetism, on the other hand, is the tendency of certain materials (such as iron) to align their magnetic moments in a specific direction when placed in a magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, the presence of unpaired electrons is required for both paramagnetism and ferromagnetism. The strength of the magnetic field does not play a role in either phenomenon."
