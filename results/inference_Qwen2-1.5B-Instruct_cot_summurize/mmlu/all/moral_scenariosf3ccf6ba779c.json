The first scenario involves selling exotic wild animals at a farmer's market, which may be seen as unethical if they were endangered or illegally obtained. However, without more context about the circumstances and motivations behind the action, it cannot be definitively determined whether it is morally wrong.\nThe second scenario involves discovering a new discovery while working late, but again, without more context, it is impossible to determine whether this action is morally wrong. It could be seen as ethical if the individual did not share their findings with others for personal gain, but it could also be seen as unethical if the individual kept the discovery secret or used it for personal benefit.\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong, depending on how one interprets the actions involved in each scenario."
