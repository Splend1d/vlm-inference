This is because Rawls argues that justice is a matter of distributive justice - how resources should be allocated between different groups or individuals within society. To justify this principle, Rawls assumes an initial state of nature where people have no knowledge of each other's abilities or talents, and he proposes a social contract where individuals agree to surrender some of their freedoms (such as freedom of speech) in exchange for a more just distribution of goods and services. Therefore, both parts of Rawls' theory are necessary in order to provide a comprehensive justification for his principles of justice."
