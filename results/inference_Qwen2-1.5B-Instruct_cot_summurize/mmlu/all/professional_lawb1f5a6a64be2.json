The boy was mostly a benchwarmer who played only an inning or two during the game. One night, the father hid behind some shrubbery in front of the coach's home. Armed with a baseball bat, the father intended to break the coach's kneecaps when he came home from work. A man, who resembled the coach, was walking down the street. The father mistakenly believed that this man was the coach. The father jumped out of the bushes and hit the man in the kneecaps with the baseball bat. The man, who was a hemophiliac, died as a result of the injuries suffered in the beating. The father is\n\nA. guilty of attempted murder of the coach and the murder of the man.\nB. guilty of attempted murder of both the coach and the man.\nC. guilty of attempted manslaughter of the coach and murder of the man.\nD. guilty of attempted battery of the coach and murder of the man.\n"

Attempted murder is defined as \"the act of planning or preparing to commit murder.\" In this case, the father did not actually kill anyone; instead, he accidentally killed the man who resembled the coach by hitting him with a baseball bat.\n\nTherefore, the father cannot be guilty of attempted murder of the man, but rather of attempted battery, which involves intentionally causing harm to another person without the intent to kill.\n\nAdditionally, the father cannot be guilty of attempted murder of the coach because there was no intention to kill the coach at all. The father's actions were accidental and caused the death of the man who resembled the coach, not the coach himself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. guilty of attempted battery of the coach and murder of the man."
