This is because the \"inverted U\" hypothesis refers to an observed pattern where there is initially a decrease in inequality with increasing development but then it starts to increase again after a certain point, which is typically associated with advanced stages of economic development. Empirical studies have shown that this phenomenon does not hold true across all contexts and may vary depending on factors such as governance, social norms, and cultural values. Therefore, the hypothesis is generally not supported by empirical evidence."
