The molecules of a saturated fatty acid are packed so close together that they form a solid at room temperature.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the molecules of a saturated fatty acid are not solid at room temperature; instead, they are liquid at room temperature. Saturated fatty acids have all their double bonds replaced by single bonds, which means they cannot form hydrogen bonds to form a solid. However, they can form intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and van der Waals forces to form a liquid or gas at normal atmospheric pressure."
