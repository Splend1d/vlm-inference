This is where anaerobic glycolysis comes into play. Glycolysis occurs in the mitochondria of muscle cells and produces lactic acid as a byproduct. When oxygen levels fall or if there is a lack of oxygen to initiate glycolysis, muscle cells switch to anaerobic glycolysis to generate ATP. \n\nLactate production increases during anaerobic glycolysis because it requires a high concentration of ADP and Pi (Pi is the product of glycolysis) to drive the reaction forward. As the body tries to generate more ATP, it uses up more ADP and Pi, leading to increased lactate production.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D. glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise."
