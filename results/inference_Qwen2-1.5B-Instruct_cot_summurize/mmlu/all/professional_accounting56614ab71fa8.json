The complexity of the entity's electronic order processing system.\n\nWhile the other options mentioned (the ineffectiveness of the entity's audit committee, collusion of employees, and lack of resources) can all be considered limitations to an entity's internal control, they do not directly relate to the specific technical aspects of the entity's internal control systems or processes. \n\nAn electronic order processing system is complex due to its reliance on technology that may introduce errors or vulnerabilities. However, this does not necessarily make it inherently susceptible to fraud or manipulation by employees, nor does it prevent the need for effective monitoring and oversight mechanisms within the entity. \n\nOn the other hand, if the entity has an ineffective audit committee or employees colluding with each other to circumvent internal controls, these factors could lead to significant weaknesses in the entity's internal control system. Similarly, if there are insufficient resources to effectively monitor and maintain the effectiveness of internal controls, this too could create an inherent risk. These factors are more directly related to the operational and management aspects of an entity's internal control system rather than the technical intricacies of the electronic order processing system itself."
