Development of a two-party system\n\nIn an electoral system with single-member districts, each district elects one representative to represent their interests in Congress. This results in a two-party system where both major political parties have equal representation in Congress. The winner of an election typically wins all seats in a particular district and does not face any competition from other candidates. This can lead to a concentration of power in the hands of the winning party, as they control the entire legislature. However, it also allows for a balance of power between the presidency and Congress, as the president may need to compromise with the majority party in order to achieve legislative goals."
