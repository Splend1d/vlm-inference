Mixing a solution of a weak acid with a strong base.\n\nWhen a weak acid and a strong base are mixed, the resulting mixture will not form a buffer solution because the pH of the mixture will be affected by the acid-base reaction between the two components. The weak acid will react with the strong base to form water and an acid, which can then react with the other component in the mixture to further alter the pH. This means that the resulting mixture will not be able to maintain a constant pH level over time.\n\nOn the other hand, when a weak acid and its conjugate base (a strong base) are mixed, they will react to form water and carbon dioxide gas. This will result in a stable buffer solution that can maintain a consistent pH level over time."
