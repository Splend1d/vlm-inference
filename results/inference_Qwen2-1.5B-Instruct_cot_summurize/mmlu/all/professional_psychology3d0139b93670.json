It involves a critical period when an animal is most receptive to certain stimuli, such as sound or light, and can form strong emotional bonds with those stimuli. During this time, the animal may be \"imprinted\" on the sound or light source, leading to long-term behavioral responses associated with that stimulus.\n\nSo, while heredity plays a role in determining the basic structure of a behavior (as proposed by Chat Heredity), it is not the sole factor. Environmental factors play a crucial role in shaping the specificity of the behavior through the process of imprinting."
