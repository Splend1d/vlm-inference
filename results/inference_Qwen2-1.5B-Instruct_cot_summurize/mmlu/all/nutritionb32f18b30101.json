Vitamin B12 is essential for the production of red blood cells and can be obtained from dairy products, eggs, meat, fish, poultry, and some plant-based sources like fortified cereals and nutritional yeast. Without adequate intake, symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and numbness in the hands and feet can occur. However, it's important to note that this risk is relatively low among vegan populations compared to non-vegan populations."
