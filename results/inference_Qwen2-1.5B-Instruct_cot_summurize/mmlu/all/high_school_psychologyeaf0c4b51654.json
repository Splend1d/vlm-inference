It is important for people to voice dissent.\n\nJanis's research on groupthink found that when individuals in a group feel strongly enough about an issue, they are more likely to speak out and express their opinions, even if they disagree with the majority of the group. This can lead to more creative solutions and greater innovation within the group. Therefore, it is important for people to be willing to challenge the status quo and express their dissenting opinions in order to promote positive outcomes."
