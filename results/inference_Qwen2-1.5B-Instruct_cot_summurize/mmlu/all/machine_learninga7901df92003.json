However, this does not necessarily mean that these methods can be used directly for classification purposes without additional steps such as thresholding or feature selection. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nAs for the second statement, while there may be some overlap in terms of the underlying assumptions and likelihood functions involved in both logistic regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes, the fact that they share the same formality does not imply a direct correspondence between their parameter spaces. This is because logistic regression assumes linear separability between classes, whereas Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes independence among features, which is a different type of assumption. Therefore, option D is also correct."
