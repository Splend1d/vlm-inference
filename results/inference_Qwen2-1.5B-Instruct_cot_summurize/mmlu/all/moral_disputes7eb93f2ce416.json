The inability to explain why it would be wrong to force Canada to join NAFTA. This implies that there may be some negative consequences or drawbacks associated with forcing a country to participate in an agreement, such as economic losses or political instability.\n2. The inability to explain why it would be wrong for the United States to forcefully annex Canada. This implies that there may be some negative consequences or drawbacks associated with forcibly taking over another country's territory, such as cultural conflicts or political instability.\n\nTherefore, both A and B can be considered unpalatable implications that follow from denying a country's right to freedom of association."
