Although the owner used due care in keeping the animal in a securely fenced area, he knew of one prior incident where the animal got loose and bit someone. Is the dog's owner liable for the injuries to the mailman?\n\nA. No, he is not liable because he used due care and was not negligent under the circumstances.\nB. No, he is not liable because the man was on someone else's property at the time of the incident.\nC. Yes, he is liable because a dog owner is always liable for any injuries caused to a third person.\nD. Yes, he is liable because an owner who knows of the dog's dangerous propensities is strictly liable for ensuing damages.\n"

Yes, he is liable because an owner who knows of the dog's dangerous propensities is strictly liable for ensuing damages.\n\nStrict liability is a legal doctrine that holds a person or entity responsible for harm caused by their actions, even if they did not intend it or could not have foreseen the consequences. In this case, the owner of the dog knew about the previous incident involving the dog getting loose and biting someone, but they failed to take reasonable steps to prevent such incidents from happening again. Therefore, the owner can be held strictly liable for the injuries sustained by the mailman."
