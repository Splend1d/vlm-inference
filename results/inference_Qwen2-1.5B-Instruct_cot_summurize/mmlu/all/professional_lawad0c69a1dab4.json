He arrested her for driving while under suspension and secured her in the rear seat of the squad car. He then searched the car where he found several bags of cocaine inside a coat that was setting on the rear seat; he arrested her for possession and possession with intent to deliver cocaine. Prior to trial, the driver moved for suppression of the cocaine. Is it likely that the trial court will grant the suppression motion?\n\nA. Yes, it must be suppressed because this was an unreasonable, warrantless search.\nB. No, the motion will be denied because the search was permissible as incident to a proper arrest.\nC. No, the motion will be denied because the initial traffic stop was legal and everything that flowed therefrom was a reasonable step to search for crime.\nD. Yes, the motion will be granted because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n"

The trial court will most likely grant the suppression motion because a search of a vehicle requires a search warrant unless there are exceptional exigent circumstances.\n\nIn this case, the police officer had probable cause to believe that the driver was committing a crime (driving while under suspension) based on the evidence they had found during their initial traffic stop. However, they did not have a warrant to search the car, which is required by law if they want to seize evidence or make an arrest. Therefore, the search of the car without a warrant was illegal, and the evidence obtained from that search cannot be used in court.\n\nTherefore, the trial court is likely to grant the suppression motion to exclude any evidence obtained through the illegal search of the car."
