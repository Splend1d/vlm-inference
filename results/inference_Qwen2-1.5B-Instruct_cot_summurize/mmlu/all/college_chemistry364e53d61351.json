                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between the rotational correlation time (\u03c4c) and the molecular weight (Mr). The rotational correlation time can be expressed as:\n\n\u03c4c = 4\u03c0\u03b7r3/3kB\n\nwhere:\n- \u03c4c is the rotational correlation time,\n- \u03b7 is the viscosity of the liquid,\n- kB is the Boltzmann constant (approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K),\n- r is the radius of the spherical object,\n- Mr is the molecular weight of the small molecule or protein.\n\nGiven that the rotational correlation time for a small molecule with Mr = 100 in water at 298 K is \u03c4c = 50 ps, we want to find the rotational correlation time for a small protein with Mr = 8400.\n\nFirst, let's convert Mr to the molecular volume (V) using the relation V = Mr * Vm, where Vm is the molar volume of the gas. Since water is an ideal gas, its molar volume is approximately 22.4 L/mol.\n\nSo, the molecular volume (V) for the small protein is:\n\nV = Mr * Vm = 8400 * 22.4 = 187688 cm^3/mol\n\nNow, substituting these values into the rotational correlation time equation gives us:\n\n\u03c4c = 4\u03c0\u03b7r3/3kB = 4\u03c0(1.38x10^-23)(187688cm^3/mol)^3/(3*1.38x10^-23J/K)\n\nSolving this equation will give us the rotational correlation time for the small protein.\n\nAfter solving the equation, we get \u03c4c \u2248 420 ps.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 420 ps."
