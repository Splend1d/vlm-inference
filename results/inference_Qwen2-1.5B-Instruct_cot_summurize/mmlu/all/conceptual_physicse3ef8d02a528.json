This means that no matter how much energy is added to one side of a system, it will not necessarily result in equal amounts being added to the other side until some form of external work is done on the system.\n\nTherefore, option B (cold to hot ever) is incorrect because heat can indeed flow from a colder body to a hotter one under certain conditions, such as when there is a temperature difference between the two bodies and the system is isolated from the environment.\n\nOption C (hot to cold without external energy) is also incorrect because even if the system is isolated from the environment, heat transfer can still occur spontaneously through processes like conduction, convection, and radiation.\n\nOption D (cold to hot without external energy) is correct because heat transfer requires some form of external energy input, either directly or indirectly, for it to occur spontaneously."
