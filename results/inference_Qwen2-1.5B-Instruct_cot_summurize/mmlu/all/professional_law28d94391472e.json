Late one evening, the defendant was walking past the convenience store when he decided to break into the store to steal beer and cigarettes. The defendant threw a brick through the window of the convenience store and quickly went inside. Awakened by the alarm, the victim went down the stairs and into the convenience store. Seeing the victim, the defendant turned and began to run. Seeing the defendant running away with a case of beer and a carton of cigarettes, the victim ran after the defendant but tripped and fell, breaking his neck, which resulted in his immediate death. If the defendant is subsequently charged with the victim's death, he will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty of felony murder.\nB. guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\nC. guilty of voluntary manslaughter.\nD. not guilty, because it was unforeseeable that a death would occur under the circumstances.\n"

In this case, the defendant broke into the convenience store to steal alcohol, and when the victim discovered him, the defendant fled the scene. However, the victim chased the defendant down the stairs and tripped and fell, breaking his neck. This accidental death was not intended or caused by the defendant, and therefore the defendant cannot be held liable for the victim's death. Therefore, the defendant should be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter."
