The heterophile agglutination test is commonly used in immunology to detect antibodies against specific antigens, including viruses. However, it is not typically used to diagnose allergic reactions or to determine if someone has had a previous exposure to the antigen being tested.\n\nIn this case, the patient's symptoms (shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema) are consistent with an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The best option among the given choices would be:\n\nD. \u03b2-Adrenergic blocking agent therapy\n\nThis type of medication can help reduce the severity of an allergic reaction by blocking the action of the immune system on certain cells, such as mast cells, which release chemicals that cause the symptoms described in the question. Other options like the inquiry about an egg allergy, skin test with histamine reagent, and \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent therapy may also be useful in diagnosing allergies, but they do not directly address the immediate response to an allergic reaction from a vaccine."
