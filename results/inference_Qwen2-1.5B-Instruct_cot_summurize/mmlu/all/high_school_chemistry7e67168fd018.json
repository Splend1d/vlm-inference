CH3CH2CHO\n\nThis is because acetic acid (CH3CH2COOH) is a carboxylic acid, which can undergo dehydration reactions and form water by losing one hydroxyl group. This results in the formation of an amide group, CH3CONH2, which can hydrogen bond with another carboxylic acid, forming a salt.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. CH3CH2CHO."
