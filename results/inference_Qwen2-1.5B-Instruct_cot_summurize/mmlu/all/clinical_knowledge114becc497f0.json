It is regulated by three factors: preload (the amount of fluid in the body that must be expelled before the heart can receive a new supply), contractility (how much force the heart can generate with each contraction), and afterload (the resistance to blood flow due to the presence of vessels). These factors work together to maintain a constant stroke volume throughout the cardiac cycle."
