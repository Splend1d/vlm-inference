The man has \u00d2Beware of Dogs\u00d3 signs clearly posted around a fenced-in yard where he keeps the dogs. The man\u00d5s next-door neighbor frequently walks past the man\u00d5s house and knows about the dogs\u00d5 ferocity. One summer day, the neighbor entered the man\u00d5s fenced-in yard to retrieve a snow shovel that the man had borrowed during the past winter. The neighbor was attacked by one of the dogs and was severely injured. In a suit against the man, is the neighbor likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the neighbor knew that the man had dan-gerous dogs in the yard.\nB. No, because the neighbor was trespassing when he entered the man\u00d5s property.\nC. Yes, because the neighbor was an invitee for the pur-pose of retrieving the shovel.\nD. Yes, because the man was engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity.\n"

Yes, because the neighbor was an invitee for the purpose of retrieving the shovel.\n\nAn invitee is someone who enters onto another's premises with the express or implied invitation of the owner or occupier. In this case, the neighbor was invited into the man's yard by the man himself, as indicated by the \"Beware of Dogs\" signs posted around the yard. Therefore, the neighbor was an invitee for the purpose of retrieving the shovel, and the man cannot be held liable for any injuries sustained by the neighbor due to the dogs' behavior."
