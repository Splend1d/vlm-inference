His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Physical examination shows enlarged, 3-cm, erythematous axillary lymph nodes bilaterally. On palpation, the nodes are tender, fluctuant, and movable. Examination of a fine-needle aspirate from one of the nodes shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Cultures of the aspirate grow yellow, \u03b2hemolytic colonies that are catalase and coagulase positive. A polymerase chain reaction test shows mecA-positive organisms. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?\n\nA. Ciprofloxacin\nB. Penicillin G\nC. Rifampin\nD. Vancomycin\n"

Vancomycin, as it is effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is the causative organism in this case. Vancomycin is an antibiotic that inhibits cell wall synthesis, making it particularly effective against MRSA. It is important to note that vancomycin should only be used under the supervision of a healthcare professional, as its use can have serious side effects if not administered correctly."
