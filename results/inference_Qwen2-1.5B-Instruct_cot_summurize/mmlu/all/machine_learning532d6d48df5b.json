False, False\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect because both BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) use precision and recall in their evaluation metrics. Precision measures the proportion of relevant examples that are retrieved correctly, while recall measures the proportion of relevant examples that are retrieved at all.\n\nStatement 2 is correct because hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been widely used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. HMMs can be used to model the sequential dependencies between words or phrases in a sentence, which is essential for understanding meaning and context in text data."
