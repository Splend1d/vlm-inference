They should hold the Nationally Certified School Psychologist credential or the state school psychologist credential. \n\nAccording to the position statement \"Supervision in School Psychology\" published by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP), school psychologists who supervise in a school district must have either the Nationally Certified School Psychologist credential or the state school psychologist credential. This means that they must meet the requirements for certification in their respective states before they can supervise other school psychologists.\n\nIt is important to note that the NASP position statement does not specify how long it takes to become certified, so option C is incorrect. Additionally, option A is not entirely accurate, as it suggests that school psychologists who are not fully certified or licensed may also receive supervision from their supervisor. However, the NASP position statement specifically excludes this possibility, stating that supervisors should only provide supervision to those who are fully certified or licensed. Finally, option B is incorrect because providing both professional and administrative supervision is typically reserved for experienced school psychologists with advanced degrees or specialized training in supervision."
