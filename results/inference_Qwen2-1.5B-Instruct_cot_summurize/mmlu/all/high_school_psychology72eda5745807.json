STM sensory registries.\n\nSTM (Short-Term Memory) refers to the part of the brain responsible for short-term memory, which includes sensory information that is stored in the form of neural connections or \"memories.\" Iconic memory refers to the ability to remember images or visual memories. Therefore, iconic memory is related to STM sensory registries. The other options do not accurately describe STM sensory registries."
