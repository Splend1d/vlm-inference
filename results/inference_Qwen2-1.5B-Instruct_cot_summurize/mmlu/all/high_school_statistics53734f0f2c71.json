The formula to find the standard deviation of the mean (\u03c3x\u0305) when \u03c3 exists is:\n\n\u03c3x\u0305 = \u221a(\u03a3(x - x\u0305)^2 / n)\n\nwhere \u03a3 is the sum of the deviations from the mean, n is the number of items.\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n\u03c3x\u0305 = \u221a((100 * ($155 - 155)^2 + 100 * (-$32)^2) / 100)\n\u03c3x\u0305 = \u221a(0 + 100 * $964)\n\u03c3x\u0305 = \u221a(100 * $964)\n\u03c3x\u0305 \u2248 320\n\nNow, let's use the confidence interval formula to estimate the range of possible means at different levels of confidence:\n\nCI = z * \u03c3x\u0305 \u00b1 t * \u03c3x\u0305 / \u221an\n\nwhere CI is the confidence interval, z is the z-score corresponding to the desired level of confidence (usually 95% for a two-tailed test), \u03c3x\u0305 is the standard deviation of the mean, and n is the sample size.\n\nLet's calculate the z-scores for each option:\n\nA. Average donation: $155\n   z = 155 / 320 \u2248 0.48\n\nThis corresponds to a 95% confidence interval of (155 - 0.48 * 320, 155 + 0.48 * 320). Since we want to include both ends of the interval, we can express it as [155 - 0.48 * 320, 155 + 0.48 * 320]. This gives us an approximate range of [117.28, 192.72].\n\nB. 50% of all donations this November are more than $155:\n   This statement does not make sense since we calculated the mean and standard deviation specifically for this November and do not consider the entire population.\n\nC. We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219:\n   Using our calculated z-score for 95%, we would be 95% confident that the mean lies within the interval (155 - 0.48 * 320, 155 + 0.48 * 320), which includes the lower bound of $91 and the upper bound of $219.\n\nD. We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161:\n   Using our calculated z-score for 95%, we would be 95% confident that the mean lies within the interval (155 - 0.48 * 320, 155 + 0.48 * 320), which includes the lower bound of $149 and the upper bound of $161.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is C. We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219."
