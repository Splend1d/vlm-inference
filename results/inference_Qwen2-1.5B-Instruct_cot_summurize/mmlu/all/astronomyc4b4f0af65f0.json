They reveal that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years.\n\nMeteorites are rocks that have fallen to Earth from space, typically originating from asteroids or comets. When these meteorites land on Earth, they can be analyzed for clues about the origins of our planet. One way this can be done is by examining their composition, which can tell us about the chemical makeup of the materials that formed them.\n\nSome meteorites contain small amounts of iron-oxide (hematite), which suggests that they were originally part of a larger rock that fell to Earth. Other meteorites contain carbonates, which are minerals that form when water dissolves minerals in the surrounding environment. These minerals could have come from the surface of a comet or asteroid, indicating that the meteorite originated from space.\n\nAdditionally, meteorites often contain traces of other celestial bodies, such as pebbles or dust, which can provide insights into the history of the solar system. For example, some meteorites have been found to contain evidence of water vapor or other molecules that could indicate the presence of life in the early solar system.\n\nOverall, studying meteorites provides important information about the formation and evolution of the solar system, including its age and composition."
