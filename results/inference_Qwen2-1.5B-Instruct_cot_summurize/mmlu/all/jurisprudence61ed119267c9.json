                    "text": "The proposition that punishment should fit the crime (option D) is the most inconsistent with a consequentialist justification of punishment. In a consequentialist framework, the primary goal of punishment is not necessarily to protect security, prevent or reduce crime, or protect personal safety, but rather to achieve the overall well-being and social order of society. A fitting punishment would be one that is proportional to the severity of the offense and serves as a deterrent against similar offenses in the future. Therefore, it aligns more closely with the goals of justice and public safety than punishing someone based on their behavior's \"fit\" for an offense. Option C, while also being concerned with protecting individuals, does not directly conflict with the idea of fitting punishments.\n\nOption B, regarding the cost-effectiveness of punishment, is also consistent with a consequentialist perspective because it suggests that punishment is an efficient means of preventing crime and maintaining societal order, although this could be achieved through other methods that may not have the same direct impact on security. However, option A, focusing on protection of security, is not inherently part of a consequentialist justification since the focus lies elsewhere in terms of what punishment aims to achieve."
