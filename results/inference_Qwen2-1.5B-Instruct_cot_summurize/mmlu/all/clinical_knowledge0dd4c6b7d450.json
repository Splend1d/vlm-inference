This basic solution helps to neutralize the acidic environment caused by lactic acid production during exercise, which can lead to fatigue and decreased performance. By elevating the pH of the extracellular fluid, sodium bicarbonate allows for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle cells, helping to improve endurance and performance in activities that require sustained energy output."
