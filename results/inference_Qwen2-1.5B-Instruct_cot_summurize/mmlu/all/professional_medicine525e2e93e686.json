Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%.

                    "text": "The statistical power of a study refers to the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. In other words, it's the ability of the study to detect an effect that exists in the population.\n\nIn this case, the investigators want to test whether the new drug is more effective than the standard drug. They have decided to make a mistake in one direction: either incorrectly assuming that the new drug is more effective or mistakenly thinking that both drugs are equally effective.\n\nTo calculate the statistical power, we need to know the effect size of the difference between the two drugs. Without this information, we cannot accurately determine the statistical power.\n\nAssuming the effect size is small (e.g., a difference of 2 mm Hg), we can use a common formula for calculating power:\n\nPower = (1 - \u03b1) / [1 - (\u03b2 + \u03b1)]\n\nwhere:\n- \u03b1 = Type I error rate (probability of making a type I error)\n- \u03b2 = Power\n\nSince the investigators have set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy at 1%, and the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same at 10%, we can plug these values into our formula:\n\n\u03b1 = 0.01\n\u03b2 = 0.10\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives us:\n\nPower = (1 - 0.10) / [1 - (0.10 + 0.01)]\nPower = 0.9 / [1 - 0.11]\nPower = 0.9 / 0.89\nPower \u2248 1.01\n\nTherefore, the statistical power of this study is approximately 101% or 10%.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 90%."
