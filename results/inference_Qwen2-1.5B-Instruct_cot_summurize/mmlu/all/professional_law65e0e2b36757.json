The shopper brought suit against the owner of the entire building. The owner claimed that since he leased the cafeteria, he no longer retained any control over the connecting hallway. If the shopper offers into evidence the fact that two days after the accident, the owner had the hallway carpet re-laid, the court should rule that the evidence is\n\nA. admissible, because it is relevant to the issue of the owner's knowledge of the unsafe condition.\nB. admissible, because it shows that the owner retained ownership and control.\nC. inadmissible, because it shows subsequent repair, which is against public policy.\nD. inadmissible, because the evidence is irrelevant to the accident.\n"

This action suggests that the owner did not know about the unsafe condition until after the accident had already happened. Therefore, the evidence of the subsequent repair is relevant to whether or not the owner knew about the unsafe condition at the time of the accident, and thus can be used as evidence to establish his liability for the shopper's injuries."
