Photosynthesis is a process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy, which they can use to grow and reproduce. This process has been essential for the survival of life on Earth for billions of years, and it provides the foundation for the food chain that sustains nearly every other organism on the planet. While other organisms may also have similar adaptations to sunlight, including those that live in the ocean or are adapted to high temperatures, the closest living relatives to the common ancestor of all life are likely to be those that rely on photosynthesis for energy production."
