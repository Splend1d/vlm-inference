She has had one previous pregnancy resulting in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. Today, her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 28-week gestation. Fetal ultrasonography shows a male fetus with no abnormalities. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. The physician recommends administration of Rho\n\nA. immune globulin to the patient.

This treatment is most likely to prevent formation of antibodies to RhD.\n\nExplanation:\nRho immunoglobulin is used during the third trimester of pregnancy or after delivery as a prophylactic measure against Rh disease. Rh disease occurs when an individual receives a blood transfusion or blood products containing Rh-positive red blood cells from a person who is Rh-negative (Rh-null). This can cause severe and sometimes fatal\u6eb6\u8840\u6027\u8d2b\u8840.\n\nIn the case of the pregnant woman in question, she has already had a previous pregnancy result in a spontaneous abortion due to Rh incompatibility. Therefore, administering Rho immunoglobulin would be appropriate to prevent any potential complications that could arise from future Rh-positive blood transfusions or exposure to Rh-positive blood products."
