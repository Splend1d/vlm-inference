Eating these foods might increase your blood glucose level temporarily, but this effect should wear off within a few hours.\n\nKetone bodies are a waste product of fat metabolism that can accumulate in the blood as a result of excessive carbohydrate intake. Consuming a meal rich in carbohydrates can lead to increased ketone production due to the increased demand for energy sources other than fats.\n\nNon-esterified (free) fatty acids are also a metabolic byproduct of fat breakdown, and their concentration could potentially increase with a high-carbohydrate meal. However, since fatty acids are typically stored as triglycerides, they're less likely to be released into the bloodstream unless there's already a surplus of triglycerides.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most likely answer is **C. Ketone bodies**, given that they are produced in response to elevated glucose levels and can potentially increase in concentration after eating foods rich in carbohydrates."
