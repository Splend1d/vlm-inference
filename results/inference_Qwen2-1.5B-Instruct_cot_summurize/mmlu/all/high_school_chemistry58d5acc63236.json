However, it can also be named as 1,4-dichlorobenzene. The naming convention for organic compounds involves using the prefix para- (for aliphatic hydrocarbons) or meta- (for aromatic hydrocarbons) before the name of the parent compound, followed by the substituents in alphabetical order. In this case, we would use para- because the substituent is on the para-position."
