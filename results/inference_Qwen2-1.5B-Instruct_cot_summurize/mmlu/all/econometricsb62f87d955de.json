Taking logarithms of each of the variables.\n\nUsing principal components analysis (PCA) can help to reduce multicollinearity by transforming the original variables into a smaller number of new variables that are uncorrelated with each other, and thus may be less prone to multicollinearity. \n\nDropping one of the collinear variables can also help to reduce multicollinearity if that variable has high correlation with another variable in the dataset. However, it's not always possible or practical to drop a variable, especially if it is an important predictor in the model.\n\nTaking logarithms of each of the variables can also potentially reduce multicollinearity by changing the scale of the variables so that they are more independent from each other. This is because the log transformation changes the distribution of the variables such that their correlations become weaker. However, this method may not work well in all cases and may require careful consideration and validation. \n\nIn summary, taking logarithms of each of the variables is not a plausible remedy for near multicollinearity as it does not directly address the issue of the variables being highly correlated with each other."
