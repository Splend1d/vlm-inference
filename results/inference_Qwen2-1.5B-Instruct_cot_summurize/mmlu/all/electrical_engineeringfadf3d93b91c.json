Inaccuracy: The output of the system cannot be precisely controlled, as it only responds to input changes and does not account for any errors or disturbances in the system's environment.\n\n2. Unreliability: Open-loop systems have no feedback mechanism, which means that they do not adjust their behavior based on feedback from the environment. This can result in instability and unpredictability, making them less reliable than closed-loop systems."
