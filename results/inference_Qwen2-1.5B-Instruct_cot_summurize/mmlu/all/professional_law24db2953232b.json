Yes, if the dominant intent of Congress was that the tax would produce revenue.\nC. No, if the tax does not result in a significant collection of revenue.\nD.

No, because the tax is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership.\n\nThe constitutionality of the handgun tax depends on whether it serves an important government interest and whether it is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. In this case, the government's interest in regulating the sale of handguns is clear: preventing gun violence. The tax is designed to discourage private individuals from buying handguns, which would reduce the number of guns available for illegal use by criminals. However, the tax is also meant to serve as a deterrent to gun owners who might be tempted to purchase more than one handgun. \n\nBecause the tax is specifically aimed at penalizing gun ownership rather than banning it altogether, it may withstand a constitutional challenge. However, the tax must still be narrowly tailored to serve its purpose. If the tax were too broad, such as applying to all handgun sales regardless of reason, it would likely be struck down as unconstitutional under strict scrutiny. Therefore, the correct answer is D. No, because the tax is clearly intended as a penalty on handgun ownership."
