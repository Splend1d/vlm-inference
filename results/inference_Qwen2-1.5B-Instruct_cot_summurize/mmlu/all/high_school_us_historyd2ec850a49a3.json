It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich one of the following statements about the Spanish conquest of the Americas is most accurate?\n\nA. African slavery was a direct result of Spanish settlements in Florida.\nB. Early native civilizations in Mexico introduced Spanish explorers to cattle ranching and wheat cultivation.\nC. Christopher Columbus was not the first European to have explored North America.\nD. Due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people.\n"

Based on the information given, it is clear that the Spanish conquest of the Americas did not involve any of these events or actions. Instead, the passage describes how the Spanish conquest led to the establishment of colonies in the Americas and the introduction of new crops like tobacco and sugar, as well as the enslavement of indigenous peoples through forced labor. The passage also mentions the work of Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a Spanish bishop who advocated for the rights of indigenous peoples based on his belief in a universal human rights concept rooted in the idea of a single human race. Therefore, the correct statement is D, which says that due to racial prejudice, Spanish explorers shunned intermarriage with native people."
