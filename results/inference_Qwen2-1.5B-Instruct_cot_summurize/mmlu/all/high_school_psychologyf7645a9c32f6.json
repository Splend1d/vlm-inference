Depressive\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Prozac and Paxil are commonly prescribed for depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other mood disorders that involve imbalances in neurotransmitters, including serotonin.\n\nManic disorders typically involve an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters, but not necessarily serotonin. Similarly, conversion disorders may involve an imbalance of neurotransmitters but are often associated with physical symptoms rather than mood disturbances.\n\nDissociative identity is a complex condition characterized by multiple identities, and it is not directly related to neurotransmitter abnormalities like those seen in antidepressant use."
