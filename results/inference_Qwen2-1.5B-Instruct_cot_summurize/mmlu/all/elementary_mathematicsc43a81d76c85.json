To find out how many boxes he needs for these remaining muffins, we divide the total number of muffins by the capacity of each box. So, the calculation would be: (232 - 190) / 6 = 42. This means that the baker will need 42 boxes to store all the remaining muffins.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation to use is:\n\n(232 - 190)x6=b\n\nThis represents the calculation of the number of boxes needed based on the remaining muffins after sending some to the hotel."
