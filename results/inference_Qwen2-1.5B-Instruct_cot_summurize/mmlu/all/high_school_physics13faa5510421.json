The normal force of the hill on the sphere\n\nThe reason for this is that when an object rolls down a hill, it experiences a net force in the direction of motion (which is due to gravity). This net force produces a rotational acceleration about its center of mass. However, since the sphere is rolling without slipping, the tangential component of the net force must be balanced by the normal force exerted by the surface it's rolling on. Therefore, the normal force provides the necessary torque to cause the rotation.\n\nStatic friction, kinetic friction, and gravity do not provide any torque because they act perpendicular to the plane of rotation and do not contribute to the angular acceleration of the sphere."
