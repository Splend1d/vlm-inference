As he drove up to the drive- through line, the manager of the hamburger stand informed him through the intercom system that the restaurant was closing and no further orders would be accepted. She told the man that the last car to be served was the one directly in front of him. The man became angry and yelled into the intercom machine, \"Listen, babe, I am hungry. I want two cheeseburgers, a large order of fries, and a Coke. \" The manager retorted, \"I'm terribly sorry, but we cannot accept your order. \"Shortly thereafter, the manager handed the food order to the passengers in the car immediately in front of the man's. When the man saw the manager serving that car, he became very angry, drove his automobile up to the service window and shouted at the manager, \"You can't do this to me. \" When the manager laughed, the man suddenly reached into the car's glove compartment and pulled out a gun. He aimed at the manager and fired the weapon, intending to hit her. The bullet missed the manager but hit a customer, wounding him in the head. In an action by the customer against the man for battery, the customer will be\n\nA. successful, because the man intended to shoot the manager.\nB. successful, because there was a \"substantial certainty\" that the customer would be hit by the bullet.\nC. unsuccessful, because the man could not foresee that the bullet would hit anyone other than the manager.\nD. unsuccessful, because the man did not intend to shoot the customer.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. successful, because there was a \"substantial certainty\" that the customer would be hit by the bullet.\n\nIn a legal context, battery refers to the intentional act of touching or causing harm to another person without their consent. In this case, the man intended to shoot the manager with a firearm, which constitutes battery as it involves physical contact without permission.\n\nHowever, the question asks about whether the customer will be successful in a lawsuit against the man for battery based on the fact that the bullet missed the manager but hit a customer in the head. This scenario raises questions about foreseeability and the intention behind the man's actions.\n\nUnder common law principles, if the defendant had a reasonable expectation of being able to predict that their actions would result in harm to someone else (in this case, the customer), they may be held liable for battery. However, in this case, the bullet did miss the manager, so the man's intention was not necessarily to injure the manager specifically, but rather to strike the customer. Therefore, under the circumstances presented, the man's intent is less clear-cut, making it difficult to definitively conclude that he would have been successful in injuring the manager. \n\nAdditionally, the specific circumstances involving the customer in the head injury also complicate matters. The fact that the bullet did not hit the manager but instead struck the customer could be seen as a mitigating factor in the man's liability, depending on the specifics of the situation. For example, if the man's intention was purely to scare the manager and the customer, and he did not anticipate any direct impact from the bullet, then he might still be found liable for battery.\n\nUltimately, determining whether the customer would have been hit by the bullet or not depends on the facts of the case, including the man's intent, the likelihood of the bullet hitting the customer, and the actual impact of the bullet when it did hit the customer. Without more information about these factors, it is impossible to definitively state whether the customer would have been successful in a battery claim against the man."
