This is because solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking the Sun's light and casting a shadow on the Earth. The angle at which this happens can vary depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that solar eclipses still occur about once per year on average, but the duration of each eclipse varies. In some cases, an eclipse may only last for a few minutes, while in other cases it may last for several hours. So even if solar eclipses occurred less frequently due to alignment with the ecliptic plane, their durations would still vary significantly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: solar eclipses would be much more frequent."
