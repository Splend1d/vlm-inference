The argument suggests that discrimination is necessary and inevitable, which implies that there might not be an alternative or better way of living without it. This kind of language can be considered prejudicial because it assumes that discrimination is always negative or harmful, whereas in reality, it can also serve important social functions like promoting diversity and inclusivity. Therefore, option A fits best in this context."
