The logit model can result in too many observations falling at exactly zero or exactly one\nC. For the logit model, the marginal effect of a change in one of the explanatory variables is simply the estimate of the parameter attached to that variable, whereas this is not the case for the probit model\nD.

This means that the marginal effect of changing one variable will be the same regardless of how much other variables are changed.\n- D: The probit model also uses a cumulative logistic function but applies it differently from the logit model. The probit model is more appropriate for modeling binary outcomes where the dependent variable is either 0 or 1.\n\nTherefore, all of these options are correct."
