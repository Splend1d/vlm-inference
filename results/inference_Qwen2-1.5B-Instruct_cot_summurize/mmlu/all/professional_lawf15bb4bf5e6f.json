The authorities arrested the man for felonious larceny, a crime that is also called theft in some states. The man defended on the basis that he had no intent to steal and only wanted his rightful compensation. He filed a motion to dismiss, relying essentially on proof that he had no intent to steal because he believed in good faith that it was his own property. What will be the most likely decision of the court?\n\nA. The charges will not be dismissed because his intent becomes irrelevant when he uses force to obtain possession of property.\nB. The charges will be dismissed because the intent to steal is a required element of both theft and larceny and this man did not intend to steal because he thought that he had a right to the money.\nC. The charges will be dismissed because he can raise the defense of necessity and it is always lawful to take what a person needs to survive.\nD. The charges will not be dismissed because the man's right to the money was disputed and therefore his intent is irrelevant as compared to the employer's intent and belief.\n"

The charges will be dismissed because the intent to steal is a required element of both theft and larceny and this man did not intend to steal because he thought that he had a right to the money.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the law distinguishes between \"theft\" and \"larceny.\" Theft generally requires the intention to permanently deprive another of their property or use it against them, while larceny refers to taking someone else's property with the specific intent to deprive them of it (i.e., using force or threat). In the case described, the man intended to receive compensation for wages that he believed were rightfully owed to him, but there is no evidence that he intended to permanently deprive his employer of anything.\n\nTherefore, even though the man may have believed he had a right to the money, the fact remains that he did not have the necessary intent to commit larceny. As a result, the charges should be dismissed."
