All four options are true.\n\nWhen an irrelevant or insignificant variable is added to a regression model, it can cause bias in the estimated coefficients. This is because the OLS estimator relies on the assumption of homoscedasticity and normality of errors, which may not hold when there is multicollinearity or other sources of heterogeneity in the data. \n\nIn addition, if the excluded variable is uncorrelated with all of the included variables, the slope coefficients may still be consistent, but they may also be biased due to the presence of multicollinearity or other sources of error in the model. Therefore, option (ii) is incorrect.\n\nOption (iii) is also incorrect because the exclusion of an irrelevant variable does not necessarily mean that the intercept coefficient will be inconsistent. In fact, the intercept coefficient may remain consistent even when the excluded variable is uncorrelated with all of the included variables.\n\nOption (iv) is correct because when an irrelevant variable is excluded, the OLS estimator becomes biased and inconsistent, regardless of whether the excluded variable is correlated with any of the included variables. This is because the OLS estimator assumes that the errors have constant variance, and this assumption may not hold when there is multicollinearity or other sources of heterogeneity in the data. Therefore, the slope and intercept coefficients may be consistent but biased, leading to inefficiency in the estimates."
