While some grandparents may feel that they are being spoiled by their grandchildren, this is not necessarily a common experience among all grandparents. Many grandparents enjoy spending time with their grandchildren and watching them grow and develop, which can be incredibly rewarding. Additionally, many grandparents take pride in their roles as caregivers and mentors for their grandchildren, and feel fulfilled by the opportunity to share their wisdom and experiences with future generations."
