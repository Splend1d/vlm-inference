The worst-case path length for a network is the maximum, over all pairs of nodes in the network, of the minimum length paths (measured in number of links) between the nodes. For each type of interconnection of n processors, a figure of merit can be formed as the product of the number of links required for the network times the worst-case path length connecting any two processors. The ratio of this figure of merit for the fully interconnected network compared to that of the ring network, for even n > 2, is\n\nA. 1/(n^2)\nB. 1/(n(n-1))\nC. 1/n\nD. (n-1)/n\n"

Each pair of nodes has a minimum distance of n-1 - 1 = n-2 links, so the worst-case path length for the ring network is (n-2)^2. Therefore, the figure of merit for the ring network is (n-1)(n-2)^2.\n\nTo compare the figures of merit for the fully interconnected network and the ring network, we need to find the ratio of these two figures of merit:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{Figure of merit for fully interconnected network}}{\\text{Figure of merit for ring network}} = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)^2}{(n-1)(n-2)^2} = 1.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
