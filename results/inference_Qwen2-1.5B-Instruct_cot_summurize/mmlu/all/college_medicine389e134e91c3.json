Phosphocreatine stores.\n\nWhen the body experiences a high force contraction for a brief period of time, such as during intense exercise or sudden movements, the muscles require a quick source of energy to generate the required force. This can be achieved by using stored energy in phosphocreatine (PCr) molecules, which are small, fast-repairing ATP molecules that are found in muscle cells. When PCr molecules are depleted during exercise, they are broken down into ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), releasing energy through the ATP synthase enzyme complex. This process allows muscles to continue generating force even when their ATP stores are low, helping to power the contractions."
