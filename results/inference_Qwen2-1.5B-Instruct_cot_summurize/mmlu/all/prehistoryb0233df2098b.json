Fire offered protection from predators and enemies by keeping humans warm, dry, and safe from danger.\n\nB. Fire made meat more digestible and killed bacteria because it could be cooked at high temperatures, which breaks down proteins and reduces the growth of harmful microorganisms.\n\nC. Fire provided light and heat, which allowed humans to see better in the dark and also kept them warm on cold nights.\n\nD. Fire could be used in warfare and to clear fields by being used as a signal or distraction before an attack, or by burning away dense vegetation that would hinder movement or progress. \n\nTherefore, all of these advantages make fire one of the most significant developments in human history."
