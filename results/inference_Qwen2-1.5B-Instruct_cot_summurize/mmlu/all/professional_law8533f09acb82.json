Invalid, because it is an unauthorized extension of executive power.\n\nExecutive orders are issued by the President under the authority granted by Congress. They can only be used for matters within the President's constitutional powers, such as foreign affairs or defense. In this case, the President's claim that the drug causes cervical cancer in laboratory monkeys is not within his constitutional powers, as it relates to the regulation of interstate commerce. Therefore, the President's executive order is invalid."
