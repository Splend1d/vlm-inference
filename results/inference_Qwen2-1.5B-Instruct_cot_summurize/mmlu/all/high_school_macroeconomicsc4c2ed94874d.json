This will increase the total quantity supplied and decrease the quantity demanded. As a result, the equilibrium price (P) will increase because there will be more buyers willing to buy corn at that higher price level. Similarly, when demand shifts to the left, it means that consumers are willing to pay less for corn at each price level. This will decrease the total quantity demanded and increase the quantity supplied. Again, as a result, the equilibrium price will increase because there will be more sellers willing to sell corn at that lower price level."
