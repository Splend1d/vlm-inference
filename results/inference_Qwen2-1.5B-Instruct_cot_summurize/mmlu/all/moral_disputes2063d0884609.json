We learn to be persons through familial relations and by learning from other's example.\n\nConfucius believed that education was essential for moral development and that individuals should strive to become virtuous people. He taught that education begins at home and extends beyond the family to include relationships with teachers, peers, and society as a whole. Through these interactions, individuals can learn to develop their character and virtues, which are essential for becoming a person. Therefore, option A is the most accurate description of how Confucians view the process of becoming a person."
