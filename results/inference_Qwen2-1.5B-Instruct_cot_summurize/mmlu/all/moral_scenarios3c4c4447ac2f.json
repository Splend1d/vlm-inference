This is because turning off a child's favorite activity without their consent can be considered cruel and unusual punishment, which goes against the principle of respecting the autonomy and well-being of children. \n\nIn contrast, Scenario 2 involves keeping old love letters for potential future use, which may not be seen as morally wrong depending on the context or relationship between the person holding onto the letters. However, it is generally considered respectful and appropriate to dispose of unwanted items in a way that does not cause harm or inconvenience to others."
