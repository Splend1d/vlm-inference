The wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) of the emitted photon can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{c}{\\nu} \\]\n\\[ \\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nWhere \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the emitted photon.\n\nFor a hydrogen atom with one electron, we have:\n\n\\[ c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^8 \\, m/s \\]\n\\[ h = 6.62606957 \\times 10^{-34} \\, J \\cdot s \\]\n\\[ R = 1.09737297 \\times 10^{18} \\, J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\]\n\nPlugging these values into the equation for the wavelength of the emitted photon gives us:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{hc}{\\nu} = \\frac{(6.62606957 \\times 10^{-34}) \\cdot (2.99792458 \\times 10^8)}{(2 \\cdot 1.09737297 \\times 10^{18})} \\]\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{1.73778698 \\times 10^{-19}}{2.1947459} \\]\n\\[ \\lambda = 8.1 \\times 10^{-7} \\, m \\]\n\nThis is the wavelength of the emitted photon in the ground state of a hydrogen atom. When the electron transitions to a higher energy level, the wavelength of the emitted photon increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Decreased by a factor of 81."
