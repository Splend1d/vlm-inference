In this case, there is no net external force acting on the car because it is coasting up the incline without any friction or air resistance.\n\nSince the only forces acting on the car are gravity (mg) and the normal force from the incline (N), we have:\n\nF = mg + N\n\nand\n\nma = mg + N\n\nSolving for a gives:\n\na = g + N/m\n\nIf the incline is at an angle \u03b8 to the horizontal, then the component of gravity along the incline is:\n\nmgcos\u03b8\n\nSo,\n\na = g(1 + cos\u03b8)\n\nThis means that the car's acceleration in the x-direction is zero (ax = 0), but the car's acceleration in the y-direction is equal to the acceleration due to gravity (ay = g). Therefore, the answer is B. ax = 0; ay = g."
