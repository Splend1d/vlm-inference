A group of immigrant farm workers were continually refused employment contracts by the labor contractors in the state. Instead, the labor contractors had employed many alien workers since they would toil longer hours for less wages. The immigrant farm workers now bring suit in state court pursuant to the above-mentioned statutory provision. Which of the following determinations would most likely result as a consequence of the immigrant farm workers' lawsuit?\n\nA. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The court would declare the statute constitutional as within the realm of rights reserved to the states by the Eleventh Amendment.\nC. The court would declare the statute unconstitutional since the regulation of immigration is preempted.\nD. The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n"

The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.\n\nThis determination is based on the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution and federal laws regarding immigration and employment. Under the principle of \"state sovereignty,\" states retain authority over their own internal affairs, including matters related to immigration and employment. This means that states can regulate these issues independently, even when dealing with individuals who may be considered \"illegal\" under federal law.\n\nTherefore, the decision made by the court would be consistent with the principle of state sovereignty and not preemption by the federal government."
