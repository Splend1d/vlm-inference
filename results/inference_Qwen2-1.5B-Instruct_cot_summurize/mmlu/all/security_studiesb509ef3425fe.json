Human security is threatened by global inequality, because 3s of the world population do not share the benefits of globalisation. However, this inequality does not translate into political instability or involve military action.\nB. Global inequality creates disenfranchised populations who, although discontent with their situation, lack the agency to rebel or protest.\nC. Revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them.\nD. Global inequality does not present a significant threat to global security.\n"

Revolutionary uprisings are likely to occur; people of the world who have been left behind by neoliberal globalisation can become radicalised and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them.\n\nGlobal inequality can create tensions and conflicts between different groups within a country or region, which could escalate into violence and civil unrest. In addition, global inequality can lead to political instability, as marginalized communities may feel disenfranchised and vulnerable to external threats. This could potentially lead to geopolitical tensions and conflict, such as terrorism, proxy wars, or regional conflicts. Therefore, it is important to address global inequality in order to promote stability and prevent potential threats to global security."
