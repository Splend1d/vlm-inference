Muscle biopsy specimens obtained from the subjects during the resting state show significantly increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA. The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits which of the following processes in these subjects?\n\nA. Fatty acid oxidation\nB. Fatty acid synthesis\nC. Gluconeogenesis\nD.

Therefore, an increase in malonyl-CoA levels would directly inhibit fatty acid oxidation by increasing the availability of malonyl-CoA for this process. This can lead to an accumulation of fatty acids in the liver, which can cause insulin resistance and other metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes."
