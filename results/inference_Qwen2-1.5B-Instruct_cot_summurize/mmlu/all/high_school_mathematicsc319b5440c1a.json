So, for example, $5! = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 120$.\n\nWe want to find the greatest odd factor of $5!$. Since $5! = 120$, we need to find the largest odd number that divides evenly into 120.\n\nTo do this, we can start by dividing 120 by the smallest odd numbers until we reach an odd number.\n- $120 \\div 1 = 120$\n- $120 \\div 3 = 40$\n- $120 \\div 5 = 24$\n- $120 \\div 7 = 17$\n\nAt this point, we have reached an even number (17), so we know that $5!$ has at least one factor of 7 and possibly more factors of 7.\n- $120 \\div 9 = 13$\n\nNow we have reached an odd number (13) which is a factor of 120. So, the greatest odd factor of 120 is $\\boxed{15}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 15."
