The fact that the skulls of the earliest migrants to the New World do not match those of modern Native Americans suggests that there may have been genetic differences between the two groups, and that the early migrants were not fully assimilated into the existing population of Native Americans. Therefore, it is possible that they did not pass down their own genetic makeup or that the genetic changes occurred before the arrival of the early migrants."
