Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nScenario 1 involves using another person's property without their consent and endangering their safety by moving the ladder while they were on it. This behavior goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2 involves training one's spouse to beg for food, which is considered exploitative and unethical. It also violates the principles of autonomy and respect for personal boundaries.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve clear violations of ordinary moral standards. The only difference between them is that scenario 1 involves a physical action, while scenario 2 involves psychological manipulation. However, both actions can be considered morally wrong based on the context and consequences involved."
