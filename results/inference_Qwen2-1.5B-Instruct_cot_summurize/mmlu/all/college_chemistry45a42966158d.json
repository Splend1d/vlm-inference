The rate of this decrease is given by the rate constant (k), and it does not depend on the initial concentration of reactant A or any other factors like temperature or pressure. Therefore, the expression for the rate of a zero-order reaction is simply k. \n\nHere's why:\n\n- The rate law for a zero-order reaction is typically written as R = k[A], where R represents the rate of the reaction.\n- In this case, the concentration of reactant A is multiplied by the rate constant (k) to give the rate of the reaction.\n- Since the concentration of reactant A decreases at a constant rate, this means that the rate of change in the concentration of reactant A must also decrease at a constant rate.\n- Therefore, the only way this can happen is if the rate of the reaction is proportional to the concentration of reactant A itself, rather than some higher power of the concentration.\n- This is exactly what we see when we write R = k[A] in the rate law for a zero-order reaction.\n\nSo, the rate constant (k) directly determines the rate of a zero-order reaction, regardless of any other factors like initial concentration or temperature."
