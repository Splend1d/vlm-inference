This means:\n\n\\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 2x \\equiv 0 \\mod 5\\]\n\nLet's solve for \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 2x\\) modulo \\(5\\):\n\n- If \\(x^4 \\equiv 0 \\mod 5\\), then \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 2x \\equiv 0 + 4(0) + 2(0) \\equiv 0 \\mod 5\\)\n- If \\(x^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\), then \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 2x \\equiv 1 + 4(1) + 2(1) \\equiv 6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\)\n\nTherefore, either \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 2x \\equiv 0 \\mod 5\\) or \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 2x \\equiv 1 \\mod 5\\).\n\nSince we're working in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\), where every element is congruent to one of the five elements (\\(-1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\)), we can conclude that the only possible values for \\(x^4 + 4x^2 + 2x\\) modulo \\(5\\) are \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\nThus, there are two possible solutions for \\(x\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_5\\): \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\nHence, the correct answer is **C. 0,1**."
