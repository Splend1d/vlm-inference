Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment?\n\nA. The aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations\nB. The continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market\nC. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company\nD. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia\n"

Therefore, option D (the growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia) does not support the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment. Option A (the aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations) also does not directly relate to the statement about African underdevelopment. Option B (the continuous sale of African slaves by Arabian merchants into the Mediterranean market) and option C (the establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company) both refer to specific historical events related to colonization and slavery, which do not address the issue of African underdevelopment in the context of capitalism."
