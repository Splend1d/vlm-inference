                    "text": "The correct answer is C: there is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures.\n\nIt is not true that typical calcium intake in most adults is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg per day. The recommended daily intake for adults is typically around 1000-1300 mg of calcium per day. However, it is important to note that calcium intake can vary depending on factors such as age, sex, and individual needs.\n\nIt is also not true that activated vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium. In fact, vitamin D plays an important role in regulating calcium absorption in the body.\n\nAbsorption efficiency is indeed inversely related to calcium intake, but this does not necessarily mean that a higher proportion of calcium will be absorbed if intake is high. This relationship is known as the \"absorption paradox\" and it has been studied extensively in the field of nutrition. It is generally accepted that a small increase in calcium intake may lead to a decrease in absorption, but this effect is relatively minor compared to the benefits of increased calcium intake overall."
