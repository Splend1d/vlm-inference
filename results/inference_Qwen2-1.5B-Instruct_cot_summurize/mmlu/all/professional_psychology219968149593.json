Generalizing the results of the study to other individuals, settings, and conditions.\n\nExternal validity refers to the extent to which the findings of a study can be generalized to real-world situations outside the experimental setting. It measures how well the results of a study apply to the broader population or the larger world. \n\nIn contrast, internal validity refers to the degree to which the results of the study are not due to chance but rather reflect true differences in the populations being studied. \n\nManipulation refers to the ability to control for certain variables within an experiment, while random assignment allows for equal distribution of participants across treatment groups. Determining causality involves examining relationships between variables without manipulating one or the other."
