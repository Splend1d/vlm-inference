However, he does acknowledge that nonhuman animals can be treated as \"agents\" or \"entities with interests,\" which implies that they may be accorded some form of moral standing. In this case, Carruthers suggests that we should treat nonhuman animals as \"quasi-intelligible entities\" rather than as fully conscious beings."
