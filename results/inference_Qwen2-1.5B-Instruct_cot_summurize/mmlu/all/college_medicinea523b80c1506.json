This is accomplished by a positive gradient of H+ ions that are formed outside the membrane which then pass back through a specialized channel known as ATP synthase. The energy created from this phosphorylates an ATP to an ATP, known as oxidative phosphorylation. The mechanism by which H+ returns to the inside of the mitochondria is known as what?\n\nA.

In the context of the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis, active transport plays a crucial role in moving protons (H+) from the intermembrane space to the matrix of the mitochondrion, creating a proton gradient. This gradient drives the production of ATP through the enzyme ATP synthase."
