An acute phase reaction results in changes in inter-tissue distributions of certain micronutrients.\n\nInfections and inflammatory states can lead to an acute phase response, which includes changes in the body's metabolism and distribution of certain nutrients. This can cause an imbalance in nutrient intake and absorption, leading to inaccurate measurement of micronutrient levels in biochemical indices. For example, during an infection, the immune system may activate stress hormones like cortisol, which can interfere with the normal functioning of enzymes involved in nutrient metabolism. As a result, the body may use up more of these nutrients than it would normally, leading to a higher concentration in the blood or other bodily fluids. Additionally, inflammation can cause changes in the structure and function of cells, which can affect how they absorb and utilize micronutrients. Therefore, the accuracy of biochemical indices may be compromised in samples from people who are sick due to these changes in nutritional status."
