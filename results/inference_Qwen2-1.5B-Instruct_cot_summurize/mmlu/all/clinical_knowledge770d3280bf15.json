To minimize risk of cross-infection.\n\nElectric razors can carry bacteria or other microorganisms that may be transferred from one person to another during use, particularly in hospitals where there is often a high volume of patient interactions. By allowing male patients to bring their own electric razors to the hospital, healthcare providers can ensure that they are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before being used by the patient. This helps to reduce the risk of transmission of infections such as staphylococcal skin infections (SSIS) and other types of skin infections caused by bacteria on the razor blades. Additionally, it also allows for more control over the cleanliness of the razor, which can be crucial when using shared equipment."
