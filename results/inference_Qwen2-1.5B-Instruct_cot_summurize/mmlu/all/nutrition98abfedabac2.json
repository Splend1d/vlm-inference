However, as a general guideline, most athletes require between 0.8 and 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.\nThis is because the human body cannot store excess protein, so it must be obtained from the diet through the consumption of proteins-rich foods such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, legumes, nuts, seeds, and plant-based sources like tofu, tempeh, and quinoa. It's important for athletes to consume enough protein to support muscle growth and repair, maintain lean muscle mass, and prevent muscle wasting during periods of low-intensity exercise or recovery.\nIn summary, athletes should aim to consume between 0.8 and 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, with no more than 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day to avoid excessive nitrogen loss and dehydration."
