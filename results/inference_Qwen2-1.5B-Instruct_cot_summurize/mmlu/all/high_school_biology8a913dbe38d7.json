An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.\nB. Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.\nC.

Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\n\nIn this scenario, when you place a dialysis bag (containing a 0.5 M solution) into a beaker (containing a 0.6 M solution), there will be a net movement of water from the 0.5 M solution to the 0.6 M solution due to the difference in concentration between the two solutions. The movement of water is driven by both the concentration gradient and the pressure gradient across the membrane. \n\nConcentration gradient refers to the difference in concentration between the two solutions. Solvent molecules preferentially move towards areas of higher concentration because they have less energy to overcome the concentration gradient. This is why water moves from the low concentration solution (the dialysis bag) to the high concentration solution (the beaker).\n\nPressure gradient, on the other hand, refers to the force pushing the water molecules through the membrane. In this case, the higher concentration of solutes in the 0.6 M solution pushes the water molecules against the membrane, causing them to flow from the 0.5 M solution to the 0.6 M solution.\n\nSo, together, concentration and pressure gradients combine to drive the movement of water from the 0.5 M solution to the 0.6 M solution. This is why the correct answer is C. Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential."
