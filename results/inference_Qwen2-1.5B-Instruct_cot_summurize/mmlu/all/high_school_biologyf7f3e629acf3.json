Mutation. \n\nMutation refers to changes in an organism's DNA sequence that can lead to variations in traits or phenotypes. In this scenario, the original population of ferns may have undergone genetic mutations that led to the emergence of a new variant. The new variant could then have been selected for by natural selection due to its advantageous traits, such as better camouflage or increased survival in certain environments.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the change in the variant is mutation, which occurred independently from any other factor listed (Karyotyping, Balance polymorphism, Polyploidy)."
