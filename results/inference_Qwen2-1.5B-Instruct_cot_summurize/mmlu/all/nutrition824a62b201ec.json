The daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food\n\nToxicity and dose-response data from animal studies can be used to evaluate the safety of a food substance by determining the maximum safe level that is not harmful to animals at the highest possible exposure levels. This information can then be used to estimate the potential toxicity of the substance when consumed by humans. By comparing the toxicological data from animals to human data, researchers can determine whether the substance is safe for human consumption at recommended doses or if further testing may be needed."
