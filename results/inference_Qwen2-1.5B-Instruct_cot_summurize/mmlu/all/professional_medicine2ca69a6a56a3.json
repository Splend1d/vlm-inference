The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\nA. Atrial fibrillation\nB. Cor pulmonale\nC. Systemic hypertension\nD. Tricuspid valve regurgitation\n"

It can lead to pulmonary hypertension, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue, and chest pain.\n\nThe patient's history of pneumonia at age 3 years and the presence of a grade 3/6 systolic murmur on physical examination suggest that this patient may have had cor pulmonale, which is a complication of lung infection. The other options listed do not necessarily correlate with the patient's clinical presentation."
