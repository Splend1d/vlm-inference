By comparing the maximum altitude of the Sun in two cities at different latitudes at the same time on the same day.\n\nEratosthenes used the phenomenon of the sun's position relative to the stars to determine the size of Earth. Specifically, he observed that the angle between the sun and the horizon was larger when he was at one latitude than it was when he was at another latitude. This difference in angle corresponds to the difference in elevation of the sun as seen from each location, which can be calculated using trigonometry. By adding up the differences for all locations, Eratosthenes could then estimate the size of Earth based on its distance from the observer."
