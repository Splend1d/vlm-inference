About 95% of polls conducted in this way will give a sample proportion within 3.2 percentage points of the actual proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing.\n\nThis means that there is a 95% chance that the sample proportion of Americans who approve of the president's job performance falls within plus or minus 3.2 percentage points of the true population proportion. The margin of error (MoE) is a measure of the expected variability in a sample statistic when it is used to estimate another statistic from which it was derived. In this case, the MoE represents the range of values within which we can expect the sample proportion of Americans approving of the president's job performance to fall if the survey were repeated many times under similar conditions."
