When the audience are convinced via the speech act or the securitizing actor but fail to grant that actor the special rights requested in order to address the proposed threat.\n\nThis option addresses the situation where the securitizing actor has successfully conveyed their case for the need for extraordinary measures through persuasive discourse and convincing arguments, but the audience remains unconvinced due to lack of support from key stakeholders or failure to grant them the necessary authority to implement those measures. In this scenario, the audience's inability to support the securitizing actor's request for extraordinary measures can prevent the issue from being effectively securitized."
