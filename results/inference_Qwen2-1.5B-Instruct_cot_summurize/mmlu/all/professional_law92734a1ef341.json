He said to the roofer, \"We'll have a deal when you begin to do the work necessary for this job.\" The roofer did not directly respond to the offer but he went out and purchased the supplies and materials needed for the homeowner's specifications. When he arrived at the site with the supplies he found a message from the homeowner that he revoked the offer. Can the homeowner revoke the offer under these circumstances?\n\nA. Yes, because an offer for a bilateral contract can be revoked before its acceptance.\nB. No, because the act of purchasing supplies specifically for the homeowner's job was an effective acceptance and a contract was formed prior to homeowner's attempted revocation.\nC. No, because the offer had to remain open for a reasonable period of time before it could be revoked.\nD. Yes, because an oral offer to enter a bilateral contract is never enforceable.\n"

Yes, because an offer for a bilateral contract can be revoked before its acceptance.\n\nAn offer for a bilateral contract (i.e., a contract between two parties) is valid until one party accepts it or until the other party withdraws the offer. In this case, the homeowner made an offer to the roofer by saying they would have a deal when the roofer began doing the work necessary for the job. This offer was still valid even after the roofer purchased the necessary supplies and materials.\n\nWhen the roofer arrived at the site and received a message from the homeowner revoking the offer, the offer was no longer valid according to the rules of bilateral contracts. Therefore, the homeowner could revoke the offer under these circumstances."
