In 1797, John Frere made a significant scientific discovery in what is now known as the Gough Island site in British Guiana. He discovered several human skeletons, including one with an ape-like feature and another with a skull with large, flat nasal bones and a small jaw. These discoveries challenged the prevailing view of human origins and sparked debates among scientists about the nature of early humans."
