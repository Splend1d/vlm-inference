The state charged that selling the video violated its anti-obscenity law. The store owner defended on the ground that the prosecution violated his constitutional right to freedom of speech. Should the store owner prevail in this defense?\n\nA. No, because the store owner is engaged in the commercial sale of the video, which is not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nB. No, because the video consists entirely of portrayals of nudity, appeals to the prurient interest of viewers, and lacks serious social value as a whole.\nC. Yes, because mere portrayals of nudity are insufficient to justify a finding that the video is obscene as a matter of constitutional law.\nD. Yes, because the portrayals of nudity occurred outside the United States, and therefore the state lacks a compelling interest in applying its anti-obscenity law to the sale of the video.\n"

No, because the video consists entirely of portrayals of nudity, appeals to the prurient interest of viewers, and lacks serious social value as a whole.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, obscenity laws are meant to protect children from material that is deemed offensive or inappropriate for their age group. In order for something to be considered obscene, it must cause significant harm to society, such as promoting violence or encouraging illegal activity. \n\nIn this case, the video contains images of nude sunbathers on a beach in a foreign country where nude public sunbathing is common. While these images may be considered sexually explicit to some viewers, they do not necessarily promote violence or encourage illegal activities. Additionally, the fact that the video was sold in a store does not automatically make it more harmful than other forms of media. Therefore, the state cannot rely solely on the content of the video to establish that it is obscene.\n\nFurthermore, even if the video did contain content that could potentially be considered obscene under certain circumstances, the state's interest in protecting children from exposure to inappropriate material would still need to be weighed against the defendant's rights to free speech. The state has the burden of proving that the video falls within the scope of the state's anti-obscenity law, so the court will likely require evidence beyond just the content of the video to support such a claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis provided, the store owner should not prevail in this defense."
