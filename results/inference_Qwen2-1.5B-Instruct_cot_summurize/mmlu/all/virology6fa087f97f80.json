Direct-acting Antivirals such as daclatasvir and sofosbuvir\n\nDirect-acting antivirals (DAAs) have revolutionized the treatment of hepatitis C by providing highly effective, non-invasive treatments that eliminate the virus from the body without the need for long-term medication or liver transplants. These drugs work by blocking the production of viral proteins, which helps to reduce the amount of virus in the blood and reduces the risk of complications like cirrhosis and\u809d\u786c\u5316. Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir are two examples of DAAs that are currently being used to treat hepatitis C."
