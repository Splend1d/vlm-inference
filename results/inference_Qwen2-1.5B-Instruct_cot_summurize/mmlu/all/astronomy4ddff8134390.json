Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn.\nB. Methane did not exist in the solar nebula at the radii of Jupiter and Saturn when the planets formed.\nC. The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.\nD. Methane reacts with the abundant ammonia clouds in Jupiter and Saturn and is removed from the atmosphere.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. The relative slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.\n\nUranus and Neptune have slower rotations than Jupiter and Saturn, which means that methane molecules have more time to travel upwards through the atmosphere before condensing into clouds. This results in a thicker layer of methane clouds on these planets compared to their larger counterparts.\n\nJupiter and Saturn, on the other hand, have faster rotations, so methane molecules tend to stay closer to the surface and condense as they cool down, forming clouds. Therefore, they have thinner layers of methane clouds compared to Uranus and Neptune."
