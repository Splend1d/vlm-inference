Lucy, also known as \"Lucy\" or \"Laetitia,\" was an early member of the genus Homo and lived about 3 million years ago in Ethiopia. She belonged to the species Homo erectus, but her fossil remains were found in Tanzania and not Ethiopia, so she is often referred to as \"Lucy.\" However, her exact species is still under debate among paleoanthropologists."
