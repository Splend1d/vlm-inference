A business owner owns the central parcel in fee simple and maintains his dwelling house thereon. He has a right-of-way, granted in a written agreement, across the eastern parcel for crossing the eastern parcel on foot, by bicycle, or automobile. A landscaper is the owner of the eastern parcel. An investor owns the western parcel and conveys it to the business owner in fee simple. The business owner then builds a 15-story office building, covering the western parcel and the central parcel, which houses 6,000 persons during working hours each day. All of these persons use the right-of-way over the eastern parcel, and the business owner uses the way for delivering as many as 30 loads of supplies per day to the office building. In an action by the landscaper to enjoin the business owner and the office workers from using the right- of-way across the eastern parcel, the court will most likely hold that\n\nA. the business owner's right-of-way would be extinguished due to excessive use by the office workers.\nB. the business owner's right-of-way would be forfeited due to the unauthorized use by the office workers.\nC. the business owner, by making use of the right-of-way beyond the scope of the original privilege, would permanently be enjoined from using the servient tenement.\nD. Although the business owner may continue to use the right-of-way, the office workers would be enjoined from making such use.\n"

This principle is known as \"ejaculation.\" In this case, the business owner took possession of the eastern parcel by constructing a building on top of it, which means he has taken possession of the land without permission. As a result, the landscaper cannot use the right-of-way across the eastern parcel without being enjoined by the court.\n\nHowever, even after ejaculation, the business owner still has the right to use the right-of-way as long as it does not interfere with the landscaper's use of the property. Therefore, the court will most likely hold that the business owner's right-of-way would be temporarily enjoined until the landscaper is able to obtain an injunction against the business owner's use of the right-of-way."
