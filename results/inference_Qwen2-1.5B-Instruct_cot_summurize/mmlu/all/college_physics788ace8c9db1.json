                    "text": "The primary source of the Sun's energy is its core, where thermonuclear reactions occur. These reactions involve the fusion of protons into heavier nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the process.\n\nLet's consider the reaction that occurs in the Sun's core:\n\n$$ 4 \\text{H} + \\text{O}_{(9)} \\rightarrow 3 \\text{He} + 10 \\text{e}^- + \\text{n} $$\n\nThis reaction releases approximately 8 MeV per nucleon (a unit of nuclear energy) due to the conversion of rest mass energy into kinetic energy. Since the reaction involves only two types of particles (protons and neutrons), we can express this as follows:\n\n$$ 2(\\text{mass H}) + 2(\\text{mass O}) = 2(\\text{kinetic energy}) $$\n\nwhere $\\text{mass H}$ is the mass of one proton and $\\text{mass O}$ is the mass of one neutron. The kinetic energy released by the reaction is then:\n\n$$ 2(\\text{kinetic energy}) = 2 \\times 8 \\text{MeV} = 16 \\text{MeV} $$\n$$ 16 \\text{MeV} = \\frac{1}{2}c^2 \\times m_{\\text{He}} - \\frac{1}{2}c^2 \\times m_{\\text{H}} $$\n\nwhere $m_{\\text{He}}$ is the mass of one helium nucleus and $m_{\\text{H}}$ is the mass of one hydrogen nucleus. Solving for $m_{\\text{He}}$, we get:\n\n$$ m_{\\text{He}} = \\frac{1}{2}c^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2}m_{\\text{H}} + 16 \\right) $$\n\nSince $m_{\\text{H}} = 1.0073 \\text{u}$ (atomic weight of hydrogen) and $c = 3 \\times 10^{8} \\text{m/s}$, we have:\n\n$$ m_{\\text{He}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 10^{8} \\text{m/s} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.0073 \\text{u} + 16 \\right) = 5.56 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{u} $$\n\nwhere u is the atomic weight of helium. This means that the mass of one helium nucleus is about 5.56 parts per million of the mass of one proton or one neutron.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Four hydrogen atoms and one helium atom"
