The driver allegedly hit another car in a parking lot and drove away without leaving proper insurance and contact information. A bystander wrote down her license plate number and called the police. At trial, the driver proposes to testify that the day after the accident, she met with the police officer investigating the accident, and told him that she did not leave until after she had inspected both cars and determined there was no damage. The bystander is not available to testify at trial. The driver's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because it is the statement of the witness herself, who is subject to cross-examination.\nB. admissible, because it is a statement based on firsthand knowledge.\nC. inadmissible, because the bystander is unavailable and, therefore, cannot contradict the driver.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

Hearsay is a statement made for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted and must be offered by one of two exceptions: (1) the declarant is unavailable; or (2) the declarant is dead. In this case, the bystander is unavailable and cannot contradict the driver's testimony, so the statement cannot be admitted as hearsay. Additionally, the driver's testimony does not meet the requirements of being a statement based on firsthand knowledge or a statement against interest, which would also preclude its admission under the hearsay rule. Therefore, the only exception that allows the driver's testimony is if the witness is unavailable, but in this case, the witness is still available to contradict the driver's testimony."
