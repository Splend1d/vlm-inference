The Bahr [al-Fava'id, or \"Sea of Precious Virtues,\" written in the 1150s or 1160s] insists that the first duty of a Muslim ruler is to prosecute the jihad and bring about the victory of Islam, and if he does not do so and he makes peace with the infidel, that ruler would be better dead than alive, for he would be corrupting the world.\nRobert Irwin, \"Islam and the Crusades,\" 1995\nIt is strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly, saying that these men are dedicated to the Great and Glorious God and that they should therefore share with them. Likewise, not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories.\nIbn Jubayr, Muslim scholar, traveling to Mecca and Jerusalem, ca. 1185\nThese two passages are best understood in the context of which of the following?\n\nA.

The attempt of a religious group to proselytize to those following another faith\n"

It mentions the treatment of Muslim hermits by Christians in Syria, as well as the idea that Muslims were justified in pursuing the jihad (jihad) against non-Muslims. This suggests that there may have been tension between different religions at this time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely either A. The influence of religion on interaction between cultures, or C. The syncretic fusion of different religious traditions, as both of these options could explain why there might have been tension between different religions during this period. However, without more specific context or information about the passage, it's difficult to definitively say which option is the best fit."
