A decrease in consumer confidence.\n\nWhen there is a decrease in consumer confidence, people tend to spend less on goods and services, which can lead to a decrease in demand for those goods and services. This can cause prices to rise as businesses try to sell their products at higher prices to compensate for lower demand. At the same time, if there is a decrease in real GDP (which measures the value of all final goods and services produced by an economy over a specific period), it means that fewer goods and services are being produced overall. As a result, the economy may not have enough capacity to meet the increased demand, causing prices to rise further. This can lead to inflation, which is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services."
