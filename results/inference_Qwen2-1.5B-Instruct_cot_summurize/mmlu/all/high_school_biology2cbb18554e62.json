In this case, organisms on islands are different from, but closely related to, similar forms found on the nearest continent, indicating that they have evolved independently under different environmental pressures. This suggests that the islands formed from continental fragments, and over time, the local populations adapted to their unique environments, resulting in distinct species. Therefore, option C is incorrect, as the islands did not form from the continent directly. Option D is also incorrect, as convergence refers to similarities between different species on the same continent, not between islands and continents."
