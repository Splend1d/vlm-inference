Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released.\n\nWhen the string is released at an angle of 50 degrees below the horizontal, the ball swings back and forth with a period of 0.4 seconds. This means that the period of the pendulum is independent of its mass or the length of the string.\n\nHowever, if we increase the angle of the string from the horizontal when released, it will result in a longer period for the pendulum. The longer period occurs because the ball has more time to swing back and forth before being pulled back up by gravity.\n\nTherefore, decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released would decrease the period of the pendulum."
