It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following is referenced by the co-operation mentioned in the second paragraph?\n\nA. The competing ideologies of the Cold War\nB. The competing ideologies of World War II\nC. The competing empires of World War I\nD. The competing colonization companies in the Scramble for Africa\n"

Non-alignment involved countries engaging in economic and diplomatic cooperation with both sides of the Cold War, rather than taking sides with either bloc. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nD.
