This is because caring attitudes are not always something that one can choose or actively engage in. They can arise from certain circumstances or experiences, and it may take effort on the part of an individual to cultivate these attitudes. Additionally, caring attitudes are often seen as a result of being empathetic and understanding towards others, which is something that can be developed over time through practice and experience. Therefore, it is possible to have caring attitudes even if they do not come naturally to someone."
