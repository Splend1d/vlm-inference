Examples include washing hands regularly, avoiding close contact with sick people, covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and keeping your environment clean and free of clutter. Vaccines and antiviral medications can also play important roles in preventing certain diseases, but they are not as effective at preventing all diseases as hygiene. Mosquito nets are an important measure for preventing malaria, but they do not necessarily prevent other diseases."
