Higher transmission voltage increases the power transfer capability of the transmission line, allowing for greater energy delivery over longer distances.\nB. Reducing transmission line losses by increasing voltage can help in achieving more efficient power transmission.\nC. Reducing the area of cross-section and volume of the conductor with higher voltage can also lead to cost savings as it reduces material usage and maintenance requirements.\n\nTherefore, option D (all of the above) is correct."
