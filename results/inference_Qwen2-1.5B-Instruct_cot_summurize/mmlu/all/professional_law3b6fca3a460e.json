He then took them to the scene of the murder where they found the victim's body. By the next day, the man claimed that \"voices\" had ordered him to confess and he didn't act voluntarily. A physician verified that the man suffered from hallucinations that impaired his volitional abilities, preventing a voluntary confession. Will the court suppress the statements?\n\nA. Yes, he was insane and could not have given a voluntary confession.\nB. Yes, the police overreached by not having him mentally evaluated before questioning him.\nC. No, there was no police misconduct or overreaching, and as a result the confession is voluntary.\nD. No, a confession is admissible when accompanied by actions by the defendant that prove the truth of the statements.\n"

The man's claims of being influenced by voices and his inability to give a voluntary confession due to his hallucinations suggest that he was unable to form a true understanding of what he was doing at the time of the confession. Therefore, the court may conclude that the confession was involuntary and therefore inadmissible."
