It can also be seen as an unnecessary disturbance for the staff or other visitors. Therefore, it would be considered morally wrong. \n\nOption A is incorrect because running around loudly at the park is not inherently wrong, but rather depends on the context and whether it causes harm or inconvenience to others. Option B is also incorrect because admiring many of the paintings at the Louvre is generally considered a positive activity and is not inherently wrong. Option C is incorrect because admiring art is often considered a positive thing to do and is not inherently wrong either."
