But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her\u2013\u2013because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters\u2013\u2013to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak\u2013\u2013therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty\u2013\u2013therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nThe reference to the \"continual beatings\" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?\n\nA. The invasion of Afghanistan\nB. The creation of the Warsaw Pact\nC. The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe\nD. The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II\n"

The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe\n\nThe passage from Joseph Stalin's speech describes how the Soviet Union faced constant challenges due to its perceived backwardness and military, economic, cultural, and political inferiority. This reflects a historical context where the Soviet Union was viewed as an underdeveloped nation that was vulnerable to external pressures and exploitation.\n\nIn later Soviet foreign policy, the Brezhnev Doctrine (also known as the Non-Aligned Movement) was adopted in the early 1960s. The doctrine stated that the Soviet Union would not engage in any form of direct conflict or intervention in the internal affairs of other states, but would rather use its influence to promote the interests of the Third World countries and oppose Western imperialism. This stance aimed to counterbalance the influence of the United States and NATO powers, especially during the Cold War period when tensions were high between the two superpowers.\n\nTherefore, the passage from the speech directly supports the decision to impose the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe, as it aligns with the Soviet Union's commitment to non-aggression and the promotion of the interests of developing nations against Western imperialism."
