Ceftriaxone is an effective antibiotic that is commonly used in the treatment of meningitis caused by these bacteria. It is also safe for patients with chickenpox, as long as they have been vaccinated against varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Therefore, it would be appropriate to prescribe ceftriaxone as the first-line therapy."
