The main character disabled the cruise control on their car, which was not harmful or illegal.\n\nScenario 2 involves calling the police on an ex-lover who hit the main character. This action may be seen as morally wrong by some people due to the emotional and physical harm it caused the main character, but it also depends on personal beliefs and values. Some individuals may view this action as justified if they believe that violence against someone else should not be tolerated, while others might see it as an appropriate response in self-defense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nHowever, please note that the question seems to have been phrased with the assumption that \"I\" refers to the main character using first-person singular pronouns, which is common in narrative contexts. If you meant for \"I\" to refer to a third person, then scenario 2 would be considered morally wrong based on the context given."
