The city manual requires that newcomers pay a higher contribution to the city's employee betterment fund for the first three years of employment. Newcomer refuses to pay a higher contribution than other employees, whereupon she is terminated. Can she make a successful equal protection argument to fight for her job?\n\nA. No, she is not a member of a suspect class as there cannot be a \"class-of-one\" in the employment law context.\nB. No, the request for the contribution was not unreasonable and cannot support an equal protection argument.\nC. Yes, she can claim a class of one who is being discriminated against.\nD. Yes, she can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are coming and are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she is the only newcomer she knows of at this time.\n"

Yes, she can claim membership in a group of newcomers who are coming and are being treated differently than everyone else, even if she is the only newcomer she knows of at this time.\n\nIn order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), a plaintiff must show that: \n\n1. The plaintiff belongs to a protected class; \n2. The employer took an adverse action against the plaintiff because of his or her membership in the protected class; \n3. The adverse action taken by the employer was motivated by discriminatory intent; \n4. The protected characteristic of the plaintiff is related to the position held by the plaintiff; and \n5. There is no legitimate reason for the employer to have acted in a discriminatory manner.\n\nIn this scenario, the newcomer has established all five elements necessary to prove a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII:\n\n1. She belongs to a protected class (newcomers);\n2. Her employer took an adverse action against her (terminated her); \n3. This adverse action was motivated by discriminatory intent (she refused to pay a higher contribution than other employees); \n4. The protected characteristic of the newcomer is related to the position held by the newcomer (being a newcomer); and \n5. There is no legitimate reason for the employer to have acted in a discriminatory manner.\n\nTherefore, the newcomer can successfully argue that she is a member of a group of newcomers who are being discriminated against and should be entitled to a hearing on her case."
