For example, empirical evidence alone may not fully capture the complexity of moral disputes or account for subjective experiences and perspectives. Additionally, empirical methods may not be applicable or relevant in certain contexts or situations where ethical issues are deeply rooted in cultural, social, or historical factors. Therefore, it is important to use empirical methods in conjunction with other approaches such as normative ethics, meta-ethics, and critical theory to fully address and resolve ethical disagreements."
