However, it's important to note that while exercise can improve overall health and reduce the risk of complications related to diabetes, it should always be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Additionally, some types of exercise may have negative effects on blood glucose levels if not properly managed. It's also worth noting that while exercise can be beneficial for people with diabetes, it doesn't necessarily help control hypertension or triglycerides levels as much as other lifestyle changes such as diet and weight loss."
