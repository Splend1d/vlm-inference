When stomata open, they are usually surrounded by a stoma guard cell that prevents air from entering or leaving the stomatal opening. If the stomatal guard cell becomes damaged or breaks down, it can lead to the loss of gas exchange and water uptake. In this case, the stomatal opening may eventually close, allowing for gas exchange and water uptake again.\n\nIn contrast, phloem sieve tubes and xylem vessels are part of the plant's transport system and do not involve programmed cell death. Root cap cells are also involved in the plant's response to stress conditions but are not directly related to programmed cell death."
