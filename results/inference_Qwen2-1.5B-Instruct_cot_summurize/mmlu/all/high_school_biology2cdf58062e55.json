Genotypic variation refers to differences between individuals due to their different combinations of genes, while phenotypic variation refers to differences between individuals due to their expression of these gene combinations. \n\nGenetic variation is the underlying cause of phenotypic variation, as it determines which specific combination of genes an individual expresses at any given time. This means that all genetic variations (whether they be small or large) have the potential to produce changes in phenotype, although not necessarily all will do so."
