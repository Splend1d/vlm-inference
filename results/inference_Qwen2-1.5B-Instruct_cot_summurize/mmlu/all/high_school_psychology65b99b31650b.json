Apes have been able to use the words they know to express novel concepts.\n\nThis statement suggests that apes, which are closely related to humans and share many cognitive abilities with us, can develop and use a sophisticated language by learning new words and expressions through trial and error. This is considered strong evidence for the idea that animals are capable of developing and using a sophisticated language. \n\nThe other options may be correct in their own way, but none of them directly suggest that animals have developed and used a sophisticated language as effectively or efficiently as humans do. Option A suggests that there may be some similarities between animal and human brain structures, but it does not necessarily imply that animals have developed and used language in the same way. Option B and C both mention systems of communication, but they do not specifically address whether these systems are used to communicate novel concepts or to develop a sophisticated language. Option D, on the other hand, specifically mentions that apes have been able to use their knowledge of words to express novel concepts, which would be a clear indicator of a sophisticated language development."
