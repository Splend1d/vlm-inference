Rate = k[A]^-1.\n\nIn a first-order reaction, the concentration of the reactant decays as follows: [A] = [A]o * e^(-k*t), where [A]o is the initial concentration of the reactant, k is the rate constant, and t is the time elapsed. \n\nFor the graph of 1/[A] versus time, we can rearrange this equation to solve for the rate constant (k). Rearranging gives:\n\nln(1/[A]) = -kt + ln([A]o)\n\nTaking the exponential of both sides,\n\n1/[A] = [A]o * e^(-kt)\n\nDividing both sides by [A],\n\n1/([A]) = [A]o / ([A])\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n1/[A] = [A]o * (1/k)\n\nTherefore, the rate law in this case is:\n\nRate = k[A]^-1\n\nThis matches option D."
