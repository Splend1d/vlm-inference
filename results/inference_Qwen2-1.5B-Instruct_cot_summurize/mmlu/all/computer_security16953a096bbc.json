However, it only works if the user has enabled two-factor authentication and has a U2F dongle installed on their computer. If the user does not have two-factor authentication enabled or has not installed a U2F dongle, then this statement would be false.\n\nStatement 2 is also true because a server using U2F can reliably determine that the user who is attempting to log in is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request. This is because the U2F protocol provides a secure way of exchanging data between the client (the user trying to log in) and the server, which helps ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information. The U2F protocol uses digital signatures and other cryptographic techniques to verify the authenticity of the client and the server, making it difficult for attackers to impersonate legitimate users. Therefore, this statement is true."
