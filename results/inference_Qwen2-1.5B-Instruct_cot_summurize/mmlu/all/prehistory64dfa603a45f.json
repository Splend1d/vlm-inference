Obsidian tools: Obsidian is a type of volcanic glass that was widely used by both the Indus Valley civilization (which included the cities of Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, and other cities) and the ancient Mesopotamians (who lived in the fertile plains of modern-day Iraq). The obsidian tools found at Indus Valley sites suggest that there were exchanges between these two civilizations.\n\n2. Glass beads, copper, and gold: These materials were traded between the two civilizations. For example, copper was a valuable commodity among both Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, and glass beads were used as currency in both regions. Gold, which was highly valued in Mesopotamia, was also exchanged with the Indus Valley.\n\n3. Harappan seals and Mesopotamian cylinder seals: Both the Harappans and the Sumerians had their own unique types of seals that they used to sign documents or convey important messages. The fact that Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia and Mesopotamian cylinder seals have been found in the Indus Valley suggests that there was some form of communication and exchange between these two civilizations through the use of these seals.\n\n4. Trade networks: There were likely many indirect ways in which trade occurred between these two civilizations, including through intermediaries such as merchants, traders, and even animals that carried goods across long distances.\n\nTherefore, all of the above options are correct."
