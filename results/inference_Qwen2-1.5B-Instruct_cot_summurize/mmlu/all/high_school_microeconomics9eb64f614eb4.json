Firms spend money to differentiate and advertise their products.\n\nMonopolistic competition is characterized by firms that produce differentiated goods or services, which they try to sell at prices above marginal cost in order to earn economic profit. Therefore, firms will spend money on advertising and differentiation efforts to attract customers and maintain their competitive position. While some firms may incur losses due to lower demand for their products relative to those of more dominant competitors, this does not necessarily mean that all firms earn long-run economic profits. Additionally, while monopolistically competitive markets can be inefficient from an allocative standpoint (as there may be underallocation of resources), they do not always result in allocative inefficiency as in perfectly competitive markets. The concept of allocative efficiency also depends on the nature of the industry and the level of competition within it."
