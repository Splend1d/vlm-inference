So, the set of all such permutations is:\n\n$$\\{ (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) \\} $$\n\nNow, let's check if $p = (1,2,5,4)(2,3)$ is indeed an element of $S_5$:\n\n- The cycle notation for $p$ is $(1,2,5,4)(2,3)$.\n- This means that after applying $p$ once, we have gone through the sequence: $(1,2)\\rightarrow(1,3)\\rightarrow(2,3)\\rightarrow(2,4)\\rightarrow(2,5)\\rightarrow(3,4)\\rightarrow(3,5)\\rightarrow(4,5)\\rightarrow(5,1)$.\n- However, this sequence does not go back to its original state; it wraps around to the next permutation in cyclic order.\n\nSince $p$ doesn't return us to our starting point, it is not an element of $S_5$. Therefore, the index of the subgroup generated by $p$ in $S_5$ is 0.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **0**."
