However, it's important to note that the concept of \"sum of two people's losses\" doesn't have a universally accepted definition or interpretation in philosophy or economics. It's possible that some might argue that the sum of two losses is greater than either loss individually, while others may argue that it's equal to or smaller than either individual loss.\n\nIn general, it's important to consider all factors involved when making decisions about how to allocate resources or act in response to events, rather than relying solely on the number of people affected by those actions. This can help ensure that decisions are fair and equitable, taking into account the potential consequences and impacts on individuals and communities."
