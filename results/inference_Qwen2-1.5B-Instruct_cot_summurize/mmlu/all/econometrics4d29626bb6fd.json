All four statements are true.\n\nStatement i) is incorrect because the assumption that the standardised residuals are normally distributed depends on whether the GARCH model is appropriate for the data at hand. A GARCH model may not be appropriate if there are strong seasonality or other non-stationary patterns in the data.\n\nStatement ii) is correct because the square of the standardised residual can indeed be related to its lagged squared value if the GARCH model is appropriate. This is because the standardised residuals are used as predictors in the GARCH model, which allows for the use of autoregressive terms in the error term.\n\nStatement iii) is correct because the GARCH model assumes that the variance of the errors follows a power law distribution, which typically has heavier tails than a normal distribution. This means that the standardised residuals should have heavy tails, but not necessarily normal distributions.\n\nStatement iv) is also correct because if the GARCH model is adequate, it implies that the error variance process is weakly stationary, which is required for the standardised residuals to be equivalent to the raw residuals. However, this does not guarantee that the standardised residuals will always be equal to the raw residuals, as the latter may still depend on the specific structure of the data and the estimation method used."
