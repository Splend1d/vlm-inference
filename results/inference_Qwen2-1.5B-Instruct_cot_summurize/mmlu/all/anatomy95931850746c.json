The anterior fragment of the mandible will typically be displaced downwards by the action of the digastric muscle, which is located in the back of the neck and helps to move the head forward.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the movement of the fragments of the mandible in response to muscle activity:\n\n- B. The posterior fragment of the mandible will tend to be displaced anteriorly by the action of the lateral pterygoid muscle, which is also located in the back of the neck but moves the jaw towards the sides.\n- C. The anterior fragment of the mandible will tend to be displaced backwards by action of the temporalis muscle, which is located in the front of the face and helps to move the head upwards.\n- D. The posterior fragment of the mandible will tend to be displaced medially by action of the medial pterygoid muscle, which is located in the back of the neck and helps to move the jaw towards the sides."
