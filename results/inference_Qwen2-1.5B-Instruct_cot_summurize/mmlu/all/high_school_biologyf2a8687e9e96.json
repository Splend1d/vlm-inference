Redox reaction.\n\nRedox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between two substances, and in this case, the energy is released or absorbed during the transfer of electrons, making it an exergonic reaction. Exergonic reactions release energy, while endergonic reactions absorb energy. Hydrolysis reactions are related to acid-base reactions, not redox reactions, and they do not necessarily involve energy."
