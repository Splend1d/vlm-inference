He wanted to reward the colonies through his extension of \"salutary neglect.\"\n\nThe passage you provided mentions that the Prime Minister Grenville believed it was just and necessary to establish new provisions and regulations for improving the revenue of the kingdom and for extending and securing the navigation and commerce between Great Britain and its American territories. This suggests that he supported the idea of controlling trade and raising revenue. Therefore, option D, which states that he wanted to reward the colonies through his extension of \"salutary neglect,\" goes against the sentiment expressed in the passage.\n\nOption A aligns with the Prime Minister's belief in the importance of controlling trade and raising revenue. Option B also supports the view that the Crown needs to control trade and raise revenue. Option C, however, contradicts the Prime Minister's statement about the need to control trade and raise revenue since he explicitly stated that Parliament had the right to increase taxes on the colonies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
