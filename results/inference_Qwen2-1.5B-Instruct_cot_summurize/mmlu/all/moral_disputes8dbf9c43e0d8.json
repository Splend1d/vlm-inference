The key feature of this form of objectification is that it treats individuals as mere objects rather than as human beings with dignity and autonomy. Therefore, it does not require any action or behavior from the perpetrator to be considered sexual objectification. \n\nTherefore, option C (not necessary for sexual objectification) is correct."
