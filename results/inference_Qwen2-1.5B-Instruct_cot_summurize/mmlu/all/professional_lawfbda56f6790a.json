The bond agreement provided that for the first five years the racetrack was in operation, at least $2 from each admission charge would be used to repay the bond debt. The bond agreement further stipulated that if the proceeds from the admission charges during the first five years were not sufficient to repay the bondholders, then at least $1 from each admission charge for the next five years would be applied to make the necessary bond payments. After the racetrack was built and in operation for two years, the state legislature passed a bill requiring the racetrack to admit all senior citizens over the age of 65 for the discounted admission fee of 50 cents. This law is probably\n\nA. constitutional, because it is a justifiable exercise of the state's police power.\nB. unconstitutional, because it denies citizens under the age of 65 the equal protection of the law.\nC. unconstitutional, because it impairs the obligation of the bondholders' contract.\nD. unconstitutional, because it is an ex post facto law.\n"

If the proceeds from admission fees are insufficient, the racetrack must find other sources of revenue or adjust the terms of the bond agreement to ensure repayment.\n\nIn this case, the state legislature passed a law that requires the racetrack to admit all senior citizens over the age of 65 for a discounted admission fee of 50 cents. This law may impair the obligation of the bondholders' contract, as it changes the terms of the bond agreement without their consent. Therefore, the law is unconstitutional."
