This decrease in demand leads to a reduction in the quantity demanded of pears. As a result, the quantity supplied of pears remains relatively constant since producers are not willing to supply more at higher prices. Therefore, the market for pears will shift from an excess of supply to an shortage of supply, which will lead to a decrease in the quantity demanded and ultimately a fall in the price of pears."
