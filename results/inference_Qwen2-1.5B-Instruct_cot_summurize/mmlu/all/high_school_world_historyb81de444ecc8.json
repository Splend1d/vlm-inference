He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.\n\u2026\nHe looked to the West and prayed, \"I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal.\" When he had prayed he bowed again.\nFrom Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s\nAccounts of Xuanzang's travels from both the 600s and 1500s C.E. are inspired by which of the following accomplishments?\n\nA. Xuanzang's career as a spy against the Gupta Empire\nB. Xuanzang's conversion of South Asian Hindus\nC. Xuanzang's study and retrieval of Buddhist texts from India\nD. Xuanzang's opening of new trade routes to Southeast Asia\n"

Xuanzang's study and retrieval of Buddhist texts from India\n\nThe passage you provided describes Xuanzang, also known as Sun Wukong (\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a), a character from Chinese folklore and literature, specifically the novel \"Journey to the West\" by Wu Chengen. The passage describes how Xuanzang, having been chosen from among all the monks for his virtuous character and desire to cultivate nirvana, seeks to retrieve Buddhist scriptures from India. This action is significant because it represents his dedication to the pursuit of knowledge and spiritual enlightenment, rather than seeking power or honor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Xuanzang's study and retrieval of Buddhist texts from India."
