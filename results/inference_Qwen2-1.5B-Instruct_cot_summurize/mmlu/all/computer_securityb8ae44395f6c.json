One of these features is called \"session ticket\" protection, which prevents an attacker from replaying data that was sent in the past by the client. This is achieved through the use of a session ticket, which is generated during the handshake process and used for encryption purposes. Therefore, option D is correct, as it indicates that TLS protects against an attack where an attacker can replay data that was previously sent by the client. \n\nOn the other hand, option A is incorrect because it suggests that an attacker can replay bytes that a client sent earlier, which is not necessarily true under the assumption that the client and server are honest and do not leak their keys. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that an attacker impersonates the server, which is not necessarily true under the same assumptions. However, option C is partially correct because it implies that TLS protects against an attack where an attacker impersonates the server, but this is not always the case. For example, an attacker could potentially impersonate both the client and the server, depending on their intentions."
