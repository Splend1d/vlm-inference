Direct effects arise from changes in the quantity of money, such as through adjustments in interest rates or government policies. Indirect effects occur through changes in aggregate demand (AD) caused by shifts in consumer and business behavior due to changes in expectations about future monetary conditions. These changes in AD may lead to shifts in output and prices, which in turn can affect interest rates. Therefore, a change in the money supply can have multiple impacts on the economy, beyond just changing interest rates alone."
