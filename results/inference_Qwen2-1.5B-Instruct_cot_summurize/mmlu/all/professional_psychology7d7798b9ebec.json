While bartering can be a legitimate way to pay for psychological services, it must be done with the understanding that it may not be clinically appropriate or ethically sound in some cases.\n\nIf a psychologist engages in bartering with a client who does not have access to other forms of payment or who cannot afford to pay for their services, the relationship may become exploitative or abusive, which is why it is generally discouraged.\n\nAdditionally, bartering should not be used as an excuse for not providing necessary treatment or care, such as medication management or ongoing therapy sessions. The relationship between the therapist and client should always be based on mutual trust and respect, regardless of the financial arrangement."
