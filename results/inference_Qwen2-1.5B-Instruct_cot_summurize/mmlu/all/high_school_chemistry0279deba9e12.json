Therefore, all three options (the number of collisions per second, the transition state, and the energy of each collision) are included in the collision theory.\nHowever, the fourth option (the orientation of each collision) is not typically considered in the collision theory because it depends on the specific details of how the reactants and products interact with one another during the reaction, which is beyond the scope of the collision theory. Instead, the collision theory focuses on the overall probability of successful collisions occurring, rather than the precise direction or angle at which they occur."
