Role culture\n\nIn a role culture, employees are given clear roles and responsibilities within the organization, which helps in maintaining stability and efficiency as it ensures that everyone knows what their job entails and how they fit into the larger picture. This type of culture also encourages accountability and responsibility among employees, which can lead to increased productivity and efficiency.\n\nTask culture, on the other hand, focuses more on tasks rather than individuals or teams, which may not always align with the needs for stability and efficiency. Similarly, power culture promotes a hierarchical structure where power is distributed based on authority, which can lead to instability and inefficiency if not managed properly.\n\nPeople culture, while emphasizing individual strengths and values, may not always prioritize stability and efficiency over task performance. Therefore, a role culture is generally considered the best option for delivering both stability and efficiency in an organization."
