This means that if f(z) is an analytic function that maps the entire finite complex plane into the real axis, it will map the imaginary axis to a ray of points in the complex plane. The exact shape of this ray depends on the specific form of the function f(z), but it will always lie entirely within the real axis and extend infinitely in both directions from the origin."
