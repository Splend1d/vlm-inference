                    "text": "The correct answer is B: expansionary monetary policy by selling Treasury securities.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve engages in expansionary monetary policy, it typically buys government securities (Treasury bonds and notes) from commercial banks and other financial institutions. This increases the money supply in the economy, which can stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment. However, this type of monetary policy has the potential to crowd out private investment, as businesses may choose to invest rather than lend their excess reserves to the Federal Reserve at lower interest rates. Therefore, the Federal Reserve may need to use contractionary monetary policy measures such as raising the discount rate or selling Treasury securities to prevent crowding out."
