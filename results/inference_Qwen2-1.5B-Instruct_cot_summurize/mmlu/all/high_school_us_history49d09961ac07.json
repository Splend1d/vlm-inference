In the Providence of God, I am the voice of the maniac whose piercing cries from the dreary dungeons of your jails penetrate not your Halls of Legislation. I am the Hope of the poor crazed beings who pine in the cells, and stalls, and cages, and waste rooms of your poor-houses. I am the Revelation of hundreds of wailing, suffering creatures, hidden in your private dwellings, and in pens and cabins\u2014shut out, cut off from all healing influences, from all mind-restoring cares.\u2026 Could their melancholy histories be spread before you as revealed to my grieved spirit during the last three months, how promptly, how earnestly would you search out the most approved means of relief; how trifling, how insignificant, by comparison, would appear the sacrifices you are asked to make; how would a few dimes and dollars, gathered from each citizen, diminish in value as a possession, compared with the certain benefits and vast good to be secured for the suffering insane...by the consecration and application of a sufficient fund to the construction of a suitable hospital.\u2026\n\u2014Dorothea Dix, Memorial Soliciting a State Hospital for the Protection and Cure of the Insane,\nSubmitted to the General Assembly of North Carolina, November 1848\nWhich of the following best reflects the perspective of Dorothea Dix in the passage above?\n\nA. The care of the mentally ill is a state concern.\nB. The mentally ill are best left to the care of their families.\nC. The federal government should regulate the treatment of the mentally ill.\nD. More democracy will help the mentally ill.\n"

                    "text": "The perspective of Dorothea Dix in the passage above aligns with option A: \"The care of the mentally ill is a state concern.\" Dix's statement that she comes to \"appeal\" to those who cannot plead their own case suggests that she believes the responsibility for the care of the mentally ill falls primarily on the states or local governments. She also advocates for a state-funded hospital specifically designed to provide treatment for the mentally ill, which further supports this view.\n\nOption B (state concerns) is incorrect because Dix's focus is on the need for a state hospital rather than individual or family responsibilities.\nOption C (federal regulation) is incorrect because Dix does not advocate for federal intervention in the matter of mental health care provision.\nOption D (more democracy) is unrelated to the context of the passage, focusing instead on political implications rather than the actual concerns addressed by Dix."
