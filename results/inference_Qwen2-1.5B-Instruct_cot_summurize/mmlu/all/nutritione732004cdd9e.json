According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 60% of adults in high-income countries are considered obese or overweight, while only around 20% of adults in low- and middle-income countries are considered obese or overweight. Therefore, it's difficult to provide an exact number for the worldwide prevalence of obesity without considering these factors. However, based on available data, it can be estimated that the global obesity rate is around 39%."
