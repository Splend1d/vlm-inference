The Vak, or discourses given by the Guru during his lifetime, are considered to be the words of the Guru himself and are believed to contain profound teachings and wisdom that can inspire individuals to reflect upon their own lives and seek guidance and direction.\n\nHearing the Vak in the morning is seen as an opportunity to start the day with a positive mindset and to receive inspiration and guidance from the Guru's teachings. It is also believed that listening to the Vak helps to purify the mind and prepare it for the day ahead, making it easier to focus on spiritual practices and engage with others in a positive manner. Therefore, option C - \"Inspiration for personal meditation throughout the day\" is the correct answer."
