Therefore, we cannot determine the exact percentage of the population that scores between 70 and 130 without additional information about the distribution of scores.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the WISC has a normal distribution with a mean of around 100 and a standard deviation of around 15, then we can estimate the percentage of the population that scores between 70 and 130 using a z-score formula:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere x is the score you want to find the percentile range for, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nPlugging in the values we get:\n\nz = (130 - 100) / 15 = 20 / 15 = 1.33\n\nThis means that approximately 13% of people scored between 70 and 130 on the WISC.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 68."
