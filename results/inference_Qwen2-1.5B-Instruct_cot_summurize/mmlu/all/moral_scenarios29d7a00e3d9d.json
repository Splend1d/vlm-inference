It can be seen as cruel and inhumane to intentionally cause harm or death to an animal that is still alive.\n\nIn scenario 2, calling the police on a violent man who has committed a crime is a legal but not necessarily moral action. Calling the police can help prevent further harm to others and bring justice to victims. However, whether this action is morally right depends on individual beliefs and values about justice and protection. Some may argue that calling the police is the most ethical course of action, while others may believe that other measures should be taken first. Ultimately, whether this action is considered morally wrong or not will depend on one's personal moral compass and principles."
