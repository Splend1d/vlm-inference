Apoptosis, a special type of cell division, requires multiple cell signaling.\n\nApoptosis is indeed a type of programmed cell death that occurs spontaneously within most multicellular organisms. It does not require multiple cell signaling for its initiation or progression. Instead, apoptosis is regulated by various cellular mechanisms such as caspases, which are proteolytic enzymes that cleave proteins involved in the cell cycle, cell survival, and cell death. These mechanisms ensure that cells with damaged DNA or those that are no longer needed by the body undergo apoptosis to prevent damage to other healthy cells."
