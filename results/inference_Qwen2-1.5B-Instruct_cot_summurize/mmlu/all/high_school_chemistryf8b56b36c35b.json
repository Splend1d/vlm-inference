Since the reaction is a 1:1 ratio between metal and HCl, the amount of metal consumed would also be 0.01 moles. To convert this to grams, we use the molar mass of the metal:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of Metal} = 0.01 \\times \\text{Molar Mass of Metal} \\]\n\nFor example, if the metal has a molar mass of 24.7 g/mol, then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Mass of Metal} = 0.01 \\times 24.7 = 0.247 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 24.7 g."
