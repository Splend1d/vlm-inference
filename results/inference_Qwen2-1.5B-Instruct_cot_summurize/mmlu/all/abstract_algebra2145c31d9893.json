                    "text": "Statement 1 is false. The set of integers from 1 to \\(n-1\\) under multiplication modulo \\(n\\) does not form a group because it violates the closure property for all elements except \\(1\\). Specifically, multiplying any two elements in this set will result in an element outside the set, which contradicts the definition of a group. Therefore, statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2 is true. This statement says that there exists an integer \\(x\\) such that when multiplied by \\(63\\) modulo \\(100\\), the result equals \\(1\\). Since \\(63 \\equiv -47 \\pmod{100}\\) and \\(100 = 4 \\times 25\\), we can write \\(63x \\equiv (-47)x \\pmod{100}\\). Multiplying both sides by \\(4\\) gives us \\(252x \\equiv -188x \\pmod{100}\\), or equivalently, \\(440x \\equiv 188x \\pmod{100}\\). Simplifying further, we get \\(252x \\equiv 188x \\pmod{100}\\), which implies \\(64x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{100}\\). Thus, there exists an integer \\(x\\) that satisfies the given condition, making statement 2 true. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
