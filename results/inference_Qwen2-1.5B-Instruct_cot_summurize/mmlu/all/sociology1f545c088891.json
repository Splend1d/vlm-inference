They amassed their wealth by owning companies and financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, which generated income through corporate profits and dividends. This type of accumulation of wealth allowed them to enter into the upper-class ranks of society, particularly among those who had previously been part of the middle or working classes."
