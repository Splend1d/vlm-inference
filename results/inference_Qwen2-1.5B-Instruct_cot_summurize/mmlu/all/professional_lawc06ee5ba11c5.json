Solicitation, attempted sale of narcotics, and false pretenses.\n\nSolicitation refers to offering someone something in exchange for their promise to do it, even if you don't actually perform the act yourself. In this case, the defendant solicited the partygoer to buy marijuana from him, knowing that he had no intention of selling it.\n\nAttempted sale of narcotics means that the defendant intended to sell the marijuana, but failed to complete the transaction due to some unforeseen circumstances (such as being caught by law enforcement). \n\nFalse pretenses occur when someone makes a false representation or statement with the intent to deceive, which leads to a breach of trust or confidence. In this case, the defendant made a false representation about the nature of the item he was selling, leading to a breach of trust or confidence.\n\nTherefore, all three charges apply: solicitation, attempted sale of narcotics, and false pretenses."
