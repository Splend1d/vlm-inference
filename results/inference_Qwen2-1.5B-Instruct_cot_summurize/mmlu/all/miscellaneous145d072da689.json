Skeleton keys are typically used for historical or decorative purposes and do not have any special locking mechanism that makes them more effective than other types of keys. Additionally, they may be difficult to find and can be quite expensive.\n\nWhile some skeletons keys may be made from bone, this is not a requirement for their use as a key. Many modern keys are also made from bone, although it is less commonly used today.\n\nIt is possible that some skeletons keys may hang in a closet, but this is not a characteristic of all skeletons keys."
