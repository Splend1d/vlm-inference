Two days after the soybean contract was made, the buyer and the seller entered into another contract under which the buyer agreed to purchase 10,000 bushels of wheat from the seller at market price. Before the time for delivery of the soybeans, the seller notified the buyer that it would not deliver the wheat because the seller's wheat supplier had refused to extend additional credit to the seller and therefore the seller had no wheat available for the buyer. Which of the following statements best describes the effect of the seller's repudiation of the wheat contract on the buyer's rights under the soybean contract?\n\nA. It gives the buyer the right to demand assurances that the seller will perform the soybean contract.\nB. It gives the buyer the right to terminate the soybean contract, because of the doctrine of soybean contract, because of the doctrine of dependent covenants.\nC. It gives the buyer the right to terminate the soybean contract, because the buyer does not have to deal with a party that breaches a contract.\nD. It has no effect on the buyer's rights, because the two contracts are entirely separate.\n"

It gives the buyer the right to terminate the soybean contract, because of the doctrine of dependent covenants.\n\nIn the case of dependent covenants, one contract (the principal) requires performance by another contract (the guarantor). If the guarantor fails to fulfill its obligation, then the principal may rescind the contract or seek damages from the guarantor. In this scenario, the buyer's failure to receive the wheat from the seller due to the seller's breach of the wheat contract constitutes a breach of the dependent covenant in the soybean contract, giving rise to the buyer's right to terminate the soybean contract."
