This means that the velocity at any given point on the disk will be the same as it was at the center of the disk. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because the period of rotation depends only on the moment of inertia and not on the distance from the axis.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because the period of rotation does not depend on the distance from the axis but rather on the mass of the disk and the radius of the circle formed by the disk's edge.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: The period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk."
