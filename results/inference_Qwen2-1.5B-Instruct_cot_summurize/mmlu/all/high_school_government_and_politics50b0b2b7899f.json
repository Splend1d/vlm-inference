Due Process Clause\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, includes several provisions that were added during the Civil War era as part of the Reconstruction Amendments. One such provision is the Due Process Clause, which guarantees certain fundamental rights and protections against states or the federal government.\n\nFor example, under this clause, the Supreme Court has held that states must provide \"due process\" before depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. This means that governments cannot take away these important rights without following proper legal procedures, such as providing notice and an opportunity for a fair hearing. The Due Process Clause also extends the Bill of Rights to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, allowing the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution's other provisions (such as the Fifth and Sixth Amendments) in light of the Due Process Clause.\n\nSo when the Supreme Court uses the Due Process Clause to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state law, it means that the Constitution's protections are not just limited to the federal government but also extend to the states, even if those states have adopted different laws or interpretations of their own constitutions."
