The search property refers to how customers find information about a product or service before making a decision, such as by reading reviews, watching videos, or searching online. The experience property refers to how customers have an actual interaction with a product or service, such as by trying it out or using it for a period of time. Finally, the credence property refers to how customers believe in the quality of a product or service based on their own experiences or beliefs.\n\nTherefore, these three properties are the most relevant when discussing the evaluation and selection of market offerings."
