In scenario 1, the main character did something that goes against the societal norm of not taking someone else's property without permission, especially when it comes to candy that was purchased by the parent. In scenario 2, the main character is doing something good by helping others and contributing to society financially. However, both actions have consequences and could be seen as morally ambiguous if they go against one's personal values or beliefs."
