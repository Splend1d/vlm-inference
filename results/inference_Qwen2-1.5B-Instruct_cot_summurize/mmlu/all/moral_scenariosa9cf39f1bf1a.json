It goes against the principle of respecting others' property and autonomy.\n\nScenario 2 involves not releasing a potentially harmful substance that could cause harm if released. This action is justified because it is based on a belief or understanding that certain actions are harmful or dangerous, even if they have no immediate effect on the person being harmed. It also respects the autonomy of the individual who may be affected by the release of the substance."
