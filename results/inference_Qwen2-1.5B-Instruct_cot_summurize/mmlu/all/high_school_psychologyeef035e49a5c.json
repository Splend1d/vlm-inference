These effects can manifest as lack of coordination or slowness, making it difficult to perform tasks or maintain balance and posture. Participants who have experienced sleep deprivation during the first two nights may report feeling more alert and awake than usual after the third night, but they should still be cautious when engaging in activities that require attention or coordination."
