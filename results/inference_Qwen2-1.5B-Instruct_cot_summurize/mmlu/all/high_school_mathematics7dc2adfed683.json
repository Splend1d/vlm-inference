According to the problem, Grady rides \\(60\\%\\) faster than Noah, so we can write:\n\n\\[G = S + 0.6S = 1.6S\\]\n\nWe're also told that Grady rides \\(12\\) more miles than Noah in two hours. Since distance is equal to speed times time, if Grady rides for twice as long as Noah, he would cover \\(2 \\times S\\) miles. So, we have:\n\n\\[2 \\times S = G = 1.6S + 12\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(G\\) from our first equation into this second equation gives us:\n\n\\[2 \\times S = 1.6S + 12\\]\n\nSolving for \\(S\\), we subtract \\(1.6S\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[2S - 1.6S = 12\\]\n\\[0.4S = 12\\]\n\nDividing by \\(0.4\\), we find Noah's speed (\\(S\\)):\n\n\\[S = \\frac{12}{0.4} = 30 \\text{ miles per hour}\\]\n\nTherefore, Noah rides at a speed of \\(30\\) miles per hour.\n\nThe correct answer is B. 20."
