Berkeley was an 18th-century British philosopher who argued that heat and cold are not physical objects, but rather sensations that exist solely in the mind of the observer. He believed that the sensation of heat or cold arises when we experience a change in temperature, such as when we touch something hot or cold. According to Berkeley, this sensation does not correspond to any external object or substance. Instead, it corresponds to the subjective experience of the mind. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
