However, this is not necessarily an immediate consequence of the given premises because it does not follow directly from the other two premises.\n\nOption B: U \u2228 W - This proposition states that either U or W must be true. It is not necessarily an immediate consequence of the given premises because it only guarantees one of the premises being true, but not both.\n\nOption C: ~W - This proposition states that W is false. It is an immediate consequence of the given premises because it follows directly from the second premise and the third premise.\n\nOption D: ~(X \u2261 ~Y) - This proposition states that X is not equivalent to ~Y. It is not necessarily an immediate consequence of the given premises because it does not guarantee any of the premises being true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option C. ~W."
