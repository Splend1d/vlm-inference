Eliminates Statistical Concerns About Ipsative Measurement The forced-choice distribution of rated attributes in performance appraisal eliminates statistical concerns about Ipsative measurement by providing employees with a clear choice between two alternatives for each attribute being rated. This allows for more objective evaluation of an employee's performance, as both positive and negative feedback can be given without fear of bias or inconsistency in the rating process. Additionally, this method reduces the likelihood of subjective judgments and increases the accuracy and validity of performance appraisals."
