Thus, the remaining activity at any point in time is essentially equal to the initial activity if the time goes to infinity.\n\nTherefore, after 24 hours (which is approximately 120 hours or more than one year), the amount of radioactivity would be very close to \\( A_0 \\). Since we're dealing with a small number like 150 mCi, it's reasonable to assume that the activity remains relatively low even after a long period. \n\nHowever, without knowing the exact decay constant (\\( \\lambda \\)), we cannot provide an exact numerical value for the remaining activity. The closest option based on the information provided is D. 9.4 mCi. This assumes that the activity continues to decrease exponentially over time, which is consistent with our understanding of radioactive decay behavior."
