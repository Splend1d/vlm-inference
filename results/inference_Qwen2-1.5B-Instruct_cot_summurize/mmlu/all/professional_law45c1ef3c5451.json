In order to sell lottery tickets directly to the public, the agency established outlets throughout the country, including in a particular state. The state levies a general tax on the gross receipts from all gaming operations within the state. The state seeks to tax the agency on the sales of lottery tickets from its outlets within the state. Must the agency pay the state gross receipts tax?\n\nA. No, because a federal agency may not pay any monies to a state without explicit federal statutory authorization to do so.\nB. No, because a state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.\nC. Yes, because it is a generally applicable tax that does not discriminate against the agency.\nD. Yes, because the federal government is not exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities.\n"

No, because a state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.\n\nUnder the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. This means that powers that are not explicitly granted to the federal government by the Constitution cannot be delegated to it by Congress. In this case, the power to tax the agency on the sales of lottery tickets from its outlets within the state is not explicitly granted to the federal government by the Constitution.\n\nFurthermore, the Tenth Amendment also provides that the taxing power is reserved to the states or the people. Therefore, a state has the authority to tax entities like the federal government or its own agencies, but only if such taxation is specifically authorized by the Constitution or other laws.\n\nIn conclusion, while a state may levy taxes on private businesses, it cannot tax a federal agency directly unless there is explicit constitutional authorization for the federal government to be taxed."
