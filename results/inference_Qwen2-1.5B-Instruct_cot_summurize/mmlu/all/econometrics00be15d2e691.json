This means that if one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase at a similar rate. Therefore, both variables should be stationary in order for them to be cointegrated.\n2. Linear Combinations: In order for two variables to be cointegrated, they must satisfy the cointegrating equation, which describes their long-term equilibrium relationship. A linear combination of two stationary variables can also be stationary.\n3. Short-Run Relationship: While the cointegrating equation describes the long-term relationship between two variables, it does not necessarily describe their short-run relationship. It's possible that the cointegrating equation may not hold when the variables are perturbed by shocks or random noise.\n4. Residuals: When regressing one variable on another, the residuals will typically be non-stationary because they contain information about the disturbance process. However, if the cointegrating equation holds, then the residuals will be stationary, as they represent the error terms from the long-run relationship.\n\nTherefore, all four statements are true."
