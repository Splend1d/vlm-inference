When making an international telephone call from within the United States, you need to dial \"1\" followed by the country code for the destination country and then your local area code. For example, if you want to call Canada, you would dial \"1\" + \"1\" (Canada's country code) + your local area code. The country code for Canada is 1. So, the complete number to dial in this case would be \"111\". It's important to note that there may be additional digits required depending on the specific country or carrier you're calling."
