All of them import significant amounts of raw materials and energy from other countries.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the level of self-sufficiency can vary depending on how much a country imports versus what they produce domestically. For example, some countries like Norway have relatively high levels of self-sufficiency due to their abundant oil reserves.\n\nIn general, however, all of these countries rely heavily on imported goods and services, especially when it comes to energy sources such as oil, gas, and electricity."
