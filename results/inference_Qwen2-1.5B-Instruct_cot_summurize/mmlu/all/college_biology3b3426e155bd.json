Double fertilization\n\nDouble fertilization is a characteristic unique to angiosperms, which includes flowers, seeds, and other plants that produce fruit and seeds through the process of pollination by animals or wind. In contrast, wind-borne pollen and sporophyte life cycles are characteristics of gymnosperms, while alteration of generations and double fertilization are both common in all plant species."
