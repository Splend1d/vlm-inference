In fact, they have already collided several times in the past, as evidenced by the presence of debris left behind from the impact. However, this does not necessarily mean that they will always remain in synchronous orbit around each other in the future. It is possible for them to eventually drift apart or merge into a larger object if certain conditions are met."
