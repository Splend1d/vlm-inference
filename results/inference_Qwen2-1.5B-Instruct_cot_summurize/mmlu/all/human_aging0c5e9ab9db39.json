Have learned to cope with loss\n\nAs older adults age, they often experience more life changes and losses, such as retirement, the death of loved ones, or physical decline. These experiences can lead to feelings of sadness, grief, and isolation, which are common symptoms of depression. Older adults have also likely developed coping mechanisms and strategies for dealing with these challenges, which may help them manage their emotions and reduce the severity of their depression. Additionally, older adults may be more aware of the societal norms surrounding mental health and may feel more comfortable seeking support from healthcare providers and others in their community. Therefore, older adults may show less major depression compared to younger adults due to their ability to adapt to life's changes and cope with their emotions effectively."
