This effect is thought to be due to the way our brains organize information.\n\nIn this case, Dan read a list of 30 vocabulary words and was typical and showed the serial position effect. So, we can assume that he remembered the words in some order based on his ability to recall them.\n\nSince the words were listed in alphabetical order (assuming it's not just a random sequence), if Dan had remembered all the words in order, then he would have been able to recall them easily. However, since he only remembered two words two days later, it's likely that he did not remember them in alphabetical order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. distributed throughout the list."
