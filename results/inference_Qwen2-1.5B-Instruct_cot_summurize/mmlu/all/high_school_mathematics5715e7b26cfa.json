The standard sine function \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) takes any real number as input and returns a value between -1 and 1. When you add or subtract multiples of 2\u03c0 from this angle, the resulting angle will be in the same period but shifted by \u03c0 units. For example:\n\n- Adding 2\u03c0 gives us an angle that is the same as the original angle plus \u03c0.\n- Subtracting 2\u03c0 gives us an angle that is the same as the original angle minus \u03c0.\n- Multiplying by 2\u03c0 gives us an angle that is the same as the original angle multiplied by \u03c0.\n\nNow, if we have a sine function like \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\), then when we shift it by \u03c0 (or any multiple of \u03c0), the range of the function also shifts by the same amount. This means that the maximum value of the function will occur at \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi\\) for some integer \\(n\\), where \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) is the reference angle. Since the sine function ranges from -1 to 1, the maximum value of the function occurs at \\(y = 1\\).\n\nHowever, since we are shifting the entire graph up by 5 units, the maximum value of our function becomes \\(5 + 1 = 6\\). \n\nFor the minimum value, we can observe that adding 2\u03c0 to a positive angle does not change its magnitude, but it does make the sine value negative. Therefore, when we subtract 2\u03c0 from a positive angle, the sine value becomes positive again. Thus, the minimum value of the function is still -1 because we're subtracting 2\u03c0 from a positive angle.\n\nTherefore, the range of the function \\(y = 5 + 3 \\sin(\\pi - x)\\) is \\(y \\in [-1, 6]\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 0 \u2264 y \u2264 6."
