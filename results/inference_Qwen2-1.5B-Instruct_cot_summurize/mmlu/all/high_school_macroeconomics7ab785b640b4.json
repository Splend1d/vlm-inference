The natural rate of unemployment refers to the level of unemployment that occurs when the economy has reached its potential output, meaning it cannot produce more goods and services without causing inflation. At this point, the economy is operating efficiently and effectively, with no excess capacity or wasted resources.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct."
