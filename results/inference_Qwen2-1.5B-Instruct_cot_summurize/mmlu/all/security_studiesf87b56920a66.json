If a threat posed by one group to another is military - particularly when linked to the defence of the historic homeland - armed response is required. At the intra-state level, many societal groups have no such means of armed protection and are compelled to employ non-military counter-measures.\nB. Intra-state collectives faced with a political or military threat to their identity will form their own militia or defensive force as a means of protection. This results in the establishment of quasi-states which may undermine the territorial integrity of the nation.\nC. Being aligned with the state, society has immediate and unequivocal access to the use of state forces (in the form of military retaliation) if there is a threat to societal security.\nD. Societal groups do not face military threats; being constituted by identity and social cohesion, military forces are not engaged against societal groups in any meaningful way.\n"

Being aligned with the state, society has immediate and unequivocal access to the use of state forces (in the form of military retaliation) if there is a threat to societal security.\n\nThis is because societal identity often goes hand-in-hand with national identity, and a threat to societal security could potentially lead to a threat to national security. In such cases, the state would have an obligation to protect its citizens, including those within the societal community. The use of state forces would then be justified under international law and domestic laws that protect human rights and ensure the safety of individuals. \n\nIt's important to note that this does not mean that societal identity can never be defended militarily, but rather that the specific circumstances surrounding the threat and the societal community's relationship to the state would determine whether or not armed response is appropriate."
