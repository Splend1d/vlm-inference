First, convert both numbers to have the same decimal point:\n   - Convert \\(16.1\\) into a decimal: \\(16.1 = 16 + 0.1 = 16.1\\)\n   - Convert \\(0.14\\) into a decimal: \\(0.14 = 0 + 0.04 = 0.14\\)\n\n2. Divide \\(16.1\\) by \\(0.14\\):\n   - The first digit of \\(16.1\\) is \\(1\\), so we multiply \\(0.14\\) by \\(1\\): \\(0.14 \\times 1 = 0.14\\)\n   - We then add this result to \\(16.1\\), which gives us \\(16.1 + 0.14 = 16.24\\)\n   - Now, we repeat these steps with \\(16.24\\) and \\(0.14\\), adding the next digits as we go.\n   \n3. Continue this process until you get a single-digit number (which will be the quotient).\n\nLet's do the actual division now:\n\n- \\(16.24 \\div 0.14 = 110.85714...\\)\n\nThis means that after four decimal places, the quotient becomes 110.85714... which doesn't simplify further without more significant figures.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is **D. 115**."
