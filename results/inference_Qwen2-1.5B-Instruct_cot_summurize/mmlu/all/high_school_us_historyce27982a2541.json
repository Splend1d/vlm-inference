The economic necessity which has forced women out of the home and into the world of business has completely annihilated the old idea that a woman should eat only in the privacy of her household or in the homes of her friends, has created the absolutely new social phenomenon of women eating in public, unescorted by men, by the tens of thousands, and has given rise to a wholly new phase of the restaurant business.\"\n\u2014The New York Times, October 15, 1905\nWhich of the following groups would have most likely supported the scenario described in this passage?\n\nA. Ku Klux Klan.\nB. American Temperance Union.\nC. National Woman Suffrage Association.\nD. Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\n"

This shift was influenced by economic factors such as increased demand for labor and the need for women to earn money outside the home.\n\nGiven these historical events, it is more likely that supporters of the passage would be from the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), which fought for women's suffrage and advocated for equal rights for women during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The NWSA aimed to challenge traditional gender roles and promote women's independence and economic self-sufficiency.\n\nTherefore, option C, National Woman Suffrage Association, would have been the most likely group to support the scenario described in the passage."
