                    "text": "The correct answer is D: Transition metals will lose their outermost s-block electrons when forming bonds.\n\nTransition metals, also known as\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e (gu\u00f2zh\u00e0o j\u00ecl\u00f9), are a group of 18 elements in the periodic table that lie between the alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals. They exhibit a variety of properties due to their different electronic configurations.\n\nWhen a transition metal forms a bond, it loses its outermost s-orbital electron(s) and gains an electron from the atom it is bonding with. This results in a higher number of valence electrons and a lower energy level, which makes it more stable. The resulting ion has a positive charge, making it an electropositive element.\n\nThis process of losing electrons is called valence electron transfer (VET). It allows for the formation of compounds with a wide range of chemical and physical properties, including color, magnetic properties, and conductivity.\n\nTherefore, option D is the best explanation for why most transition metals share a common oxidation state of +2."
