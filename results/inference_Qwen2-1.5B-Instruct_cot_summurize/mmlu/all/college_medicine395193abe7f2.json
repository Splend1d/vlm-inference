Mismatch repair mechanism.\n\nMismatch repair (MMR) is a process that allows cells to correct errors in DNA replication before they can lead to mutations. When a mismatch is detected between two strands of DNA during replication, MMR proteins recognize the error and help repair it by replacing the incorrect base with the correct one.\n\nIn this scenario, if a mistake is noted and the incorrect base is removed shortly after the RNA primer is removed, it suggests that there has been a mismatch between the two strands of DNA during replication. The MMR machinery would then recognize this mismatch and help correct it by replacing the incorrect base with the correct one.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Mismatch repair mechanism."
