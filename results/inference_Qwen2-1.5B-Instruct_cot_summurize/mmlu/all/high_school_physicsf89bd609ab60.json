The image gets smaller at first and then bigger in size.\n\nWhen you move the convex lens from a distance of 0.3 m above the coin to a distance of 0.1 m above the coin, the object (the coin) moves closer to the lens. This causes the image to become larger due to the principle of magnification.\n\nAs you continue to move the lens further away from the coin, the object will start moving faster towards the lens, causing the image to become smaller because the image is now further away from the lens. However, as the object approaches the focal point (where the image is formed), the image will again start getting larger due to the principle of magnification.\n\nSo, the image starts decreasing in size initially but then starts increasing in size as it moves further away from the lens."
