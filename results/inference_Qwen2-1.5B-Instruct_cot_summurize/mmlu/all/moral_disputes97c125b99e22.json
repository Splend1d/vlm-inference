This type of reasoning aligns with the concept of relative moral standing, which refers to the idea that some actions are more deserving of moral consideration than others based on factors such as the magnitude of harm caused or the degree of suffering experienced.\n\nTherefore, option C (relative moral standing) is the correct answer."
