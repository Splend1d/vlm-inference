The findings generated by focus groups can be used to develop surveys and other quantitative tools, but they do not necessarily generalize to the entire population. Focus groups are typically used to gather specific information from a small group of people, rather than to make broad generalizations. Additionally, focus groups may not always produce reliable or valid results due to issues such as selection bias or interviewer effects."
