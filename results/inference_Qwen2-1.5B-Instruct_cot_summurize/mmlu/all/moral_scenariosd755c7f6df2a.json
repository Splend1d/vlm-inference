Running over a carpet with a lawnmower can cause significant damage and may even be illegal depending on the location. \n\nScenario 2 involves intentionally causing harm to oneself, but this action is generally considered less harmful than running over property. Additionally, testing one's own body for infection is not inherently wrong, but again, this depends on the context and circumstances surrounding the situation."
