The ALU also includes a direct memory access function that allows it to directly read and write to the memory locations on the CPU's side.\n\nThe ALE (Address Line Enable) signal is a control line that enables or disables the use of the address bus for data transfer. When the ALE signal is set high, it enables the address bus to be used as a low-order address bus, which means that only the least significant bits of the address are transferred to the memory location being accessed. This is useful when accessing memory with a fixed offset, such as accessing a particular page in a hard disk drive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. To achieve all the functions listed above"
