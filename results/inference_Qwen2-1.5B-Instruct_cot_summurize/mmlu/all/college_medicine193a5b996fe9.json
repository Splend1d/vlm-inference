The body relies more heavily on fat for energy when carbohydrate levels are low, which can lead to fatigue and reduced performance. However, it's important to note that this is only one factor that can affect exercise performance and there are many other factors at play. Additionally, research has shown that moderate carbohydrate intake before and during exercise can improve performance and recovery."
