The duration of sensory memory can vary widely, but it typically lasts between 2 and 3 seconds for visual and auditory stimuli, and up to 4 seconds for tactile stimuli. However, the duration of sensory memory can be influenced by factors such as the complexity of the information being processed and the amount of attention given to the stimulus."
