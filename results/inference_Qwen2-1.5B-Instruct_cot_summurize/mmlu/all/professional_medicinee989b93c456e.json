She also reports shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down. She has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. She has not had chest pain. Her pulse is 96/min and regular, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is 15 cm H2O. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm and a soft S3. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n\nA. Measurement of serum troponin I concentration\nB. ECG\nC. Exercise stress test\nD. Echocardiography\n"

Echocardiography\n\nEchocardiography is the gold standard for diagnosing heart disease in this patient, as it can provide detailed images of the heart's structure and function, including assessing the size and shape of the left ventricle, which is affected by heart failure. It can also detect abnormalities such as mitral regurgitation or valvular stenosis that may be contributing to the symptoms described. The other options (measurement of serum troponin I concentration, ECG, and exercise stress test) may help rule out certain conditions but do not directly diagnose heart failure."
