According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, intentionally driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is considered morally wrong and illegal.

On the other hand, laughing at someone's death during a funeral is generally not considered morally wrong, as it can be seen as an expression of grief rather than mocking or insensitive behavior."
