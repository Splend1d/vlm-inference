Vegetarianism has been linked to a lower risk of respiratory diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis, due to the consumption of plant-based foods that contain fewer allergens than animal proteins. However, this does not necessarily mean that vegetarians are at a lower risk for other types of diseases. It's important to note that there may be other factors contributing to the incidence of certain diseases in vegetarians, such as their diet or lifestyle habits."
