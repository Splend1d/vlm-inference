'De facto organs' are the persons, which are, in fact, acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct attributable to the State.\n\nUnder the law of international responsibility, 'de facto organs' are defined as those individuals who are empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental authority but do so in practice and not according to legal procedures established by the State. These individuals may include government officials, military personnel, and other state actors who have taken up roles outside their designated responsibilities and are performing actions that are contrary to the laws and norms of the State they represent. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
