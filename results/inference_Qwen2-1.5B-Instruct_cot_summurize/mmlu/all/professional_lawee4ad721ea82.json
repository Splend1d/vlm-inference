The informant gave the police explicit details about the extortion scheme: the defendant would be calling the victim from a public phone booth on a particular street corner on a certain date and time to make the extortionist demand. Without notif'ing the telephone company or seeking a warrant, the police installed an eavesdropping device on the public phone. At the time on the date specified by the informant, the defendant phoned the victim from the telephone booth and said, \"You better pay me $5,000 by next week or I'll kill you and your family. \" The defendant provided additional details about how and where to make the payoff. Based on the taped conversation, the police arrested the defendant and charged him with extortion. Prior to trial, the defendant's attorney moves to exclude the taped conversation from evidence. The defense motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.\nB. granted, because the police did not obtain prior approval of the telephone company before installing the eavesdropping device.\nC. denied, because the defendant did not have reasonable expectation of privacy.\nD. denied, because the police had probable cause based on the information supplied by the informant.\n"

In this case, the informant provided specific details about the defendant's extortion scheme, including the time and place of the call, which was enough for the police to have probable cause to install the eavesdropping device without obtaining a warrant. Therefore, the defendant's attorney cannot exclude the taped conversation from evidence."
