Option B is also possible if we assume that Neandertals were not present in Africa at the time of their migration out of Africa. \n\nOption C is unlikely as Neandertals would have been able to interbreed with anatomically modern humans due to their shared ancestor, Homo erectus.\n\nOption D is also unlikely as it contradicts the known facts about human evolution."
