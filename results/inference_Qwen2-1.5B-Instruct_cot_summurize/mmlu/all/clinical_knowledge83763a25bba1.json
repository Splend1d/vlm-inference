It causes pain in the ear, face, and neck, and may also result in hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).\n- A lack of ability to close the eyelid on the paralysed side could indicate a lower motor neuron lesion, but it is not specific enough to definitively diagnose this condition.\n- In Bell's palsy, the sense of taste is usually not affected. However, some patients may experience a temporary taste sensation or difficulty with taste."
