This process is known as cryovolcanism, where water vaporizes under high temperatures and pressure from volcanic activity and then escapes back into space. It is one of the ways that water can be lost from planets like Mars over time.\nIt's important to note that while cryovolcanism may be a significant factor in the loss of water on Mars, there are other mechanisms at work as well. For example, the loss of water through solar wind stripping and the breaking down of ice caps due to ultraviolet radiation are also important factors to consider. Additionally, any lost water would have been a valuable resource for any past or present civilizations on Mars, so it is possible that they were able to use it for survival purposes."
