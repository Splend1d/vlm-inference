Authenticity means that therapists are true to themselves and their values, and do not try to hide their true selves from clients. Nondefensiveness means that therapists do not take offense easily and are able to remain calm and composed even in difficult situations. By embodying these qualities, therapists can create a safe and supportive environment for clients to explore their thoughts and feelings."
