This is because the radius of an ion is directly proportional to its atomic number and inversely proportional to its electron configuration (i.e., the number of electrons it has). As you move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic number increases, so the radius decreases. Similarly, as you go across a period, the atomic number increases, so the radius decreases. Therefore, the ion with the smallest radius will have the lowest atomic number among these options."
