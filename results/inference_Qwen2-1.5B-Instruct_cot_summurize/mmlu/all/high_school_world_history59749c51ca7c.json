This boundary or line shall be drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being calculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be considered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be no greater than abovesaid. And all lands, both islands and mainlands, found and discovered already, or to be found and discovered hereafter, by the said King of Portugal and by his vessels on this side of the said line and bound determined as above, toward the east, in either north or south latitude, on the eastern side of the said bound provided the said bound is not crossed, shall belong to, and remain in the possession of, and pertain forever to, the said King of Portugal and his successors.

                    "text": "The Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) established a boundary dividing the newly discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal. Therefore, the best context for the treaty is:\n\nA. European maritime exploration\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas reflects the early stages of European exploration, particularly the search for new trade routes and territories to conquer and exploit. It highlights the rivalry between Spain and Portugal, which were the dominant maritime powers during the Age of Discovery. The treaty's provisions, such as the delineation of boundaries and the division of land between the two nations, reflect the geopolitical interests of these explorers.\n\nOption B, European engagement in the African slave trade, is tangentially related but does not provide the direct historical context needed for understanding the treaty. Option C, The Scientific Revolution, is also unrelated because the treaty pertains to physical geography rather than scientific advancements. Option D, The Protestant Reformation, while relevant to European history, does not address the specific legal aspects of the Treaty of Tordesillas or its impact on global relations."
