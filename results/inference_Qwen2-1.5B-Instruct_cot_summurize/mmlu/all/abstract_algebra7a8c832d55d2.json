For example, the free abelian group of rank 2 has only two generators and no non-trivial relations, but it cannot generate all possible groups of higher ranks due to the fact that each element must have an inverse and the group must be closed under addition.\n\nStatement 2 is also false. While a finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number (a topological invariant) equals the number of elements in some generating set, this does not necessarily mean that the group is free abelian as a structure. The Betti numbers can be calculated using cohomology theory, but they do not directly determine whether or not a given group is free abelian as a group."
