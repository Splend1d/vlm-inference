The document states that \"we ordain that the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion shall be restored and reestablished in all places and localities of this our kingdom and countries subject to our sway,\" which suggests that Henry IV sought to restore Catholicism to France after years of persecution under the Huguenots (Protestants). The passage also mentions allowing the Reformed faith (\"the said religion called Reformed\") to practice freely, indicating that Henry IV was willing to tolerate Protestantism as long as they were not forced to adhere to Catholic practices. Therefore, it can be inferred that Henry IV was a Protestant ruler who sought to establish a more tolerant policy towards his subjects' religious beliefs."
