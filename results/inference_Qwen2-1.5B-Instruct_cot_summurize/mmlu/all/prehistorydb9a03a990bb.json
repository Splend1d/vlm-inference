All the above\n\nGround-penetrating radar (GPR), proton magnetometers, and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) are all types of remote-sensing devices that can be used to investigate the subsurface at archaeological sites. GPR uses electromagnetic waves to map the underground layers, while proton magnetometers use magnetic fields to detect metal objects. ERT measures electrical resistance in soil or rock, which can provide information about its composition and history."
