In fact, it may even lead to a surplus if the additional spending does not match the increased demand.\nOn the other hand, when the economy is not operating at full employment, there is excess capacity in the labor market, meaning that workers are available but not being employed. If the government increases its spending without also increasing taxes, this can help to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. However, if the government spends more than what is needed to fill all the jobs created, this can lead to inflation as the extra money circulates through the economy and causes prices to rise.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: An increase in government spending with no change in taxes."
