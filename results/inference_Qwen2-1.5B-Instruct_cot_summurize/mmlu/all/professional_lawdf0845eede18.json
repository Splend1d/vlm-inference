She approached her friend and told him she would give him $50 to beat up her ex-boyfriend. The friend agreed but said he would wait until the ex-boyfriend left the bar. While the defendant was eavesdropping on her ex-boyfriend in the hopes he would say something nice about her, she overheard him having a conversation on his cellphone. During the course of that conversation, the defendant realized that her ex-boyfriend was now a federal agent. Afraid she might be prosecuted for a federal offense, the defendant told her friend not to bother with the planned attack. If the defendant is subsequently charged with the statutory offense of conspiring to commit an assault on a federal officer, the defendant will probably be\n\nA. convicted, because her knowledge that her exboyfriend was a federal agent is not a material element of the crime.\nB. convicted, because withdrawal is never recognized as an affirmative defense to conspiracy.\nC. acquitted, because she was unaware that her ex-boyfriend was now a federal agent.\nD. acquitted, because her abandonment of the plan aborted the conspiratorial objective.\n"

The defendant conspired with another person or persons to commit an assault on a federal officer;\n2. The defendant intended to commit the assault; and\n3. The defendant's conduct contributed to the commission of the assault.\n\nHowever, if the defendant withdraws from the conspiracy before the assault can be committed, the prosecution cannot prove that the defendant actually intended to commit the assault. Therefore, the defendant cannot be convicted of conspiracy to commit an assault on a federal officer based solely on her withdrawal from the conspiracy.\n\nIt is important to note that the defendant's knowledge that her ex-boyfriend was a federal agent is not a material element of the crime, so it does not affect whether she can be convicted of conspiracy to commit an assault on a federal officer. However, her decision to abandon the conspiracy and withdraw from the assault attempt may be relevant in determining the defendant's state of mind at the time of the attempted assault."
