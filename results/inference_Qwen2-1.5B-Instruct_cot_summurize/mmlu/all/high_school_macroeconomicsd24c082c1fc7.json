Lower spending and higher taxes.\n\nFiscal and monetary policies can be combined to fight a recessionary gap by adjusting both spending and taxation. Lowering spending and increasing taxes will reduce aggregate demand, which is one of the key factors in a recession. This will help to slow down economic growth and reduce inflationary pressures.\n\nMonetary policy can also be used to combat recessions by lowering interest rates. This will make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, encouraging investment and consumption. By reducing interest rates, the central bank can stimulate economic activity and create a virtuous cycle of increased spending and investment.\n\nTo avoid large budget deficits, it is important that these changes do not result in significant increases in the national debt. Therefore, lower spending and higher taxes should be balanced with appropriate cuts in government programs and services, as well as efforts to increase revenue through new sources such as payroll taxes or corporate taxes.\n\nIn summary, combining lower spending and higher taxes with monetary policy (lowering interest rates) can help to combat recessions by slowing economic growth and creating a virtuous cycle of increased spending and investment. However, careful attention must be paid to prevent large budget deficits from resulting from these measures."
