However, it is true that the former Soviet Union was a communist society where the government controlled all aspects of life, including economic, social, and cultural activities.\n\nIn a communist society, the government often controls resources such as land, factories, and transportation systems, which can lead to centralized control over the economy and lack of competition. This can make it difficult for businesses to compete against the state-owned enterprises, leading to inefficiencies and low productivity.\n\nFurthermore, in a communist society, there may be a lack of freedom of speech, press, and assembly, which can limit the ability of individuals to express their opinions and engage in political dissent. This can create a culture of fear and suspicion, where people are afraid to speak out against the government or criticize its policies.\n\nOverall, while it is possible that a communist society may have limitations on advanced industrial technology due to its central planning approach, this does not necessarily mean that it is incompatible with these technologies. The extent to which a communist society can benefit from advanced industrial technology depends on many factors, including the degree of freedom and autonomy available to citizens, the level of investment in infrastructure and technology, and the overall quality of education and training provided by the government."
