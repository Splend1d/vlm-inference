However, it is not necessarily true that one hemisphere cannot perform all cognitive functions equally well. \n\nWhile it is possible that some individuals with unilateral damage may have difficulty with specific tasks related to their dominant hemisphere, others may still be able to perform these tasks effectively. For example, someone who has had bilateral damage to the left hemisphere may still be able to read and understand written language, but may struggle with tasks that require visual-spatial skills or language processing.\n\nTherefore, without more information about the specific individual's abilities and limitations, it would be premature to say that they would have an inability to perform any particular task due to unilateral damage. The most accurate assessment would involve consulting with a neurologist or other healthcare professional to evaluate the extent and nature of the damage and its impact on cognitive function."
