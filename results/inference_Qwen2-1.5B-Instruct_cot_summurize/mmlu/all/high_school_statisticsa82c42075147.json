While every element in a population has an equal chance of being selected, this does not guarantee that each element will be included in the sample with an equal probability. For example, if the population consists of only 10 elements and we select 5 of them as part of our sample, some of those elements may have been more likely to be chosen than others due to their proximity to the beginning or end of the population. Therefore, option D is not always true for simple random samples."
