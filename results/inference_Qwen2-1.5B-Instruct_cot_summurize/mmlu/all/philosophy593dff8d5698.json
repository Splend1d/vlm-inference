He suggests that reason can be used to justify certain actions, but ultimately it is the desire or emotion behind those actions that drives us to act. Additionally, Hume believed that reason was not the only factor in determining morality, as there were other factors such as habit and tradition that could influence our behavior. Therefore, he argued that reason should be seen as one of many influences on our actions, rather than the sole source of moral decision-making."
