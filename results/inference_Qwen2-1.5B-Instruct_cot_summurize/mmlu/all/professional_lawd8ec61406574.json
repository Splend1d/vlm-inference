The company claimed that the policy had lapsed. At trial, the plaintiff admits that she failed to make a timely premium payment; however, she cites a policy provision that required the company to give her notice that it had not received the premium by a specified date and testifies that she never received such a notice. The company then calls its chief billing clerk, who is company then calls its chief billing clerk, who is prepared to testify that, because of the plaintiff's unusual name, the clerk remembers preparing the plaintiff's notice and placing it in the \"out\" box on his desk, and that an employee from the company's mailroom daily picks up all mail from office \"out\" boxes and places it in a U.S. mail deposit box. How should the court rule on the admissibility of the billing clerk's testimony?\n\nA. It is admissible only if the company produces corroborative evidence, such as a mailing checklist.\nB. It is admissible without more, because it is evidence of the routine practice of a business.\nC. It is inadmissible, because evidence of the mailroom employee's general practice does not prove the particular mailing.\nD. It is inadmissible, because the billing clerk lacks personal knowledge of the actual mailing. mailing.\n"

It is inadmissible, because evidence of the mailroom employee's general practice does not prove the particular mailing.\n\nIn this scenario, the billing clerk's testimony about how the notice was placed in the \"out\" box and picked up by the mailroom employee is hearsay evidence. Under Rule 803(6)(c), this type of hearsay is generally admissible to show the frequency or pattern of conduct in a business transaction. However, the admission of this evidence would require corroboration with other evidence that the billing clerk actually performed the act described in his testimony.\n\nFor example, the court could admit the testimony as evidence of the company's regular practices if there is additional evidence showing that the billing clerk did indeed place the notice in the \"out\" box and that the mailroom employee regularly handled mail at the company's discretion. In this case, the billing clerk's testimony alone would be insufficient to establish the particular mailing, and therefore it would be inadmissible under the hearsay exception.\n\nTherefore, the court should rule that the billing clerk's testimony is inadmissible unless the company produces corrobating evidence of the billing clerk's actions."
