The estimates will converge upon the true values as the sample size increases. \n\nAn estimator is said to be consistent if its expected value approaches the true parameter value as the sample size grows larger. In other words, as more data is collected, the estimate becomes closer to the true value of the parameter being estimated.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the statement \"On average, the estimated coefficient values will equal the true values\" does not necessarily imply consistency. It only implies that the estimator's mean or expected value converges towards the true value over time.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) estimator is unbiased, this does not guarantee that any other unbiased estimator will have a smaller variance. Variance refers to the spread of the estimator's values around the true parameter value, not the bias itself.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because while the coefficient estimates may get closer to their true values as the sample size increases, they do not necessarily become exactly equal. The estimator's mean or expected value still needs to approach the true parameter value over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: the estimates will converge upon the true values as the sample size increases."
