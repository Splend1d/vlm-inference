On arrival, she has shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Her pulse is 135/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 80/40 mm Hg. Breath sounds are decreased at the left lung base. An x-ray of the chest shows opacification of the left lower lung field with loss of the diaphragmatic shadow. Placement of a chest tube yields a small amount of air followed by greenish fluid. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. CT scan of the abdomen\nB. CT scan of the chest\nC. Thoracoscopy\nD. Laparotomy\n"

This can help determine if there is an underlying cause for the fluid accumulation, such as a lung abscess or a pericardial effusion. If the fluid contains pus, then further imaging studies may be needed to evaluate for pneumonia or other causes of inflammation in the lungs. It is important to note that thoracentesis should only be performed under general anesthesia to prevent aspiration of stomach contents into the pleural space."
