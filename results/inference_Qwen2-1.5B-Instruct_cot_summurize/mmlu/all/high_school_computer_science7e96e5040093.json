In Python, indexing starts from 0 and goes up to length - 1 for lists or tuples. However, when you try to access an index that is greater than the length of the list or tuple, it raises an IndexError.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. 1. This is because Python tries to access the value at index 2 (since it's 1), but since there is no element at that position, it returns 1 as the result."
