The resulting set inherits the operations from the original ring (addition and multiplication) by defining them component-wise on these equivalence classes. Since both addition and multiplication are associative and commutative in a ring, the operation in the quotient ring will also be associative and commutative.\n\nStatement 2: \"An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 is an element of N.\"\n\nThis statement is false because not every ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 must contain 1. For instance, consider the ring Z/4Z (the integers modulo 4) where the ideal {0} contains the identity element 0 but does not contain any other non-zero numbers since 0 + 4 = 0 mod 4. Therefore, the condition for an ideal to be equal to the whole ring cannot hold universally without additional conditions or constraints on the structure of the ring.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. False, False**."
