We know from the original question that if the student had the same z-score on the final exam as on the midterm, then \\( Y = 58 \\).\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ \\frac{Y - 52}{4} = 0 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( Y \\):\n\n\\[ Y - 52 = 0 \\]\n\\[ Y = 52 \\]\n\nTherefore, the student's final exam score was also 52 points. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **D. 127 points**."
