Some examples include:\n\n- Orthodox Judaism: The Jewish law (halakha) prohibits abortions except when the life of the mother is at risk.\n- Fundamentalist Protestantism: Many fundamentalist Protestant denominations view abortion as a sin and may consider it murder.\n- Eastern Orthodox Christianity: Although abortion is not explicitly condemned in the Church's teachings, some Eastern Orthodox Christians believe that it is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. All of the above."
