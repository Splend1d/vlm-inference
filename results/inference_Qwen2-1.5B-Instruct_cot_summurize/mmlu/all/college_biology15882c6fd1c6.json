The threshold potential\n\nThe ability of the brain to detect differences in stimulus intensity can be explained by the fact that the threshold potential, or the minimum amount of stimulation required for an action potential to occur, varies with the stimulus intensity. This means that as the stimulus intensity increases, the threshold potential decreases, allowing for finer and more precise detection of changes in stimuli."
