Rods are responsible for detecting movement and fine detail, while cones are responsible for color vision and high-contrast vision. While both types of cells play important roles in vision, they differ in their sensitivity to different wavelengths of light. Cones are most sensitive to blue and green light, while rods are most sensitive to red and yellow light. Rods also have a lower absolute threshold for light compared to cones, meaning that they can detect much weaker light levels than cones. This is why we see better at night or in dim lighting conditions when our eyes rely on rods rather than cones for vision."
