They can mimic the effects of natural steroids or inhibit their actions, depending on the specific compound used. However, they do not act as full steroid hormones themselves but rather act as ligands for androgen receptors. Therefore, they fall under the category of non-steroidal drugs that mimic the effects of natural steroids."
