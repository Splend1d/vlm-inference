She has a 2-year history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, leukocyte count is 5000/mm3 , and platelet count is 35,000/mm3 . A serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\n\nA. CT scan of the abdomen\nB. CT scan of the chest\nC. Bronchoscopy\nD. Bone marrow aspiration\n"

Bone marrow aspiration\n\nThe patient's symptoms of easy bruising suggest that she may have disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can be caused by cancer or other factors such as radiation therapy. Bone marrow aspiration can help identify any abnormal cells that could be contributing to DIC. The other options, such as a CT scan of the abdomen, chest, bronchoscopy, or bone marrow aspiration, would not provide specific information about the cause of her bleeding without further diagnostic testing."
