His pulse is 120/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Breath sounds are normal on the right and decreased on the left. Abdominal examination shows an entrance wound in the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line below the left costal margin. There is an exit wound laterally in the left axillary line at the 4th rib. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. CT scan of the chest\nB. Intubation and mechanical ventilation\nC. Peritoneal lavage\nD. Left tube thoracostomy\n"

This procedure involves inserting a needle into the abdominal cavity to remove fluids and potentially debris from the wound site. This can help reduce the risk of infection and promote healing. It is not appropriate to perform a CT scan of the chest or intubate and mechanically ventilate the patient, as these interventions may be unnecessary given the initial presentation of shock and other critical signs. A left tube thoracostomy may also be considered if necessary, but it is not typically performed immediately after a gunshot injury due to potential complications such as pneumothorax."
