Refilling the shampoo bottle with shaving cream and putting it back in the shower is considered stealing because you took something that was not yours to use for your own benefit.\n\nScenario 2 involves being respectful and maintaining social distancing during a health crisis, which is generally seen as morally right. Keeping a distance from an ambulance shows concern for others' safety and well-being, which aligns with ordinary moral standards."
