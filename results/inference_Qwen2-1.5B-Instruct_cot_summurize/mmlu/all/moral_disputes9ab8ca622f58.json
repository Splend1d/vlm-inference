The use of needles to cause pain or discomfort without medical necessity is particularly cruel and unusual punishment that goes against basic human dignity. It is important to remember that torture can have long-lasting psychological effects on the victim and may even lead to death. Therefore, it is essential to avoid using torture methods and to uphold the principles of justice, fairness, and respect for human rights."
