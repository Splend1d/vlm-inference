Food allergies are a specific type of allergy where the body's immune system overreacts to a substance in food, causing symptoms like hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing.\n\nA. Is avoidable if the allergic agents are not allowed to exceed specified limits - This statement is partially correct. Food manufacturers should follow strict safety guidelines for ingredients and processing methods to minimize allergens. However, there is no foolproof way to completely eliminate food allergies through avoidance.\n\nB. Are a form of food intolerance - While food intolerances can sometimes cause digestive problems, they do not involve an immune reaction to the food. Food allergies, on the other hand, involve an immune response to the food.\n\nC. Usually occur only after an individual has been sensitized by prior exposure - This statement is also partially correct. Most cases of food allergies develop after exposure to the allergen, although some people may have them from birth due to genetic factors.\n\nD. Are uncomfortable but generally of little medical concern - While it can be uncomfortable, food allergies themselves typically do not pose a serious health risk unless they lead to severe reactions or life-threatening situations. In many cases, treatment involves avoiding the offending food entirely or using medications to manage symptoms. However, complications from food allergies can be serious, especially in children who might not be able to communicate their symptoms or need emergency care."
