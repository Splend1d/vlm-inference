Adler's individual psychology. \n\nAdler's theory emphasizes the importance of individual differences and the role of early childhood experiences in shaping personality. According to Adler, children engage in behaviors as a way of asserting their own needs and desires, and may do so by seeking attention, displaying inadequacy, seeking revenge, or gaining power over others. This perspective aligns closely with the idea that children's misbehavior can be motivated by various factors such as attention-seeking, desire for recognition, fear of being hurt, etc."
