This is because the chemical shifts (chemical shift values) of different substituents in an organic molecule can be determined by comparing their resonance frequencies to those of the reference compound, which is usually tetramethylsilane (TMS). The chemical shift value for CH3Br is approximately 1.55 kHz, while the chemical shift values for the other options are as follows:\n- CH3F: -14.6 ppm (approximately 17.8 kHz)\n- CH3Cl: -9.5 ppm (approximately 16.0 kHz)\n- CH3I: -4.3 ppm (approximately 12.4 kHz)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. CH3Br."
