Deliberative justification refers to the process of considering all relevant facts and perspectives before making a decision or judgment. It is a form of rationality that involves weighing different options and choosing the best one based on what is considered reasonable and ethical.\n\nMoral requirements, on the other hand, refer to the principles and values that guide our actions and decisions. They are not necessarily refuted by deliberative justification because they provide the framework within which we make decisions. Instead, deliberative justification may be used as an additional tool in identifying and evaluating the impact of moral requirements on our decisions.\n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect because moral requirements do not refute deliberative justification. Finally, option D is also incorrect because deliberative justification does not ignore morality; rather, it recognizes the importance of moral considerations in shaping our judgments and decisions."
