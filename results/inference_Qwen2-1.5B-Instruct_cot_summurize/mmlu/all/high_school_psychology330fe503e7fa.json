Delta waves are characterized by slow, regular oscillations in the frequency range of 4-7 Hz, making them less noticeable to the human ear compared to other types of brainwaves. In contrast, alpha waves, beta waves, and sleep spinders are all part of the gamma band, which is associated with higher levels of alertness and consciousness."
