According to the elaboration likelihood model, individuals tend to rely more heavily on the central route (passive processing) when they perceive a message as being within their \"latitude of acceptance\". This means that if the message is something that they already believe or agree with, they may be less inclined to actively process it and engage in deep processing (active processing). In contrast, if the message is outside of their \"latitude of acceptance\", they may be more likely to engage in active processing by trying to understand and evaluate the message more deeply."
