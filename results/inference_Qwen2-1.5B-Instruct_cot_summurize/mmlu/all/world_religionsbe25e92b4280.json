He is considered one of the most influential leaders in Jain history and spread the dharma of non-violence (ahimsa) throughout his life. Ashoka's teachings emphasized compassion, non-violence, and the importance of treating all beings with respect and kindness.\n\nNgo Dinh Diem, The Dalai Lama, Siddhartha, and Ashoka were not leaders who spread the dharma of non-violence; however, they did play important roles in their respective religions and philosophies. Ngo Dinh Diem was a Vietnamese politician who became president after the fall of French colonial rule in Vietnam. The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibet and a major figure in Tibetan Buddhism. Siddhartha was an Indian philosopher and the founder of Buddhism."
