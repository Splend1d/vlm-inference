                    "text": "A department store had suffered a succession of thefts of merchandise over a period of months. From reports by employees and customers, the department store's manager concluded that the losses were due, wholly or in large part, to the depredations of a female shoplifter, aged 30 to 40 years, about 5 feet 5 inches in height, with red hair and green eyes, who usually wore a suit. This information was passed on to all of the employees of the department store. One day, a woman entered the store to purchase accessories. The woman was 5 feet 5 inches tall, 37 years old, red-haired and green-eyed, and dressed in a smartly tailored suit. She carried a large shopping bag. The manager noticed her as she picked up, examined, and put down a number of gloves and scarves. After a while, she looked about tentatively, and then started to walk out, swinging her bag. The manager intercepted her and, standing in front of her, politely asked the woman if she would accompany her to the store manager's office. When the woman asked for an explanation, the manager told her of the store's recent experience and the suspicion that the woman might be concealing pilfered merchandise in her bag. Flushing angrily, the woman replied, \"Very well,\" and followed her to the office. Once there, the manager began to question the woman quite intensively. After the questioning, the manager then asked the woman's permission to inspect the contents of her shopping bag. At first, the woman curtly refused and announced that she had had enough of this nonsense. When she rose to go, the manager told her, \"Listen, unless you let me look inside that bag, I'm going to call the police. \" The woman replied, \"Very well,\" and handed her the bag. The manager inspected the contents of the bag thoroughly but did not find any pilfered merchandise. She then gave the woman permission to leave. The total length of the woman's detention was 30 minutes. If the woman asserts a claim for false imprisonment against the department store, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because she was detained for an unreasonably long period of time.\nB. prevail, because the manager did not have reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft.\nC. not prevail, because under the circumstances, the manager had reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft.\nD. not prevail, because the manager gave the woman permission to leave after conducting her investigation.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Not prevail, because under the circumstances, the manager had reasonable grounds to suspect that the woman had committed a theft.\n\nThe manager's suspicions were based on several factors:\n\n1. The description of the suspect matches the description of the actual thief, including height, age, hair color, and eye color.\n2. The woman matched the description of the actual thief when she arrived at the store.\n3. The woman's behavior during the encounter, such as looking about tentatively before starting to walk out, suggests that she may be concealing stolen goods.\n4. The woman's reaction when confronted about the suspected theft (flushing angry) indicates that she may have been involved in the theft.\n\nTherefore, even though the woman was only detained for 30 minutes, it was sufficient time for the manager to conduct a thorough investigation, which led to the conclusion that the woman was not guilty of the theft. Therefore, the woman cannot prevail in a lawsuit alleging false imprisonment."
