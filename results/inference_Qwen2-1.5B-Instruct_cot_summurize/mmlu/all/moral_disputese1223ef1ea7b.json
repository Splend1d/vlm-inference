The consequences of helping the poor would be worse than the consequences of not helping them.\n\nArthur's reasoning seems to be based on the idea that helping the poor could lead to negative consequences for both parties involved, particularly if the affluent does not receive anything in return. He suggests that the right to aid should only be granted to those who are willing to enter into a contract or agreement with the poor, which may include conditions such as repayment or compensation in the event of failure to assist. However, this argument does not directly address the specific reasons why Arthur believes that the poor do not have a right to aid from the affluent.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that persons cannot have a right to aid from anyone, which contradicts Arthur's own statement that he does not believe that the wealthy have a right to aid from the poor.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because the right to aid is generally considered a positive right, rather than a negative right.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C."
