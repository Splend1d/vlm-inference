Ratio Data is scaled and at equal distances but no absolute zero. \n\nRatio data is a type of numerical data that has a fixed unit of measure, such as weight, length, or temperature, and is measured in whole numbers or integers (e.g., 1 kg, 5 m). It has a scale of measurement and is ordered from smallest to largest, but it does not have an absolute zero point. This means that ratios cannot be negative or infinite, and they always result in whole number values.\n\nFor example, if you want to measure the height of people in inches, you would use ratio data because the units of measurement are consistent and the measurements are ordered from shortest to tallest. However, if you wanted to measure the age of people in years, you would use interval data because the units of measurement are continuous and there is no absolute zero point. Interval data can also be divided into ordered categories, which is why option D is incorrect."
