I and III only.\n\nFor any two-sided ideal \\(V\\) in a ring \\(R\\), we have that:\n\n1. \\(U+V\\) is an ideal, since it's closed under addition.\n2. If \\(u \\in U\\) and \\(v \\in V\\), then \\(uv\\) is not necessarily in \\(U+V\\). For example, consider \\(U = \\{0\\}\\) and \\(V = \\{1\\}\\), where \\(1\\) is a unit in \\(R\\). Then \\(uv = 1\\) for all \\(u,v \\in U\\), but \\(uv\\) is not in \\(U+V = \\{0\\}\\).\n3. Similarly, if \\(x \\in U\\) and \\(x \\in V\\), then \\(x\\) is not necessarily in \\(U+V\\). For example, consider \\(U = \\{0\\}\\) and \\(V = \\{1\\}\\), as above. Then \\(x = 1\\) for all \\(x \\in U\\), but \\(x\\) is not in \\(U+V = \\{0\\}\\).\n\nTherefore, for both \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) to be two-sided ideals of \\(R\\), they must satisfy the conditions:\n\n- \\(U+V\\) is an ideal.\n- \\(UV\\) is an ideal, which means that for all \\(a,b \\in UV\\), \\(ab \\in UV\\). However, this does not imply that \\(ab\\) is necessarily in \\(U+V\\), so it is not necessary for \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) to be ideals.\n- The condition \\(U \\cap V = \\emptyset\\) cannot hold, because this would mean that every element of \\(U\\) is a left zero divisor in \\(R\\) and every element of \\(V\\) is a right zero divisor in \\(R\\), contradicting the assumption that \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are ideals.\n\nThus, the only way for \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) to be two-sided ideals of \\(R\\) is if they satisfy the additional condition that \\(U \\cap V = \\emptyset\\), making option C incorrect. Option A correctly identifies that only ideals \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\) satisfy these conditions."
