Therefore, option B (enactment of laws regulating railroads), which refers to efforts to regulate railroad companies, may have been a part of this movement. \n\nHowever, without additional context or specific details about the movements and events mentioned in the lyrics, it is difficult to determine if any of these actions were specifically aimed at the political movement described in the lyrics. It is possible that some of these actions had indirect effects on the movement's goals, but without further information, it is not accurate to say that any of them directly contributed to the success of the movement."
