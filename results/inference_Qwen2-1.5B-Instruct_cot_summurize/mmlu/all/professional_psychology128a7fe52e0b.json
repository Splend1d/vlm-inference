When we decrease within-group variability, it will increase the MSE and thus reduce the overall F-ratio. Conversely, when we increase between-group variability, it will decrease the MSE and thus increase the F-ratio.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Increasing between-group variability and decreasing within-group variability."
