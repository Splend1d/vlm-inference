This is because `nextAvailableID` is used to increment the ID number for each new Insect object created, so it is important to have a global counter that can be shared across all instances of the Insect class.\n\nOption B (nextAvailableID) is also correct since it is the variable used to store the ID number of the last created Insect object. However, option A (age), C (idNum), and D (position) are not static as they refer to local variables within the Insect class itself rather than being shared between objects."
