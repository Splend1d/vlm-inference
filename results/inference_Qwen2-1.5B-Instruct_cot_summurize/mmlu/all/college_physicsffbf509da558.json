Hall coefficient\n\nThe Hall coefficient is a measure of the conductivity of a material, and it can be used to determine whether the material has free electrons or holes as its charge carriers. In a p-type semiconductor (a type of semiconductor that has been doped with impurities that have an excess of valence electrons), the Hall coefficient will be positive because the positive charges from the dopants will cancel out some of the negative charges on the conduction band, resulting in a net positive current. In a n-type semiconductor (a type of semiconductor that has been doped with impurities that have an excess of conduction electrons), the Hall coefficient will be negative because the negative charges from the dopants will compensate for some of the positive charges on the valence band, resulting in a net negative current. This property is also known as the Hall effect."
