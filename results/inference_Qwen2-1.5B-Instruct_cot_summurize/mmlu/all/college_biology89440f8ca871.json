Juxtamedullary nephrons in the mammalian kidney allow the organism to produce hyperosmotic urine.\n\nJuxtamedullary nephrons are responsible for the production of hyperosmotic urine in mammals, which helps to maintain homeostasis by removing excess water and electrolytes from the body. This process occurs when the cells of the nephron become more permeable to water molecules, allowing them to pass through the cell membrane and into the surrounding fluid. As a result, the concentration of water in the blood becomes higher than the concentration of water in the filtrate, leading to the production of a hyperosmotic urine."
