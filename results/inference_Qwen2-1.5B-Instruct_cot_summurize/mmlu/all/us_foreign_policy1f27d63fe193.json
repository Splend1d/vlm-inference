This theory was popularized by Henry Kissinger and referred to the possibility that if South Vietnam fell to communist forces, it would inevitably lead to North Vietnam taking control of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Burma. It was used as a justification for US military intervention in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War."
