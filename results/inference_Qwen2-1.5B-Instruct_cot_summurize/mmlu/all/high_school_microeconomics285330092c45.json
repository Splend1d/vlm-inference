Neither party has an incentive to deviate from their strategy\n\nIn a Nash equilibrium, both parties involved in a game have no incentive to change their strategies because doing so would result in a worse outcome for them than the one they are already experiencing. This means that there is no gain to be had by either party by changing their strategy, and therefore no reason to do so.\n\nThe other options listed are not necessarily true at all in all situations:\n\n- A. The supply curve intersecting the demand curve: In many markets, this can occur if the government intervenes with price controls or subsidies. However, it does not guarantee a Nash equilibrium.\n- C. The marginal revenue curve intersecting the marginal cost curve: In some cases, this can happen as part of a perfectly competitive market, but it is not always the case. For example, in monopolistic competition, firms may still face negative marginal costs.\n- D. An unstable equilibrium where each party would like to switch strategies: While it is possible for a Nash equilibrium to be unstable, it is not guaranteed to be so. There could be other factors at play that make switching strategies beneficial to one or both parties."
