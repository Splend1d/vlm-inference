Human migration will arise as a result of global inequalities in the distribution of power, wealth, and resources. Disempowerment of populations will lead to competition and violence, manifested in transnational movements; and environmental threats and resources scarcity will lead to conflict.\nB. Economic interdependency between states will strengthen global security and lead to a reduction in international conflict. Human migration will lead to overcrowding and resource scarcity but this will be addressed by the technological advancements of developing states to which most migration will take place.\nC. The primary cause of conflict, both at international and sub-national level will be based in ideological differences between populations as resources scarcity, population growth and human migration forces diverse identity groups into increasingly close contact.\nD. Environmental concerns will be overshadowed by immediate threats to international security, posed by global economic crisis and the subsequent rise of fundamentalist ideologies and violence. Human migration will be managed within the current global economic system as poverty restricts movement although there is a limited risk of transnational revolt as a result of disempowerment and resource scarcity.\n"

Some key factors that could shape these conflicts include:\n\n1. Human migration: As mentioned earlier, human migration will play a crucial role in shaping conflicts in the twenty-first century. Displacement due to political instability, economic hardship, and natural disasters can trigger violent conflicts as people seek safety and opportunities elsewhere.\n\n2. Global inequalities in power, wealth, and resources: Inequality among nations and regions will continue to fuel competition and conflict. This could manifest itself through territorial disputes, trade wars, and military interventions.\n\n3. Environmental threats and resources scarcity: Climate change, pollution, and other environmental issues could exacerbate existing tensions between countries and populations, leading to conflicts over access to resources and territory.\n\n4. Ideological differences: Ideologies such as nationalism, communism, and capitalism may create divisions and tensions among different populations, potentially leading to armed conflicts.\n\n5. Economic interdependence: Increased globalization and economic interdependence between countries will likely reduce the likelihood of direct conflict, but it could also increase the potential for economic downturns and crises that could spark violent protests or revolutions.\n\n6. Technological advancements: While technology has the potential to improve standards of living and alleviate some of the world's problems, it could also exacerbate inequality and conflict if not used responsibly.\n\nOverall, the changing global security environment will require a nuanced approach to address complex issues like human migration, economic interdependence, environmental challenges, and ideological differences, while still ensuring that all nations have an equal voice in shaping their own futures."
