The mushrooms on the farmer's farm were usually picked and packaged by the farmer's three sons. On February 27, two of the Sons were injured in a fanning accident and hospitalized. As a result, the farmer encountered a manpower shortage and could not process all of the mushrooms for the chef's order. On February 28, the farmer telephoned the chef and said, \"Because my two sons were injured yesterday, I won't be able to deliver your mushrooms on March 1. However, I am trying to hire some other farm hands to help process your order. Although I can't promise it, I should be able to deliver the mushrooms by the end of the week. \" The chef, who knew that the fanner's sons were responsible for the mushroom farming, said, \"No problem. I think I'll be able to get by without them for a few days. However, be advised that I will hold you liable for any loss I sustain as a result of your failure to deliver the mushrooms on March 1 . \" When the chef failed to receive the mushrooms on March 5, he sent the following fax to the fanner:\"I must have the mushrooms no later than March 9. \" This fax was received and read by the farmer on the same day. If the fanner delivers the mushrooms to the chef on March 9 and the chef accepts them, can the chef successfully maintain a contract action against the farmer to recover damages resulting from the delay in delivery?\n\nA. No, because temporary impracticability excused his duty to deliver the mushrooms on March 1.\nB. No, because the buyer's statements and acceptance of the mushrooms constituted a waiver of the condition of timely delivery.\nC. Yes, because his statements to the farmer did not constitute a promise to forgo any cause of action he then had or might later acquire.\nD. Yes, because there was no consideration to support his waiver, if any, of timely delivery.\n"

No, because the buyer's statements and acceptance of the mushrooms constituted a waiver of the condition of timely delivery.\n\nIn this scenario, the chef made an offer to buy the mushrooms on March 1, but the farmer declined to deliver them due to a manpower shortage caused by the injury of his two sons. The chef responded by demanding delivery by March 9, which the farmer accepted. Therefore, the chef has effectively waived his right to demand timely delivery of the mushrooms under the terms of the contract. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that the chef did not seek compensation for the delay does not affect the validity of the contract. Waiver of rights is only effective when the party waiving those rights has been provided with notice of the impending claim. In this case, the chef did not provide any such notice before accepting the mushrooms, so the waiver cannot be enforced."
