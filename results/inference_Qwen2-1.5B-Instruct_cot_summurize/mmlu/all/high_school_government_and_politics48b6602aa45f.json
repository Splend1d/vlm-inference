An individual with a graduate degree is more likely to vote than an individual who has only a high school diploma.\n\nThis statement is based on research and data showing that education level is positively correlated with political engagement, including voter turnout. Higher levels of education are often associated with greater interest in politics, greater knowledge of political issues, and a greater likelihood of engaging in political activities such as voting. Therefore, it can be inferred that individuals with higher levels of education are more likely to vote than those with lower levels of education."
