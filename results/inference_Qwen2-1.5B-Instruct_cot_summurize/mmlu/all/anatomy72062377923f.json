Synapse\n\nThe point at which an impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another neuron is called a synapse, also known as a synaptic connection or simply a \"connection.\" The synapse is where neurotransmitters, chemicals that carry signals between neurons, are released and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron (the receiving neuron). This binding causes the postsynaptic neuron to fire an action potential, which can then propagate throughout the nervous system to other neurons."
