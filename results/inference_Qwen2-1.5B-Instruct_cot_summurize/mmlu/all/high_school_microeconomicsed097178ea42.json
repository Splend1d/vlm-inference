Marginal External Cost\n\nIn a monopolistic market, the marginal revenue curve (MR) shows the additional revenue that can be generated by selling one more unit of product at its current price. However, in a monopsony market (where there is only one buyer), the marginal external cost curve (MEC) would represent the additional cost that the firm incurs when it hires one more worker. The MEC is the total cost divided by the number of workers hired, so it's the inverse of the marginal external benefit curve. Therefore, the relationship between the marginal revenue curve and the marginal external cost curve for a monopsony is analogous to the relationship between the marginal revenue curve and the marginal external cost curve for a monopoly."
