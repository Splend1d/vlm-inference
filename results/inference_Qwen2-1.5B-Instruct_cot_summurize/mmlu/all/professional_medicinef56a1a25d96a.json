Review of her extensive medical chart, which she has brought with her, discloses that she has a long history of varying physical symptoms. Definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history. She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Conversion disorder\nB. Histrionic personality disorder\nC. Occult medical disorder\nD. Somatic symptom disorder\n"

                    "text": "The most likely diagnosis based on the information provided is:\n\nD. Somatic symptom disorder\n\nThis condition involves individuals who report persistent symptoms (such as stomachaches, headaches, or back pain) but have no identifiable physical cause. The patient's history suggests a pattern of presenting with severe, distressing symptoms that do not respond to conventional treatment, along with frequent hospitalizations due to their severity.\n\nConversion disorder refers to a type of somatic symptom disorder where patients experience sudden changes in bodily functions without an obvious physical cause. However, the patient's description does not fit this description.\n\nHistrionic personality disorder is characterized by excessive concern with appearance, emotional expression, and personal achievements, often at the expense of others. This disorder is not typically associated with self-reported chronic pain.\n\nOccult medical disorder refers to conditions that are not apparent during routine health care examinations but can be detected through additional testing. While this could be relevant in some cases, it is less likely than other options given the detailed history presented.\n\nSomatic symptom disorder is the most likely diagnosis here because the patient reports severe, persistent symptoms that do not have an identified cause, and they have multiple hospitalizations for unrelated reasons. The fact that the patient has been hospitalized so frequently and given extensive diagnostic evaluations suggests that there may be a real underlying problem, even if it is not immediately apparent."
