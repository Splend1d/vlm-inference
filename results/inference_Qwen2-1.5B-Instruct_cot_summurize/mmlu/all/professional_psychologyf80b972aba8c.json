This phenomenon is known as the \"bystander effect.\" The theory behind this is that if there are too few people around, individuals may feel less responsible for taking action because they believe someone else will take care of it. However, with more people present, there is usually enough support and pressure to act. Therefore, having at least four people nearby can increase the chances of receiving help during an emergency."
