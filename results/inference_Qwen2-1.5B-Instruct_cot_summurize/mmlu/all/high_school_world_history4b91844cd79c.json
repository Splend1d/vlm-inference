The [Muslims] are exceedingly numerous here. This whole city is surrounded by a wall: each of the six [districts of Hangzhou] is also surrounded by a wall. In the first reside the guards, with their commander. I was told that, in the muster-rolls, these amount to twelve thousand\u2026In the second division are the Jews, Christians, and the Turks who worship the sun: these are numerous, their number is not known: and theirs is the most beautiful city. Their streets are well disposed, and their great men are exceedingly wealthy.

Therefore, option D cannot be determined based on the given information.\n\nOption A states that the Mongol administration in China favored many religious traditions, but this information is not provided in the passage either. \n\nOption B suggests that the Mongol administration in China relied heavily on tribute from the Russian principalities, which may be true considering the Mongols' relationship with Russia as allies and traders. However, the passage does not mention whether or not the Mongols imposed taxes or tribute on the Russian principalities at that time.\n\nOption C states that the Mongol administration in China encountered immense domestic unrest, but again, this information is not provided in the passage.\n\nTherefore, none of the options directly relate to the Mongol administration's policies towards Russia during the specified time period."
