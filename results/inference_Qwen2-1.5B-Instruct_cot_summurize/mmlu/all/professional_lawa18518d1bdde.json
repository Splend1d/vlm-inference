The contract stipulated that the work had to be completed by December 1 (the anticipated opening date for the resort), and that the electrician would be paid $5,000 upon completion of the job. Before accepting the job, the electrician had inspected the property and determined that 500 lighting fixtures would be needed to adequately light the pathways. By November 15, the electrician had installed 150 lighting fixtures. That evening, the owner inspected the property and discovered that the lighting fixtures installed by the electrician did not provide adequate lighting. The next day, the owner immediately discharged the electrician and hired a lighting specialist to complete the installation work at $20 per fixture. The lighting specialist installed the remaining 350 fixtures, completing the work on December 1. The electrician filed suit against the owner. If it is determined that the owner was legally justified in discharging the electrician, which of the following is the electrician's proper measure of recovery?\n\nA. $7,000. 00\nB. $3,500. 00\nC. Quantum meruit for the reasonable value of his services rendered in installing the 150 fixtures.\nD. Nothing, because the electrician did not complete performance of the entire job.\n"

Quantum meruit for the reasonable value of his services rendered in installing the 150 fixtures.\n\nQuantum meruit is a legal principle that allows for compensation when one party breaches a contract but the other party does not have sufficient remedies under the contract itself. In this case, the electrician was only compensated for the 150 lighting fixtures he had already installed, so any additional work done after that point would not be covered by the contract. Therefore, the electrician can claim the reasonable value of his services rendered in installing those 150 fixtures as compensation for breach of contract."
