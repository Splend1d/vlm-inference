According to common ethical principles, it is considered morally wrong to intrude on someone's privacy without their consent, even if the person being observed has no reason to feel threatened or uncomfortable. In this case, the protagonist violated the neighbor's privacy by looking through the window, and this action was not justified by any legitimate purpose such as curiosity or protection from harm. Therefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong."
