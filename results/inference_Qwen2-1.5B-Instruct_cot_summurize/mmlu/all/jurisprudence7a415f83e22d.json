It espouses the view that there is no necessary connection between morality and law.\n\nLegal Positivism, also known as Legal Realism, posits that the nature of law is objective, independent of moral values or personal beliefs. This means that law exists independently of human morality and can be determined by following established rules and principles without regard for personal feelings or intentions. Therefore, it does not necessarily align with the idea that morals and law are inseparable. \n\nOption A, which states that Legal Positivism regards morals and law as inseparable, is incorrect because it contradicts the core belief in the independence of law from morality. Option B, stating that Legal Positivism perceives law as commands, is also incorrect because it incorrectly attributes the characteristics of commands to legal positivism, which is actually an attribute of natural law theory rather than legal positivism. Option C, which suggests that Legal Positivism regards a legal order as a closed logical system, is correct but irrelevant to the question since it does not address the accuracy of the statement about the relationship between morality and law."
