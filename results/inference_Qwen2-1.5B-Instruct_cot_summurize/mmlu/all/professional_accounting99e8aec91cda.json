The total vacation accrued by both employees combined equals 4 weeks (2 weeks for each employee). Therefore, there is no vacation liability or expense to report in Elan's year-end financial statements.\nIn summary, there is no need to adjust the financial statements for vacation liabilities or expenses due to the fact that both employees have taken vacations that do not affect the company's vacation balance."
