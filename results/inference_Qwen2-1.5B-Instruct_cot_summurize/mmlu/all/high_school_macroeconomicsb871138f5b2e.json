Inflation also tends to fall during a recession as there is less overall spending and more savings among households and businesses. As a result, consumption falls, which can lead to a decrease in aggregate demand and further contraction of the economy. Household wealth may rise if assets like stocks and real estate appreciate in value, but this does not necessarily reflect an increase in consumption."
