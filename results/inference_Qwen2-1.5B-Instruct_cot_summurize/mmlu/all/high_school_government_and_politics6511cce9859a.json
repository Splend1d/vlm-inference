However, they do not specifically prohibit campaigns from issuing attack ads. Attack ads are typically characterized as negative or misleading advertisements that aim to discredit an opponent's policies or character. While it is important for voters to be informed about their candidates' positions on issues, preventing them from seeing attacks against their opponents can undermine the democratic process and discourage voters from participating fully in the electoral process. Therefore, while federal election laws should strive to protect the integrity of the electoral process, preventing attacks on candidates is not one of their primary goals."
