This process generates three molecules of ATP per glucose molecule. Additionally, some of the pyruvate molecules can be converted to lactate, which also contributes to ATP production through fermentation pathways. Therefore, the total number of ATP molecules produced by glycolysis is approximately 3 (from glucose) + 4 (from glycogen) = 7."
