Therefore, the most effective sentence for first-grade students to read would be one that uses all five of the letters they have learned so far (b, a, s, g, and t). \n\nOption D, \"Sally was happy,\" is the only option that includes all five of these letters in a single word. It also contains an additional vowel sound (i) at the end of the word, which helps reinforce the concept of blending sounds together to form new words.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Sally was happy."
