It is influenced by several factors, including the type of food consumed, the individual's physical activity level, and the time since eating.\n\nFor carbohydrates, the TEF is generally higher because they require more energy to digest and absorb compared to proteins or fats. This is partially due to the fact that carbohydrates have a higher specific heat capacity and lower specific volume than proteins or fats.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the TEF does not necessarily correlate directly with the amount of calories consumed. The actual calorie content of the meal can also play a significant role in determining the energy expenditure during digestion and absorption.\n\nRegarding B: The postprandial period refers to the period following a meal when blood glucose levels rise. During this time, there may be an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity as the body prepares to mobilize stored energy sources, which could potentially lead to an increased metabolic rate.\n\nAs for A: The thermic effect of food is not substantially higher for carbohydrate than for protein. Both carbohydrate and protein have similar thermic effects upon ingestion, although carbohydrate tends to have a slightly higher TEF due to its higher specific heat capacity and lower specific volume compared to proteins.\n\nFinally, D: Food malabsorption can affect the thermic effect of food, but it is not typically considered a factor in the overall energy expenditure. Malabsorption can lead to a reduction in the amount of nutrients absorbed from the diet, which could result in a decreased metabolic rate. However, this effect is relatively minor and should not significantly alter the overall thermic effect of food."
