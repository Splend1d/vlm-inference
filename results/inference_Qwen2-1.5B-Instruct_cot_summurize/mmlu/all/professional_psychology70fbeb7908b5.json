Men and women react aggressively to crowded conditions to about the same degree.\n\nResearch has shown that both men and women may exhibit aggressive behavior under conditions of overcrowded spaces, such as during sports events or public transportation. However, it's important to note that these behaviors can vary depending on individual factors such as personality traits, cultural background, and social norms. Additionally, some studies have suggested that women may display higher levels of aggression when they feel threatened or cornered in crowded environments compared to men."
