The plaintiff claimed that the defendant drove through a red light and hit her as she was crossing the street. The posted speed limit at the scene of the accident was 25 m. p. h. In his case-in-chief, the defendant testified that the traffic light was green and he was driving carefully at 20 m. p. h. The plaintiff's attorney did not cross-examine the defendant. Rather, she called a police officer who testified that the defendant told him immediately after the accident that he was going 30 m. p. h. The police officer's testimony is\n\nA. a prior inconsistent statement and, therefore, admissible to impeach.\nB. hearsay, but admissible as a prior inconsistent statement for any purpose.\nC. admissible, as offered against the defendant.\nD. inadmissible, because the accident report is the best evidence of what the defendant told the police officer.\n"

However, this rule applies only when the statement is made by a party opposing the other side, which is not the case here. Therefore, the police officer's testimony about the defendant telling him he was going 30 m.p.h. is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement to impeach the defendant's testimony.\n\nIt is important to note that the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement depends on the context and the circumstances surrounding its admission. If the prior statement was made in a different setting or with a different purpose, it may still be admissible. Additionally, the statement must be reliable and not based on speculation or inference."
