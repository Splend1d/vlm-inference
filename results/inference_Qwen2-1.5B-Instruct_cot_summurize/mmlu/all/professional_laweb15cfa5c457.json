The defendant inspected the watch and informed the customer that the watch needed a minor adjustment, which he would perform that afternoon. The customer gave the watch to the defendant and told him that he would return the following day to pick it up. As the defendant was repairing the watch, he discovered that it was an extremely valuable antique. He then substituted a less-expensive look-alike for the watch, which the customer picked up the next day.\nB. As two defendants were walking down the street, they noticed a victim park his metallic gold sports car and enter the pool hail. When they approached the car, one of the defendants observed that the victim had left the keys in the ignition. Knowing that the victim would be hustling pool all evening, the defendants hopped into the sports car and drove off, intending to return the car later that evening.\nC. During a craps game in the back room of a bar, the defendant lost $150 to the victim. The defendant left the bar after losing his money and returned an hour later with a gun in his possession. Honestly believing that the $150 still belonged to him, the defendant confronted the victim in the back room and demanded the return of his money. Frightened, the victim handed the money back to the defendant.\nD. One afternoon, the defendant noticed the victim riding his racing bike in the park. The defendant, who always wanted to own a racing bike, saw his opportunity when the victim left his bike unattended to participate in a touch football game. The defendant jumped on the bike and quickly rode away. Later that evening, the defendant called the victim and demanded $200 for the return of the bike. The victim agreed to the defendant's demand. The following day, the victim paid the defendant the money, and the defendant, in turn, returned the bike.\n"

Additionally, the defendant did not return the property as promised, which constitutes a breach of trust."
