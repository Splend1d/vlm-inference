Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people\u2014these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency.\n\"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . .\"\n\u2014Port Huron Statement, 1962\nThe primary intended audience for the Port Huron Statement was\n\nA.

It was meant to inspire and encourage these young people to take action against racism and inequality. Therefore, it is likely that the primary intended audience for the statement was middle-class college students."
