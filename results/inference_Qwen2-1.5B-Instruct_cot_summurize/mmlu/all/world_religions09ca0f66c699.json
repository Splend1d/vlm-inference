The term \"Svetambara\" comes from the Sanskrit word svetambara which means \"half-martyr,\" referring to their belief that they should not renounce all attachments but rather some of them.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while Svetambaras believe in some form of semi-reincarnation, there isn't a consensus among scholars regarding whether they follow a path of complete renunciation. Some scholars argue that Svetambaras may have a more relaxed approach towards physical renunciation compared to other Jaina groups like Digambaras, who often require complete physical renunciation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would depend on how strictly the question defines \"semi-renunciation.\" If the term refers to a less strict path, then the Svetambara Jaina community could be considered."
