Without limiting our perspective to an internal dreamworld, we cannot achieve any objective, external knowledge of the real world.\n\nThis is because our perception and understanding of reality are shaped by our experiences and beliefs, which are all subjective and based on personal perspectives. If we limit ourselves to an internal dreamworld, we may not have access to objective, external knowledge of the real world.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most appropriate choice. The other options do not address the limitations of individual perspectives in determining their usefulness, truth, or value. Option A refers to the need for comparison with an objective external perspective, but does not explain why this is necessary. Option B suggests that what we appeal to to prove our perspective is wrong itself becomes part of the evaluation process, which is not necessarily the case. And option C simply states that scientific research would challenge our perceptions, which is not necessarily the case."
