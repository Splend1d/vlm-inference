All octagons are polygons because they have at least 3 sides.\n\nExplanation: \n- A hexagon has six sides, so it cannot be considered a triangle (since a triangle has exactly three sides).\n- An octagon has eight sides, which means it is indeed a polygon and can be classified as such based on its number of sides.\n- A parallelogram has two pairs of parallel sides, but it does not necessarily have four equal sides. For example, a rectangle also has four equal sides, but it is not a parallelogram.\n- A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, but it does not necessarily have four equal sides. For example, a square is a special type of rhombus with all four sides equal in length."
