Which of the following best describes current thinking?\n\nA. Audiences are more vulnerable and passive than ever before.\nB. Television viewing, in particular, creates increased activity in the right hemisphere of the brain.\nC. Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.\nD. Technology has led to increasingly passive recipients at the ends of message transmission systems.\n"

Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.\n\nCurrent research suggests that audiences are not passive recipients but rather active participants in the process of receiving and interpreting media messages. They actively seek out information, engage with content, and can influence its meaning through their own interpretations and reactions. This shift from passive to active reception is seen as an important development in understanding how people interact with media. \n\nWhile technology does play a role in shaping audience behavior, it does not necessarily lead to increased passivity or passive reception. Instead, technological tools and platforms have enabled greater flexibility and control for individuals, allowing them to choose what they consume and interpret it in ways that suit their interests and values. The rise of social media and digital media channels has made it easier for audiences to access diverse viewpoints and participate in discussions about topics they care about. Therefore, the answer C is correct."
