They had just consumed a six-pack of beer when the classmate asked the defendant if there was anything else to drink. The defendant indicated there wasn't and suggested that his classmate drive to the store and buy another six-pack. The classmate told the defendant that his car wasn't working and asked the defendant if he could borrow his. The defendant assented and gave his classmate the keys to his car. The defendant knew that the classmate was drunk when he lent him his car. The classmate was driving to the store at an excessive rate of speed. As he approached an intersection, he was traveling at 70 M. PJ-I. When he came to the intersection, the light turned red. The classmate, who made no effort to stop in time, drove through the red light and collided with another car. The driver of the other car, who had entered the intersection with a green light, was killed in the accident. In the event that the defendant can be convicted of manslaughter, it will most likely be upon the basis of\n\nA. responsibility for the accident as an accomplice.\nB. recklessness in lending his car to his classmate.\nC. joint venture in lending his car to his classmate for a common purpose.\nD. vicarious liability for the conduct of his classmate.\n"

Lending someone your car without verifying their ability to safely operate it is a reckless act, especially if you know they are intoxicated or impaired. If the classmate was driving recklessly and caused the accident, the defendant may be held liable for his actions under the doctrine of contributory negligence. However, if the defendant was not aware of the classmate's impairment or recklessness, then they may have limited liability or no liability at all."
