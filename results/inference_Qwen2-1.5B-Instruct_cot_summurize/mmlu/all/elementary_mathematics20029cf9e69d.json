She also states that there are \"no vertices,\" implying that it doesn't have any sharp edges like in a prism or cylinder. Lastly, she says it can \"roll,\" indicating its shape is more flexible than a cube or rectangular prism.\n\nGiven these clues, we know that the object is not a cone because cones typically only have one flat surface at each vertex (the base). Also, since it cannot be a cylinder because cylinders have straight sides with no curved surfaces, we eliminate B as an option. \n\nTherefore, based on the description of the object provided by Tisha, it must be a sphere, as it fits all the criteria mentioned: it has two flat surfaces, no vertices, and can roll when rolled on its surface."
