In other words, the system cannot prove something that is false. The completeness property states that if a formula is provable from the system, then it must be true. And finally, a succinct proof system means that any unsatisfiable formula of propositional logic can be proven using a proof of length that is polynomial in the length of the original formula. However, the resolution proof system satisfies all three properties, so the correct answer is D."
