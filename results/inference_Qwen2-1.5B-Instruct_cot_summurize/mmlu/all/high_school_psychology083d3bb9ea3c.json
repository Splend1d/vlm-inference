The school psychologist has worked with the boy and knows him well. Anthony has a mild learning disability and receives academic support. He is doing well on a daily basis but has difficulty performing on tests. The school psychologist discusses ways in which Ms. Harcar could incorporate study-skills training into classroom activities. With regard to study-skills training, the school psychologist should stress which of the following principles while advising Ms. Harcar?\n\nA. The study skills of students with disabilities are improved when they are given a single, specific study strategy to follow for all subjects.\nB. Students with disabilities often develop study skills on their own and need only some guidance and reinforcement by the teacher.\nC. Training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches.\nD. Study strategies are best taught in a small group by having students practice collaborative problem-solving activities modeled by the teacher.\n"

Training in study skills needs to include helping students to guide their own thinking to organize their own study behaviors and to use varied study approaches.\n\nStudy-skills training involves teaching students how to manage their time, prioritize tasks, take notes, and review material effectively. It also involves helping students to develop study habits that work for them, such as using different types of materials (e.g., visual aids, hands-on activities) and engaging in active rather than passive learning. This approach can be particularly beneficial for students with learning disabilities or other special educational needs, as it helps them to build confidence in their ability to learn and succeed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that students with disabilities should follow a single, specific study strategy for all subjects without considering individual differences and preferences. Option B is also incorrect because it implies that students with disabilities need no guidance or reinforcement from teachers, which is not true. Option D is partially correct but does not fully address the importance of student self-direction and collaboration in effective study-skills training."
