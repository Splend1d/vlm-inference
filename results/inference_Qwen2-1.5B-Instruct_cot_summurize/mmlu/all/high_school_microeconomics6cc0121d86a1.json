In this case, firms have an incentive to offer different prices to different market segments, such as those with more or less elastic demand.\n\nMarket segments with relatively elastic demand (such as luxury goods) tend to pay higher prices because they are willing and able to pay more for the good. These consumers are more sensitive to changes in price and are likely to switch to alternative products if the price increases too much. On the other hand, market segments with relatively inelastic demand (such as necessities like food and clothing) tend to pay lower prices because they are not as sensitive to price changes.\n\nAs a result, the overall demand curve for the good will be steeper for the elastic demand market segment, leading to higher prices and smaller consumer surplus than for the inelastic demand market segment. This is known as the law of demand."
