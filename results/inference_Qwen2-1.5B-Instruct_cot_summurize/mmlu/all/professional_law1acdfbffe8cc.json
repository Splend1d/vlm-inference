A corporation who provides cable television services successfully persuaded the state legislature to grant it an exclusive right to install cable television lines in all multiple family dwellings in the state, in exchange for the corporation's promise to freeze cable television rates for the next four years. An owner of several large multifamily apartment buildings in the state brought an action in federal district court challenging the constitutionality of the state legislation. The suit claimed that the space used by the corporation when it subsequently installed cable television lines in one of his apartment buildings amounted to a taking without compensation. In this action, the owner will be awarded\n\nA. no relief, because easements for utility lines are presumed to be beneficial to the servient estate.\nB. no relief, because the legislation is merely a regulation of the use of property and not a taking.\nC. no relief, because the corporation is not a government entity.\nD. damages for the value of property used by the corporation.\n"
