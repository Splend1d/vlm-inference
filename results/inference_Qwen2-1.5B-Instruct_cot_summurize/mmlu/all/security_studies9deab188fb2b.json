Anarchy is an inescapable feature of the international system.\n\nAnarchy is not considered a fundamental ontological principle of social constructivism because it refers to the absence of any form of governance or control within a society. It does not address the nature of human agency or the relationship between agents and their environments. Social constructivists focus on how meanings and identities are constructed through interaction with others, rather than the inherent structure of the world itself. Therefore, while anarchy may be true under certain conditions, it is not necessarily a fundamental ontological principle that needs to be addressed by social constructivists."
