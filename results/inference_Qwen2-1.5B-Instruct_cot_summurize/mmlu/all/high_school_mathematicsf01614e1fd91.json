According to the problem, we have the equation:\n\n$x^2 + 85 = (x - 17)^2$\n\nExpanding the right side of the equation gives us:\n\n$x^2 + 85 = x^2 - 34x + 289$\n\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides and rearranging terms gives us:\n\n$85 = -34x + 289$\n\nNext, we'll solve for $x$ by adding $34x$ to both sides and subtracting $289$ from both sides:\n\n$-34x + 85 = 0$\n\nThen, add $34x$ to both sides:\n\n$85 = 34x$\n\nFinally, divide both sides by $34$ to find $x$:\n\n$x = \\frac{85}{34} = \\frac{5}{2}$\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$, or in decimal form, approximately equal to $2.5$.
