If she went to the Ancient Concert on Wednesday, having besides a concert of her own here on Monday, it would be four nights of fatigue, really exhausted as the Queen is.\nBut if Lord Melbourne thinks that as there are only to be English singers at the Ancient Concert, she ought to go, she could go there for one act; but she would much rather, if possible, get out of it, for it is a fatiguing time&\u2026.\nAs the negotiations with the Tories are quite at an end, and Lord Melbourne has been here, the Queen hopes Lord Melbourne will not object to dining with her on Sunday?\"\nThe Letters of Queen Victoria, Volume 1 (of 3), 1837-1843: A Selection from Her Majesty's Correspondence Between the Years 1837 and 1861\nThe phrase \"negotiations with the Tories\" suggests that what historical transition had been made complete?\n\nA. The switch from a liberal-dominated to a conservative-dominated Parliament\nB. The conversion from male-dominated politics to female-dominated politics\nC. The change from a divinely-ordained monarch to a constitutionally-approved monarch\nD. An end to war and the creation of a lasting peace\n"
