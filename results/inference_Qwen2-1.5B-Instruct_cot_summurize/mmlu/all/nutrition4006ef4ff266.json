Vision: Vitamin A is essential for good vision. It helps to maintain the health of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that detects light.\n2. Skin Health: Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining healthy skin and preventing skin disorders such as acne and eczema.\n3. Immune System: Vitamin A supports immune system function by helping the body produce white blood cells (leukocytes) and other immune cells.\n4. Regeneration of Cells: Vitamin A is involved in the regeneration of cells and tissues, particularly those in the liver and lungs.\n\nHowever, it does not directly synthesize the blood clotting proteins. This function is carried out by other vitamins and minerals like vitamin K and calcium."
