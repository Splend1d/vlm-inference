                    "text": "To determine which individual (man or woman) is more unusually tall, we need to compare their heights relative to their respective means and standard deviations.\n\nFor the man:\n- Mean height = 70 inches\n- Standard deviation = 4 inches\n\nHis height (74 inches) falls 2 standard deviations below the mean (since \\(74 - 70 = 4\\)), making him \"unusually\" short compared to the population mean. However, this does not directly answer whether he's taller than a woman who is 70 inches tall.\n\nFor the woman:\n- Mean height = 66 inches\n- Standard deviation = 3 inches\n\nHer height (70 inches) falls exactly at the mean, so it's neither exceptionally high nor low compared to the population mean. Her height is also within one standard deviation of the mean (since \\(70 - 66 = 4\\)).\n\nComparing both heights:\n- Man: \\(74 - 70 = 4\\) inches\n- Woman: \\(70 - 66 = 4\\) inches\n\nBoth heights are within one standard deviation of their respective means. However, since the man has an extra standard deviation of 4 compared to the woman, the difference in their heights is larger. Thus, the woman is more unusually tall relative to the man by having a greater standard deviation difference between her height and the mean.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. The woman, because her height is 1.33 standard deviations above the mean height of all women, whereas the man\u2019s height is only one standard deviation above the mean height of all men."
