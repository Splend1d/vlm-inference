They have also built up their armies to a state of great efficiency and are possessed of war implements of great power and precision, in short have license to be formidable powers. If, therefore, we persistently cling to our antiquated systems, heaven only knows what a mighty calamity may befall our Empire.\n\u2014Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847\nHow did Japan respond to the concerns raised by Lord Ii during this era?\n\nA.

The country sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry.\n\nIn response to Lord Ii's concerns about the state of foreign states and their potential threat to Japan's empire, the Japanese government decided to send emissaries to study Western ideas and technologies. This was part of an effort to modernize Japan and adapt to the changing global landscape. The specific actions taken varied depending on the individual emissary, but they often involved sending delegations to Europe or other Western countries to learn about political systems, trade practices, and industrial techniques."
