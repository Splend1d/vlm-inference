Memory\n\nLong-chain fatty acids, specifically EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), have been shown to have neuroprotective effects in animal studies and human trials. They may help support healthy brain development and function during pregnancy and infancy, which can potentially benefit memory and cognitive development later in life.\n\nWhile other aspects of visual performance, motor performance, and behaviour disorders may also be influenced by these nutrients, the focus is more on their potential benefits for cognitive health rather than specific physical abilities or behavior."
