It is known that the views of people from different countries on issues like smoking tend to vary due to the influence of different local social structures. Which of the following is an appropriate sampling technique to use in this situation, and why?\n\nA. Stratified sample, because the population is divided into five strata\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\nB. Cluster sample, because the population is divided into five clusters\u2014namely, five offices in five different countries\nC. Simple random sample, because this is the simplest sampling method\nD. Simple random sample, because this is the only method that gives unbiased results\n"

A simple random sample is the best choice for this situation because it ensures that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This makes it possible to estimate the proportion of employees who support banning smoking on the office premises accurately and without bias. The other options are not suitable because they do not ensure that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, which is essential for accurate estimation."
