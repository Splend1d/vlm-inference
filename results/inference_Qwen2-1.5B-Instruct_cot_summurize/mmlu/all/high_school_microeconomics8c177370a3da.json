Price is determined by the equilibrium in the entire market.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers who are not price takers (i.e., they do not have control over the price). This means that the market price is determined by the interaction between buyers and sellers through the process of bidding up or down until an equilibrium is reached. In this situation, it is the overall market price that determines the firm's profit, rather than individual prices set by each seller."
