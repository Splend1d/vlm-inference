A dentist competently completed the extraction of Lee's tooth but mistakenly pulled the wrong one.\n\nIn this scenario, the dentist performed their duty by extracting the tooth as instructed and met the standard of care required for performing dental procedures. However, they made a mistake by pulling the wrong tooth, which deviates from the contractual terms and constitutes a breach of contract. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of substantial performance. \n\nOption A involves delivering the wrong product, option B involves failing to complete a task that was part of the agreement, and option C involves not meeting the expectations set forth in the contract, all of which do not constitute substantial performance."
