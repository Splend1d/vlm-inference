Restart STP and retry the query, up to a limited number of retries.\n\nWhen the STP (Sequential Timed Petri Net) solver times out on a constraint query for a particular path, it means that there is no solution satisfying all the constraints within the specified time limit. In this case, instead of assuming that the query is not satisfiable and stopping execution of the path, the STP solver should restart itself and try again with a new set of constraints or parameters, possibly by removing some constraints or increasing the time limit for the query. This allows the solver to explore different paths and find a possible solution before giving up entirely."
