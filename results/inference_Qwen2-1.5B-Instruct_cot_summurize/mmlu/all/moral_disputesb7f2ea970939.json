It does not apply to peace or non-warlike situations. Antiwar pacifists believe that war is inherently wrong and should never be fought, while just war theory seeks to balance the use of force with ethical considerations. Moral nihilism is the belief that there are no universal moral principles or values, and therefore there is no way to know what is right or wrong in any given situation."
