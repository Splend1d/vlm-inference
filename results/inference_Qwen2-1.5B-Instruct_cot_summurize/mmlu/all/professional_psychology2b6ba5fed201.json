Whenever the employee's age, instead of work performance, is the basis for firing.\nAge discrimination occurs when an employer takes an adverse employment action against an individual because of their age. This includes being fired or denied promotion due to age.\nIt is not necessary for the company policy to reflect adverse impact on older workers or for the affected employee to demonstrate substantial economic loss for there to be evidence of age discrimination. The most important factor is whether the employee was terminated based solely on their age and not their job performance."
