A standard GARCH(1,1) model can capture all these features of financial asset return time-series:\n\ni) Fat tails in the return distribution: The GARCH(1,1) model allows for non-normal distributions of returns, which can lead to fat tails.\nii) Leverage effects: The GARCH(1,1) model accounts for leverage effects by allowing for conditional variance, which can affect the volatility of returns over time.\niii) Volatility clustering: The GARCH(1,1) model captures volatility clustering, which refers to the tendency for short-term volatilities to be higher than expected based on historical data.\niv) Volatility affecting returns: The GARCH(1,1) model allows for volatility to affect returns, meaning that changes in volatility can influence future returns.\n\nTherefore, options (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are all correct."
