The man called a towing company and told the company's manager that the car was 100 feet down the embankment. \"That's lucky,\" said the manager, \"because our winch only goes 100 feet.\" After the manager and the man agreed on a price, an employee of the company attempted to reach the car but could not because the car turned out to be 120 feet down the embankment. Is the towing company's performance excused on the grounds of mistake?\n\nA. No, because both parties were uncertain about the distance.\nB. No, because the towing company assumed the risk by the manager's failure to examine the distance himself.\nC. Yes, because at the time of contracting, both parties were mistaken about a basic assumption on which the contract was based.\nD. Yes, because the agreement did not allocate the risk of mistake to either party.\n"

Yes, because at the time of contracting, both parties were mistaken about a basic assumption on which the contract was based.\n\nIn this scenario, the man who called the towing company made a mistake in estimating the distance his car had slid down the embankment. The manager also made a mistake in assuming the length of the winch's reach based solely on the information provided by the man. These mistakes occurred at the time of contracting, before any actual work was done or decisions were made about how to proceed with the tow.\n\nSince the man and the manager were each making assumptions about distances that they did not have enough information to accurately determine, their contracts cannot be considered valid under the doctrine of mistake. Therefore, the towing company's performance is excused on the grounds of mistake."
