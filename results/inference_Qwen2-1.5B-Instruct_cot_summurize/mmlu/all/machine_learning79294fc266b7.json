The Bayes' rule states that the joint probability of three events A, B, and C can be calculated as follows:\n\nP(A, B, C) = P(B|A) * P(A) * P(C|B)\n\nIn this case, we have four events: H, U, P, and W. We need to find the joint probability of H, U, P, and W.\n\nAccording to the Bayes' rule, we can write:\n\nP(H, U, P, W) = P(U|H, P) * P(P|W) * P(H) * P(W)\n\nWe know that P(U|H, P) is the marginal probability of U given H and P, which is 0 (since U and P are independent). Similarly, P(P|W) is also 0 because P and W are independent. Therefore, the joint probability reduces to:\n\nP(H, U, P, W) = P(H) * P(W)\n\nSo the correct answer is option B."
