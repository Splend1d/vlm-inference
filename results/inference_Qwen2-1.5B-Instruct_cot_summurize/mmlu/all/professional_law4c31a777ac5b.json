It is enforceable, because the employee conferred a material benefit on the employer by negotiating the lucrative contract.\nB. It is enforceable, because the employer was morally obligated to pay the bonus.\nC. It is unenforceable, because it was not supported by legally sufficient consideration.\nD.
