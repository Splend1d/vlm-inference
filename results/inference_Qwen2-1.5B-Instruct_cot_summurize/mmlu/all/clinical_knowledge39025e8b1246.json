In fact, some people have only one joint affected by RA and others may have several joints involved.\n\n3) Anemia is common in RA due to chronic inflammation.\n\n4) Heberden's nodules are characteristic findings on MRI scans of the hands in patients with RA. These nodules are small, painless lesions that can be found on the backs of the fingers and thumbs. They are thought to be related to immune system abnormalities and inflammation in the joints."
