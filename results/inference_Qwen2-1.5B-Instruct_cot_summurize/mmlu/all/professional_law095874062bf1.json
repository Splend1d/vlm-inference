Therefore, Fred's acceptance on April 5 did not extend the revocation period beyond April 1. Option B is incorrect because the offer had already been signed and mailed before Fred's acceptance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the offer stated that it would not be revoked until the end of the ten-day period, which means that Fred's acceptance on April 1 does not automatically revoke the offer. Option D is also incorrect because the offer clearly stated that it would not be revoked, so Fred's acceptance on April 15 does not automatically revoke the offer either."
