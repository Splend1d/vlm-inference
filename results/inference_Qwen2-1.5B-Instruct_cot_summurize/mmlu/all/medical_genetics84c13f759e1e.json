In Huntington disease, males have an increased risk of developing the disorder if they inherit it from their father. The inheritance pattern is X-linked dominant, meaning that only males with one copy of the mutant gene will show symptoms of the disorder. However, females can also be carriers of the gene and may pass it on to their sons. This means that male children of affected women have a higher chance of inheriting the mutation from their father than from their mother."
