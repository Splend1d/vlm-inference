It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n\u2014Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nThe situation faced by the young women in the passage above is most directly comparable to which of the following?\n\nA. American revolutionaries in the 1770s\nB. Slaves in the antebellum South\nC. Populist farmers in the 1890s\nD. Detroit autoworkers in the 1930s\n"

Slaves in the antebellum South\n\nThe passage describes a situation similar to slavery, where individuals are treated unfairly and have limited access to basic necessities. The young women are described as being exploited because they lack resources and are forced into situations that are not conducive to their well-being. The fact that they are considered \"guilty\" or \"providential\" marriages also highlights the social norms and expectations placed on them. These similarities make the situation described in the passage most directly comparable to slavery in the antebellum South."
