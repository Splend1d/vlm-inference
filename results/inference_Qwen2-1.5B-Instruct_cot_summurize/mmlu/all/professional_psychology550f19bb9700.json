This means that they may not be as easily moved by their partner's actions or words, which can lead to less intense emotional experiences over time.\n\nIt's important to note that this doesn't mean that people stop feeling emotions altogether - it simply means that they may experience them less intensely or with less intensity than when they first started dating or were in a new romantic relationship."
