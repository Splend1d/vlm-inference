In this case, the reserve ratio is 20%, which means that for every $1 of deposits, $0.20 is kept as reserves.\n\nSo, if a bank receives a deposit of $1000, it would keep $200 (20% of $1000) as reserves. The remaining $900 ($1000 - $200) would be lent out to other banks or businesses.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money created through new loans is:\n\n$900 (lent out) / 20% = $4,500\n\nThe correct answer is C. $4,000."
