Both the source and detector travel in the same direction.\n\nWhen both the source and detector move in the same direction (either together or opposite to each other), the frequency of the sound waves emitted by the source will be the same as the frequency of the sound waves received by the detector. This means that there will be no perceived Doppler shift, because the relative speed between the source and detector is zero.\n\nOn the other hand, when the source moves towards the detector and the detector moves towards the source, the frequency of the sound waves emitted by the source will be higher than the frequency of the sound waves received by the detector. This creates a perceived Doppler shift, indicating that the source is approaching the detector at a faster rate than the detector is moving towards the source.\n\nSimilarly, when both the source and detector move away from each other, the frequency of the sound waves emitted by the source will be lower than the frequency of the sound waves received by the detector. Again, this creates a perceived Doppler shift, indicating that the source is moving away from the detector at a faster rate than the detector is moving towards the source."
