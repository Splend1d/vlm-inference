Vertical mobility refers to the ability of an individual to move up in the social hierarchy, such as from a lower socioeconomic status to a higher one through education, hard work, or other means. Absolute poverty and relative poverty refer to specific types of economic conditions, while horizontal mobility refers to the ability of individuals to move between different levels within the same socioeconomic group."
