This results in lower net savings, which leads to a decrease in the amount of loanable funds available for investment. As a result, the real interest rate decreases, making loans cheaper and encouraging borrowing. However, this also reduces the amount of investment spending because people have less disposable income to spend on goods and services, so they tend to save rather than invest. Therefore, the real interest rate and investment spending both decrease as a result of an increase in the federal deficit."
