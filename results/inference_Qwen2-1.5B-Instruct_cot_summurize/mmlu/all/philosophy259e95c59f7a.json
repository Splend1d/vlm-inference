While individuals may have certain personal traits or behaviors that can be interpreted as evidence of psychological egoism, these traits do not necessarily indicate their moral beliefs.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question would depend on how one defines \"psychological egoism\" and whether they believe that it is supported by historical events like Abraham Lincoln's life. Without more information, it is impossible to determine which option is correct."
