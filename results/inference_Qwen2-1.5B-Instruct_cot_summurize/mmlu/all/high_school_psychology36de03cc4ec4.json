They typically do not require a deep understanding of the topic being tested, but rather rely on rote memorization of facts and figures. This makes them well-suited for assessing students' knowledge of specific details, such as dates, names, or definitions.\n\nIn contrast, fill-in-the-blank or completion questions require students to use their own reasoning skills to fill in gaps in a sentence or construct a complete paragraph based on given words or phrases. These types of questions require a deeper level of understanding and critical thinking, as they require the student to analyze the meaning of the words and ideas presented and make connections between them. While some students may be able to recall specific facts or definitions from memory, others will need to engage with the text and analyze it in order to arrive at an accurate response.\n\nTherefore, while multiple-choice questions can be easier than fill-in-the-blank or completion questions for certain types of material, they still do not necessarily assess critical thinking or other higher-order cognitive skills."
