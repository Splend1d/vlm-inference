This is because the father's actions were taken in response to an immediate threat to his life, which could be considered as a reasonable fear of imminent death or serious bodily injury. However, it is important for the judge to carefully consider all the circumstances and evidence before reaching a decision, including whether the father's use of force was justified in proportion to the threat posed by his son. Additionally, the judge should also take into account any mitigating factors such as the father's history of violence towards his son."
