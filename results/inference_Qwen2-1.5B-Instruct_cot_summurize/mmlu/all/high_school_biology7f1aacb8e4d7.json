ATP is formed because an endergonic reaction is coupled with an exergonic reaction.\n\nThis is because ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is formed when a high-energy phosphate bond is added to ADP (adenosine diphosphate), which releases energy stored in its bonds. This process is driven by the difference in activation energies between two reactions, where one is endergonic and the other is exergonic."
