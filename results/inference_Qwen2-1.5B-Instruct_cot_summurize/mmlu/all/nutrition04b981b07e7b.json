Carbohydrates can be made from and converted to amino acids and fatty acids.\n\nThis rule is central to the integration of metabolic pathways because it allows for the synthesis of energy-rich molecules such as glucose, which serves as the primary source of energy in cells. Glucose can then be used to synthesize other molecules that are essential for cellular function, including fatty acids and amino acids. The process of breaking down these molecules into their constituent parts (glycogen, lipids, and proteins) is also an important part of the metabolic pathway. This breakdown allows for the storage of excess energy in the form of glycogen or stored fat, and the synthesis of new molecules when needed."
