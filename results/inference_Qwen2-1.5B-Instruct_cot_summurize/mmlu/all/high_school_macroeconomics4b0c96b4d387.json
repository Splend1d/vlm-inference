If the tax rate is higher than the spending increase, it could result in a net decrease in the budget deficit, which means that there may be less money available for spending, thus leading to a decrease in real GDP.\n\nHowever, if the tax rate is lower than the spending increase, it could result in more revenue being available for spending, which could lead to an increase in real GDP.\n\nTherefore, without knowing the exact relationship between the tax rate and spending, we cannot definitively say whether the overall impact will be positive or negative. It depends on how much revenue is raised relative to the amount spent. So, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Real GDP will remain unchanged."
