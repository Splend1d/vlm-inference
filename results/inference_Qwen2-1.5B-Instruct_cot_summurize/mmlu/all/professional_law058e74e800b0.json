This was the first action taken, and the creditor did not have a judgment. It served the notice of garnishment on the garnishee, the woman's employer. The employer honored the notice by holding all of the woman's earnings in escrow pending the creditor's lawsuit and entrance of final judgment against the woman. The state where defendant lived and worked had a provision for pre-judgment garnishment, as long as the money was held and not distributed until a judgment was entered. The money would be paid to the woman if a judgment was not entered with the next 120 days. The woman sued the employer and the creditor, demanding release of her earnings. Will the court order the garnishee to release the funds to the woman?\n\nA. No, because the state procedure for protecting the woman's money until a judgment is entered is a fair one that comports with procedural due process.\nB. No, because the state has an interest in protecting the rights of creditors to collect debts through the garnishment procedure.\nC. Yes, because the only party that has garnishment rights in the United States is the Internal Revenue Service.\nD. Yes, because the interim freezing of wages without a chance to be heard violates procedural due process.\n"

No, because the state procedure for protecting the woman's money until a judgment is entered is a fair one that comports with procedural due process.\n\nProcedural due process requires that the government must provide individuals with adequate notice and opportunity to be heard before depriving them of any property or liberty. In this case, the state's procedure of holding the woman's earnings in escrow while she seeks a judgment from the court does not violate procedural due process. The state has a legitimate interest in ensuring that creditors can collect their debts and protect their rights to receive payment. The state's procedures for garnishing wages and other assets during the pendency of a legal proceeding are designed to ensure that these interests are protected."
