They may not fully agree with all aspects of mainstream culture, but they do not reject it outright. Instead, they try to find ways to integrate their religious beliefs into the fabric of society while still respecting its conventions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because world-affirming religions generally do not reject traditional religious content or values.\n\nOption B is incorrect because world-affirming religions often reject the loss of meaning and significance in religious teachings, even if they do not fully accept all aspects of mainstream culture.\n\nOption C is incorrect because world-affirming religions do not necessarily have a negative attitude toward mainstream social values.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
