The gas particles are point-like and non-interacting.\n2. The gas particles have negligible size compared to their distance apart.\n3. The gas particles move freely through the container without any resistance from other gas particles or walls of the container.\n4. The gas particles do not experience significant collisions with each other during the time interval over which they collide with the walls of the container or with each other.\n\nThese assumptions make it possible for the gas molecules to behave approximately like point masses, resulting in a simpler and more intuitive relationship between the variables involved. However, there are some limitations to this approximation, such as the effects of molecular weight and intermolecular forces on the behavior of real gases under different conditions."
