The definition of a ring requires the existence of these four operations as well as an additional operation called \"multiplication\" which distributes over the other three operations (i.e., for all elements \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in the ring, we have \\(a \\cdot (b + c) = a \\cdot b + a \\cdot c\\) and \\(a \\cdot (bc) = (ab)c\\)). Therefore, every field automatically satisfies the properties of a ring because it already contains the operations of addition and multiplication. Thus, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: \"Every ring has a multiplicative identity.\"\n\nA ring is a set equipped with two binary operations, usually denoted by plus (+) and times (\u00d7). A multiplicative identity element is an element such that multiplying any element of the ring by this element results in the same element. In a ring, this means there exists at least one element that, when multiplied by any element of the ring, does not change its value. For example, in the integers under addition and multiplication, the integer zero is the multiplicative identity. So, every ring must contain a multiplicative identity. However, this property is not necessarily guaranteed to hold for all rings; some rings may not have a unique multiplicative identity or do not include a multiplicative identity element at all. Therefore, while it's generally true that every ring has a multiplicative identity, it isn't universally true due to the possibility of non-uniqueness or the absence of such elements. Thus, Statement 2 is false.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is D. False, True."
