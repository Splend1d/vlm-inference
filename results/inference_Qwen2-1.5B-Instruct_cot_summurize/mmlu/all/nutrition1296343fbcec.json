May follow colectomy\n\nIntestinal failure, also known as intestinal obstruction or enterocolitis, is a condition that occurs when the intestines become blocked and cannot function properly. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, inflammation, or injury.\n\nIn some cases, colectomy (removal of part or all of the colon) may be necessary to treat intestinal failure. This procedure involves removing the affected section of the colon, which can help relieve symptoms and allow the remaining sections of the intestine to heal.\n\nSodium supplementation of 90mmol/l or higher may also be beneficial in managing symptoms of intestinal failure. However, it's important to note that this should only be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as high levels of sodium can have negative effects on the body.\n\nOverall, while intestinal failure can be a serious condition, there are treatments available that can help manage symptoms and improve outcomes."
