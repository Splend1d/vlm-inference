All living beings, because they are living, possess direct moral standing.\n\nBiocentrism is the belief that all living things have intrinsic value and deserve respect and consideration based on their capacity to experience suffering or pleasure, regardless of whether they can speak for themselves or whether they are capable of communicating with humans. This means that even if some living beings do not have the ability to communicate directly with us, we should still treat them as having moral standing because they are alive and deserving of our attention and care."
