The witness denied ever having heard the defendant make such threats, even though she had testified to that effect before the grand jury. The prosecutor now seeks to admit the witness\u00d5s grand jury testimony. How should the court rule with regard to the grand jury testimony?\n\nA. Admit the testimony, because it contains a statement by a party-opponent.\nB. Admit the testimony, both for impeachment and for substantive use, because the witness made the inconsistent statement under oath at a formal proceeding.\nC. Admit the testimony under the former testimony exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. Exclude the testimony for substantive use, because it is a testimonial statement.\n"

Under this exception, a witness's prior inconsistent statement can be admitted as evidence if it was made in the course of an earlier proceeding involving an adversary and was offered against the witness to prove his or her truthfulness. However, the witness must have been present at the earlier proceeding and be available as a witness at the current trial. In this case, the witness was not present at the earlier proceeding, so the testimony cannot be admitted under this exception. Additionally, the witness has already testified to the same statement under oath in the grand jury, which means the testimony is already known to the court and cannot be used again to impeach the witness's credibility. Therefore, the court should exclude the testimony."
