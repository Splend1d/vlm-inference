The negative regression coefficient for a predictor indicates that as the predictor increases, the criterion variable decreases (or vice versa), which suggests that the predictor has an inverse relationship with the criterion variable. This can be interpreted as a potential problem if it violates assumptions of linearity or homoscedasticity in the model. However, it does not necessarily mean that the predictor should be eliminated from the regression equation. It's important to carefully examine the results and any other variables in the model before making such decisions."
