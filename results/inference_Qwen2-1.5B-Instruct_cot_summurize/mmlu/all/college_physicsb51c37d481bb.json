In a degenerate Fermi gas, there are no allowed transitions between states with the same energy level. This means that the electrons are strongly coupled to their nearest neighbors, which leads to a high density of states (HDO) at low energies and a large effective mass at high energies. This results in a high mean kinetic energy for the electrons in metals."
