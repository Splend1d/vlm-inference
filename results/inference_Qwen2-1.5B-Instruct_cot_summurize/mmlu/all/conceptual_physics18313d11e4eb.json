This average kinetic energy depends on the number and mass of particles in the system, as well as their speed and direction of motion. In general, the more dispersed or disordered the arrangement of particles within a substance, the higher its temperature will be. Conversely, if the particles are more tightly packed or ordered, the lower the temperature will be. Therefore, the correct answer is C: average translational kinetic energy."
