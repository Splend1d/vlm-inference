They were laughing as they pushed and pulled each other, trying to get the ball and keep it away from each other. Just as a car approached on the street, the girl lost her balance and fell off the sidewalk and into the street. The driver of the car tried to swerve to avoid her, but ran over her leg.

Negligence occurs when a person fails to exercise the degree of care that a reasonable person would have exercised under similar circumstances. In this case, the driver failed to exercise the necessary level of care when approaching the street where the girl was playing. By swerving to avoid the girl rather than braking or stopping, the driver put themselves at risk of colliding with her, which ultimately led to her injury.\n\nTherefore, the girl's parents can most likely prevail in a lawsuit against the driver if the court finds that the driver was negligent when the accident occurred. However, this depends on various factors such as whether the driver was driving within the posted speed limit, the specific circumstances surrounding the accident, and any contributory negligence on the part of the driver or the girl."
