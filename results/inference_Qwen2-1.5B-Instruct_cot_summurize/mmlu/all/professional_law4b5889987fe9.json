Greyacre's jurisdiction has a race-notice statute and a tract index system. If an action is filed for title to the property, the likely outcome would be for\n\nA.

In this case, Charlene did not have any evidence showing that she knew about the prior conveyance between Alice and Barbara, so under the race-notice statute, she will be considered as having notice of the prior conveyance. Therefore, Charlene will be considered the owner of the property, even though she did not actually own it at the time of the conveyance."
