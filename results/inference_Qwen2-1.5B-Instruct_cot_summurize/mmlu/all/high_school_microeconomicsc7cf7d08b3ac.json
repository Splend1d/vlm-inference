The firm will realize zero economic profits.\n\nIn the long run, firms operating under perfect competition will have no barriers to entry and exit, which means that there will be many other firms selling similar products at the same price. As a result, prices will tend to be set by the market, and firms will earn no economic profit (a loss) since they cannot charge more than the competitive equilibrium price.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that even though the firm might not make any economic profit in the long run, it may still earn some residual income from fixed costs or other sources if it can differentiate its product from competitors' offerings or if it has access to resources such as land or raw materials that other firms do not have.\n\nRegarding non-price competition, it refers to the use of various strategies by firms to gain an advantage over their competitors, such as advertising, branding, and customer service. In the context of perfect competition, these types of activities would likely not lead to significant differences in market power between firms."
