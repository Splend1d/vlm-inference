Results show an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among these students during finals week. It is hypothesized that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. Which of the following laboratory findings in these students during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis?\n\nA. Decreased AM serum cortisol concentration\nB. Decreased macrophage activity\nC. Increased basophil count\nD. Increased lymphocyte count\n"

Decreased macrophage activity\n\nDuring stressful periods such as exam weeks, the body's immune response can become overwhelmed due to the high demand on the immune system to fight off potential pathogens. As a result, there may be a decrease in the production or activation of macrophages, which are white blood cells responsible for phagocytosis (the engulfing of foreign bodies by phagocytes) and are important for inflammation and tissue repair.\n\nThis decrease in macrophage activity could potentially lead to reduced inflammation and increased susceptibility to infections. However, it's essential to note that other factors like nutritional status, physical exercise, and sleep quality also play significant roles in maintaining a healthy immune system."
