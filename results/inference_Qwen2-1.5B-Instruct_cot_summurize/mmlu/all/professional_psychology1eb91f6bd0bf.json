While it is true that people tend to have less complex words or concepts stored in their memory as they age, this does not necessarily mean that their overall intelligence has decreased. In fact, research suggests that older adults may be able to better understand and use new information than younger individuals. However, it is important to note that these findings are based on studies conducted on healthy individuals, and more research is needed to fully understand the impact of aging on cognitive abilities."
