To achieve this, the labor market must be functioning effectively and efficiently. Therefore, reducing unemployment rates can lead to increased productivity and economic growth by increasing the number of workers available for employment and contributing to the overall productivity of the workforce. On the other hand, an increase in the unemployment rate or a decrease in the population would not have a positive impact on economic growth."
