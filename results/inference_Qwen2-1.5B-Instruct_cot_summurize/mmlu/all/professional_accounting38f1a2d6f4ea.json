The agreement calls for an interest rate of 10% on fund used, a 15% compensating balance, and a commitment fee of 1% on the unused amount of the credit line. Assuming that the compensating balance would not otherwise be maintained, the effective annual interest cost if the firm borrows $200,000 for one year is closest to\n\nA. 11.5 percent.\nB. 15 percent.\nC. 26.5 percent.\nD. 13.53 percent.\n"

The compensating balance (15% of the borrowed amount).\n3. The commitment fee (1% on the unused amount).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total borrowing amount:\n$200,000 + $200,000 * 15% = $240,000\n\nNext, we'll add the commitment fee to this total:\n$240,000 + $240,000 * 1% = $242,000\n\nNow, we can calculate the effective annual interest cost by adding these amounts together:\n$200,000 * 10% + $242,000 = $40,000 + $242,000 = $282,000\n\nFinally, we divide by the principal amount to get the effective annual interest rate:\n$282,000 / $200,000 = 1.41\n\nConverting this to a percentage gives us:\n1.41 * 100% = 141%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 13.53 percent."
