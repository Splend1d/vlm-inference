Since a basis for V contains only eigenvectors of T, we can write any element of V as a linear combination of these eigenvectors. This means that any matrix in U can be written as a product of an eigenvalue times its corresponding eigenvector. Therefore, U is equal to M(V), which is the set of all invertible matrices.\n\nII. dim(U) + dim(W) = n^2\n\nThis statement is false. The dimension of U is 1 because it's just the identity matrix I, so dim(U) = 1. However, the dimension of W depends on the specific matrix T. Without knowing more about T, we cannot determine its effect on the dimensions of U and W.\n\nIII. dim(U) < n\n\nThis statement is also false. From our analysis in I, we know that dim(U) = 1. So, this statement is not true either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B**. II only."
