Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn both scenarios, the main character is performing actions that may not align with their personal values or beliefs, but they are not necessarily doing anything morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Laughing at someone who made a joke is generally considered acceptable behavior if it's done without intent to harm or offend others. Throwing nuts to small squirrels for amusement could also be seen as harmless fun, especially if the squirrels are not endangered species. Therefore, neither scenario involves doing something clearly morally wrong."
