The parties agreed orally on a price of $100,000 for the system, but continued to negotiate over several points. When all matters regarding the air-conditioning system were finally settled, the parties signed a written agreement. It provided that the price for the system, which would be delivered on June 1, would be $110,000. The written agreement, a lengthy form contract, did not contain a merger clause. The seller delivered the system on June 1, but the buyer refused to pay more than $100,000, citing the earlier oral agreement as to price. The seller sued the buyer for the additional $10,000 under the written agreement. Is the court likely to admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000?\n\nA. No, because the buyer assumed the risk of any mistake as to price.\nB. No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement.\nC. Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.\nD. Yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause.\n"

Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.\n\nWhen drafting contracts, it is important to consider how the terms will affect the final document. In this case, the written agreement did not contain a merger clause, meaning that the oral agreement was still in effect and could potentially override the written agreement if the buyer took action based on the oral agreement.\n\nThe buyer's refusal to pay the higher price may have been influenced by the earlier oral agreement, even though it was not explicitly stated in the written agreement. Therefore, the court is likely to admit the evidence of the orally agreed price of $100,000 to determine whether the written agreement should be reformed or modified to reflect the original intent of the parties."
