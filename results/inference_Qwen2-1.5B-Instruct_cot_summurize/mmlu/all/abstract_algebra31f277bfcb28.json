                    "text": "Statement 1: The image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements.\nThis statement is true because in general, the size of the image of a group under a homomorphism does not depend on the order of the original group, but rather depends only on the structure and properties of the homomorphism itself. In this case, we can assume that the homomorphism has a kernel (the set of elements mapped to the identity element), which must be a subgroup of the original group. Since there are 5 non-identity elements in the original group, there must be at least one subgroup of the original group with 5 elements. By Lagrange's theorem, this means that the image of the homomorphism will have at most 5 elements as well. However, if the homomorphism is surjective (onto), then it could map all 6 elements of the original group to the same element in the image, resulting in an image of 6 elements. So the image of the group under the homomorphism could be any number between 5 and 6 inclusive, including both 5 and 6. Therefore, the first statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: There is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.\nThis statement is also true because by the previous argument, it is possible for there to exist such a homomorphism. For example, consider the trivial homomorphism from any group G to itself, which maps every element to the identity element. This homomorphism has a kernel consisting of just the identity element, so its image consists of the entire group G. Since G has 6 elements, its image under this homomorphism will have exactly 6 elements. Therefore, the second statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. True, True."
