The court should\n\nA. grant the request, because it promotes expeditious and economical disposition of the proceedings.\nB. grant the request, because the standard of care is amply supported by information supplied to the court.\nC. deny the request, because judicial notice cannot be taken of matters that are ultimate issues in the case.\nD. deny the request if the judge determines that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute.\n"

Deny the request if the judge determines that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute. \n\nJudicial notice is the doctrine under which a fact is admitted as true without requiring proof at trial. In this case, the customer is asking the court to take judicial notice of the printed statement from a printer's association defining the minimum standard of skill for printing companies in the area. However, the court must first determine whether the statement is subject to reasonable dispute before granting the request.\n\nIf the court finds that the statement is not subject to reasonable dispute, then it can take judicial notice of it. However, if the court finds that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute, then it may deny the request. This means that the court will not admit the statement as true without further proof or evidence.\n\nIn summary, the court should consider whether the statement is subject to reasonable dispute before taking judicial notice of it. If the statement is not subject to reasonable dispute, then the court can take judicial notice of it. If the statement is subject to reasonable dispute, then the court may deny the request."
