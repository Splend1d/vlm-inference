It was named after its chief proponent, U.S. Secretary of State James F. Marshall. The plan provided financial assistance to Europe in the form of loans and grants to rebuild infrastructure, industries, and economies. The Marshall Plan had a significant impact on the political landscape of Europe, as it helped to stabilize the region and prevent the spread of communism."
