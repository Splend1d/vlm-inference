Decrease spending and increase the reserve ratio.\n\nDecreasing spending can help reduce the money supply, which in turn can slow down economic growth and decrease inflationary pressures. Increasing the reserve ratio can also help reduce the money supply by limiting the amount of money banks can lend out. This will ultimately lead to lower interest rates and slower economic growth, which can help prevent inflation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because decreasing taxes while increasing the reserve ratio would not necessarily reduce inflation. Option C is incorrect because selling government securities would actually increase the money supply, not decrease it. Option D is incorrect because increasing taxes would only exacerbate inflation, as higher tax rates would lead to reduced consumer spending and investment."
