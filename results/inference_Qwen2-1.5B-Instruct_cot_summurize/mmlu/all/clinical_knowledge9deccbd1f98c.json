Pain resulting from actual or potential tissue damage, which causes the release of chemical mediators that stimulate nerve fibres to initiate pain signals to the brain.\n\nThis type of pain is commonly known as nociceptive pain and it results from damage to tissues or injury to nearby nerves. It can be caused by various factors such as physical trauma, inflammation, infection, or disease processes.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it refers to pressure on a nerve or group of nerves, which is not the same thing as nociceptive pain.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it is referring to a disorder of a specific nerve or group of nerves, which is different from nociceptive pain.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it refers to pain resulting from a disorder of the central nervous system, which is not related to nociceptive pain."
