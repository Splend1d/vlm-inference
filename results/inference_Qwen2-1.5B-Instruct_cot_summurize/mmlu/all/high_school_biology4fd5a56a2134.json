This integration allows the bacteria to express the ampicillin resistance gene when it encounters the antibiotic ampicillin, which kills or inhibits the growth of other bacteria that lack this resistance.\n\nTo produce multiple copies of the plasmid, the bacteria must divide repeatedly during their life cycle, allowing each daughter cell to receive a copy of the plasmid. This process is called transduction and is achieved through a process called conjugation. In conjugation, the plasmid DNA is transferred from one bacterium to another via contact or by passing through a medium between them. The plasmid can also be transferred from a bacterium to a virus or directly to a cell using viral vectors. However, these methods do not involve cloning the plasmid within a suitable bacterium."
