Employees who handle cash receipts are not bonded.\n\nEmployees who handle cash receipts without proper bonding can increase the risk of fraud, as they may be more vulnerable to theft or embezzlement if they have access to sensitive information such as bank account numbers and passwords. This could lead to unauthorized transactions that result in material misstatements in the financial statements. \n\nOther options:\n\n- Industry trends: While these might indicate potential risks, they do not directly relate to the risk of fraudulent financial reporting. Fraudulent activity can occur regardless of industry trends.\n- Bank reconciliations: Although bank reconciliation processes can help identify discrepancies between bank records and accounting records, they alone cannot eliminate the risk of fraudulent financial reporting.\n- Equipment depreciation: While equipment is sometimes sold at a loss, this does not necessarily indicate fraudulent activity. If the equipment was purchased for less than its fair market value and has been properly depreciated, it may not pose a significant risk."
