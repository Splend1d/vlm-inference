The infection can be asymptomatic in some cases, but it can also cause symptoms such as painful urination, discharge from the penis, pelvic pain, and testicular swelling in men. In women, gonorrhea can cause symptoms such as vaginal itching, burning during urination, and a white, yellow, or green discharge. Both men and women can contract gonorrhea, and it can affect any part of the body, including the throat, eye, and rectum. Antibiotics are effective treatments for gonorrhea, and there are several different types of antibiotics available that can be used to treat the infection. It's important to get tested if you suspect you have gonorrhea, as early treatment can help prevent complications and reduce the risk of transmission to others."
