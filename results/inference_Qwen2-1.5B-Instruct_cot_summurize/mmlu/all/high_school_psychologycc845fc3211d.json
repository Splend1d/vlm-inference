The therapist helps the client to gradually face their fears through various techniques such as deep breathing, visualization, and gradual exposure to the feared stimuli. This process is designed to help the client build confidence and overcome their anxiety over time. Hypnotic suggestions may be used at times, but they are not the primary method used in systematic desensitization."
