This is because any cyclic group under addition (or multiplication if it's abelian) has a subgroup that is also cyclic. So, the homomorphic image of a cyclic group will be cyclic.\nThe statement about the homomorphic image of an Abelian group being Abelian is false. This is because in general, the homomorphic image of an Abelian group may not necessarily be Abelian. For example, consider the group of integers modulo n under addition. Its homomorphic image under addition modulo m for another integer m divides n, but this does not imply that the resulting group is Abelian. In fact, the group of integers modulo n under addition modulo m can be non-Abelian even when n and m are coprime. Therefore, statement 2 is false.\nSo, the correct answer is B. False, False."
