All of the above\n\nInternational trade agreements typically use a combination of mechanisms, including reciprocity, reputational concerns, side payments, and other forms of compensation or adjustment to ensure that all parties involved benefit from the agreement. For example, under the World Trade Organization (WTO), member countries negotiate free trade agreements with each other through negotiations known as roundtables and discussions on specific issues such as agriculture, services, and intellectual property rights. The agreements often include provisions related to transparency, dispute settlement, and enforcement, and may also involve side payments or other types of compensation for adjustment costs. Ultimately, the goal is to create a level playing field for businesses and promote economic growth and prosperity globally."
