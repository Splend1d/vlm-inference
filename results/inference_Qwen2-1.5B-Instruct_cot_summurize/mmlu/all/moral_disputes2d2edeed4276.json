Drug prohibition would be paternalistic, but its consequences would be good enough to outweigh considerations about paternalism.\nC. Drug prohibition would be targeted to adults, and one can only be paternalistic toward children.\nD. Paternalism is always justified when the paternalistic practices truly are in the best interest of those affected.\n"

He suggests that by preventing people from obtaining drugs, we are protecting public health and safety, reducing crime, and promoting social stability. These are all legitimate goals, even if they may be difficult to achieve through legal means alone.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it implies that drug prohibition would be paternalistic regardless of its outcomes. Option C is also incorrect because it assumes that drug prohibition cannot target adults without being paternalistic. Finally, option D is incorrect because it conflates the concept of paternalism with other ethical principles such as autonomy and justice, which do not necessarily apply in the context of drug prohibition."
