She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Twelve months ago, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She currently takes no medications. Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155/94 mm Hg, 145/90 mm Hg, and 150/92 mm Hg. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight. Her blood pressure today is 150/90 mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hematocrit is 40%. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\nA. Exercise and weight reduction program\nB. Measurement of urine catecholamine concentrations\nC. Measurement of urine corticosteroid concentrations\nD. Captopril therapy\n"

Captopril therapy\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, medical history, physical exam findings, and laboratory results, the most appropriate next step in management would be to consider captopril therapy as a potential cause of her high blood pressure. Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that works by blocking the action of ACE, which helps to lower blood pressure. Other treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as exercise and weight loss, but these do not address the underlying cause of her hypertension. Additionally, further testing to rule out any other causes of high blood pressure should also be considered."
