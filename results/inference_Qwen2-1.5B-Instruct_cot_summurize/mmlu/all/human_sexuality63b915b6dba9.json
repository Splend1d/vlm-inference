Most swingers also tend to have tolerant attitudes towards various forms of \"exotic\" sexuality.\n\nSwingers often seek out individuals who share their interests and values, and they may be open to exploring different forms of sexual expression as long as it aligns with their own personal boundaries and desires. They may also be willing to explore new experiences together and try things that they might not consider doing solo. Overall, swinging can be seen as an opportunity for individuals to connect with others who share similar interests and values, while also allowing them to explore new aspects of themselves and their sexuality."
