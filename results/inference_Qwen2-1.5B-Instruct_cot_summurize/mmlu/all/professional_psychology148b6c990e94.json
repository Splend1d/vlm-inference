In the context of learning, this means that when someone learns to behave in a particular way, they may continue to do so because they feel good about it and want to repeat the behavior.\nThis self-reinforcement mechanism helps explain why in the absence of external rewards, some behaviors may still be learned in the absence of models or other stimuli. For example, if someone learns to behave in a particular way as a result of their own actions or experiences (such as through trial and error), they may continue to do so even without any external reinforcement.\nHowever, it is important to note that self-reinforcement alone does not guarantee long-term maintenance of learned behavior. The behavior must also be reinforced by others in order for it to become a stable part of one's repertoire of skills and abilities."
