In some cases, withholding certain pieces of information, such as the length of time an interview will take, may be necessary to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the participants.\n3. Participants who know exactly what the researcher is intending to study may be more likely to comply with the consent process, but this could also lead to manipulation or coercion.\n4. Even if participants are aware of the research and its potential risks, they may still feel pressure from others or societal norms to participate, which can undermine the consent process."
