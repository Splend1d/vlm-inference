The core will always dominate the periphery.\n\nThis statement contradicts the concept of cumulative causation, which suggests that economic development and prosperity tend to flow from the core (advanced countries) to the periphery (developing countries). It also contradicts the idea that regions with initial advantages can keep and expand them by attracting labor, capital, and trade, leading to growth and prosperity for themselves. Instead, the theory emphasizes the role of inequality and power dynamics between regions in shaping global economic relationships."
