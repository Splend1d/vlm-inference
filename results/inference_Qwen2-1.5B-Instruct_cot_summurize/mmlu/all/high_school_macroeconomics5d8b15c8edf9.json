This increases the value of the dollar because there are more dollars available for other currencies to be exchanged for. At the same time, this also increases the value of the yen because there are fewer yen available for other currencies to be exchanged for. Therefore, as the US economy expands, both the dollar and the yen tend to appreciate relative to each other."
