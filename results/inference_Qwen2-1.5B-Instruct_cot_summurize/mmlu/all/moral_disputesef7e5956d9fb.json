It is important to consider all perspectives and work towards solutions that address the root causes of poverty and inequality rather than simply blaming one group for the problems faced by others. Therefore, option C (both A and B) is not correct. Option D (None of the above) is also incorrect as it does not reflect any of the options provided."
