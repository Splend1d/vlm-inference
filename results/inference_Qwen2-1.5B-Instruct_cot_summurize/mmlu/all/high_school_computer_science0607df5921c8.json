(int) (Math.random() * (high - low)) + low.\n\nExplanation: The `nextIntInRange` method takes two parameters, `low` and `high`, which represent the inclusive range of integers for generating a random number within. In this case, we want to generate a random integer between `low` and `high`. \n\nOption A, `(int) (Math.random() * high) + low`, generates a random double between 0 and 1, then multiplies it by `high` and adds `low`. This results in a random integer greater than or equal to `low` but less than `high`.\n\nOption B, `(int) (Math.random() * (high - low)) + low`, uses `(Math.random() * (high - low))` instead of `Math.random()` directly because the result of `Math.random()` is typically between 0 and 1, so multiplying it by `(high - low)` scales it to be between 0 and `(high - low)`. Then adding `low` ensures the final result falls within the desired range.\n\nOption C, `(int) (Math.random() * (high - low + 1)) + low`, calculates `(Math.random() * (high - low + 1))` as before, but then adds `low` again to ensure the final result falls within the specified range.\n\nOption D, `(int) (Math.random() * (high + low)) + low`, also uses `(Math.random() * (high - low))` to scale its result from between 0 and `(high - low)`, but then subtracts `low` to make sure the final result is within the range `[low, high]`.\n\nTherefore, only option B correctly satisfies the requirement of returning an integer in the range [low, high], inclusive."
