                    "text": "The correct answer is C: The variability (range) of scores on the criterion varies for different scores on the predictor.\n\nHeteroscedasticity refers to the phenomenon where the variance of the residuals or errors in a regression model increases as the value of the independent variable increases. This can happen when there is a non-linear relationship between the predictor and criterion, such that the variability of the criterion score increases with an increase in the predictor score.\n\nIn other words, heteroscedasticity means that the error terms (residuals) have varying variances across different levels of the independent variable, which may indicate that there is no linear relationship between the predictor and criterion variables. Therefore, it suggests that the relationship between the predictor and criterion cannot be described by a straight line.\n\nSo option A is incorrect because heteroscedasticity does not necessarily mean that there is a restriction of range of scores on the predictor and/or the criterion. Option B is also incorrect because heteroscedasticity does not imply any kind of statistical significance between the predictor and criterion variables. Option D is also incorrect because heteroscedasticity does not always indicate a non-linear relationship between the predictor and criterion variables."
