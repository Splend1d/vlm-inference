However, based solely on the information provided:\n\nScenario 1: Encouraging someone to do something that is harmful or dangerous for them.\nThis scenario involves encouraging your son to eat thirty grapes without proper supervision or concern for his well-being.\n\nScenario 2: Placing pieces of glass under someone else's bed.\nPlacing objects like glass under someone else's bed can cause harm or injury, especially if it falls or breaks accidentally. This action may not necessarily involve direct harm but still goes against common sense and safety precautions.\n\nTherefore, the answer would depend on what kind of moral standards you consider to be \"ordinary\" in the US at this time (as of 2020). If the US has more stringent laws about placing glass in people's beds or excessive amounts of food consumption, then Scenario 2 might be considered wrong, while Scenario 1 could be seen differently due to differing cultural norms regarding children's health and safety.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for an objective comparison between the two scenarios, based on the information given, both scenarios seem to involve morally questionable actions that could lead to harm or negative consequences, so the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong."
