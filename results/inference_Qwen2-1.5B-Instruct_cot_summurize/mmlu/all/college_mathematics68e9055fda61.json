H = 50:\nThe probability of getting exactly 50 heads in 100 tosses can be calculated using combinations since it's a binomial distribution problem.\n\\[ P(H=50) = \\binom{100}{50} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{100} \\]\n\nB. T >= 60:\nThis is not directly related to the number of heads, so it doesn't provide any information about the probability.\n\nC. 51 <= H <= 55:\nThis means that there are at least 51 heads but less than or equal to 55 heads. We can use similar reasoning as above to calculate this probability:\n\\[ P(51 \\leq H \\leq 55) = \\sum_{k=51}^{55} \\binom{100}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{100} \\]\n\nD. H >= 48 and T >= 48:\nThis condition combines both heads (H) and tails (T). The probability of getting at least 48 heads and at least 48 tails in 100 tosses is:\n\\[ P(H \\geq 48, T \\geq 48) = \\binom{100}{48} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{100} + \\binom{100}{49} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{100} + \\cdots + \\binom{100}{100} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{100} \\]\n\nCalculating these probabilities directly would require calculating binomial coefficients, which involves a lot of arithmetic. However, by observing patterns or simplifying expressions based on combinatorial identities, you can estimate the values more quickly. For example, if we assume that most outcomes will have relatively small binomial coefficients, we might notice that the sum over all possible k values will likely dominate due to symmetry (since the number of ways to get exactly k heads out of 100 tosses is the same as the number of ways to get exactly \\(100 - k\\) tails), leading to a dominant term that is much larger than others.\n\nGiven that this is an estimation exercise rather than a direct calculation, the actual calculations for the probabilities in D may not yield particularly large numbers, especially considering the complexity involved. Based on the nature of the question and the assumption made, however, the answer could potentially involve quite a bit of computation to accurately identify the maximum probability from among the options provided."
