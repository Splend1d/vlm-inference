The study found that changes in the composition of plant communities were associated with shifts in the diets of these prehistoric humans.\n\nOption A (species focused on grasses to nuts and fruits) is not supported by the research as it does not align with the findings. This option assumes that the ancient hominids consumed grasses exclusively before transitioning to other foods like nuts and fruits.\n\nOption B (meat to fruits and vegetables) is also not supported by the research. While some early hominins did consume meat, the evidence for this is limited and uncertain, and there is no clear evidence that they primarily consumed fruits and vegetables.\n\nOption C (fruits and vegetables to fish) is consistent with the research findings. There is strong evidence from fossil records that early hominins began consuming fruits and vegetables around 2-3 million years ago, followed by the introduction of fish consumption around 1.5 million years ago.\n\nOption D (nuts and fruits to species more focused on grasses) is also not supported by the research. While the evidence for a shift towards a more grass-based diet is less clear, it is possible that changes in the availability of grasses and other plant resources led to a shift towards a more grass-based diet.\n\nIn summary, based on the research, the most likely scenario is that changes in plant communities were associated with shifts in the diets of ancient hominids from species focused on grasses to ones more focused on fruits and vegetables."
