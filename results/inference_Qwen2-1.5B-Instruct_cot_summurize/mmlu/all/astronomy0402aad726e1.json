The denser materials, such as rock and metal, sink towards the center of the solar system due to their lower density compared to gas like hydrogen and helium. As a result, the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) are mostly composed of dense materials, while the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) have more gaseous material.\n\nThe other options provided do not accurately explain why the inner planets are made of denser materials than the outer planets. Option A suggests that the outer planets had more time to cool down and condense, but this does not account for the fact that the denser materials settle towards the center of the solar system due to gravity. Option C suggests that the denser materials sank to the center of the solar system, which is not supported by evidence from the formation of the solar system. And option B suggests that only heavy elements could condense, which is also incorrect based on the observed distribution of elements in the solar system."
