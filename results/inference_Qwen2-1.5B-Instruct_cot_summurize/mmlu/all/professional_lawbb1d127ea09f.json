He believed that the driver was acting irritable and fidgety, but he had no articulable reason to think anything was wrong. He searched the car anyway and found two cartons of freshly canned peaches, which were owned by the driver's neighbor and reported stolen off of her porch 24 hours earlier. Authorities charged him with theft under the state criminal code. His motion to suppress the evidence because of an unlawful search was denied. On appeal, will the appellate court likely reverse the lower court decision denying the motion to suppress?\n\nA. Yes, because the search was unconstitutional due to the officer having no reasonable suspicion that would justify searching the car.\nB. Yes, because when a car is pulled over for speeding, the officer must always obtain a search warrant prior to making any search.\nC. No, the stop and the search were within the normal bounds of propriety for a speeding stop.\nD. No, because driver being fidgety is enough for a probable cause full search of the vehicle.\n"

Yes, because the search was unconstitutional due to the officer having no reasonable suspicion that would justify searching the car.\n\nWhen a police officer pulls someone over for a traffic violation, they have a legal right to conduct a search of the vehicle if there is \"probable cause\" or \"reasonable suspicion\" to believe that illegal activity has occurred. However, this right can be overridden if the officer lacks reasonable suspicion based on objective facts rather than subjective feelings.\n\nIn this case, the officer lacked reasonable suspicion based on the fact that the driver was fidgety and acting irritable during the stop. The officer did not have any concrete evidence that suggested that the driver had committed any crimes or that there was any illegal activity taking place in the vehicle. Therefore, the search conducted without a warrant was unconstitutional.\n\nTherefore, the lower court's decision denying the motion to suppress should be reversed."
