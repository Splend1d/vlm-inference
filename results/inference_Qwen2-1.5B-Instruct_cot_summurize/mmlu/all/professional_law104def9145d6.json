At the defendant's trial, several eyewitnesses testified that they had seen a large redheaded man pull out a gun and rob the owner of the liquor store. The defendant appeared at trial with a shaven head. The prosecution calls a corrections officer to testify that the defendant had red hair when he was first brought to jail. The defendant's counsel objects. The trial judge should rule the correction officer's testimony\n\nA. admissible as a prior identification.\nB. admissible, for the limited purpose of clarifying the discrepancy in the witnesses' testimony.\nC. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\nD. inadmissible, because it is opinion testimony.\n"

In this case, the correction officer's testimony about the defendant's red hair when he was first brought to jail is hearsay because it is not directly related to the witness's personal knowledge or experience. The defense objecting to the testimony would be valid under Rule 407 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides that evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nTherefore, the jury cannot consider the correction officer's testimony about the defendant's red hair when deciding whether the defendant committed the crime. The trial judge should instruct the jury on the limitations of hearsay exceptions and allow the prosecution to present only relevant evidence from direct and collateral sources."
