After a doctor reset the broken nose, the patient was transferred to a room in the west wing of the hospital. In extreme pain, the patient asked the nurse for a painkiller. Without seeking the doctor's approval, the nurse administered an injection of morphine, which the nurse should have known to be an excessive dosage. The patient died an hour after the injection; the cause of death was a morphine overdose.

A cause-in-fact is an action that actually caused harm or death. In this case, the nurse's action of injecting morphine was a direct cause of the patient's death by causing an overdose of morphine.\n\nAs for whether it constitutes a legal cause, there is some debate among legal experts about whether the nurse's actions can be considered a \"legal\" cause under certain circumstances. However, based on the information provided, it is clear that the nurse's action directly caused the patient's death and thus could be considered a legal cause in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: a cause-in-fact and a legal cause of the patient's death."
