It is important to respect the wishes of the children and ensure that their autonomy is respected throughout the research process. If a child does not wish to participate in the study, it is not ethical or responsible to include them without their explicit consent. Additionally, asking the teacher for more information may not provide enough context to make an informed decision about whether to include the child in the study."
