It is the sum of all consumer and producer demands, adjusted for differences in income elasticity and price elasticities of demand. This means that the AD curve is not simply a horizontal summation of any set of market demand curves, but rather it reflects the overall level of economic activity and consumption across all sectors of the economy."
