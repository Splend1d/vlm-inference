Therefore, the correct answer is B. White House Office. \n\nReorganization Plan 1 of 1939, also known as the Reorganization Plan No. 1, was an executive order issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939. It aimed to streamline government operations and reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy. The plan created new agencies and reduced the number of existing ones.\n\nIn this context, the question asks about the authority of the president to select the staff for specific offices or functions within the executive branch. Given that the Reorganization Plan No. 1 focused on streamlining government operations and reducing the size of the executive branch, it would be appropriate to assume that the president has some degree of control over the selection of staff for these offices.\n\nHowever, without further information about the scope of the presidential authority under the Reorganization Plan No. 1, we cannot definitively determine whether the White House Office is one of the offices where the president can select staff. The Reorganization Plan's purpose was to reform the executive branch, not to assign individual duties to specific individuals. Therefore, while it is possible that the White House Office could have been subject to such reforms, it is not clear from the given information alone that the president has exclusive power to select its staff."
