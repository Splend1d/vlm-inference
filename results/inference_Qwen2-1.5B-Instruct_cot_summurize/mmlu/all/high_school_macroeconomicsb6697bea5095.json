When prices rise in the United States relative to other countries, it means that the purchasing power of the US dollar has decreased compared to other currencies. This can lead to a depreciation of the dollar against other currencies, as it becomes more expensive for foreigners to buy goods and services from the United States. Therefore, the value of the dollar will tend to depreciate rather than appreciate."
