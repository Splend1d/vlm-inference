Increase aggregate demand which will increase real output and increase employment.\n\nExpansionary monetary policy involves lowering interest rates, which encourages borrowing and spending by businesses and consumers. This can lead to an increase in aggregate demand (the total amount of money spent by households, businesses, and the government), which can boost economic activity and create jobs. The goal of expansionary monetary policy is typically to stimulate growth during a recession or downturn, rather than to reduce aggregate demand. However, it's important to note that other factors like fiscal policy and business confidence also play a role in determining whether a recession is expanding or contracting."
