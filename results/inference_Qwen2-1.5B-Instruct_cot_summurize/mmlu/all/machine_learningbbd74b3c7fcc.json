In polynomial regression, the number of terms in the polynomial can affect how well the model fits the data. If the polynomial degree is too high (e.g., using a quintic polynomial instead of a quadratic), the model may fit the training data too closely, leading to overfitting. On the other hand, if the polynomial degree is too low (e.g., using only linear terms), the model may not capture all the relevant features in the data, resulting in underfitting. Therefore, the polynomial degree is the most important structural assumption for controlling overfitting in polynomial regression."
