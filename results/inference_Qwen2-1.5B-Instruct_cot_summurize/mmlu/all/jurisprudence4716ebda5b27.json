It opens the door to authoritarianism.\n\nWhile Dworkin's concept of law as integrity emphasizes the importance of upholding legal rules, it does not necessarily imply an open door to authoritarianism. In fact, one of Dworkin's central arguments is that law as integrity can be used to resist authoritarianism by ensuring that laws are based on principles rather than just on power or personal interest.\n\nTherefore, while Dworkin's approach may lead to greater individual rights and liberty, it is unlikely to result in a society where the government has absolute authority over citizens. Instead, it could help to limit the scope of state power and promote democratic values such as freedom of speech, association, and expression."
