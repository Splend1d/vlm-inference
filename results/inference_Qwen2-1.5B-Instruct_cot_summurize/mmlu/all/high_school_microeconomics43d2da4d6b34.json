In other words, it's about the ability to produce more of a product with less input compared to others.\n\nAbsolute advantage, on the other hand, means that a country produces all its goods using the least amount of resources. This implies that the production costs per unit for each type of good is lower for that country when compared to other countries.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Ray can pull 50 weeds per hour of cooking.\n- Dorothy can pull 100 weeds per hour of cooking.\n\nIf Ray were to cook instead of pulling weeds, his comparative advantage would be higher (because he could produce more of one good using fewer inputs), while if Dorothy were to pull weeds instead of cooking, her comparative advantage would also be higher because she could produce more of one good using fewer inputs.\n\nTherefore, based on these calculations, the correct answer is **C. Dorothy cooks, since she has comparative advantage in cooking**."
