When the defendant was approached by an FBI investigator, the defendant stated that her invitation to the procurement officer to spend his vacation in the defendant's mountain cabin was a favor to a friend, unrelated to his government office. The defendant also said to the investigator that she would reveal some \"hot\" information on a large-scale fraud in exchange for the investigator's promise to \"stop worrying about a little vacation.\" a little vacation.\" Is the investigator's testimony about the defendant's offer to give information admissible?\n\nA. No, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nB. No, because the defendant made the offer in a negotiation for settlement of a criminal investigation.\nC.

Therefore, they can be admitted as hearsay under the business records exception or the declarant testifying about a prior inconsistent statement. Additionally, the fact that the defendant made the offer while being investigated suggests that it may have been relevant to the case at hand."
