KMnO4 (potassium permanganate).\n\nPotassium permanganate is a strong oxidizing agent that can oxidize a wide range of organic and inorganic compounds. When exposed to air, it decomposes into oxygen gas and manganese(II) oxide, but this process is reversible.\n\nOther options like aluminum (Al), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), zinc (Zn), and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) are not strong enough oxidizers compared to potassium permanganate. \n\nTherefore, the best choice among these options is potassium permanganate for oxidizing substances when chlorine or its substitutes are unavailable."
