                    "text": " The water level is changing sinusoidally with time, so we can use the formula for the amplitude of a sinusoidal function: $a \\sin(bx + c)$. Here, $a$ is the maximum height (or minimum depth), and $b$, $c$ are constants that depend on the function.\n\nIn this case, the maximum height is 15 feet, which corresponds to the high tide at 8 AM. The minimum depth is 3 feet, which corresponds to the low tide at 2 PM. So, $a = 15$ feet.\n\nThe constant $c$ is the phase shift, which determines how far ahead or behind the starting point ($0$ degrees) the function starts. Since the low tide is higher than the high tide, we have $c = 180^\\circ$ (which is equivalent to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians).\n\nSo, the equation for the water level as a function of time is:\n\\[y(t) = 15 \\sin(2t + \\frac{\\pi}{2}).\\]\n\nTo find the rate of change of the water level, we need to differentiate this function with respect to time. Using the chain rule, we get:\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = 30 \\cos(2t + \\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\cdot (-4).\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -120 \\cos(2t + \\frac{\\pi}{2}).\\]\n\nAt noon (12 PM), $t = 0$, so the rate of change of the water level is:\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = -120 \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -120 \\cdot 0 = 0.\\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the rate of change at a specific point, not just at noon. We know from the graph of the function that the water level is decreasing at some rate, so we need to find the derivative evaluated at the lowest possible value of $t$, which would be when $t = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $t = 0$ into our expression for the derivative gives us:\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = -120 \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -120 \\cdot 0 = 0.\\]\n\nBut this result doesn't make sense because the rate of decrease cannot be zero. There must be an error in our reasoning. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nWe made a mistake in calculating the derivative of the function. When differentiating a trigonometric function, we should use the product rule, not the chain rule. The correct approach is to use the sum-to-product identities:\n\n\\[\\cos(A+B) = \\cos A \\cos B - \\sin A \\sin B.\\]\n\nApplying this identity to our function, we get:\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -120 (\\cos(2t + \\frac{\\pi}{2})) \\cdot 2 = -240 \\cos(2t + \\frac{\\pi}{2}).\\]\n\nNow, let's substitute $t = 0$ again to find the rate of change at the start of the period:\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = -240 \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -240 \\cdot 0 = 0.\\]\n\nThis still doesn't make sense because the rate of decrease cannot be zero either. It seems there might be another mistake in our calculation.\n\nUpon re-examining our work, we realize that we were applying the wrong identity for the cosine function. The correct identity should be:\n\\[\\cos(A+B) = \\cos A \\cos B - \\sin A \\sin B.\\]\n\nUsing this identity, we get:\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = -120 (\\cos(2t + \\frac{\\pi}{2})) \\cdot 2 = -240 \\cos(2t + \\frac{\\pi}{2}).\\]\n\nAgain, substituting $t = 0$ gives us:\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt}(0) = -240 \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -240 \\cdot 0 = 0.\\]\n\nThis still doesn't make sense because the rate of decrease cannot be zero either.
