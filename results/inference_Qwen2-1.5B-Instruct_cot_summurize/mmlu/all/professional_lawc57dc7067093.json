One evening, the consumer was driving along a city street when he saw the traffic light facing him turn from green to amber. He sped up, hoping to cross the intersection before the light turned red. However, he quickly realized that he could not do so and applied the brakes, which failed because of a defect in the brake mechanism. The consumer then swerved to avoid hitting a bus that was crossing the intersection at a right angle to him. As a result of the swerve, the consumer's car rode up on the sidewalk and overturned, pinning a pedestrian. Both the consumer and the pedestrian were severely injured. If the consumer asserts a claim against the car dealer based on strict liability in tort, will the plaintiff prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the brakes failed while the consumer was driving his car.\nB. Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\nC. No, because the consumer contributed to his own injury by speeding up.\nD. No, because the car dealer carefully inspected the car before selling it.\n"

Yes, because the brakes failed because of a defect present when the consumer purchased the car.\n\nStrict liability for failure to warn or defects in design is a legal doctrine that holds manufacturers responsible for injuries caused by their products even if they did not intend those injuries to occur. In this case, the brake system malfunctioned while the consumer was driving, causing them to lose control of their vehicle. This event would fall under the category of \"injury\" as defined by strict liability law, and thus, the manufacturer (the car dealer) would be held liable for any resulting harm, including injuries sustained by the consumer.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n- Option A: While the brakes failed during the act of driving, it does not necessarily mean that the consumer was driving recklessly or carelessly, which is typically required to establish strict liability. \n\n- Option C: The consumer's speeding up was an action taken voluntarily, which is not a factor in determining whether strict liability applies.\n\n- Option D: The fact that the car dealer thoroughly inspected the vehicle prior to sale does not absolve them from liability. Inspection alone is insufficient to ensure the safety of a product sold, especially one with inherent risks like brakes."
