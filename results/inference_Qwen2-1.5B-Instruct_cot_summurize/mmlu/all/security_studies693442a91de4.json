Economics as the science of individuals making decisions, and applying economic science to security, allows us to understand, predict, and respond to the behaviour of states and other security actors.\nB. The growth of capitalism has catapulted the individual consumer to a place of extreme significance in shaping the global market. The behaviour of consumers dictates the nature of the global system.\nC. Behaviour, as a social constructivist concern, is not relevant to economic theory or security theory in general.\nD. The behaviour of states is governed by their economic interests, in terms of securing favourable trade agreements and building strong domestic markets. Thus, their behaviour is dictated by economic considerations.\n"

By understanding how individuals make choices based on economic incentives, we can identify patterns and trends that may indicate potential threats or opportunities for security.\n\nThe growth of capitalism has indeed placed individuals at the center of economic decision-making, but this does not necessarily mean that they are irrelevant to security. In fact, understanding consumer behavior can help us anticipate changes in demand, supply, and prices, which can have significant implications for national economies and security.\n\nFurthermore, behavior is a crucial aspect of any social construct, including economic theory and security theory. It shapes the way people interact with each other, form alliances and partnerships, and engage in conflict. Understanding how individuals behave can help us develop strategies to mitigate risks and promote stability in international relations.\n\nFinally, while the behavior of states is influenced by economic factors, such as trade agreements and domestic markets, it is also shaped by a range of other factors, including political ideology, military capabilities, and cultural values. Therefore, understanding state behavior requires a holistic approach that takes into account both economic and non-economic factors."
