After that point, the body transitions into aerobic metabolism, where it relies on the production of ATP through anaerobic respiration.\n\nIn contrast, aerobic exercises like jogging or cycling last longer than 1 minute, allowing for sustained energy production without requiring the immediate consumption of oxygen from aerobic metabolism. Therefore, after approximately 1 minute, maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic."
