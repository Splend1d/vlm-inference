At the end of year 2, the land was revalued, and the fair value increased to $105,000. How should the company account for the year 2 change in fair value?\n\nA.

By recognizing $10,000 in profit or loss and $5,000 in other comprehensive income.\n\nUnder IFRS, when an asset's carrying amount is reduced to its fair value through a subsequent measurement, any increase in the fair value above the original carrying amount represents a gain on the revaluation surplus. Therefore, the company recognized a gain of $10,000 (the difference between the new carrying amount and the previous carrying amount) as profit or loss.\n\nHowever, since the gain arises from the revaluation of the asset, it must also be included in the statement of changes in equity (other comprehensive income). Specifically, the gain would be reported in other comprehensive income rather than directly in profit or loss. This is because gains from revaluations are considered part of a company's ongoing operations and not separate from the overall financial performance. Therefore, the company recognizes $5,000 ($10,000 - $5,000) in other comprehensive income."
