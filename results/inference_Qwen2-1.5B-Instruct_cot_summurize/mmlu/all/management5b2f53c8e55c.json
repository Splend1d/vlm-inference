The level of rivalry.\n\nIn the five forces model, there are four main types of competitive activities:\n\n1. Threat of new entrants (Threat of entry)\n2. Bargaining power of buyers (Power of buyers)\n3. Bargaining power of suppliers (Power of suppliers)\n4. Rivalry among existing firms (Rivalry)\n\nThe level of rivalry refers to the degree to which competitors within an industry are likely to compete with each other. This can be influenced by factors such as product differentiation, market concentration, and barriers to entry. High levels of rivalry typically result in higher prices and lower profits for firms in the industry. Low levels of rivalry may lead to increased competition and lower prices."
