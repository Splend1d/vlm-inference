National program of child immunization\n\nThe national program of child immunization is designed to protect infants and children from preventable diseases that can significantly reduce their productivity and lifespan. By preventing these illnesses, the program helps to ensure that children grow up healthy and strong, which can lead to increased productivity in the long run.\n\nWhile other options may have some positive effects on population growth or job creation, they do not necessarily result in a permanent increase in a nation's productive capacity. For example, declining adult literacy rates could potentially lead to a decrease in overall productivity if there are fewer workers available for employment, while widespread relocation of manufacturing firms to low-wage nations would likely cause an increase in labor costs due to higher wages paid by foreign companies compared to domestic ones."
