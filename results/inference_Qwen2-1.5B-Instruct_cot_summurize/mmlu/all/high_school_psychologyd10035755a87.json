Homeostasis\n\nHomeostasis is the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment by regulating various physiological processes, including temperature, pH, and blood pressure. It involves the body's tendency to maintain a relatively constant state that permits cells to live and function. This process helps to prevent harm from occurring and ensures that bodily functions continue smoothly."
