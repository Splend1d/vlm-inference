This means that the person you find attractive is someone who consistently provides positive feedback and encouragement in your life. The law suggests that if you receive too much punishment or criticism, it can lead to feelings of self-doubt and discourage you from pursuing your goals. Therefore, people who provide a balanced mix of positive reinforcement and constructive criticism tend to be most appealing."
