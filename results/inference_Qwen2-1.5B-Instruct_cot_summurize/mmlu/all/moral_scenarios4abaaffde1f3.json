It is considered a common practice for people to have copies of keys if they frequently use different locks or want to keep their own lock for security purposes.\n\nHowever, in scenario 2, the main character threw his/her milk on his/her classmates' heads to put out the fire, which is not only illegal but also very harmful and disrespectful to others. This action goes against the principles of kindness, empathy, and respect towards others. Therefore, it can be classified as morally wrong."
