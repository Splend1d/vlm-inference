This simplifies to $-c \\geq 1$, or equivalently, $c \\leq -1$.\nSince we're working over $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, the elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ can be used as coefficients for polynomials. However, it's important to note that in this context, $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ represents the integers modulo 3, so we must restrict our attention to the elements from this set when considering divisibility conditions. In particular, since $|Z_3| = 3$, any element in $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ can only have at most two possible values: $0$, $1$, or $2$. \n\nGiven the above considerations, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. $0$: If $c = 0$, then $x^3 + x^2 + c = x^3 + x^2 + 0 = (x+1)(x^2+x+1)$, which is reducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, hence not a field.\n\nB. $2$: If $c = 2$, then $x^3 + x^2 + c = x^3 + x^2 + 2 = (x+1)(x^2+x+2)$, which is also reducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, hence not a field.\n\nC. $1$: If $c = 1$, then $x^3 + x^2 + c = x^3 + x^2 + 1 = (x+1)(x^2+x+1)$, which is reducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, hence not a field.\n\nD. $3$: If $c = 3$, then $x^3 + x^2 + c = x^3 + x^2 + 3 = (x+1)(x^2+x+3)$, which is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_3$, therefore it forms a field with multiplicative inverse $1/3$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. $3$."
