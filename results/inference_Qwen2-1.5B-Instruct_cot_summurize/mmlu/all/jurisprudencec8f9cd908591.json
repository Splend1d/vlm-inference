This approach rejects Rawls' theory because it focuses solely on individual capabilities and ignores the social context in which they exist. \n\nFor example, some people may have physical limitations that prevent them from accessing certain goods and services, while others may lack the necessary skills or education to benefit from them. In such cases, the capability approach would argue that these individuals should not be excluded from the benefits of society simply because they lack the ability to achieve those benefits themselves.\n\nTherefore, option A (because it fails to address the actual capabilities people have to benefit from his theory of justice) is correct. The capability approach does not take into account the actual capabilities people have to access and benefit from the goods and services provided by society."
