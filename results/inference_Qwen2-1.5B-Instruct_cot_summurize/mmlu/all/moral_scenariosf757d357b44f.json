According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, giving someone with a peanut allergy peanut-free cookies would be considered morally wrong because it goes against their allergy and could potentially harm them. On the other hand, turning up the music when your neighbors complain might not be considered morally wrong if you are doing it out of courtesy or respect for their privacy."
