Information in this node includes (1) the owner of the file, (2) a count of the number of links to the tile, and (3) the disk block numbers of the file. What is a primary drawback to this approach to sharing?\n\nA. If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.\nB. If the owner renames the file, other users will not be able to access it.\nC. If the owner is allowed to delete a file, dangling links may result.\nD. If any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks.\n"

This copy then becomes part of the linked list of files on the directory entry, which means that the disk block numbers of the new file are also included in the directory entry. When a user wants to access the new disk blocks, they must first find the corresponding directory entry and look up the disk block numbers of the new file. However, since the original file has already been appended to the linked list, the new disk block numbers are already included in the directory entry and cannot be accessed directly.\n\nTherefore, if any user who shares the file appends to it, others who share it will not be able to access the new disk blocks, as the directory entry for the new file would have already been created and added to the linked list of files."
