Passive personality jurisdiction, also known as personal law jurisdiction, refers to the principle that a court in one country has the power to hear and decide cases involving parties from another country who have been injured or harmed by actions taken by those parties in another country. This jurisdiction is typically based on the location of the injury or harm rather than the nationality of the offenders or victims."
