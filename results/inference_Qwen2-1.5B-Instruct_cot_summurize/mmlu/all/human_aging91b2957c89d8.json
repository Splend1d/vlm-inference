This can lead to a decreased sense of agency and increased vulnerability to stressors.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct - those with low capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands. Option B is incorrect as experiencing high environmental demands does not necessarily result in becoming more docile. \n\nOption C is also incorrect because experiencing high environmental demands does not necessarily lead to becoming less docile. Some individuals may actually become more resilient or adaptable in response to such demands.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because having less capability does not necessarily mean being more vulnerable to environmental demands. There are many factors that contribute to an individual's susceptibility to stressors and environmental demands, including personality traits, social support, and access to resources."
