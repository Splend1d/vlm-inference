Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character ate all of the donuts, which is not only wasteful but also goes against the principle of sharing and being considerate of others' feelings. In contrast, in scenario 2, making loud distracting noises during a class session is considered disrespectful to the teacher's authority and could potentially disrupt the learning environment. However, it is generally considered acceptable to make noise when speaking to someone else or if necessary for privacy purposes. Therefore, both actions can be seen as morally ambiguous, depending on the context and the circumstances involved."
