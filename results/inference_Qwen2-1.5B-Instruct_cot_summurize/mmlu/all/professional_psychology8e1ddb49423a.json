A factorial research design has been used.\n\nIn a factorial research design, researchers manipulate two or more independent variables and measure the effect of each on a dependent variable. This allows them to test hypotheses about how different levels of the independent variables interact with each other.\n\nBy analyzing the results of this type of research using trend analysis, researchers can identify patterns in the data that may not be immediately apparent from looking at individual values. For example, they might find that as one independent variable increases, another independent variable also increases, which suggests that there is an interaction between the two variables. They could then use this information to better understand the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.\n\nOn the other hand, if the study's dependent variable is qualitative, trend analysis would not be appropriate because it does not allow for quantifying differences between groups or individuals. Similarly, if the study's independent variable is quantitative but the dependent variable is qualitative, trend analysis would not be appropriate because it would not allow for comparisons between different categories of the dependent variable."
