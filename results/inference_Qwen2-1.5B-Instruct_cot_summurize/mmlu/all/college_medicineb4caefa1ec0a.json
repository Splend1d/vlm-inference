II and IV.\n\nTriacylglycerides consist of three fatty acid chains, each containing one carbon atom attached to the carboxyl group of an amino acid called carnitine. The fatty acids are then linked together by ester bonds, forming the backbone of the molecule. Each ester bond consists of a water molecule and a phosphate group (the latter being derived from ATP). Therefore, the correct answer is D. II and IV."
