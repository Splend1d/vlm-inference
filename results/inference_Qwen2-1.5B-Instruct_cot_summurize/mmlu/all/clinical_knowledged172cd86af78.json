Sodium valproate\n\nSodium valproate, also known as Depakote, is commonly used to treat epilepsy and other conditions, but it can sometimes cause dry mouth or oral thrush. These side effects can lead to a dry throat or hoarseness, which could be mistaken for a chronic cough.\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), long-term smoking, and long-term use of ACE inhibitors like sodium valproate can all contribute to chronic cough by causing inflammation in the esophagus or bronchial tubes. However, sodium valproate does not typically cause chronic cough on its own."
