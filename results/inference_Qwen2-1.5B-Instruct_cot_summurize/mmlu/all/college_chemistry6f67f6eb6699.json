Protons have orbital and spin angular momentum, neutrons have spin angular momentum.\n\nThis is because protons and neutrons both contain quarks, which can exist in different configurations called states. In the ground state of the proton, there are two up quarks (u) and two down quarks (d). In the ground state of the neutron, there is one up quark (u) and one down quark (d). The spin angular momentum of a particle depends on its internal structure, so the spins of the protons and neutrons will be different."
