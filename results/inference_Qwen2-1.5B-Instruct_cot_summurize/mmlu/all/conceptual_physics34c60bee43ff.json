This means that if one sound has twice the intensity as another, its intensity will be 4 times greater. If one sound has four times the intensity as another, its intensity will be 16 times greater, and so on.\n\nIn this case, we're dealing with a sound that is 80 dB louder than a sound at 60 dB. To find how much louder it is, we raise the intensity of the second sound to the power of 1/2:\n\n(80 dB)^(1/2) = 9.75 dB\n\nSo, the intensity of the second sound is 9.75 dB higher than the first sound. Therefore, the intensity of the second sound is 10 * 9.75 dB = 97.5 dB, which is over 1000 times greater than the first sound's intensity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: more than 1000 times greater."
