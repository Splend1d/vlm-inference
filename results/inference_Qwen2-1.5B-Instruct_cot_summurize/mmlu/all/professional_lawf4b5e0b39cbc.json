After an unanticipated zoning change increased the land's fair market value to $150,000 during the executory period, the owner refused to close. Wishing to avoid a lawsuit, the buyer assigned the contract (which the contract did not forbid) in an arm's-length transaction to an investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate. The investor paid the buyer $25,000. The investor knew of the owner's refusal to close, and the owner continued to refuse to close despite the investor's demands that he do so. The investor has sued the owner for specific performance. Who will likely prevail?\n\nA. The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\nB. The investor, because she has elected to waive the owner's lack of marketable title caused by the zoning change.\nC. The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.\nD. The owner, because the investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate, is entitled to money damages but not to specific performance.\n"

The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\n\nIn this scenario, the investor was an assignee of the original contract between the buyer and the owner. Under most states' laws on real property transactions, including California, if the assignor (the original party purchaser) refuses to close, the assignee may be entitled to specific performance. Specifically, the law allows an assignee to enforce the contract as though they were the original party purchaser, even if the original party has breached their obligations.\n\nTherefore, the investor will likely prevail in seeking specific performance from the owner, as long as the conditions required for such relief exist (such as the failure of the owner to close)."
