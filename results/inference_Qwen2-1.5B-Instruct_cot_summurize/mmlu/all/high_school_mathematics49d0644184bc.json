So, there are $3 \\times 2 = 6$ choices for the object.\nFinally, the remaining two roles can be filled by any of the seven members not yet assigned roles, so there are $7 \\times 6 = 42$ choices for those last two roles.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to assign the roles is $2 \\times 6 \\times 42 = 504$.
