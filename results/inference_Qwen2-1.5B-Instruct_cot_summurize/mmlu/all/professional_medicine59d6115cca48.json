                    "text": "The Starling force is the balance between hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure within the glomerular capillaries. The hydrostatic pressure is determined by the pressure difference across the afferent arteriole, while the oncotic pressure is determined by the solute concentration in the Bowman's capsule.\n\nIn this scenario, if the efferent arteriole is constricted, there will be an increase in hydrostatic pressure, as well as an increase in oncotic pressure due to the higher solute concentration in the Bowman's capsule. This means that the net hydrostatic force on the glomerular capillaries will be increased, leading to an increased filtration rate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Increased hydrostatic pressure."
