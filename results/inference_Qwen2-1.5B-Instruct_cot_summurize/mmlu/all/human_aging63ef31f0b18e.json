While it is true that older adults may experience declines in certain areas of memory, such as short-term or working memory, there are also many studies that suggest that overall cognitive function can actually improve with age if the brain is given enough stimulation and challenge. This includes learning new things, engaging in mental exercises, and maintaining social connections. By taking steps to keep their minds active and engaged, older adults can help prevent memory decline and maintain their cognitive abilities for longer."
