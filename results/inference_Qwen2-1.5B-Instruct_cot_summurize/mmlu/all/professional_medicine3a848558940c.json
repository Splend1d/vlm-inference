Order MRI of the lumbosacral spine\n\nThe patient's symptoms of recurrent low back pain suggest a potential diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis, which can be caused by narrowing of the spinal canal due to degeneration or compression of the nerves. An MRI would help diagnose the cause of the stenosis and determine whether it is causing the patient's symptoms. This information will allow for targeted treatment options such as conservative measures like physiotherapy, injections, or surgical intervention if necessary."
