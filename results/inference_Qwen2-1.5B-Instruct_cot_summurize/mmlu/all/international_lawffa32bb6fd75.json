The absence of implementing legislation with respect to the Council's founding treaty meant that individuals did not derive rights and duties from it in the English legal system.\n\nIn the context of international organizations, such as the International Tin Council, there can be different views on whether the absence of implementing legislation is problematic or not. Some argue that the absence of implementing legislation does not necessarily mean that the organization is not functioning properly or that its members do not have rights and duties. However, others believe that the absence of implementing legislation is problematic because it can lead to uncertainty about the legal status of the organization and the rights and obligations of its members.\n\nTherefore, the absence of implementing legislation in the case of the International Tin Council could have had various consequences depending on the specific circumstances and perspectives of the parties involved."
