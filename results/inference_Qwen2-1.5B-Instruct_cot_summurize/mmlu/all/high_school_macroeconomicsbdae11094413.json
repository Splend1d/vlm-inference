It involves decisions about how much money the government will spend on public goods, such as infrastructure and education, and how much it will collect in taxes. When there is an economic downturn, governments may increase spending to stimulate demand and create jobs, while also reducing taxes to encourage consumption and investment. Conversely, when there is inflation, governments may increase taxes to reduce spending and slow down price growth. The goal of fiscal policy is to maintain a stable economy and promote long-term growth."
