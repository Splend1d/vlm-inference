The putrid smell from the slaughterhouse travels over the woman's property. The woman and her family members find the odor to be foul and nauseating. As a result of the man's slaughterhouse, the value of the woman's property was diminished by 20 percent, and the woman incurred expenses for prescription drugs to treat her family's nausea. There is no applicable zoning ordinance preventing the man's slaughterhouse operation. The woman has asserted a nuisance action against the man. The complaint seeks recovery for damages and injunctive relief enjoining operation of the slaughterhouse. The court should\n\nA. award damages, but not grant injunctive relief.\nB. grant injunctive relief, but not award damages.\nC. grant injunctive relief and award damages.\nD. neither award damages nor grant injunctive relief, because there was no violation of any ordinance.\n"

In this case, the man's slaughterhouse operation caused a nuisance to the woman and her family, which resulted in a decrease in the value of her property and medical expenses. Therefore, the court should grant injunctive relief to prevent the man from operating the slaughterhouse and award damages to compensate the woman for her losses."
