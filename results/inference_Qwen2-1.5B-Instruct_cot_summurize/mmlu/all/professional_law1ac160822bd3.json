The landlord leases the land and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years, commencing on August 1, 2001, and terminating at midnight on July 31, 2008. The lease contains the following provisions:\"(1) The tenant covenants to pay the rent of $750 per month on the first day of each month. \"After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to an attorney, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Then in 2005, the attorney assigned his leasehold interest to a doctor. The doctor went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. After the doctor failed to make his rental payments for the first two months of his lease, the landlord brought suit against the tenant to recover for the unpaid rent. Judgment should be for\n\nA. the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments.\nB. the landlord, because he did not object to the assignments.\nC. the tenant, because the doctor, as assignee, would only be held liable.\nD. the tenant, because his assignment to the attorney constituted a novation, thereby extinguishing his obligation to pay rent.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments.\n\nUnder the law of real estate, when a lessee assigns his rights under a lease to another party, the original lease agreement continues to be binding between the lessor and the assignee. In this case, the tenant assigned his rights to an attorney, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Therefore, the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments, and the landlord can still sue the tenant to recover for the unpaid rent.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the landlord did not object to the assignments, so the landlord cannot avoid liability by claiming that the assignments were invalid or unenforceable.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the doctor was not the original lessee, so he does not have any contractual obligations with the landlord.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the assignment to the attorney did not constitute a novation, which means that it extinguished the original lease obligation. Instead, it created a new lease agreement between the attorney and the landlord, which the doctor did not sign. Therefore, the doctor remains bound by the original lease agreement with the tenant."
