This can include physical, cognitive, or emotional differences, such as children with disabilities, those who have experienced trauma or neglect, or individuals who are differently abled in some way.\n\nFunctional isolation often refers to situations where people are separated or excluded because of their perceived inability to participate fully in society or achieve certain goals due to their unique circumstances. It's important to note that this does not mean that these individuals are not capable of learning or contributing positively to society, but rather that they may require different supports or accommodations to access opportunities typically available to others. \n\nTherefore, option D is correct, as it acknowledges that the term \"functional isolation\" does not necessarily imply that an individual lacks all necessary skills or capabilities, but rather that they might need tailored support systems to thrive within society."
