This is known as \"hammer down\" rule. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the auctioneer allows for the possibility of retracting bids before the hammer falls (option B).\n\nOption C does not apply because it states that the retraction of a bid by a bidder revives the previous bid, which contradicts the principle of \"hammer down.\"\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that the auctioneer can withdraw articles from the auction even after the hammer has fallen, contrary to the standard practice where the auctioneer only has the right to do so prior to the hammer falling under the hammer down rule."
