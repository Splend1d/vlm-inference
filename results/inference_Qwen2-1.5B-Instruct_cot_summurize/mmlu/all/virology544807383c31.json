Cytoplasmic replication and 'snatched caps' are used as primers for RNA transcription, which is a type of viral replication that is paralleled by some other viruses. \n\nCytoplasmic replication involves the virus replicating within the host cell's cytoplasm, where it uses its own genetic material to synthesize new viral particles. This process can be influenced by various factors such as temperature, pH, and nutritional status.\n\nIn contrast, extracellular replication occurs when the virus exits the host cell and infects another cell without entering the cell's cytoplasm. This type of replication is less common than cytoplasmic replication but still seen in some viruses.\n\nThe term \"snatched caps\" refers to the use of host cell proteins or molecules to facilitate the synthesis of viral RNA during replication. This process is also associated with cytoplasmic replication.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, cytoplasmic replication and 'snatched caps' are indeed used as primers for RNA transcription, which makes them an example of replication paralleled by some other viruses."
