This statement is not supported by any evidence from natural selection, as it suggests that adaptation is irrelevant to reproduction and survival in nature. In fact, research has shown that poorly adapted individuals often produce more offspring due to their ability to adapt quickly to changing environments. Therefore, option B is incorrect."
