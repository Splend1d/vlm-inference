Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 'outside agitator' idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere in this country. . . .\"\n\u2014Martin Luther King, Jr., \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail,\" April 16, 1963\nSusan B.

Anthony was a leader in the women's suffrage movement and played a key role in securing the right to vote for women through her advocacy efforts. She wrote the famous \"Votes for Women\" speech in 1857 that became a rallying cry for the cause. Later in life, she supported the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which granted women the right to vote in federal elections."
