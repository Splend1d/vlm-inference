Increasing the sample size can reduce the probability of committing a type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true) because with more data, there is a greater chance that at least one of the treatments will have some effect. However, it also increases the probability of a type II error (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false), since there are now more observations available to support the alternative hypothesis. \n\nTherefore, while the power (the likelihood of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it should be rejected) increases, the overall probability of making either a type I or a type II error remains constant. This is because the trade-off between reducing the risk of a type I error and increasing the risk of a type II error is always present when increasing the sample size."
