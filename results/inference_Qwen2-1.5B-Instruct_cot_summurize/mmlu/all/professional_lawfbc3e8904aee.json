During production, the image of the golfer was inad-vertently reversed and the right-handed golfer appeared to be left-handed. When the posters were delivered on the date provided in the contract, the sporting goods shop noticed the discrepancy, which had no provable significant impact on the effectiveness of the poster. In the opinion of the shop man-agement, however, the posters did not look as good as they had in the catalog from which the shop had ordered them. Is the sporting goods shop legally entitled to reject the posters?\n\nA. No, because the nonconformity does not materially alter the value of the posters to the sporting goods shop.\nB. No, because the publisher must be given an opportunity to cure the nonconformity before the sporting goods shop can reject the posters.\nC. Yes, because the posters do not conform to the contract.\nD. Yes, because the publisher has breached an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.\n"

                    "text": "The sporting goods shop is entitled to reject the posters.\n\nThe reason is that the non-conformity is material, meaning it significantly alters the value of the posters to the sporting goods shop. The posters were delivered with the wrong image of the golfer, which affects their aesthetic appeal and functionality (i.e., whether people will actually see the golfer's face). This difference is not just cosmetic but could potentially cause confusion or misinterpretation about the golfer being right-handed instead of left-handed. Therefore, the non-conformity is material enough to justify rejection by the sporting goods shop under most circumstances.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the sportsman is only required to have an opportunity to cure the defect if there is a reasonable expectation that the defect can be remedied by the seller. In this case, the sporting goods shop never received any opportunity to correct the defect, so the requirement for a remedy cannot apply.\n\nOption A is also incorrect because the non-conformity is material. It significantly changes the appearance and functionality of the posters without providing any means for the publisher to rectify the error.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the sporting goods shop did receive an opportunity to cure the defect when they raised the issue with the publisher after receiving the posters. However, even if the sporting goods shop was unaware of the defect at the time of delivery, the publisher still has an obligation to make things right.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: yes, because the posters do not conform to the contract due to the non-conformity being material."
