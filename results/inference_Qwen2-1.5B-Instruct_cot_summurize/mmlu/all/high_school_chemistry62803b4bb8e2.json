The I2 molecule is much larger than Br2 (atomic radii are 114 and 133 pm, respectively). Which is the best reason for the large difference in boiling points?\n\nA. Bromine is a liquid and boils; iodine is a solid and sublimes.\nB. The intramolecular bonds in I2 are much weaker than those in Br2.\nC. The I2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the Br2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\nD. The mass of iodine is much greater than the mass of bromine.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C: The I2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the Br2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.\n\nLondon forces are electrostatic interactions between atoms or molecules that occur due to the distribution of electrons on different atomic shells. In this case, the I2 molecule has two I atoms bonded together, while the Br2 molecule only has one Br atom bonded to an I atom. This means that the I2 molecule has a higher degree of polarity, which leads to stronger London forces between the I atoms and the Br atom, causing the I2 molecule to have a lower boiling point than the Br2 molecule."
