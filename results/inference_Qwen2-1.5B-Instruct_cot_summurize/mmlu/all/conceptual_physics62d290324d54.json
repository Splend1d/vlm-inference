The length of the closed end is not relevant to the calculation since it does not affect the resonant frequency of the pipe.\n\nSo, if we assume that the length of the open pipe is 1 unit (for simplicity), then the length of the closed pipe would be:\n\nL = pi/4 * 1 = pi/4 units.\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency of the pipe using the formula:\n\nf = v / (pi * L),\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the pipe, v is the velocity of sound in air, and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nSince the speed of sound in air is approximately 343 m/s, we can use the given frequency (256 Hz) to find the length of the pipe:\n\n256 Hz = v / (pi * L),\n256 Hz = 343 m/s / (pi * L).\n\nSolving for L gives us:\n\nL = (343 m/s/pi) / 256 Hz,\nL \u2248 0.879 m.\n\nNow, we can calculate the frequency of the closed pipe using the formula:\n\nf = v / (pi * L),\nf = 343 m/s / (pi * 0.8799 m),\nf \u2248 256 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the length of the closed pipe at a frequency of 256 Hz is equal to the length of the open pipe, which is 1 unit. \n\nThe correct answer is A. one-quarter the value for a tube open at both ends."
