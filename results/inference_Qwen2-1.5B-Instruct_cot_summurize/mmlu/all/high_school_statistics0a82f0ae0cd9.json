In this case, both sets X and Y have the same median because they both contain the number 50.\n\nThe mean is the sum of all the values divided by the total number of values. For both sets X and Y, the mean would be (10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90) / 7 = 280/7 \u2248 40.29. However, since the question asks which of the options is false, we need to consider whether any of these statements apply to the given data:\n\nA. The sets have identical medians - This statement is true because the median of each set is 50.\n\nB. The sets have identical means - This statement is also true because both sets have a mean of approximately 40.29.\n\nC. The sets have identical ranges - This statement is false because the range of set X is from 10 to 90, while the range of set Y is from 10 to 70. Therefore, the difference between the two sets' ranges is not zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. The sets have identical ranges."
