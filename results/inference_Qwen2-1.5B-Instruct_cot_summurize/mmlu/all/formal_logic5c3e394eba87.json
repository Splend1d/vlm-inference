If China promotes human rights, then South Africa must not supply diamonds.\n\nThe first part of the statement is represented by the implication \"~E \u2192 F\" which means \"If England does not import beef, then France will subsidize agriculture.\"\n\nThe second part of the statement is represented by the conditional \"C \u2192 ~S\" which means \"If China promotes human rights, then South Africa will not supply diamonds.\" \n\nTherefore, the correct representation of the given sentence using propositional logic symbols is (~E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 ~S), where F = France's subsidizing agriculture, C = China promoting human rights, and S = South Africa supplying diamonds."
