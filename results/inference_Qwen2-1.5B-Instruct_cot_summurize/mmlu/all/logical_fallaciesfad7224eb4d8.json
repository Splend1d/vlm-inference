Appeal to the masses\n\nThe fallacy of appeal to the masses occurs when someone argues that a claim must be true simply because a large number of people believe it, without providing any evidence or logical reasoning for their belief. This argument often relies on the idea that if most people agree with something, then it must be correct. However, this can lead to false conclusions and undermine critical thinking."
