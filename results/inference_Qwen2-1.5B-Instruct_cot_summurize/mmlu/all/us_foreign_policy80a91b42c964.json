This enabled it to project its influence abroad and promote democracy and capitalism around the world, which were seen as key components of American exceptionalism. The US also played a leading role in international organizations like the United Nations and NATO, further cementing its position as a global leader.\n\nHowever, the Cold War also highlighted the limits of American exceptionalism. The Soviet Union, despite being defeated in the arms race, continued to pose a threat to US interests, and the US was unable to prevent the spread of communism to other parts of the world. This failure to effectively contain the spread of communism led some to question the effectiveness of American exceptionalism as a justification for interventionist foreign policy.\n\nFurthermore, the Cold War exposed the flaws in American exceptionalism when it came to issues like civil rights and labor unions. Despite its reputation as a champion of human rights, the US government often failed to protect the rights of minority groups and working-class Americans, leading some to argue that these failures undermined the idea of American exceptionalism.\n\nOverall, while the Cold War did enhance the US's standing as a global leader, it also raised questions about the extent to which American exceptionalism could be applied consistently across all aspects of US foreign and domestic policies."
