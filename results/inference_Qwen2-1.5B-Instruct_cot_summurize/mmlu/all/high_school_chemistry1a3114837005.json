Therefore, the compound with the lowest molar mass will have the highest solubility.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- NaBr (sodium bromide) has a molar mass of approximately 106 g/mol.\n- NiSO3 (nickel(III) sulfate) has a molar mass of approximately 189 g/mol.\n- CrCl3 (chromic chloride) has a molar mass of approximately 147 g/mol.\n- Mn(NO3)2 (manganese(II) nitrate) has a molar mass of approximately 226 g/mol.\n\nBased on this information, we can see that CrCl3 (chromic chloride) has the lowest molar mass among the given options. Therefore, it would be the least soluble in water among the options provided. \n\nSo the correct answer is C. CrCl3."
