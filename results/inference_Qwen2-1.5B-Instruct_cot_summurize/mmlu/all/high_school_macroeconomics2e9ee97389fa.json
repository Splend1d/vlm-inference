This can cause an appreciation of the local currency, including the Chinese yuan in this case, because the demand for Chinese goods and services increases due to the lower cost of these items for foreign buyers.\n\nLower prices in China, on the other hand, would not necessarily result in an appreciation of the Chinese yuan, as this depends on both domestic demand and international trade dynamics. Similarly, growing American preference to consume more Chinese-made goods or rising per capita GDP in China increasing imports from the United States could impact the balance of trade between the two countries, but it does not directly affect the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan.\n\nTherefore, the correct relationship between interest rates and exchange rates is typically related to capital flows rather than direct economic factors like production costs or import volumes."
