Transamination is an irreversible reaction in amino acid catabolism.\n\nTransamination refers to the transfer of a methyl group (-CH3) between two amino acids, resulting in the formation of a new amino acid and water. This process is an essential part of protein synthesis and can occur through three different pathways: the glutamate cycle, the aspartate cycle, and the oxaloacetate cycle. The glutamate cycle is the most common pathway, where glutamine is converted into glutamate, which is then used by the liver for energy production or further metabolism. This process involves several enzymes that require specific cofactors such as NAD+ for the first step, and CoA for subsequent steps."
