He states that liberal egalitarians believe in the idea of \"openness,\" which means allowing people from different countries into their society without discrimination or restriction. Therefore, he concludes that liberal egalitarianism supports more open immigration policies.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Carens' argument shows that liberal egalitarianism does not support closed borders for immigration.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because Carens' argument does not make any claims about the morality of egalitarianism.\n\nOption D is partially correct but does not fully capture Carens' argument. While Carens acknowledges that some forms of anticosmopolitanism may be justified, he argues that liberal egalitarianism does not succumb to these arguments and still advocates for openness towards immigrants and refugees."
