Health care\n\nThe major concern in countries with a large and rapidly aging population is often inadequate health care resources, which can lead to increased demand for medical services and potentially higher healthcare costs. This can put pressure on existing healthcare systems and may require new investments in infrastructure, staff training, and technology. Additionally, an aging population may also increase the demand for long-term care services such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities."
