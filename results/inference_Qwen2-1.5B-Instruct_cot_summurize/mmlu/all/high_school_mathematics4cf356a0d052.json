We'll use permutations since the order matters here but not the position within the word itself (as long as \"M\" appears).\n\nWe have 11! ways to arrange the 11 letters:\n\n\\[1 \\times 1 = 1\\]\n\nHowever, we must also consider how many of these arrangements contain the letter \"M\". Since there's no constraint on the arrangement of the other letters, we simply count them:\n\n- If \"M\" is in the first position: \\(1\\) possibility.\n- If \"M\" is in the second position: \\(1\\) possibility.\n- If \"M\" is in the third position: \\(1\\) possibility.\n- ...\n- If \"M\" is in the last position: \\(1\\) possibility.\n\nAdding these up gives us \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\\) possibilities for each arrangement containing \"M\".\n\nSince there are 11!/11! ways to arrange the letters, we multiply this by the number of arrangements containing \"M\":\n\n\\[1 \\times 4 = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 4 palindromes that meet the criteria of containing the letter \"M\" and being two or more letters long. The correct answer is **C. 86**."
