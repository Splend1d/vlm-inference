They only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart. They wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the United States of America, to leave them alone in peace, and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it Viet Cong, North Vietnamese or American.\"\nJohn Kerry, 1971\nWhich of the following pairs of words best characterizes the differences between the approaches of Presidents Lyndon Johnson (1963\u20131969) and Richard Nixon (1969\u20131974) to the Vietnam conflict?\n\nA.
