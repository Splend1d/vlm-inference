The ideal gas law (PV=nRT) applies only when the gas is at constant temperature and pressure, meaning that the volume is not changing with respect to time. However, in reality, gases can expand or contract due to changes in their internal energy.\n\nTherefore, under high temperature and low pressure conditions, the molecules of the gas move faster and collide more frequently with each other, resulting in a higher density and lower volume. This causes the gas to behave more like an ideal gas. Conversely, under high pressure and low temperature conditions, the molecules of the gas move slower and have less chance of colliding with each other, resulting in a lower density and higher volume. This causes the gas to behave more like a non-ideal gas."
