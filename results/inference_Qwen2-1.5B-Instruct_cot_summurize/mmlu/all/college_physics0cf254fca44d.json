The only relevant factor here is the relative motion between the car and the wall.\n\nSince the car is moving towards the wall at a speed of \\(3.5\\) m/s, the time it takes for the sound to travel from the wall to the car and back is simply half the time it takes for light to do so because the car is moving closer to the wall during the time interval.\n\nLet's denote the distance between the car and the wall as \\(d/2\\). The equation then becomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{d/2}{350} \\approx \\frac{d}{700}. \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency heard by the driver using the information about the speed of sound and the frequency of the siren. Since the frequency of the siren is \\(600\\) Hz, the Doppler effect formula gives us the frequency heard by the driver:\n\n\\[ f' = f + \\Delta f = 600 + \\Delta f, \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta f\\) is the difference in frequency due to the change in velocity of the source or observer.\n\nWe know that the frequency heard by the driver does not depend on the frequency of the siren but rather depends on the difference in frequency (\\(f'\\)) and the frequency of the siren (\\(f_s\\)). However, since the frequency of the siren is fixed at \\(600\\) Hz, the only way the frequency heard by the driver could differ from \\(600\\) Hz would be if there was a difference in frequency caused by the car's motion towards the wall.\n\nHowever, since the car is moving away from the wall at a speed of \\(3.5\\) m/s, the time taken for the sound to return is \\(t = d/c - t_{sound}\\), where \\(t_{sound}\\) is the time it takes for light to travel from the wall to the car. This means the car will have moved a distance equal to its own length before the sound returns, resulting in a delay of \\(t_{sound}\\).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ t_{sound} = \\frac{d}{c} - t, \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ t_{sound} = \\frac{d}{350} - \\frac{d}{700} = \\frac{d}{700}(1 - \\frac{1}{35}) = \\frac{d}{700} \\times \\frac{34}{35} = \\frac{d}{700} \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{4d}{985}, \\]\n\nwhere we used \\(1 - \\frac{1}{35} = \\frac{34}{35}\\) to simplify the denominator.\n\nSubstituting \\(d/2\\) for \\(d\\) and rearranging the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{985} \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{d}{985} \\times \\frac{4}{7} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{d}{985} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{d}{3980}, \\]\n\nwe see that the time \\(t\\) cancels out, leaving us with:\n\n\\[ \\Delta f = 600 - \\frac{d}{3980}. \\]\n\nThis tells us how much the frequency heard by the driver differs from \\(600\\) Hz based on the car's motion. However, without knowing the exact value of \\(d\\), we cannot determine the exact frequency of the echo heard by the driver. Therefore, none of the options provided directly answer the question, and the correct answer is not one of these choices. \n\nIn conclusion, the driver would hear the echo at a frequency closest to **none of the above** (since the exact value of \\(d\\) is needed to accurately calculate the frequency heard by the driver)."
