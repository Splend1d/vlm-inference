This increase in bank reserves can lead to an increase in the total amount of money available for circulation in the economy. However, if the velocity of money (the number of times a unit of money is spent per year) falls, then there may not be enough new spending to create as much economic activity and growth as would otherwise occur with a higher velocity of money. This could potentially diminish the potential amount of money created after the Fed increases bank reserves."
