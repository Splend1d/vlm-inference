Jim and Tim will have very similar IQs.\n\nHeritability studies suggest that around 50% of an individual's IQ is due to genetic factors, while the remaining 50% is due to environmental factors. In monozygotic twins who were reared together, both twins share the same genetic makeup, so their IQs would be expected to be highly correlated due to their shared genetic background. This means that Jim and Tim would have very similar IQs if they were identical twins raised in the same environment.\n\nIn contrast, fraternal twins who were reared together do not share the same genetic makeup, so there is less chance of them having very similar IQs due to their shared genetic background. However, they may still have some degree of similarity in IQ due to other environmental factors or shared experiences."
