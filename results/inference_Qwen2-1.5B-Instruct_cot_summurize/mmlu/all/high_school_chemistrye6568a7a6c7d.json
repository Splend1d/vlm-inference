                    "text": "The correct answer is D. When the reaction exhibits no change in pressure at constant volume.\n\nThis is because when a reaction reaches equilibrium, the rate of forward reaction equals the rate of reverse reaction. This means that the concentrations of reactants and products are equal to each other at equilibrium. Therefore, if the reaction does not undergo any change in pressure (i.e., it is at constant volume), then the partial pressures of the reactants and products must also be equal at equilibrium. Thus, the equilibrium constant (Kp) will have the same numerical value as the initial concentration of the reactants and products, which is 1.00 molar."
