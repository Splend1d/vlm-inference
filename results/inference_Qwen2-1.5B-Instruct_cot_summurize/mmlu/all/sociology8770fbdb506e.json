Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nThe policies of Project 2000 did not have an impact on the profession of nursing as it was a government initiative rather than a professional association. Option B is incorrect.\n\nThere has been no significant change in the number of women working in nursing over time, so option C is incorrect.\n\nThe role of the nurse is not ambiguous but rather evolves with each new patient interaction, requiring constant adaptation and flexibility. This is part of the emotional labor described by Allen's study. Option D is also incorrect."
