Most people ought to desire it. \n\nHobbes believed that in a state of nature, where there is no social contract or government, people live in constant fear and violence, and the only way to prevent this chaos is through the establishment of a strong central authority. He argued that this authority must be absolute and powerful enough to enforce laws and maintain order.\n\nTherefore, for Hobbes, it would make sense to say that something is good if it is conducive to human happiness because such things would help ensure peace and security, which would reduce the need for violent conflict and suffering. However, he did not believe that someone's desires necessarily led them to want certain things, but rather that they had an inherent obligation to obey the law and act in the best interest of society as a whole. Therefore, while some people may desire certain things, these desires were not sufficient on their own to justify the pursuit of those things."
