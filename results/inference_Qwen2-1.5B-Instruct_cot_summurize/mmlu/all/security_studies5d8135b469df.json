Human security as a concept has struggled to gain recognition amongst scholars of security studies, or in the policy-making community. There is a general failure to recognise the political and academic value of human security as a concept.\nB. The concept of human security gained increasing currency in the mid-1990s, serving to highlight critical issues. In particular, the study of human society has focuses on the problem of intra-state violence, which has become the dominant issue for post-Cold War security studies.\nC. The concept of human security does not challenge traditional state-centric arguments in so far as these concern the protection of the state from external military violence. However, it does show that state-centric realism is insufficient because it does not address the security of people within states.\nD. Human security has become the dominant concept in understanding contemporary security studies. After the end of the Cold War, the state-centric security paradigm was made irrelevant and today there is a universal understanding that human beings and individuals within states should be the focal point of security.\n"

This shift towards a more holistic approach to security acknowledges the importance of individual rights, well-being, and dignity. It also highlights the interconnectedness between security and other social and economic factors such as poverty, education, healthcare, and access to resources.\n\nHuman security challenges traditional state-centric arguments by emphasizing the need for states to protect their citizens from harm and provide basic necessities like food, shelter, and health care. It recognizes the importance of addressing structural inequalities and fostering inclusive societies where everyone can thrive.\n\nIn summary, the concept of human security has been recognized as an essential component of contemporary security studies, particularly in the wake of the end of the Cold War and the focus on global terrorism. It serves as a reminder that security must extend beyond the protection of states from external threats and encompasses the welfare and wellbeing of all individuals within them."
