Rickets of prematurity can be caused by several factors, including vitamin D deficiency in the mother, use of certain medications such as frusemide diuretics, and hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) in the infant due to prolonged gestational age or low birth weight. These conditions can all contribute to the development of rickets in premature infants. It's important for healthcare providers to monitor these potential risk factors for rickets in preterm infants."
