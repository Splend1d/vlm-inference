Women may be more likely to experience sexual delinquency or other forms of criminal behavior, which could potentially reflect traditional gender roles. Additionally, Smart notes that women's criminal behavior may not necessarily be normalized like men's, but rather it could be influenced by their own experiences and societal expectations.\n\nTherefore, the combination of these factors suggest that the rates and types of violence experienced by men and women may differ."
