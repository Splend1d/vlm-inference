If the homeowner finds the completed job to be satisfactory, he will pay the house painter $10,000 within one week after the job is completed. \"Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the homeowner's contractual obligation to pay the house painter $10,000?\n\nA. Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an express condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.\nB. Payment of the $10,000 by the homeowner would be an express condition subsequent to the house painter's duty of performance.\nC. The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.\nD.

The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.\n\nUnder the terms of the contract, if the homeowner is satisfied with the work done by the house painter, they must pay the full amount of $10,000 within one week after the completion of the job. This means that the homeowner's satisfaction is a condition precedent to their obligation to pay the house painter. Therefore, the payments made by the homeowner are contingent upon the completion of the work by the house painter, which is why it is described as a condition precedent."
