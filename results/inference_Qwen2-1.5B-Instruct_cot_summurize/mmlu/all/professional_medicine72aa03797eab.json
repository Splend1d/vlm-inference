He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits. Treatment with a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve his symptoms due to which of the following mechanisms?\n\nA. Decreasing myocardial contractility\nB. Dilating the coronary arteries\nC. Peripheral vasodilation\nD. Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs\n"

This can help to reduce the workload on the heart and potentially alleviate the chest pain associated with ischemia (oxygen deprivation) in the affected area. However, it's important to note that this medication may also have other effects such as slowing down the heart rate, reducing blood pressure, and preventing blood clots, but these effects are not directly related to decreasing myocardial contractility. Therefore, option A (Decreasing myocardial contractility) is the correct answer based on the given information."
