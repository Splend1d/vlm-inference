All of the above.\n\nAccording to Herberg's study, he found that ethnic minorities who had been brought up in different cultures often retained their religious practices and beliefs even after they assimilated into American society. This suggests that religion was an important part of their cultural identity and was used as a means to achieve social acceptance within the dominant culture. At the same time, mainstream faiths were becoming increasingly identified with national identity, as Americans became more secularized and less likely to attend church regularly. Finally, Herberg noted that there were some differences between the moral teachings of various religions, which could be seen as reflecting the diversity of American society."
