The interference can be constructive, meaning that the waves reinforce each other and produce an increased amplitude of the wave, or it can be destructive, meaning that the waves cancel out each other and result in a reduced amplitude of the wave. Additionally, if the waves are moving slower than the source producing them, they may not reach their full potential and the bow wave will be weaker."
