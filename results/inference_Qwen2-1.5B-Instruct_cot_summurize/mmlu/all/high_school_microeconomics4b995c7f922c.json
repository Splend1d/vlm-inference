When the price of a product decreases and the price of a substitute product remains constant, consumers may buy more of the substitute product because it becomes less expensive relative to the original product. This leads to a substitution effect, which means that the consumer is shifting their consumption from one good to another. The income effect refers to how changes in income affect consumption, while the marginal effect refers to how much additional consumption occurs when a small change in price occurs. The supply effect refers to how changes in the supply of a good affect its price."
