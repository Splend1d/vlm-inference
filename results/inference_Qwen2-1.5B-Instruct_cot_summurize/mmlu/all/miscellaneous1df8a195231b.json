When you press a button on a remote control, it sends out an IR signal that tells the television how loud to make its sound. This signal is typically sent as a series of short, high-intensity pulses of infrared radiation. \n\nOther options like visible light, radio waves, and intense infrared beams are not suitable for transmitting information over long distances because they would either be too weak to detect or would cause damage to the receiver."
