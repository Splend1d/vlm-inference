Soon thereafter, she had sex with her husband, who contracted the disease within a few days. The woman revealed the source to her husband, and he then sued the paramour for negligence in failing to tell the woman that he had the disease. The trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. What will the appellate court decide?\n\nA. There is a cause of action because one who transmits a sexually communicable disease is strictly liable to all who contracts it.\nB. There is no cause of action because the wife assumed the risk that the paramour had a sexually transmittable disease.\nC. There is a cause of action because a person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others.\nD. There is no cause of action because the paramour's negligence was cut off by the wife's intervening negligence which became a superseding cause.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. A person with a venereal disease has a duty to use reasonable care to avoid infecting others.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman contracted a sexually transmitted disease from her paramour, even though she did not know about his condition. This constitutes an actionable tort under common law, known as \"intoxication\" or \"infection.\" In order to prevail on a claim of negligence, the plaintiff must prove four elements: (1) the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the breach caused harm to the plaintiff; and (4) the plaintiff suffered damages due to the breach.\n\nUnder this standard, the woman has established a prima facie case of negligence based on the premise that the paramour had a duty to inform her of his disease. If the trial court found that the paramour breached this duty by concealing his infection, the woman would have a strong case for recovery. However, if the paramour's negligence was cut off by the woman's own negligence, such as her own act of engaging in sexual intercourse without protection, the court may dismiss the claim for lack of standing or as barred by res judicata. \n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect, as the paramour's negligence was not cut off by the woman's negligence, but rather by the woman herself. Option B is also incorrect, as the woman did not assume any risks related to the paramour's health, so there was no basis for a negligence claim. Option A is incorrect, as the woman does not have a strict liability claim against the paramour for transmitting the disease since she did not know about the paramour's condition."
