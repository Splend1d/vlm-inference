Practical guidance.\n\nThe corresponding principle to the practical aim of moral theory is the principle of practical guidance, which suggests that moral principles should be applied in a way that promotes the best outcomes for individuals and society as a whole. This means considering the consequences of actions and making decisions based on what will lead to the greatest good for the greatest number. The other options (parsimony, explanatory power) do not directly correspond to the practical aim of moral theory."
