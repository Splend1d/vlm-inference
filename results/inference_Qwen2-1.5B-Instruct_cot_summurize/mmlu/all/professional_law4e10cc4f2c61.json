Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poll. A former non-Native American member of the Party is now challenging his exclusion from the Party. Which of the following constitutional provisions would furnish the former member's best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Party?\n\nA. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\nC. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.\n"

The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment states that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. This means that individuals cannot be excluded or discriminated against based on their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or ancestry. Therefore, if the former member feels that he was excluded from the Party based on his race (being a non-Native American), he may argue that this violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
