The intercostal nerves are pairs of sensory and motor nerves that innervate the muscles of the ribs and the surrounding skin. They lie deep to the superior border of the rib cage, which runs from the base of the neck to the lower part of the chest. Therefore, the intercostal nerves are located beneath the surface of the skin."
