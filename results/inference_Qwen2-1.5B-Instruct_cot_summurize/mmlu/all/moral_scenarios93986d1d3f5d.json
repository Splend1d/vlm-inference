According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it is considered morally wrong to use up toilet paper and then refuse to buy more when you have none left. This behavior goes against the principle of honesty and responsibility towards others, especially those who rely on shared resources like toilet paper. Taking pictures without consent or without permission can also be seen as disrespectful or inappropriate, depending on the context and the individuals involved."
