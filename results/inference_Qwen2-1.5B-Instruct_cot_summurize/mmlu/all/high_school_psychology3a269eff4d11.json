This type of schedule tends to maintain behavior by reinforcing it on an ongoing basis and making it less likely for the behavior to be extinguished over time.\n\nFixed ratio reinforcement schedules involve providing a specific number of reinforcements for each unit of behavior, regardless of how many times that behavior occurs. This can lead to behaviors becoming more resistant to extinction because they are being reinforced consistently, even if the behavior isn't occurring frequently enough to warrant frequent reinforcement.\n\nFixed interval schedules require providing reinforcement after a set amount of time has passed since the behavior occurred. This schedule may help to maintain behavior by ensuring that the behavior is not immediately followed by no reinforcement, which could make the behavior less likely to occur again.\n\nVariable ratio schedules provide reinforcement based on the frequency of the behavior rather than the number of units of behavior. This type of schedule allows for more flexibility and can result in behaviors being maintained longer term, but also makes them more resistant to extinction due to the unpredictability of when reinforcement will occur."
