The MnO4- : Mn2+ ratio is 3:1.\n\nThis is because the reaction follows the law of conservation of electrons, where each electron gained by the reactant (in this case, MnO4-) must be paired with an electron lost by the product (Mn2+). Therefore, for every 3 electrons gained by MnO4-, there should be 1 electron lost by Mn2+. This gives us a ratio of 3:1 for the MnO4- : Mn2+ ratio. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the I- : IO3- ratio is not given in the question and it doesn't follow from the information provided. Option B is also incorrect because the MnO4- : I- ratio is not given in the question either and it doesn't follow from the information provided. Option D is also incorrect because the H+ : I- ratio is not given in the question and it doesn't follow from the information provided."
