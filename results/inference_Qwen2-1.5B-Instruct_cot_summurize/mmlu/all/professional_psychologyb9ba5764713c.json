This fear can persist even after the caregiver returns home. The child may also show increased anxiety when the caregiver returns, despite the fact that they have previously shown signs of distress during separations. \n\nThe other options do not accurately describe this type of attachment style. Attachment styles can range from secure, where the child feels comfortable and confident in their relationship with the caregiver, to avoidant, where the child avoids close contact with the caregiver, to anxious-preoccupied, where the child experiences intense distress when the caregiver is around, but less so when the caregiver is away, and finally, anxious-ambivalent, where the child exhibits both avoidance and anxiety towards the caregiver. However, these options are not applicable to the pattern described for the child with an insecure/avoidant attachment style."
