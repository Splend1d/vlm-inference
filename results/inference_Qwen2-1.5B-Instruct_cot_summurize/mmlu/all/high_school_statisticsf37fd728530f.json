Residuals are calculated by subtracting the predicted value from the actual observed value for each data point. They represent the difference between the observed outcome and the modeled outcome.\n\nIn general, if all the points fall on a straight line (the regression line), then the sum of squared residuals should equal zero because each point contributes a square term that cancels out the others when you add them up. This means that the average of the residuals is also zero. \n\nHowever, this does not guarantee that the correlation coefficient between the independent variable and the dependent variable is exactly 1 or -1; it just indicates that the fit is very good. A perfect fit would result in a correlation coefficient of 1, while an extremely poor fit would result in a correlation coefficient close to -1. So, option D is incorrect.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because even if the linear model is good, the number of positive residuals may not necessarily be the same as the number of negative residuals, especially if the data set has outliers or influential observations. Outliers can skew the distribution of residuals and make it difficult to determine whether the model fits well or not.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is C: The mean of the residuals is always zero."
