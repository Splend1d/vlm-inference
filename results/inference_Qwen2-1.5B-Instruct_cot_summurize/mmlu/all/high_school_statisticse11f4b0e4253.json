Specifically:\n\n- Changing the units of measurement for either variable will affect the magnitude of the correlation, but not the direction (positive or negative).\n- Switching the roles of the variables being measured (e.g., changing x and y) will change the sign of the correlation coefficient, but not its absolute value.\n- Adding the same constant to all values of one variable does not affect the correlation between that variable and another variable.\n\nTherefore, options B and C are correct answers. Option D is incorrect because it implies that only one of the above factors can affect the correlation, whereas any combination of these factors can indeed affect the r value."
