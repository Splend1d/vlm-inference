The parsec is defined as the distance at which one astronomical unit (AU) measures one arcsecond from Earth. This means that the distance between two objects is calculated by measuring the angle between them on Earth's surface and then converting that angle into a measurement in astronomical units.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Distance at which one astronomical unit measures one arcsecond from Earth."
