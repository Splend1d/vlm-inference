It has announced that the South shall be excluded from the common territory, that the judicial tribunal shall be made sectional, and that a war must be waged against slavery until it shall cease throughout the United States. The guarantees of the Constitution will then no longer exist; the equal rights of the states will be lost. The slaveholding states will no longer have the power of self-government or self-protection, and the federal government will have become their enemy.\n\"We, therefore, the people of South Carolina, by our delegates in convention assembled, have solemnly declared that the Union heretofore existing between this state and the other states of North America is dissolved; and that the state of South Carolina has resumed her position among the nations of the world, as [a] separate and independent state, with full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do.\"\nSouth Carolina defines the causes of secession, 1860\nWhich of the following best explains why South Carolina chose to secede from the Union in 1860?\n\nA. The failures of the Compromise of 1850 hindered South Carolina's trade relationships with Western states, leading to severe economic recession.\nB. The Battle of Fort Sumter occurred in Charleston, prompting public outrage over Union aggression.\nC. President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, thus undermining slavery in the South.\nD. Lincoln's election on a Free-Soil platform led Southern politicians to conclude that secession was necessary.\n"
