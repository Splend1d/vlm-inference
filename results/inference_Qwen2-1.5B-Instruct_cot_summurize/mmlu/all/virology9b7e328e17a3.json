Antiviral drugs should only be given to individuals who have been exposed to a specific virus and there is evidence that they will benefit from treatment, such as if they show symptoms of a viral infection or if they have been in close contact with someone who has had the virus. Prophylactic use of antivirals (such as the flu vaccine) is not recommended unless it is part of a larger vaccination program aimed at preventing disease transmission. Therapeutic use of antivirals is when an individual has already developed a viral infection and needs medication to treat their condition."
