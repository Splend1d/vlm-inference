A long-time customer of the drug store presented a prescription to the pharmacist for the medication Clinoril, which was prescribed by her physician to treat her arthritic condition. The pharmacist was in a rush that day because of a backlog of prescriptions to fill, and he misread the customer's prescription. He filled her prescription with Clinitest, a caustic substance not for internal use. He labeled the container with the instructions for Clinoril: \"Take one tablet twice a day. \"The customer followed the instructions, consumed the Clinitest, and suffered severe injuries to her stomach and esophagus. If the customer brings a strict liability in tort action against the pharmacist, what is his best defense?\n\nA. It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication.\nB. He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.\nC. He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.\nD. The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the information provided, the customer brought an action against the pharmacist for strict liability as a result of consuming a medication containing a caustic substance instead of the intended medication (Clinoril). This means that the pharmacist did something that could have caused harm and that the customer suffered from serious injuries due to this mistake.\n\nGiven these facts, the best defense would likely be option B - he was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed. Strict liability generally applies when there is a failure to exercise due diligence or caution in the manufacture, sale, or distribution of a product that causes harm to others. In this case, it seems that the pharmacist did not directly sell the medication, but rather dispensed it at the request of the customer. Therefore, the pharmacist cannot be held strictly liable based on the actions of another party.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a more direct answer, the pharmacist should argue that the drug store itself was the manufacturer and therefore not responsible for the pharmacist's negligence. This argument assumes that the pharmacist did not cause any harm himself, only the pharmacist's error led to the customer's injury. So, the pharmacist might say something like:\n\n\"The drug store was the manufacturer of the medication, so I am not responsible for the pharmacist's mistake.\""
