It could include any number of actions or behaviors that are considered morally good or bad by different people. This makes it difficult for anyone to know whether their actions are truly \"holy,\" since they would have to constantly question whether their actions meet this criteria at every moment. \n\nSocrates' objection is based on the fact that there is no single, objective standard for what constitutes \"righteousness.\" Instead, moral judgments are often subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. Therefore, defining something as \"holy\" in such a way that it requires constant questioning and interpretation is unlikely to lead to accurate or consistent judgments."
