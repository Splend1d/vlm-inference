This is because third-party candidates often run on platforms that are considered too extreme for mainstream voters, and many voters feel uncomfortable supporting candidates who do not share their own views on important issues such as economics, foreign policy, and social justice. As a result, third-party candidates may receive little support in elections, and eventually fade into obscurity."
