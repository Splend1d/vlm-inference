In other words, LISREL is useful for analyzing complex causal models that include both measured (observed) attributes and latent traits.\n\nLatent traits refer to unmeasured factors that may influence the observed variables. These traits can be either positive or negative and can have different levels of importance depending on the context of the study. For example, in marketing research, latent traits such as brand loyalty or customer satisfaction could affect consumer behavior.\n\nTherefore, LISREL is an appropriate method of analysis when you want to understand how measured (observed) attributes relate to latent traits and vice versa, and how these relationships can be influenced by external variables."
