Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis (psoriatic arthropathy) is characterized by inflammation and pain in the hands, wrists, knees, ankles, and feet. It typically affects small joints, such as those in the fingers and toes. The disease usually starts with mild symptoms that improve on their own, but it can also become severe and cause joint damage. \n\nOne of the key features of psoriatic arthritis is nail pitting, which occurs when the skin around the nails becomes red, swollen, and painful due to inflammation. This condition can occur alongside other symptoms of the disease, including stiffness and swelling in the joints. \n\nTherefore, if you have any of these symptoms and your doctor suspects psoriatic arthritis, they may order a blood test to check for specific markers associated with the disease. However, nail pitting alone is not enough evidence to diagnose psoriatic arthritis, so the diagnosis should always be made based on a combination of clinical signs and laboratory tests."
