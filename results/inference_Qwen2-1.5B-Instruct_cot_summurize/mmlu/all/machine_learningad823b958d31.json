False, False\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect because while gradient descent can indeed be used for inference and learning on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), it does not specifically state that it can be used for learning in the context of Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifiers. This statement might refer to a different application.\n\nStatement 2 is also false because assuming a fixed number of attributes, a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier cannot be learned in time linear in the number of records in the dataset. The complexity of this task depends on the specific implementation and the number of features being considered, which is generally quadratic in the number of features. For example, in high-dimensional data, the computational complexity could potentially grow exponentially with the number of dimensions. Therefore, it is not possible to learn a Gaussian-based Bayes optimal classifier in time linear in the number of records using a fixed number of attributes."
