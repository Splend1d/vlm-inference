Neandertals used caves in Europe where their remains were preserved.\n\nWhile it is true that Neandertals lived across multiple continents and had a diverse range of habitats, this does not necessarily explain why we know more about them than other extinct species of premodern humans. The fact that Neandertals were able to survive for thousands of years in Europe suggests that they adapted well to their environment and were successful in competing with other predators and prey.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that Neandertals were relatively small in size compared to modern humans means that they likely did not leave behind large numbers of fossils or artifacts that could be easily studied. This lack of fossil evidence has made it difficult to understand the behavior and ecology of Neandertals, which has led to some speculation about their diet, social structure, and reproductive strategies.\n\nOverall, while Neandertals may have been less known than other extinct human species due to their smaller size and limited fossil record, the factors that contributed to their success as a species likely played a role in shaping our understanding of their behavior and ecology."
