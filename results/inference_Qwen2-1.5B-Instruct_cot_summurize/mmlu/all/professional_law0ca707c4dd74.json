Over the course of time, she developed the property into a residential subdivision. A four-lane public highway ran along the northern boundary of the residential subdivision. When the residential subdivision was first plotted, the developer constructed a private road along (and including) the western boundary of the subdivision. This private road was used only for the benefit of the owners who purchased lots in the subdivision. A homeowner owned a 20-acre tract immediately outside of the residential subdivision, which was situated just below the public highway and immediately adjacent to the west side of the private road. The homeowner's property was divided into two 10-acre parcels: Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the public highway; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river. In 1997, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 1 to a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Six months later, the homeowner conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. Assume that no part of Parcel 2 adjoins a public road. Consequently, the woman constructed an access road connecting her property to the private road. After the woman used the private road for approximately two months, a teacher who was an owner within the residential subdivision, ordered the woman to discontinue using the private road. In an appropriate action by the teacher against the woman to enjoin the use of the private road, the woman will\n\nA. win, because there is an easement by estoppel over the private road.\nB. win, because there is an implied easement appurtenant over the private road.\nC. lose, unless the private road is the only access road by which woman can gain ingress and egress to her property.\nD. lose, because she has no legal right to travel over the private road.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. lose, because she has no legal right to travel over the private road.\n\nAn implied easement appurtenant exists when a person uses a portion of another's land for a continuous period of time without permission from the owner or the landowner grants permission. However, this type of easement does not automatically create rights to cross or pass through other lands. An implied easement appurtenant requires the landowner to grant permission and the landowner must have intended to convey the right to use the land.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman did not obtain permission from the landowner or convey any right to use the private road. Therefore, she cannot assert an implied easement appurtenant.\n\nAdditionally, an easement by estoppel may be established if the parties have acted under the belief that they had a legal right to use the land. However, this requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the parties believed they had a legal right to use the land, and it is highly unlikely that such a belief would be proven in this case. \n\nTherefore, based on the facts presented, the most likely outcome is that the woman will lose the claim of an easement by estoppel or implied easement appurtenant due to lack of permission and intent to convey the right to use the land."
