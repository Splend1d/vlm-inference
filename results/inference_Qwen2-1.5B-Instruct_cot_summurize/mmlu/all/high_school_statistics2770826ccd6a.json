The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn. Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\nA. The mean of all the salaries.\nB. The mode of all the salaries.\nC. The standard deviation of all the salaries.\nD. The median of all the salaries.\n"

Therefore, the mean would not accurately represent the typical salary for any group of people.\n\nOption A, the mean, is the wrong answer.\n\nThe mode is the most frequently occurring value. In this case, since the salaries are not evenly distributed, there will be no single salary that occurs more often than any other.\n\nOption B, the mode, is also incorrect.\n\nThe standard deviation measures how spread out the data are from the mean. It does not tell us anything about whether the salaries are high or low compared to each other.\n\nOption C, the standard deviation, is also incorrect.\n\nThe median is the middle value when the data are arranged in order from smallest to largest. Since we have an odd number of values, the median will be the middle one. However, it is not necessarily true that the median is representative of the distribution of salaries.\n\nTherefore, none of the options provided are correct."
