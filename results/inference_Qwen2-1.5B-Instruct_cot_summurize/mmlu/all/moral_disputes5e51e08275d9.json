However, it does not necessarily follow that other distinctions (such as those listed) are also morally relevant.\n\nFor example, while it is true that some people might consider the act of killing someone to be more morally reprehensible than letting them die, this does not necessarily mean that letting someone die is morally neutral or without consequences. In fact, there can be significant ethical implications associated with allowing someone to die, such as the potential for suffering or loss of dignity.\n\nSimilarly, the distinction between a physician and a patient may depend on the context and the specific circumstances surrounding the situation. While a physician may have an obligation to provide care and treatment to their patients, they may also have a duty to prioritize the well-being of the patient's family members over the patient themselves.\n\nTherefore, while the killing/letting die distinction is important in understanding moral responsibility and accountability, it does not automatically imply that all other distinctions are equally relevant. It is ultimately up to individual moral philosophers and ethicists to determine which distinctions are most relevant and important in different contexts."
