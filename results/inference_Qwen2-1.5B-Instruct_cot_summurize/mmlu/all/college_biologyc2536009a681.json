The frequencies of some alleles in a population's gene pool has changed over successive generations.\n\nEvolution occurs when there is a change in the frequency of alleles (subtle genetic differences) within a population over time. This can happen due to various factors such as natural selection, mutation, genetic drift, and genetic recombination. Over generations, these changes accumulate, leading to changes in the overall genetic makeup of the population."
