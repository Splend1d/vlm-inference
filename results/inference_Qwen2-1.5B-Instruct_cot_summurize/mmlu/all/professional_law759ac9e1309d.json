The prosecution presented a professor of art history to authenticate each piece. The defense objected on the basis that the museum curator where the paintings were housed had to identify if these were in fact the paintings that were stolen. Assuming that others will testify to the fact of the burglary, is the court likely to reject this witness as being qualified to authenticate the paintings in question, and why or why not?\n\nA. Yes, because art works and other physical evidence must be authenticated by their official custodian.\nB. Yes, because an outside person may be able to partially authenticate the painting but he can't say whether it is the one that was in the museum or that was stolen.\nC. No, granting the objection will simply waste the court's time if the court has to bring in the museum curator and go through hoops to authenticate the paintings.\nD. No, because the authentication can be accomplished in several different ways that will verify that it is the genuine piece of art in question.\n"

Yes, because art works and other physical evidence must be authenticated by their official custodian.\n\nThe reason behind this is that the museum curator is responsible for maintaining the authenticity and accuracy of the artifacts in their custody. Therefore, they have the necessary expertise and knowledge to authenticate the paintings, which would ensure that the court is confident in the accuracy of the testimony. Additionally, having the museum curator present would provide additional credibility to the testimony and help establish the chain of custody for the paintings."
