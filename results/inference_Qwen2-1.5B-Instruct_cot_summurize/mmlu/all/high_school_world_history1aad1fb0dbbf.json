Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the following background facts persuaded Europeans to engage in the actions described in the passage?\n\nA. China had recently placed an embargo on exports of silk.\nB. The price of Chinese tea had risen higher than European buyers found acceptable.\nC. China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there.\nD. China's emperor had repeatedly insulted the British ambassador.\n"

This led to increased demand for opium, which was seen as a cheaper alternative to tea. The opium trade became a lucrative business for European merchants, and eventually led to the Opium Wars between China and Britain."
