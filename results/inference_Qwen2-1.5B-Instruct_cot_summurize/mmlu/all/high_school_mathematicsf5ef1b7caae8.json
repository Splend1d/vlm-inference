                    "text": "Given that $f(x)$ is strictly convex, we know that its second derivative must be positive everywhere except possibly at its critical points. In other words, the slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point on the curve must be increasing as you move away from that point along the curve. This condition implies that the concavity changes only at inflection points, which means there can't be any inflection points inside the domain of the function. \n\nSince $f(x)$ passes through $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$, it's clear that these points define two intervals on the x-axis where the function's value is above and below the x-axis respectively. Therefore, $f(x)$ is decreasing on one side of each of these points and increasing on the other side. \n\nLet's denote $c = f(1)$. Since $f(x)$ is strictly convex, we have:\n\n\\[f(1) < f(2)\\]\n\nThis inequality holds because the slope of the line segment between $(-2,5)$ and $(2,9)$ is greater than the slope of the line segment between $(-2,5)$ and $(1,f(1))$, implying that $f(1)$ is less than $f(2)$ but greater than $f(1)$. \n\nHowever, we also need to consider that $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable, so it must have an absolute minimum at some point within its domain. Let's assume this point is $x=1$. \n\nIf $f(1) > 9$, then $f(x)$ would be decreasing on both sides of $x=1$, violating our strict convexity assumption. So, we must have $f(1) \\leq 9$.\n\nTherefore, the range of all possible values for $f(1)$ is:\n\n\\((-inf, 9]\\)\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B. (-inf, 9)**."
