However, it's important to note that even in these regions, there is still some risk of exposure to rabies due to wild animals such as bats and rodents.\n\nIn general, countries with good public health practices and strong regulations on animal welfare tend to have lower rates of rabies transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also recommended certain measures to reduce the risk of rabies transmission, including:\n\n- Vaccination of domestic animals against rabies\n- Proper disposal of animal waste\n- Restrictions on the movement of dogs and cats between different regions\n\nIt's worth noting that while rabies is not common in developed countries like the US, it can still occur in isolated cases, particularly among wildlife and pets. Therefore, it's always important to take precautions when working with potentially infected animals or in areas where they may be present."
