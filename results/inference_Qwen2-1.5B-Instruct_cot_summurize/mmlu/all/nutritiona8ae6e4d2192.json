These modifications can affect how genes are expressed, leading to changes in phenotype.\n\nDNA methylation is a common epigenetic modification that involves the addition of a methyl group (usually a form of hydrogen) to the cytosine base in the DNA sequence. This modification can either silence or activate gene expression depending on whether it's added or removed from the site of interest.\n\nGene expression can also be modified by non-coding RNA molecules such as microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs. These molecules can bind to specific sites within the genome and regulate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence directly.\n\nFinally, environmental factors such as diet, stress, and exposure to toxins can cause changes in gene expression through mechanisms other than DNA methylation or modification of RNA molecules. These changes can lead to differences in phenotype even if the underlying genetic code remains unchanged. Therefore, all of the options provided are correct."
