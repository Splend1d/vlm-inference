If each person's holdings are just, then the total distribution of holdings is just.\n\nNozick argues that if individuals' holdings are just, then it follows that the total distribution of holdings is also just. This means that even if some people have less than others, the overall distribution of wealth is fair and just. Therefore, there is no need for redistribution of wealth to address an unjust distribution of goods.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Nozick's historical entitlement theory was criticized for being too idealistic and not taking into account the reality of historical injustices. Some critics argued that the theory failed to account for the fact that some people may have been born with more resources or opportunities than others, which could lead to unfair outcomes over time."
