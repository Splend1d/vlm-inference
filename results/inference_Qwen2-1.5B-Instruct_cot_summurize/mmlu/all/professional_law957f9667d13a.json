The complaint alleged that the retailer had not delivered $100,000 worth of goods for which the woman had paid. Twenty days after being served, the retailer, which is incor-porated in State C and has its principal place of business in State B, filed a notice of removal in a federal district court in State B. Was the action properly removed?\n\nA. No, because the notice of removal was not timely filed.\nB. No, because the retailer is a citizen of State B.\nC. Yes, because the parties are citizens of different states and more than $75,000 is in controversy.\nD. Yes, because the retailer is a citizen of both State B and State C.\n"

Therefore, the retailer meets all four requirements for removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(a). Additionally, the case involves more than $75,000 in controversy as the woman's claim is for over $100,000 in goods, and there is no dispute about jurisdiction or venue. Therefore, the action can be properly removed."
