It works by detecting changes in resistance when current flows through it, which causes the galvanometer's needle to move.\n\nTherefore, a galvanometer cannot be calibrated to read either current or voltage; rather, it is designed to detect changes in current and provide an indication of that change. The correct answer is:\n\nD. Neither of these."
