Ingestion of Carnitine during exercise.\n\nWhile the other factors mentioned (ability to tolerate heavy training, tactics, and diet) can all impact success in sports, they do not directly relate to the ingestion of carnitine during exercise. Carnitine is an essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism by transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria for aerobic respiration. It is commonly used as a supplement to improve athletic performance due to its ability to enhance endurance and reduce fatigue during high-intensity exercises. However, it's important to note that while carnitine supplementation may have some benefits, it should be done under professional guidance to ensure safe and effective use."
