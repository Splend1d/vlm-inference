While it is widely recognized that individuals should have certain basic rights such as freedom from torture, slavery, and discrimination, there may be disagreements on how these rights should be interpreted or enforced.\n\n2. Advocates of humanitarian intervention exaggerate the extent of global consensus about the use of force to protect human rights. In reality, there are significant differences between countries regarding their willingness and ability to intervene in other countries' affairs, particularly when it comes to issues related to sovereignty and national interests.\n\n3. Any norm endorsing the use of force to protect individual rights could be abused by powerful states. This is because powerful states often prioritize their own interests over the well-being of others, including those who may be vulnerable to abuse or oppression.\n\nTherefore, option D (All of these options) accurately reflects the limitations of the case for humanitarian intervention."
