The 95% confidence interval estimate of the difference in mean cholesterol level lowering was (18, 41). Which of the following is a reasonable conclusion?\n\nA. Niacin lowers cholesterol an average of 18 points, while Lipitor lowers cholesterol an average of 41 points.\nB. There is a 0.95 probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual.\nC. There is a 0.95 probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin by at least 23 points in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual.\nD. None of the above.\n"

There is a 0.95 probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin by at least 23 points in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual.\n\nThis means that there is a 95% chance that the mean difference between the two drugs' effects on cholesterol levels is greater than or equal to 23 points. This does not necessarily mean that Lipitor will always be more effective than niacin; it just indicates the range within which we can expect Lipitor's effectiveness to fall."
