This could lead to an increase in the amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing into the US, as investors may see the US as a more attractive place to invest due to the low real interest rate. As a result, this could lead to increased exports and less need for imports, thus decreasing the US trade deficit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. A decrease in the demand for the United States dollar\n\nThis is because higher real interest rates make US dollars relatively cheaper compared to other currencies, making them more attractive for international investments. This could also mean that US companies would have an easier time exporting their goods overseas, leading to more jobs and growth domestically."
