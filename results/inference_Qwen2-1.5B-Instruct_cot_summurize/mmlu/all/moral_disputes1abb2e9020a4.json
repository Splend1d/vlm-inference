This means that the pleasure must be accompanied by positive effects, such as improved health or happiness, rather than negative ones like pain or suffering. Therefore, the value of a particular pleasure cannot solely depend on its quantity (how much it costs) but also on its quality (the degree to which it brings about positive outcomes)."
