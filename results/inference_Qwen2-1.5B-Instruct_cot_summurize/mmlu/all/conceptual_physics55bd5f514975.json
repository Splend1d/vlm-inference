Mass changes.\n\nTraveling at near-light speeds would require significant acceleration or deceleration, which would cause the body's mass to increase or decrease depending on how quickly or slowly it accelerates. The effect is similar to what happens when you throw a ball in the air and catch it again; if you throw it faster, it will be heavier because it has more mass, and if you throw it slower, it will have less mass. This is known as the principle of relativity."
