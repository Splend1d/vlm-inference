AR(1) process), the expected change in the dependent variable \\(y_t\\) at time \\(t+1\\), given that it has already changed by \\(\\Delta y_t\\) at time \\(t\\), can be written as:\n\n\\[ E(y_{t+1} | y_t = \\Delta y_t ) = \\Delta y_t + \\theta \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) is the drift parameter and \\(\\Delta y_t\\) is the instantaneous change in \\(y_t\\).\n\nTherefore, if we have no information about the previous values of \\(y_t\\) beyond the current value, then there is no reason to expect any particular change in \\(y_{t+1}\\). So the best one-step-ahead forecast of the change in \\(y\\) would be to simply predict zero change (\\(\\Delta y_{t+1} = 0\\)). This is option B."
