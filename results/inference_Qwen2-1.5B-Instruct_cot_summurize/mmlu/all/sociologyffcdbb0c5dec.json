However, this migration often led to discrimination against African Americans due to their status as former slaves. Some may have been denied employment or faced violence from white supremacists who viewed them as a threat to their way of life. Therefore, it is likely that the majority of former slaves encountered discrimination upon arriving in these cities. This is evident in historical records where black individuals were often excluded from certain social activities or had difficulty finding housing. The experiences of former slaves in these cities highlight the challenges they faced in adapting to their new environments and integrating into society."
