Establishing rapport to better understand the child's perspective on a problem\n\nChild interviews can be particularly useful in establishing rapport with children, allowing teachers or therapists to gain insight into their perspectives and experiences related to the issue at hand. This can help in understanding the child's feelings, motivations, and coping strategies, which is crucial for effective intervention and support. Additionally, child interviews may also provide information that is not easily accessible through other types of assessments or data collection methods. Therefore, incorporating child interviews as part of a multimethod model of assessment can help gather a more comprehensive understanding of the child's situation and needs."
