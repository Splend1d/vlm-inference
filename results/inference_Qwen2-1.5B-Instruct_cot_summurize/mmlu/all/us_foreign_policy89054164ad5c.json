Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) are typically responsible for providing a forum for discussion and monitoring of parties, but they may not have the authority to enforce agreements or provide strong enforcement mechanisms. They may be able to facilitate negotiations and help parties reach agreements, but they cannot compel them to comply with those agreements without external intervention. Therefore, IGOs are more likely to focus on providing forums for discussion and facilitating negotiations rather than enforcing agreements themselves."
