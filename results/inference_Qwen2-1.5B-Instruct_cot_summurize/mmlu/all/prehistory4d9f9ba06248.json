The village of Capilco was located in the Valley of Mexico, while Cuexcomate was located in the Valley of Oaxaca. These two villages were part of the larger city-state of Tenochtitlan, which was centered around the modern-day capital of Mexico City.\n\nIn terms of their relationship with the king and his army, the Aztecs believed in a complex system of worship and ritual sacrifice. They viewed the king as a divine figure who was responsible for maintaining order and prosperity within the city-state. However, they also recognized the importance of trade and commerce, which allowed them to accumulate wealth and resources.\n\nIt is possible that the commoners of these villages were able to thrive because they were not directly controlled or exploited by the king's army. Instead, they were able to engage in trade and other forms of economic activity, allowing them to accumulate wealth and resources for themselves and their families. Additionally, they may have been able to rely on alliances with neighboring cities and tribes, rather than being entirely dependent on the king's army for protection."
