A group of five demonstrators who wanted to protest inadequate state funding for children's services applied for a permit to march single file on the sidewalk surrounding the capitol building. Each demonstrator planned to carry a two-foot-square sign that would read, \"Our lawmakers do not care about our children.\" The group's permit application was denied pursuant to the state law, and the group has filed an action challenging the law's constitutionality. Should the court uphold the law's constitutionality?\n\nA. No, because even though the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is more restrictive than needed to serve a legitimate government interest. government interest.\nB. No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest.\nC. Yes, because even though the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, the prohibition against the display of signs is necessary to serve a compelling public interest.\nD. Yes, because the sidewalk at issue is not a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is reasonable.\n"

No, because the sidewalk at issue is a public forum, and the prohibition against the display of signs is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest. \n\nThe First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech in public forums, which include parks, plazas, streets, sidewalks, and other places open to the general public. In this case, the state's law prohibits the display of signs on the public sidewalks around the capitol building, but does not specify what type of signs are permissible or how many may be displayed.\n\nWhile it is true that the law restricts the use of public spaces for expressive activities, the court should evaluate whether the restriction serves a significant governmental interest. In this context, the state's interest in maintaining the appearance and accessibility of the capitol building outweighs the group's desire to protest inadequate state funding for children's services. Therefore, the law is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest."
