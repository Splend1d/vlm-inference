The refusal to execute criminals does not teach that the death penalty is a better deterrent than life imprisonment, nor does it suggest that criminals are usually undeterred by the possibility of receiving the death penalty. It simply means that some people choose not to carry out capital punishment, which may be due to moral or ethical reasons. Therefore, option B is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect because the statement is not supported by any evidence."
