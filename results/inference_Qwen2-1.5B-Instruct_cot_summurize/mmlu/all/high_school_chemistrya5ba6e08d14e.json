In these reactions, the substances that lose electrons are called oxidants, while the substances that gain electrons are called reducing agents or\u8fd8\u539f\u5242.\n\nIn the first reaction, Cu2+ + e- \u2192 Cu+, we see that Cu2+ is being reduced to Cu+. The electron is transferred from Cu2+ to the electron donor, which in this case is e-. Therefore, it can be considered as a reduction half-reaction.\n\nIn the second reaction, Cu+ + e- \u2192 Cu0, we see that Cu+ is being reduced to Cu0. Here, Cu+ is the oxidant and Cu0 is the reducing agent. So, it can also be considered as a reduction half-reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the third reaction, Fe2+ \u2192 Fe3+ + e-, involves the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+. This is an oxidation half-reaction, not a reduction half-reaction. In this reaction, the electron is gained by the oxidant, which in this case is Fe2+. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a reduction half-reaction.\n\nSo, the correct answers are D. 1 and 3."
