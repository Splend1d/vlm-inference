The text mentions that the ruler of Syria defeated his enemies and conquered lands, but does not provide enough context or details about the political significance of these actions. Therefore, none of the options listed (A) Victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states; (B) Victories against outsiders provided slaves whose labor sustained agricultural systems; (C) Victories against outsiders demonstrated the power of divinities over other gods; or (D) Victories against outsiders allowed leaders of states to incorporate the elites of the subjugated into the conquering power) can be considered the most likely explanation. It is possible that there may have been some form of political significance involved, but the lack of specific information makes it challenging to identify the exact nature of those significances."
