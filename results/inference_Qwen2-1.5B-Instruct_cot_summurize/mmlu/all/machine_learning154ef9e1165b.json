This can occur because the best subset of features found earlier in the process may not be the most informative or relevant subset overall. Additionally, as more features are added to the model, the complexity and size of the model may increase, which could lead to different results compared to when fewer features were used. Therefore, the choice of feature subset should be made carefully and iteratively throughout the process."
