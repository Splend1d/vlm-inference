At the beginning of the experiment, the axon is at rest and has a threshold measured at \u201370 mV at 37oC. The axon receives one stimulus that triggers one action potential in the axon. Subsequent stimuli are much stronger. Which of the following statements explains what happens when several strong stimuli are experienced by the axon?\n\nA. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201390 mV.\nB. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201350 mV.\nC. The strength of the action potential becomes greater.\nD.

                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The axon becomes hyperpolarized to \u201350 mV.\n\nWhen an axon experiences multiple strong stimuli, it may become overexcited, which can lead to depolarization of the membrane to higher voltages than normal. This process is known as hyperpolarization. When the membrane voltage reaches a certain threshold (in this case, -50 mV), the axon will fire an action potential. However, if the membrane voltage remains above this threshold for too long or if there are additional stimuli, the membrane will continue to depolarize further, eventually reaching a point where the membrane cannot be depolarized any more due to the presence of other stimuli. At this point, the axon will stop firing action potentials and enter a state of refractoriness, where the membrane potential is not changed by subsequent stimuli. \n\nSo, the axon becomes hyperpolarized to -50 mV when multiple strong stimuli are experienced, leading to the cessation of action potential generation."
