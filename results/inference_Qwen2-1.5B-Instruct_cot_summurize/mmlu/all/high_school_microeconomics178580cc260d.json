Economics is primarily concerned with how resources are used.\n\nEconomics studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in order to understand how societies allocate scarce resources efficiently. It aims to provide insights into economic behavior and decisions made by individuals, firms, and governments. While it may involve some quantitative analysis, economics also includes qualitative factors such as cultural values, social norms, and political systems. Additionally, economics is not primarily concerned with maximizing spiritual well-being or maximizing money, although these goals can be pursued within the framework of an economy."
