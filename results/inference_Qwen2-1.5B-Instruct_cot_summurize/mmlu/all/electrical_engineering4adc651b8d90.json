Therefore, the cross-sectional area \\(A\\) is:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\times (1.5)^2 = 7.07\\ m^2 \\]\n\nSince the current \\(I\\) is given as 10 A, and since the total number of turns (\\(N\\)) is 1000, the average magnetic field strength \\(B\\) is:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{NI}{AL} = \\frac{(10)(1000)}{(7.07)(0.3)} = 486\\ T \\]\n\nSubstituting these values into the energy equation gives us:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{2} I^2 B A L = \\frac{1}{2}(10^2)(486)^2 \\times 0.3 \\]\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{2}(1000)(486)^2 \\times 0.3 \\]\n\\[ E = \\frac{1}{2}(486)^2 \\times 0.3 \\]\n\\[ E = 243 \\times 0.3 \\]\n\\[ E = 72.9\\ J \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided, but it seems to be closest to option C, which suggests an incorrect understanding of the calculation. The actual value calculated from the provided information is approximately 72.9 Joules, not 0.015 Joules.
