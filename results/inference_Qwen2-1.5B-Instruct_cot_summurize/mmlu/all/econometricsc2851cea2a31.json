(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv).\n\nIn linear regression, the dependent variable (often denoted by \\(y\\)) is also known as the regressand or explained variable because it is being predicted based on the values of one or more independent variables (also known as the regressors). Similarly, the independent variables (also known as the explanatory variables) are typically denoted by \\(x\\) and can be used to predict changes in the dependent variable.\n\nTherefore, all four options listed are valid alternative names for the dependent variable in linear regression analysis."
