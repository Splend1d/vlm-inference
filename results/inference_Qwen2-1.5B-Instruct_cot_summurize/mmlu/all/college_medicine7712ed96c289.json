Alterations in dopamine and serotonin levels have been shown to influence fatigue development through their role in regulating energy metabolism, sleep-wake cycles, and mood. Pharmacological interventions that affect these neurotransmitter systems can alter fatigue levels. For example, drugs that increase dopamine levels (such as amphetamines) can lead to increased alertness and energy, while drugs that decrease serotonin levels (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can lead to decreased energy and fatigue."
