CO2 from fossil fuels\n\nThe burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, which can trap heat from the sun and contribute to global warming. This increase in atmospheric CO2 has been shown to cause a rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere in the future. \n\nAtomic warfare and dust clouds from volcanoes do not directly cause an increase in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere. However, they may indirectly affect climate by altering weather patterns or contributing to natural disasters that could have an impact on global temperatures.\n\nDepletion of Earth's ozone layer, while it does lead to increased UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface, does not have a direct effect on global temperatures."
