This can involve taking action unilaterally, such as deploying military forces abroad, imposing trade sanctions, or engaging in intelligence gathering and espionage activities. \n\nWhile multilateralism (working with other countries through international organizations) has been successful in resolving conflicts and promoting global peace and prosperity, it may not always be effective when dealing with powerful nations that seek to dominate others. Additionally, some argue that America's power and influence have made it difficult for other countries to cooperate with it on issues like climate change and nuclear proliferation, leading to a situation where the US must act alone to promote its values and interests. Therefore, all of these factors support the argument for American unilateralism."
