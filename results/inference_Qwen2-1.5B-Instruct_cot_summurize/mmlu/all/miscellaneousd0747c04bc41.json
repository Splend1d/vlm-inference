The water table would be found at an elevation higher than 550 feet above sea level but many feet below the land surface.\n\nWhen drilling into the ground, it is important to consider the depth and location of the water table. The water table is the level at which groundwater begins to flow. In this case, the well on the side of the hill penetrates the water table at an elevation of 550 feet above sea level. Therefore, if someone plans to drill on the top of the hill, the water table would likely be found at an elevation higher than 550 feet above sea level but many feet below the land surface. This is because the well has already penetrated the water table, so any additional drilling would not significantly change its position in relation to the land surface."
