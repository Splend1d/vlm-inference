As an increase in depreciation expense of $32,000.\n\nThis is because the company has already reported the depreciation on its income statement for the previous year, but they did not actually deduct the full amount due to the error. Therefore, when correcting this error in the current year, the company would need to adjust their depreciation expense accordingly to reflect the full amount of depreciation that should have been deducted. The difference between the actual and reported amounts is $40,000 (the amount of the error), so the company would need to increase their depreciation expense by $32,000 ($40,000 - $18,000) to account for the corrected error."
