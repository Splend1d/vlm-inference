Applying to prestigious universities such as Harvard, Stanford, and Oxford can help alleviate these concerns by showing that the applicant has the potential to succeed academically and professionally. Additionally, applying to the most competitive state college in her state may also provide a sense of accomplishment and pride.\n\nOn the other hand, applying to the local community college may not be a good fit for Maria's goals, as it may not offer the same level of academic rigor or opportunities for leadership and extracurricular activities. Similarly, applying to distant community colleges may not provide Maria with the same level of support and resources as attending a larger university like Harvard or Stanford."
