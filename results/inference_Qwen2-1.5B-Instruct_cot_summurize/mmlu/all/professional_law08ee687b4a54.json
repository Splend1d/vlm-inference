The contract stipulated that no money would be due until the owner's caretaker approved the work done by the painter. The painter completed the painting of all six cottages. Two days after the painter had finished the painting, a wildfire destroyed the six cottages. Although the caretaker had inspected four of the cottages to his approval, he had not inspected the other two cottages prior to their destruction. Which of the following is the LEAST accurate statement with respect to the caretaker's approval of the painting of the cottages?\n\nA. The owner would only be obligated to pay for the painting of the four cottages that the caretaker approved.\nB. The caretaker's approval of the painting of the two cottages destroyed by the wild fire would be excused.\nC. The owner would be obligated to pay for the painting of all of the cottages.\nD. The impossibility of securing the caretaker's approval would render the owner absolutely liable for all of the painting.\n"

This option is incorrect because the caretaker did not inspect any of the cottages before they were destroyed by the wildfire, so there was no way for the caretaker to approve any of the cottages.\n\nOption B: The caretaker's approval of the painting of the two cottages destroyed by the wild fire would be excused.

This option is incorrect because the caretaker did not inspect any of the cottages before they were destroyed by the wildfire, so there was no way for the caretaker to approve any of the cottages, and therefore, the owner would still be responsible for paying for the painting."
