                    "text": "The answer is D. 1/2.\n\nWhen two objects collide and stick together, the total momentum of the system remains conserved. This means that the sum of the momenta before and after the collision is equal to zero. The conservation of momentum equation can be written as:\n\np1 + p2 = 0\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are the momenta of the two objects before and after the collision, respectively.\n\nSince both objects have the same mass (m), their momenta before the collision are equal. Therefore, we can write:\n\np1 = p2\n\nNow, let's consider the conservation of kinetic energy. In a collision where both objects stick together, the total kinetic energy of the system remains constant. This means that the loss of kinetic energy during the collision must come from the conversion of potential energy into heat or other forms of energy.\n\nTo find the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision, we need to compare the change in kinetic energy to the original kinetic energy. The change in kinetic energy is given by:\n\n\u0394KE = KE1 - KE2\n\nwhere KE1 is the kinetic energy of the first object before the collision and KE2 is the kinetic energy of the second object before the collision.\n\nSubstituting the values of m for both masses gives us:\n\n\u0394KE = (1/2) * m * v1^2 - (1/2) * m * v2^2\n\nHowever, since the two objects stick together after the collision, the final velocity of the combined system is zero. Therefore, the change in kinetic energy is actually equal to the initial kinetic energy:\n\n\u0394KE = KE1 - KE1 = 0\n\nThis implies that the loss of kinetic energy during the collision is exactly equal to the original kinetic energy of each object. Since the total kinetic energy of the system remains constant, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is 1/2. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 1/2."
