Spleen\n\nThe spleen, which is located in the left upper abdomen, is an essential organ that plays a vital role in the immune system by filtering blood and removing old red blood cells and other waste products from the body. When it is injured or damaged, it can lead to significant complications if not properly treated.\n\nBlunt trauma to the left upper abdomen can cause injuries to various organs depending on the specific mechanism of injury. However, the spleen is more commonly involved due to its location and function. The other options listed (appendix, gallbladder, urinary bladder) are less likely to be directly affected by blunt trauma without direct physical damage or rupture.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the most likely organ involved in this scenario is C. Spleen."
