Teotihuac\u00e1n was one of the most important pre-Columbian cities in Mesoamerica and it was located in the Valley of Mexico. The city was built around 200 BCE and it had a population of about 50,000 people at its peak. However, in the second half of the 6th century CE, the city was destroyed by an eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano which caused a large amount of debris to fall onto the city. This event led to the abandonment of the city and the subsequent decline of the Aztec Empire."
