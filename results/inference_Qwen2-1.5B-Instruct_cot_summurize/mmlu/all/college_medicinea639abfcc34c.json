The patient is a middle-aged businessman who is irate and creating a scene because he was told he would have to see the dental hygienist instead of the dentist. The patient loudly rants that he makes too much money to be subjected to treatment by a half-trained associate. The clerk explains to the dentist that the patient was 40 minutes late to his appointment, and the only opening now was with the hygienist. The patient snaps back that his time is worth more than any of the people in the office. What personality disorder is this patient likely exhibiting?\n\nA. Histrionic\nB. Narcissistic\nC. Paranoid\nD. Obsessive-compulsive\n"

These individuals often believe they are entitled to certain privileges or services and may view others as inferior or unimportant. In this scenario, the patient feels that their time is valuable enough to warrant seeing a dentist rather than a hygienist, which could indicate a sense of entitlement or superiority complex. However, it's important to note that diagnosing personality disorders requires a thorough assessment and should not be made based on limited information provided here."
