A ping sweep is typically used to identify live systems, as it can detect if a host is responding to a network request by sending out a ICMP echo request and receiving an ICMP echo reply from that system. This can help determine if a system is still operational and accessible. It can also be used to locate specific IP addresses or networks, as well as to test for firewall functionality."
