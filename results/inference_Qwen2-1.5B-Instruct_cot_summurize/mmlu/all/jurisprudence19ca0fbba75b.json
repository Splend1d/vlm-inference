The social contract cannot be entered into unless there is peace.\n\nHobbes believed that in the state of nature, people have no rights and live in constant fear of violence and death. To avoid this state of chaos, individuals must enter into a social contract with other individuals, forming a society or state. This social contract requires that all members agree to abide by certain laws and rules for the good of the community as a whole. One of these laws is peace, which is necessary for the existence and survival of human beings. Without peace, there can be no social order, and therefore no possibility of entering into a social contract. Therefore, peace is the first law of nature according to Hobbes."
