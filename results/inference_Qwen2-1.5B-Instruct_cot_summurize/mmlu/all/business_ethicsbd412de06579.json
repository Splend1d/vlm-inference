Codes of ethics, Internet - social media and networking. \n\nAnnual reports and company financial performance are not necessarily related to business ethics management tools, as they are more focused on reporting financial information rather than ethical considerations. \n\nCodes of ethics are a set of guidelines or principles that guide how employees should conduct themselves in their professional relationships, including dealing with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. They can also include provisions around compliance with laws and regulations, as well as environmental and social responsibility. \n\nIn recent years, there has been increased emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability, which often involves using technology such as social media and networking platforms to communicate with stakeholders and engage in dialogue about responsible business practices. This has led to the development of new business ethics management tools that specifically address these concerns."
