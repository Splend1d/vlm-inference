These organisms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and release it back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide during respiration. This process helps to regulate the Earth's climate by removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nIn addition to their role in atmospheric CO2 uptake, oceans also play a crucial role in carbon cycle processes such as sequestration of atmospheric CO2, nutrient cycling, and primary productivity. Ocean acidification, which occurs due to increased CO2 levels, can have negative impacts on marine ecosystems.\n\nTherefore, the oceans are considered the largest active pool of carbon on Earth and contribute significantly to carbon cycling."
