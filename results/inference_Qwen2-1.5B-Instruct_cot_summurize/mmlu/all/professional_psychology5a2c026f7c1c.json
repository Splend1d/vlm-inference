Social ostracism\n\nPeople with antisocial personalities often struggle with social relationships and may be isolated from others, which can negatively impact their ability to learn and develop new skills. Social ostracization can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety, which can further hinder their ability to engage in learning activities. Additionally, lack of social support can make it difficult for individuals with antisocial personalities to access resources and information necessary for successful learning."
