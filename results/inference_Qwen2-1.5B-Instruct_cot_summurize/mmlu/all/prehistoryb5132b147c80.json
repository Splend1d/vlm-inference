Chiefdom\n\nA chiefdom is a small political unit consisting of one or more closely related clans, often living in close proximity to each other and sharing common religious beliefs. It is considered more complex than a tribe because it involves a larger number of people (often thousands) and has its own government with leaders who exercise authority over their subordinates.\n\nAn archaic state is a historical state that existed before modern states were established. It is not as complex as a modern state because it lacks many of the features that make up a modern state, such as a written constitution, a standing army, and a legal system.\n\nAn egalitarian society is a group of individuals who live together without any form of government or hierarchy. It is not as complex as a state because it lacks the structures and functions that define a state.\n\nA democratic state is a type of government where citizens have the right to vote on important issues and participate in the decision-making process. It is not as complex as a state because it relies on the consent of the governed rather than the centralization of power in a single leader or group of leaders.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, a chiefdom is the most complex option compared to the others, while an archaic state is the least complex."
