The total welfare is maximized.\n\nIn a competitive market, prices are determined by supply and demand curves, which means that producers have an incentive to produce goods at the highest possible price they can sell them for. This leads to a situation where the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded, resulting in excess supply and lower prices. However, as long as there is no monopoly or collusion among sellers, consumers will benefit from lower prices and higher quality goods. In addition, competition encourages innovation and efficiency, leading to better products and services being produced at lower costs. Therefore, the total welfare of society is maximized in a competitive market."
