Three weeks after the robbery, a defendant was arrested and charged with the crime. At trial, the prosecuting attorney seeks to introduce evidence that the defendant had previously committed a robbery wearing a yellow ski mask, goggles, and a fluorescent yellow jumpsuit. Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the proffered evidence should be\n\nA. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the defendant committed the crime as charged.\nB. admissible, to show the identity of the defendant.\nC. inadmissible, because the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\nD. inadmissible, because it constitutes improper character evidence.\n"

The prosecution's evidence would not provide any additional information about the defendant's guilt or innocence beyond what has already been established through other evidence presented at trial. Additionally, introducing this type of evidence could potentially cause undue prejudice against the defendant and undermine the fairness of the trial."
