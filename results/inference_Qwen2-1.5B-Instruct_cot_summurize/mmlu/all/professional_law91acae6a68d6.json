Later, the owner of the dwelling attempted to use it as a dental office. The other owners in the subdivision asked the court to enjoin the intended use. Leaving aside zoning issues, will the court likely grant the request to prohibit the intended use?\n\nA. No, the wording is ambiguous and therefore any use is now permitted.\nB. The wording only restricts the building of the structure and does not restrict its later use so that the owner is entitled to change the use.\nC. The intention was to enforce a residential use of the property so that the intended change in use will not be allowed.\nD. A professional use of a building cannot be prohibited by a land restriction.f\n"

The wording only restricts the building of the structure and does not restrict its later use so that the owner is entitled to change the use.\n\nThe plat restriction clearly states that no structure shall be built except for dwelling purposes. This means that the owner cannot build anything else than a dwelling on the lot. However, it does not state anything about the intended use of the dwelling once it has been built.\n\nTherefore, if the owner intends to use the dwelling as a dental office, they can do so without violating the plat restriction. The court is unlikely to grant an injunction to prevent this use of the property."
