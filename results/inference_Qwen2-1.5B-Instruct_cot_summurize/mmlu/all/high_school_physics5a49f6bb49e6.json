Since the cannon moves forward at a constant speed of 5 m/s, this means that after reaching maximum height, the cannon will move back at a speed of 5 m/s relative to the ground. Therefore, the time taken to reach maximum height is half the time the cannon spends moving forward, which is 2.5 seconds.\n\nSubstituting the values into the range equation:\n\n\\[ R = v \\sin{\\theta}t \\]\n\\[ 50 \\sin{\\theta}(2.5) = 50 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\theta\\):\n\n\\[ 13.14 = \\sin{\\theta} \\times 2.5 \\]\n\\[ \\sin{\\theta} = \\frac{13.14}{2.5} \\approx 5.26 \\]\n\nTaking the inverse sine of both sides gives us:\n\n\\[ \\theta \\approx 78.9^\\circ \\]\n\nSince angles must be expressed in whole numbers or multiples of 90 degrees, the closest multiple of 90 degrees to 78.9\u00b0 is 89\u00b0. However, since we're looking for an angle between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, the correct answer would be:\n\n\\[ B. 41\u00b0 \\]"
