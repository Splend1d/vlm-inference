This involves restructuring public organizations, focusing on outcomes rather than process, using performance contracts, and decentralizing decision-making. The goal of NPM is to create a more responsive and effective public sector that can compete with the private sector in delivering services to citizens. Therefore, options A, B, C, and D are all correct answers."
