This method provides a way to monitor the concentration of free radicals over time and can be used to determine the relative amounts of different free radical intermediates.\n\nDirect detection of free radical intermediates using EPR, on the other hand, may not be possible due to the low concentration of free radicals that are typically present at the initial stages of a reaction. Spin trapping can overcome this limitation by providing a means to observe the decay of these intermediates over time. Therefore, the sentence explaining why spin trapping is often used to detect free radical intermediates is \"steady state concentration of free radical intermediates is often too low to enable direct detection by EPR.\""
