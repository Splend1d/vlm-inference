This approach provides an incentive for Mary to stay focused on her seat work by rewarding her with something she enjoys after successfully completing it. \n\nAllowing Mary to read from a teacher-selected book or explaining the value of completing seat work can also be beneficial, but they do not provide immediate consequences that encourage Mary to remain in her seat. Removing the blocks from the classroom may also discourage Mary from leaving her seat, but it does not address the underlying issue of her failure to complete seat work.\n\nAll of these options have their own advantages, but option B is likely to be the most effective in increasing the long-term likelihood that Mary will complete her seat work."
