The agency is authorized to enter into and carry out such contracts or agreements as are necessary in the conduct of its business. An export company entered into a contract with the federal agency to transport a variety of goods to foreign countries. Thereafter, the federal agency suspended the export company pending an investigation into possible misuse of official inspection certificates relating to commodities exported to a foreign country. During an investigation relevant to the charge, the president of the export company presented information to the federal agency. Subsequently, the president was charged with violation of a federal statute that states:\"It is a felony for any person in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency to knowingly make a false statement. \"At the president's trial, the government presented evidence to show that he falsified bills of lading and embezzled over $500,000 of surplus commodities for export. The president testified that he did not know that he was dealing with a federal agency and, hence, the federal government would have jurisdiction over his company's export contract with the federal agency. As to the significance of the president's ignorance, the court should instruct the jury that it may convict the president\n\nA. if it finds that the president knew that he was doing business with a federal agency.\nB. if it finds that the president was aware that he might have been doing business with a federal agency.\nC. if a reasonable person would have been aware that he might have been doing business with a federal agency.\nD. even if there was no reason the president should have known that he was doing business with a federal agency.\n"

If a reasonable person would have been aware that they were doing business with a federal agency.\n\nIn this scenario, the president is charged with violating a federal statute that makes it a felony for anyone involved in a matter involving a federal agency to knowingly make a false statement. The government presents evidence showing that the president falsified bills of lading and embezzled over $500,000 of surplus commodities for export. However, the president claims ignorance because he does not believe that he is dealing with a federal agency.\n\nThe court should instruct the jury that the president may be convicted even if he did not know that he was dealing with a federal agency. This is because ignorance is not a defense to a felony charge under federal law. A reasonable person would be aware that they were dealing with a federal agency based on their actions and interactions with the agency during the course of the case. Therefore, the court should instruct the jury to consider whether a reasonable person would have been aware of the president's activities and conclude that he violated the federal statute."
