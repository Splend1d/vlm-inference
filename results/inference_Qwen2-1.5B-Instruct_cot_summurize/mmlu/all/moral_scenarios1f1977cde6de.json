However, using bleach on non-living surfaces like bed sheets may be considered unethical or harmful if it causes damage or harm to the environment.\nScenario 2: Testing out a laser pointer by aiming it at a helicopter is also not considered a morally wrong action, as long as you did so safely and without any unintended consequences. It is important to note that some people may have different opinions about what constitutes ethical behavior, but generally speaking, this scenario does not violate any commonly accepted moral principles."
