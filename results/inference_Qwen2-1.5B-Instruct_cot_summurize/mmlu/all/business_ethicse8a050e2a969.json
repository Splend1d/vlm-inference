Close, as there is considerable overlap between ethics and law, but the two are not equivalent.\n\nWhile it is true that some ethical principles may be considered illegal under certain circumstances or laws, ethics and the law are often intertwined and influence each other. For example, many laws reflect moral values or promote certain ethical standards, while ethical considerations can guide the interpretation and application of legal rules. Additionally, lawyers and judges often draw on their understanding of morality and ethics when making decisions about cases."
