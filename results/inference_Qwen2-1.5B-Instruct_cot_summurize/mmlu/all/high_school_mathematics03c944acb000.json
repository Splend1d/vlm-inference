And we also know that $7q = 924$ (from the second statement). \n\nFirst, let's solve the second equation for $q$. We have $q = \\frac{924}{7} = 132$. Then, we can substitute this value into the first equation to find the cost of one pencil: $11p = 3*132 = 396$. To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100, so the cost of one pencil in cents is $396 * 100 = 39600$.\n\nHowever, we made an error in our calculation. The correct way to do it is to use the information given in the second equation directly. We know that $7q = 924$, so dividing both sides by 7 gives us $q = \\frac{924}{7} = 132$. Then, substituting this back into the equation $11p = 3q$ gives us $11p = 3*132 = 396$. So the cost of one pencil in cents is indeed $396$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 36."
