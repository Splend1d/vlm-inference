They can also cause more serious diseases in some people, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The most common type of adenovirus infection is called adenovirus 40, which causes mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections like the common cold.\n\nDiarrhoea and eye infections are caused by other types of adenoviruses, while haemorrhagic cystitis is caused by another type of adenovirus known as adenovirus 314."
