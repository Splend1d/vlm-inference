The passage mentions Anscombe criticizing Sidgwick, but it does not provide any specific criticism or justification for each option listed. Therefore, we cannot confidently say whether option A (he does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of one's action), option B (he endorses the divine law conception of ethics), or option C (he claims that there is a \"natural balance\" to the universe) is true based on the information given. Without additional context or evidence, we cannot make a determination about the accuracy of these statements."
