They also differ in that they release the nitrogen waste urea instead of ammonia. Which of the following statements correctly explains how this is an advantage for lungfish?\n\nA. Urea is insoluble in water and sinks to the bottom of the small pools. Thus the poisonous substance is isolated from the fish.\nB. Ammonia, which is highly toxic, would endanger lungfish that inhabit the small pools.\nC. Other fish in the small pools can use urea as an energy source.\nD. The highly toxic urea makes the pool uninhabitable to competitors.\n"

Thus the poisonous substance is isolated from the fish.\n\nThe African lungfish releases urea as their waste product rather than ammonia because urea is more stable and less toxic than ammonia. This means that the urea does not easily decompose or be released into the water, making it less likely to harm the lungs of other fish living in the small pools where the lungfish reside. Additionally, since urea is not easily broken down by bacteria, it may accumulate in the water, providing a natural filtration mechanism for the small pools."
