The largest such number within this range is 46,999 (since 46,999 + 1000 = 47,999, which exceeds our target value).\n\nTherefore, option A, 46,999, could be the number that was rounded to the nearest thousand and had a value of exactly 47,000. \n\nThe other options are:\n\n- B: 46,504 rounds up to 47,000.\n- C: 47,520 does not round down to 47,000 because 47,520 is greater than 47,000.\n- D: 47,924 rounds down to 47,000 but it's not possible since 47,924 > 47,000.\n\nHence, the correct answer is **A**."
