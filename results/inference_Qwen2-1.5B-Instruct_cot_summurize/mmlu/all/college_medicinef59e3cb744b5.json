The pressure in the neck is equal to the pressure in the knee because of the equal dynamic pressure according to the continuity equation\n\nAccording to Bernoulli's principle, the total energy per unit volume (kinetic + potential) remains constant for an incompressible fluid flowing through a fixed path. In this case, the flow is from the neck to the right knee, so there is no change in kinetic energy. However, the fluid experiences a decrease in potential energy due to the difference in elevation between the two points. Since the fluids have equal cross-sectional areas, the amount of fluid passing through each capillary does not differ, meaning that the pressures must also be equal.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer."
