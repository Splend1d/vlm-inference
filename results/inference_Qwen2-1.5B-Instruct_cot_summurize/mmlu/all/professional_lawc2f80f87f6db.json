The artist agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the retiree's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the artist has continued to pay his rent, and the retiree continued to accept it. The building became infested with rats after a restaurant was opened in the adjacent building. The artist could not tolerate the rats and served notice on the retiree that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. At common law, what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period?\n\nA. Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.\nB. Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.\nC. Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.\nD. Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.\n"

Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three-year period.\n\nWhen the original three-year lease expired, the artist continued to pay rent, which means that the retiree had a continuing right to receive the rent as long as the artist remained on the property. Under common law principles, if the artist did not return after the expiration of the lease, the retiree would have the right to recover the rent due up until the time when the artist vacated the premises. In this case, the artist vacated the premises after a year, so the retiree would be entitled to double the rent for the remaining months (12 months) plus one month (the year itself), resulting in a total recovery of 36 months' worth of rent."
