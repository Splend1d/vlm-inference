The total spin quantum number (S) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + (-\\frac{1}{2}) = 0 \\]\n\nHowever, this result doesn't match any of the options given. Therefore, we need to consider the fact that in the ground state of neutral nitrogen, all three electrons have the same spin, which means they cancel each other out. So, the correct answer is not listed among the choices provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 5/2."
