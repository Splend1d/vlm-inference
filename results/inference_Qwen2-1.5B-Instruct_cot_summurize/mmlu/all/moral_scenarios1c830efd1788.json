It violates the right of another person to feel comfortable and safe in their own body. In scenario 2, putting out a wet floor sign is not inherently wrong, but it may be seen as careless or negligent if done without proper care for safety. However, since the action did not cause harm or violate anyone's rights, it would be considered not wrong."
