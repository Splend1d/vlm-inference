The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Instead of opposing the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the action and filed a new action, alleging the same claims but also addressing the pleading defects outlined in the defendant's motion to dismiss. The defendant then moved to dismiss the second action, and the plaintiff again voluntarily dismissed the second action instead of filing opposition papers. The plaintiff then filed a third action, alleging the same claims but also including additional allegations that were responsive to the defendant's second motion. The defendant has moved to dismiss the third action; the plaintiff opposes the motion. Is the court likely to grant the defendant's motion?\n\nA. No, because the plaintiff has promptly and diligently attempted to address the pleading defects.\nB. No, because the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed each previous action before the defendant filed an answer or moved for summary judgment.\nC. Yes, because the plaintiff failed to seek a court order dismissing the second action.\nD. Yes, because the plaintiff's previously dismissed actions asserting the same claims dismissed actions asserting the same claims operate as an adjudication on the merits.\n"

Yes, because the plaintiff's previously dismissed actions asserting the same claims dismiss actions asserting the same claims operate as an adjudication on the merits.\n\nIn this scenario, the plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed each previous action before the defendant filed an answer or moved for summary judgment. This action is akin to an \"adjudication on the merits\" under Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which allows the dismissal of a case if it appears that there will be no live issues of fact or law for trial. Therefore, the court is likely to grant the defendant's motion."
