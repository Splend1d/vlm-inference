All of the above.\n\nThe Sreberny-Mohammadi argument suggests that national cultures can resist American cultural domination of the media by adopting and adapting American-style programming in order to maintain their own cultural identity. This could involve producing more \"home-produced\" programs that reflect local culture and values, controlling the distribution of imported products to limit access to American media, and promoting \"reverse flows\" of their own programming to other countries. These strategies would help preserve the distinctiveness of national cultures while still engaging with global media markets."
