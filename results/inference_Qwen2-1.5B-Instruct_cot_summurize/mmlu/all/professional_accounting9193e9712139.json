The auditor must obtain preapproval from the audit committee if the nonaudit services are expected to have a significant impact on the scope, timing, or results of the audit. However, if the nonaudit services are not expected to have a significant impact on the audit, the auditor can provide them without preapproval.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it specifies that the nonaudit services must be provided for revenue streams that represent less than 5% of the total revenues paid by the issuer to the auditor. This would limit the types of nonaudit services that could be provided, potentially excluding some options listed in the other answers.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because it states that the nonaudit services must be promptly brought to the attention of and approved by the audit committee before the completion of the audit. This requirement does not apply when the nonaudit services are not expected to have a significant impact on the audit.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that the nonaudit services should be performed for financial information systems design and implementation. While this option may be relevant in certain cases, it does not address the specific question regarding what types of nonaudit services are allowed under the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Services that the issuer did not recognize as nonaudit services at the time of the engagement."
