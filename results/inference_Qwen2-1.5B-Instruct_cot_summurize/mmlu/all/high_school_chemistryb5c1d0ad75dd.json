                    "text": "To find the concentration of BrCl at equilibrium, we can use the equation for the equilibrium constant (K), which is equal to the product of the concentrations of the reactants divided by the product of the concentrations of the products:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{[Br_2][Cl_2]}{[BrCl]^2} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( K = 15.0 \\) and \\( [Br_2] = 10.0 \\, \\text{g}\\) of Br2, we need to convert this mass into moles before proceeding. The molar mass of Br2 is approximately 76 g/mol.\n\n\\[ [Br_2] = \\frac{10.0 \\, \\text{g}}{76 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 0.135 \\, \\text{mol} \\]\n\nSubstituting these values into the equilibrium constant equation gives us:\n\n\\[ 15.0 = \\frac{[Br_2][Cl_2]}{[BrCl]^2} \\]\n\\[ 15.0 = \\frac{0.135 \\times 0.135}{[BrCl]^2} \\]\n\\[ 15.0 = \\frac{0.0180225}{[BrCl]^2} \\]\n\\[ [BrCl]^2 = \\frac{15.0}{0.0180225} \\]\n\\[ [BrCl]^2 \u2248 84.7647 \\, \\text{M}^2 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us:\n\n\\[ [BrCl] \u2248 9.14 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nConverting back from moles per liter to moles per liter:\n\n\\[ [BrCl] \u2248 \\frac{9.14 \\, \\text{M}}{15.0 \\, \\text{L}} \u2248 0.609 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the answer is approximately 0.61 mol/L, which corresponds to option D. However, since the question asks for the concentration of BrCl in mol/L, we should not round this value. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 9.9 \u00d7 10^-4 M"
