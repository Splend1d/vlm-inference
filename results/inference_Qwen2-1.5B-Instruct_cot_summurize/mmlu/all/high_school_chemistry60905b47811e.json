Diamond - This is the allotrope of carbon that is most commonly known as diamonds. It is a form of carbon with a crystal structure similar to a cubic lattice and it has high melting point and strength.\n\nB. Soot - This is also known as pitch or coal tar. It is formed when incomplete combustion occurs and contains a mixture of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and other compounds. So, sot is not an allotrope of carbon.\n\nC. Buckminsterfullerene (also known as Buckyballs) - These are icosahedral molecules made up of six-carbon rings connected by single bonds. They have been used in nanotechnology applications such as supercapacitors. So, buckminsterfullerene is an allotrope of carbon.\n\nD. Graphite - This is another allotrope of carbon with a hexagonal crystalline structure. It is the most abundant form of carbon on Earth and is widely used in pencils, writing instruments, and batteries.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Soot."
