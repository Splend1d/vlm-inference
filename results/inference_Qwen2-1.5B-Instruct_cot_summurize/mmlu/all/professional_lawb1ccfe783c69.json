The label states that a \"patch test\" is necessary because a small percentage of the population may be allergic to the chemicals contained in the product and susceptible to suffering scalp irritation. A Russian immigrant recently moved to the United States from Moscow. The immigrant cannot read or speak English. One day, the immigrant purchased a bottle of the shampoo from a drug store. She looked at the label warning but did not understand it. After throwing away the box cover, she used the shampoo without making a \"patch test. \" Minutes later, she began experiencing an allergic reaction and scalp irritation. This was followed by hair loss attributed to the shampoo. If the immigrant brings suit against the company for strict products liability, she will most likely\n\nA. win, because she suffered injury from her use of the product.\nB. win, because the manufacturer was aware that a small percentage of the population would suffer an allergic reaction to the shampoo.\nC. lose, because she didn't read or speak English.\nD. lose, because she assumed the risk by not making the \"patch test. \"\n"

In this case, the immigrant did not take the time to make a \"patch test,\" which is a simple way to determine whether you have an allergy to a particular ingredient in the shampoo. Without taking this step, there is no evidence that the manufacturer was aware of any potential issues with the product.\n\nTherefore, the immigrant can potentially sue the manufacturer for strict products liability, as long as she could show that the manufacturer should have known about the risk of an allergic reaction due to the lack of a patch test."
