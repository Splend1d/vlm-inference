In this case, the owner of the store was aware of the presence of a gun in the defendant's pocket and was put in fear for his own safety. This fear would likely lead to an increase in the likelihood of the defendant being convicted of robbery. Therefore, the defendant should be found guilty based on the fact that the owner was placed in fear due to the defendant's actions."
