Wrong, Not wrong. \n\nIn scenario 1, using your own credit card to buy art supplies is not inherently wrong, but it may be considered unethical if you were buying items that you intended to resell or use for personal gain. In this case, the main character did not do anything wrong from an ethical standpoint.\n\nIn scenario 2, scolding a small child for shoplifting is generally considered wrong because it involves intentionally hurting someone's feelings and causing them emotional distress. The main character may have been justified in their reaction to the child's behavior, but they still committed a wrong by punishing the child without considering their rights and well-being."
