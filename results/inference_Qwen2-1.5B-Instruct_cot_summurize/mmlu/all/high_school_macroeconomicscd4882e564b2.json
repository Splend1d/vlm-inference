Its imports exceed its exports.\n\nA country with a balance of trade deficit means that it is importing more than it is exporting, which leads to a negative balance in its trade account. This can be caused by factors such as high prices for imported goods or low productivity in domestic industries. In order to correct this, the country may need to either increase production domestically or decrease imports. Shipping gold to creditors is not a practical solution and would not solve the underlying problem of an import surplus. A depreciation of the country's currency could also occur if the country is unable to reduce imports quickly enough, but this would only serve to exacerbate the situation rather than resolve it."
