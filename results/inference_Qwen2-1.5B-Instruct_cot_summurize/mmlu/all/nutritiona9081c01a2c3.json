This is because the fetus is exposed to environmental toxins and chemicals, such as those associated with the Dutch Hunger Winter, during this time. The third trimester is also a critical period for fetal development, but the effects of prenatal exposure may not be fully understood or quantified yet. Therefore, it's likely that the second trimester has the largest impact on DNA methylation levels. However, it's important to note that this is an educated guess based on available research and should not be taken as definitive proof without further study."
