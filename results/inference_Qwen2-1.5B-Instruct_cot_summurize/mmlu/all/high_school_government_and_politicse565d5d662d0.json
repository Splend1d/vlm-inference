When an appeal is made to the Supreme Court, the court typically reviews the decision of the lower court and determines whether it was proper or not. If the Supreme Court finds that the lower court's decision was incorrect, it will rule in favor of the defendant and reverse the lower court's decision. However, if the Supreme Court agrees with the lower court's decision, it may decline to review the case further or may simply affirm the lower court's ruling."
