Exon skipping refers to the process by which certain exons in a gene are skipped during mRNA splicing, resulting in the production of truncated or non-functional proteins. This can occur due to mutations in the splicing factors that regulate the splicing process. Regulatory mutations and silent mutations may also contribute to exon skipping, but they do not directly result from it. Nonsense mutations may lead to protein truncation, but they do not necessarily involve exon skipping."
