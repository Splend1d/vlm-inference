The images are believed to have been created by the Nazca people between the 4th century BCE and the 7th century CE. Some of the most well-known and recognizable geoglyphs include the \"human face\" and the \"bull's head.\" These geoglyphs are thought to represent various mythological creatures, spirits, and deities from the local culture."
