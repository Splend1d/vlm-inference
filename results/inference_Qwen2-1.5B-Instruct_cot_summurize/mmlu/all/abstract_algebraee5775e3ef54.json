This is a fundamental property of permutations that allows us to consider them as functions from the set to itself.\n\nStatement 2: Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one-to-one.\nThis statement is false. While all bijections are permutations, not all permutations are bijections. For example, the identity function on any set is a bijection but not a permutation, since it maps every element to itself. Therefore, the second statement is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False, False."
