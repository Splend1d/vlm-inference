The buyer later stopped the seller from continuing to use the strip for travel because no road had been constructed. The landowner sued the buyer, claiming that he still owned the forty-foot strip of land because it was not conveyed in the deed and was at best ambiguously stated. Will the court consider the outside evidence that the parties intended this to be a right-of-way over the buyer's land?\n\nA. No, the court will confine itself to what is in the four corners of the deed.\nB. No, because that would violate the parole evidence rule.\nC. Yes, because the court always has a right to reform the wording of a deed according to the court's interpretation of what it means.\nD. Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\n"

Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\n\nThe court may consider outside evidence, such as side agreements or oral agreements between the parties, to supplement the language of the deed and determine the true intent of the parties. This is known as parol evidence. The court must also ensure that any external evidence does not contradict the terms of the deed. If there is no contradiction, then the court may consider the extrinsic evidence to understand the meaning of the ambiguous language."
