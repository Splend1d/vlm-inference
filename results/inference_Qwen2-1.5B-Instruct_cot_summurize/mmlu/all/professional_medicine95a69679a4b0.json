Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant medication that is known to interact with certain drugs and medications. Some studies have suggested that it can decrease the absorption or excretion of certain vitamins and minerals, including vitamin D. Therefore, increasing the patient's intake of vitamin D could be recommended as a way to counteract any potential effects of carbamazepine on vitamin D metabolism."
