This means that for every 3 units of A,T there are 2 units of C,G.\n\nWhen DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the template strand, it will add complementary nucleotides based on the ratio of A:T on the template strand. Since we have a total of 5 (A,T,C,G) and we know that there are 3 units of A,T on the template strand, the remaining 2 units must come from C,G.\n\nTherefore, when DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the template strand, it will add:\n\n- 3 units of A,T = 3/5 units of each base\n- 2 units of C,G = 2/5 units of each base\n\nSo, the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized complimentary strand of DNA would be 3:2.\n\nThe correct answer is C. 2:03."
