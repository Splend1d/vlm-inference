                    "text": "The range of firing angle control for a single-phase one-pulse-controlled circuit is determined by the relationship between the firing angle and the counter-emf.\n\nIn this case, the counter-emf is given by:\n\nE = Rsin(frequency)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the input signal (which is assumed to be sinusoidal), and R is the resistance in the circuit.\n\nGiven that the load counter-emf is 200 V, we can set up an equation for the firing angle using the relationship between the counter-emf and the firing angle:\n\nRsin(frequency) = 200\n\nWe want to find the range of firing angles for which the counter-emf is 200 V, so we need to solve this equation for the firing angle.\n\nsin(frequency) = 200/R\n\nTaking the inverse sine of both sides gives us:\n\nfiring_angle = arcsin(200/R)\n\nTo find the range of firing angles, we need to consider the values of R from 0 to infinity. Since the frequency must be positive, we only need to consider the first quadrant where the value of sin(x) is positive.\n\nFor a given value of R, the firing angle will vary from 0 to 90 degrees. Therefore, the range of firing angles for a load counter-emf of 200 V is:\n\n60\u00b0 to 180\u00b0\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 60\u00b0 to 180\u00b0."
