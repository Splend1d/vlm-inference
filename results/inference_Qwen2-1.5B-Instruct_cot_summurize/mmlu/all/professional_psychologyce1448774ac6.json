As we age, our brains may become less efficient at processing and storing information, which can lead to a decline in our ability to remember things. This decline is often referred to as \"senescence\" or \"aging-related cognitive decline.\" While other factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and brain structure also play a role in memory loss, the efficiency of controlled memory processes is a key factor that contributes to this decline. Metamemory skills, or knowledge about memory, can also decline with age, but they are not directly related to the efficiency of controlled memory processes. Recognition memory refers to the ability to recall specific facts or details, and does not necessarily correlate with memory decline with age. The amount of factual memory knowledge available is another factor that can contribute to memory loss, but it is not the same as the efficiency of controlled memory processes."
