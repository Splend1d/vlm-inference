In this case, the frequency difference between the tuning fork and the piano string is 1134 Hz (the difference between 1134 Hz and 1131 Hz), and there are 3 beats per second. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\nBeat frequency = 1134 Hz / 3 = 381 Hz\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the frequency of the piano string, we need to find the number that when added or subtracted from 1134 Hz produces an integer multiple of 381 Hz. By trial and error, we find that 1137 Hz satisfies this condition because 1137 Hz + 381 Hz = 1134 Hz and 1137 Hz - 381 Hz = 1134 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, 1137 Hz."
