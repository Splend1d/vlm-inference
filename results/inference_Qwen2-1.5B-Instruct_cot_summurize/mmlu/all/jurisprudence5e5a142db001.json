Morality is generally in advance of the law.\n\nNon-positivist legal theorists argue that law should not be seen as an objective reality separate from morality, but rather as a social construct shaped by societal values and norms. They believe that laws are not just enforced through coercion or punishment, but also through the influence of cultural and moral beliefs. Therefore, they see law and morality as being intertwined and constantly evolving together."
