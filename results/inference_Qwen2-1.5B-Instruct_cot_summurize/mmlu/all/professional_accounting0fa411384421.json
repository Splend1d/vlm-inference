                    "text": "To determine Carson's income from the S Corporation if the distribution was proportionate, we need to first calculate the amount that Carson would have received as a dividend if it were an S Corporation. \n\nGiven that Carson owns 40% of the outstanding stock, he would receive 40% of the corporation's total taxable income.\n\nThe corporation's taxable income is $400,000. So, Carson would have received:\n\\[ \\frac{40\\%}{100} \\times \\$400,000 = \\$160,000 \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes Carson received all his dividends in cash. In reality, Carson could also have received shares or other types of non-cash benefits.\n\nSince the question does not specify what Carson actually received (cash or shares), we'll use the amount Carson reported on his individual tax return ($$28,000) for our calculations. This represents the amount Carson would report if he were to claim the full amount of his dividends as ordinary income on his tax return.\n\nNow, let's adjust Carson's reported income by the percentage he would have received as a dividend:\n\n\\[ \\text{Adjusted income} = \\$28,000 \\times 100\\% = \\$280,000 \\]\n\nThis means Carson would have reported $280,000 on his individual tax return if the corporation were an S Corporation with proportionate distributions to the owners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. $160,000**."
