The world condemns South Africa\u2019s discrimination.\n\nThe poet uses the phrase \"remember the unquenchable will for freedom\" to emphasize the importance of remembering the events of Sharpeville and the resistance against apartheid. By doing so, the poet hopes to inspire a sense of hope and determination among those who continue to fight for equality and justice. The phrase also suggests that there may be a deeper level of understanding or recognition of the severity of apartheid's actions beyond simply acknowledging its existence."
