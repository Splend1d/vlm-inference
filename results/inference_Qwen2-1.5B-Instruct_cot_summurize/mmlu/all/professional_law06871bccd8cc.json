                    "text": "An engineer signed a two-year contract to serve as the chief safety engineer for a coal mine at a salary of $7,000 per month. The position required the engineer to work underground each workday. After one week on the job, the engineer became very ill. He requested testing of the mine air system, which revealed the presence of a chemical agent to which the engineer had a rare allergic reaction. The engineer promptly quit. The coal mine then hired a qualified replacement for the remainder of the engineer's contract at a salary of $7,500 per month. Assume that no statute or regulation applies. If the coal mine sues the engineer for breach of contract, is the coal mine likely to recover damages?\n\nA. No, because an at-will employee has the right to terminate an employment contract.\nB. No, because the risk to the engineer's health excused his nonperformance of the contract.\nC. Yes, because the coal mine acted in good faith in mitigating the effect of the engineer's failure to finish the contract term.\nD. Yes, because the mine is reasonably safe for most people.\n"

However, we can make some assumptions based on common law principles.\n\nAssuming that the engineer was not fired by the coal mine and instead resigned voluntarily due to his illness, the coal mine may have grounds to sue for breach of contract if the engineer's resignation caused them to incur additional costs related to finding a replacement and compensating the replacement worker. In this case, the coal mine could potentially recover damages for those additional expenses.\n\nOn the other hand, if the engineer was terminated by the coal mine without cause, then the coal mine may not be able to recover damages from the engineer. Termination by the employer without cause typically results in the termination being deemed \"at-will,\" meaning that either party can terminate the employment relationship with reasonable notice (usually 2 weeks). If the engineer resigned voluntarily for reasons unrelated to the coal mine, such as personal reasons or a desire to pursue new opportunities, then the coal mine may not be able to recover damages from the engineer.\n\nIn summary, while there may be some potential for recovery for the coal mine, the outcome will depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the engineer's resignation and the terms of the contract between the parties. It is important for employers to carefully review their contracts and understand the risks associated with hiring and retaining employees who have a known allergy to certain chemicals."
