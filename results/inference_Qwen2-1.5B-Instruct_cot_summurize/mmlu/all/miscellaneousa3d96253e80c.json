Schist\n\nSchists are formed when metamorphic rock is subjected to high temperatures and pressures, causing minerals in the original rock to change their structure and composition. This can result in the formation of schist, which has a texture similar to granite or quartzite but with a more foliated pattern.\n\nGranite and marble are igneous rocks that do not undergo metamorphism, while quartzite is a sedimentary rock that may be subject to minor metamorphism."
