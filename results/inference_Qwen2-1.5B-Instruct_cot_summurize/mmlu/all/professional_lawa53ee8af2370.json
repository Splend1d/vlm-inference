She was smoking marijuana, blowing it out the open window, and not sharing it with the driver. The driver fell asleep, causing the car to veer off the highway and go into a ditch where it landed upside-down. Both the driver and passenger were seriously injured. She sued the operator for negligence. The operator filed a counterclaim asking for damages against the passenger by arguing that the passenger was herself negligent by \"smoking weed\" and causing him to fall asleep. Is the court likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim?\n\nA. Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\nB. Yes, because a vehicle operator is always liable and a passenger cannot be made liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances.\nC. No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.\nD. No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.\n"

In this scenario, both the driver and the passenger are considered to have shared responsibility for the accident due to their involvement in the operation of the vehicle. The passenger's smoking of marijuana and causing the driver to fall asleep contributed to the accident, which falls within the scope of the driver's liability as an operator of a motor vehicle. Therefore, the court is unlikely to find that the passenger is not liable for her share of the negligence."
