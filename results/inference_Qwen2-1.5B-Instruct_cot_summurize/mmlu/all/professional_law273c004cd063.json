An owner of a Detroit drug store takes his gross cash receipts each week into a city in Canada where he lives and does his banking. The office of the Deputy Atty. General learned that the owner was doing this, and indicted him on 10 counts of \"willingly and knowingly\" taking cash over $10,000 into a foreign country without reporting it. The owner's main defense is that he did not know of the law or that he was breaking it. The trial judge instructed the jury that mistake of law is no defense. He was convicted and appealed. Will the federal appellate court likely reverse the conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.\nB. Yes, because treaties with Canada make all such reporting laws unenforceable.\nC. No, the practice is so dangerous to the public interest that knowledge and specific intent are not required.\nD. No, willfulness and knowledge are inferred by the habitual practice of transporting the cash.\n"

Yes, because willfulness clause requires proof of both knowledge of the law and a specific intent to commit the crime.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA) provides that an individual may be held liable for violating the law if they were aware of the law and acted with a specific intent to violate it. In this case, the owner had knowledge of the law through the indictment and the fact that the government had evidence of his actions. Additionally, the owner had the specific intent to break the law by bringing the cash out of the country without reporting it. Therefore, the federal appellate court is likely to reverse the conviction based on the willfulness requirement."
