AP rises when MP is above it and falls when MP is below it.\n\nThis is because as the level of labor increases, the additional output produced per unit of labor increases initially until it reaches its maximum point, after which the increase in output per unit of labor begins to decrease. This results in an increase in AP as more units of labor are used, but eventually leads to a decrease in AP as the marginal product starts to decline. Conversely, when MP is below AP, the additional output produced per unit of labor is decreasing, leading to a fall in AP as more units of labor are used. Therefore, the correct answer is A."
