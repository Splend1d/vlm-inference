This is an example of externalities where someone else's actions have a harmful effect on others who do not directly benefit from them.\n\nFor this externality, the appropriate plan would be to tax the citizens of the community. By taxing the residents of the community, they would have to pay a fee for the harm caused by the factory's pollution. This fee could then be used to fund programs that help mitigate or address the effects of the pollution, such as improving air quality monitoring systems or providing grants for local clean-up projects.\n\nIn contrast, B, C, and D are examples of positive externalities - benefits that accrue to individuals or groups even though they did not create or benefit from the resource themselves. For example, B gives a tree subsidy to your neighbor because you enjoy having shade and beauty from the tree. C provides subsidies to hog farmers because the waste from their farms helps fertilize fields nearby. And D subsidizes electricity production to ensure that the community has reliable access to energy, which benefits all members of society regardless of who built the power plant."
