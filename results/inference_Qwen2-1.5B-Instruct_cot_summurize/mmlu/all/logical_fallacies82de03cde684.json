This type of fallacy involves using language that has strong emotional connotations or associations, such as \"good\" or \"bad,\" \"right\" or \"wrong,\" or \"true\" or \"false,\" when presenting arguments or evidence. The goal is often to persuade the audience to accept the claim on the basis of emotion rather than logical reasoning."
