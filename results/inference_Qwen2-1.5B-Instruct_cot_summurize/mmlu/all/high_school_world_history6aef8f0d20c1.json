The poem references both Africa and the Americas, suggesting that the poet may have been influenced by both cultures. Additionally, the poem's use of metaphor and imagery suggests a strong connection between the natural beauty of the Caribbean and the city of New York, which could be seen as a reflection of the poet's appreciation for the interconnectedness of the world. Therefore, option B is the most likely explanation for the phenomenon observed in this poem."
