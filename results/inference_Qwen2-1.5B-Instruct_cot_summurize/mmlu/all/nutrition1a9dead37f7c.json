Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic process by which glucose is synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources such as amino acids, fatty acids, and lactate. The other options (Leucine, Tryptophan, Isoleucine) all have potential to be substrates for gluconeogenesis due to their ability to undergo deamination reactions that produce carbon dioxide and ammonia, which can be used as a source of energy or as substrates for gluconeogenesis."
