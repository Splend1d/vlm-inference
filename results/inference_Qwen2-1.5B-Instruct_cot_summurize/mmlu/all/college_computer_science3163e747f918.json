Local caching of files can lead to temporary inconsistencies because each machine may have a different view of the file due to differences in its processing time or storage capacity. This can cause problems if the file needs to be accessed by multiple machines simultaneously and they all have conflicting versions of the file. To avoid this, distributed file systems use techniques such as replication and checksums to ensure consistency across the entire file system."
