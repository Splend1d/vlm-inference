                    "text": "To solve this problem, let's first understand what \"uniform random distribution\" means and how it applies to our given region.\n\nIn a uniform random distribution, all points within a certain region have an equal chance of being selected. In the context of the given region \\(0 < |x| + |y| < 1\\), every point inside this region has an equal chance of being chosen for the probability calculation.\n\nNow, we want to find the probability that \\(2(x + y) > 1\\). Let's break down this inequality into two parts:\n\n1. The inequality \\(0 < |x| + |y|\\) describes the square region with side length 1 centered at the origin.\n2. The additional condition \\(2(x + y) > 1\\) simplifies to \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nGiven these conditions, we need to determine the area of the intersection between the region where \\(0 < |x| + |y|\\) and the part of the plane where \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nSince the region where \\(0 < |x| + |y|\\) is a square with side length 1 centered at the origin, its area is \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\).\n\nThe area of the second region, which is \\(x + y > \\frac{1}{2}\\), can be found using calculus or geometrically by considering the triangle formed by the lines \\(x = -\\frac{1}{2}, x = \\frac{1}{2}\\), and \\(y = x\\). This forms a right-angled triangle with legs of lengths \\(1\\) each. Thus, the area of this triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nHowever, since we're looking for the intersection of both regions, we need to subtract the overlap from the total area of the smaller region to avoid double-counting. The overlap occurs when \\(x = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}\\), but since the region is symmetric about the origin, this overlap does not contribute to the overall probability because it is not within the region defined by \\(0 < |x| + |y|\\).\n\nThus, the probability that \\(2(x + y) > 1\\) is the ratio of the area of the intersection to the area of the larger region minus the overlap.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\nArea of intersection: \\(1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nTotal area of the larger region: \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n\nProbability = Area of intersection / Total area = \\(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\nTherefore, the answer is **B. 1/4**."
