When there were marital problems, wife secretly conveyed her interest in the real estate to her youngest son from a prior marriage so that he would always have a place to live. Wife died and the husband filed to evict his stepson. According to the majority view among the states, can the stepson prevail by asserting his deed from his mother?\n\nA. Yes, the entireties ownership was severed by the valid deed from mother to her son, and son now owns one-half of the property as tenants in common with the husband.\nB. Yes, the son became a tenant by the entireties with his mother's husband upon his mother's death.\nC. No, the mother's deed was a nullity because the entireties estate can only be broken with the consent of both parties; the husband became the sole fee simple owner on wife's death.\nD. No, a mother cannot convey a real estate interest to a son without getting the approval of all of her children.\n"

Yes, the entireties ownership was severed by the valid deed from mother to her son, and son now owns one-half of the property as tenants in common with the husband.\n\nWhen a person dies intestate (without a will), their estate is divided according to state law. In the case of a joint tenancy, if one partner dies, the other partner automatically becomes the sole owner of the property. However, if the property is owned as tenants in common, each partner retains an undivided interest in the property until they die. \n\nIn this scenario, the husband and wife owned the land as tenants by the entirety, which means that if either party died, the other party would become the sole owner of the property. However, when the wife conveyed her interest in the property to her son, she severed the entireties ownership and made him a tenant by the entirety with the husband. Therefore, the son now owns one-half of the property as tenants in common with the husband, and the husband has no power to evict the son under the terms of the property agreement."
