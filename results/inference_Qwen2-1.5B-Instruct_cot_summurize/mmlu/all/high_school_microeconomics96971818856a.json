The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n\nIf the county government sends each parent a coupon that can be used to subsidize the cost of sending their child to daycare, this means there is an increase in the availability of free or subsidized daycare options. As a result, parents may choose to use these subsidies rather than pay for childcare directly. This could lead to an increase in the number of children enrolled in daycare and a rise in the overall demand for daycare services. Since the demand for daycare increases, it will also likely lead to an increase in the market price as well."
