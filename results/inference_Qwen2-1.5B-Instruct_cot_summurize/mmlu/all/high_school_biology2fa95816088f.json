It arises in response to changes in the environment.\n\nGenetic variation, also known as genetic diversity, refers to the range of differences between individuals within a population. This includes variations in traits such as eye color, hair texture, and height. Genetic variation can arise from mutations in DNA sequences, which can occur spontaneously or through the action of environmental factors such as radiation exposure or exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nWhile genetic variation can sometimes be influenced by natural selection, it does not always have to be present in a population before natural selection can act on it. Natural selection occurs when beneficial traits become more common in a population over time due to their increased survival or reproductive success in a particular environment. However, this process requires that there be some degree of genetic variation in the first place, so that different individuals have different combinations of traits that could potentially provide an advantage.\n\nIt's important to note that while genetic variation is crucial for evolution to occur, it is not necessarily the only factor driving adaptation. Other factors such as mutation rate, selective pressures, and gene flow can also play a role in shaping populations over time."
