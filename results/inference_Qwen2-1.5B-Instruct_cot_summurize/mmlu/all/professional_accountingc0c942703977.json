                    "text": "To calculate Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold, we need to first determine his original purchase price and then adjust for the dividends he received.\n\n1. Original Purchase Price:\n   - He bought the shares at $10.50 per share.\n   - So, the original purchase price was 2000 * $10.50 = $210,000.\n\n2. Dividend Received:\n   - He received a 5% dividend on his investment.\n   - The amount of the dividend is calculated as (dividend rate / 100) * original purchase price.\n   - Therefore, the dividend received was (5/100) * $210,000 = $10,500.\n\n3. Current Year Sale:\n   - He sold 800 shares at an unknown price per share.\n   - Let's call this sale price \"S\".\n   - His total gain from selling the shares would be S - $210,000 - $10,500 = 800 * (S - $210,000 - $10,500).\n\n4. Calculating Basis After Sale:\n   - To find Lemon's basis after selling the 800 shares, we add the cost basis ($210,000), subtract the dividend ($10,500), and then divide by the number of shares sold: \n     - Basis after sale = ($210,000 + $10,500) / 800 = $220,500 / 800 = $275.625\n\nSince Lemon cannot have a fraction of a share, we round up to the nearest whole share. Therefore, Lemon's basis in the 800 shares of stock sold is $276. This rounds up because you can't own a fraction of a share.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. $8,400"
