This helps in understanding if the consumer was satisfied with the product or service, its price, quality, delivery time, etc., which can impact the likelihood of repeat purchases and customer loyalty. The goal of post-purchase evaluation is not solely about assessing selling success but also about improving future offerings and services for the consumer. Therefore, option B is correct."
