In genome-wide association studies (GWAS), known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explain only a small fraction of the variation in body mass index (BMI). This is because BMI is influenced by multiple genetic factors, and even when a SNP has been identified as associated with BMI, it may not account for all of the genetic variance that contributes to BMI. The evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies suggests that BMI is more genetically determined than previously thought. However, this does not necessarily mean that SNPs do not play a role in the development of BMI."
