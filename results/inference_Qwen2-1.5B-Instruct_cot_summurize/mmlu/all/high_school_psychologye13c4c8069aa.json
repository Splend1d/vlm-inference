The experiment involved placing infant chimpanzees in plastic containers with two different types of bedding: one made of cotton and the other made of polypropylene (a type of plastic). The monkeys were observed for several weeks, and it was found that the ones sleeping on the cotton bedding showed signs of attachment and comfort, while those sleeping on the polypropylene bedding did not show any such behavior.\n\nThis study suggested that infants need physical contact to feel secure and loved, which is crucial for their emotional and social development. Therefore, option A is correct."
