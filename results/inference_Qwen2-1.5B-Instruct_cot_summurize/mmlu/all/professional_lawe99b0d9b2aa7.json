An entire contract requires all terms of the contract to be performed throughout its duration.\n\nIn this case, since the employee worked for a year and then was fired after six months, the employment relationship was not divisible. Therefore, the employee's right to compensation (which includes a severance package) would depend on the specific terms agreed upon in the original contract. If the original contract did not provide for any such termination benefits, the employee would have no legal rights under the law. \n\nSo, based on the information provided, the correct answer would be:\n\nD. Neither divisible nor entire."
