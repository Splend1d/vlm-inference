This action would be considered morally wrong due to its potential harm to the child.\n\nIn scenario 2, learning the texting lingo used by teenagers is a personal choice and a way to communicate with them on their terms. While it may not be universally accepted or appropriate for all situations, it does not directly harm anyone else. Therefore, this action would be considered not wrong."
