Unexpectedly higher resource prices.\n\nA negative supply shock occurs when there is an unexpected increase in the cost of inputs, such as raw materials or energy, that are used in producing goods and services. This can lead to higher costs for producers, which can result in lower output levels and decreased demand for those goods and services. This can cause a recession or other economic downturn. For example, if oil prices suddenly rise due to geopolitical tensions or natural disasters, it could be considered a negative supply shock to the economy."
