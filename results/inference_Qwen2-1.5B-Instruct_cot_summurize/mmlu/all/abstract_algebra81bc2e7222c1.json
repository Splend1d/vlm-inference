It states that if a belongs to a finite group G, then the absolute value of a, denoted as |a|, should divide the order of the group, denoted as |G|.\n- The order of a group is the number of its elements. Since a belongs to the group G, this means we're considering the set of elements {a} itself. In any group, the identity element (usually denoted by e) also belongs to the set {a}, so we can say that |{a}| = |G| / 1 = |G|.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nThe correct answer is **A. True, True**. Both statements are true."
