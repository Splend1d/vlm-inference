For example, consider the set of all strings containing at least one \"a\" followed by at least one \"b\". This set is infinite because there are infinitely many ways to arrange the letters.\n\nStatement II is not necessarily true either: just because set A is regular does not mean that set B must also be regular. Consider the set of all strings consisting of exactly one \"a\", one \"b\", and one \"c\". This set is regular because it can be generated using a regular expression, but it's still not necessarily equal to the set of all strings with at least one occurrence of each letter in the English alphabet.\n\nStatement III is true, though: any context-free language is inherently ambiguous, which means that it has multiple interpretations depending on how you read the input string. Therefore, any context-free language will have a non-regular set as its complement, which means that every set that is not regular will contain elements that cannot be represented as a substring of any string in the original set. So, if B is not regular, then B must be a subset of the complement of A, which is not regular itself."
