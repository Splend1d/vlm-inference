When two parties have different personalities and communication styles, it can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and even conflict. This can ultimately damage the trust and effectiveness of the relationship between the client and their PR firm. Other options listed may also contribute to the threat of a client-firm relationship, but personality conflicts tend to be the most significant factor."
