One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. An electrician submitted a bid to do the electrical work to the contractor, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the owner. The contractor notified the electrician to that effect. Two weeks later, the contractor submitted his bid to the owner, in which he offered to perform the renovation work for $75,000. The next day, the electrician notified the contractor that he was unable to perform the electrical work on the owner's project. Two days later, the owner sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein she stated, \"I hereby accept your offer to perform the renovation work for the quoted cost of $75,000. \"Thereafter, the contractor hired another electrician to complete the electrical work at a cost of $5,000 above the first electrician's bid. The contractor explained the situation to the owner and informed her that the overall cost of the job would have to be increased to $80,000. The owner responded that she would hold the contractor to his original bid of $75,000 and would not be responsible for any additional costs. The contractor then performed the renovation work, but the owner has not yet paid him anything. In an action by the contractor against the owner for the services rendered, the contractor will probably be able to recover\n\nA. only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrifle of commercial frustration.\nB. only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $80,000 the contractor, in effect, repudiated his contract with the owner.\nC. $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.\nD. $80,000, because the contractor reasonably relied to his detriment on the electrician's bid in formulating his job estimate.\n"

However, the owner did not specify that there were any additional costs associated with the work, so the contractor assumed that the owner would pay the full amount specified in the bid.\n\nWhen the owner learned about the additional costs, she refused to pay more than the original $75,000, even though the contractor had already spent over $80,000 to complete the work. This led to a breach of contract between the owner and the contractor, as the contractor had reasonable reliance on the electrician's bid in formulating its own estimate. Therefore, the contractor can recover damages for the difference between what it was entitled to under the contract (i.e., $75,000) and what it actually received (i.e., $80,000)."
