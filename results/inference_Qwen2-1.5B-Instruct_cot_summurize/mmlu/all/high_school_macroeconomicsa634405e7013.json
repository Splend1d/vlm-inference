                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The United States would likely impose a tariff on imported copper to protect domestic producers, which could lead to an increase in the domestic price of copper. This could make it less attractive for foreign buyers to import copper, leading to a decrease in imports and potentially reducing the trade deficit between the United States and other countries.\n\nOption A is incorrect because if the domestic price of copper were higher than the world price, it would not necessarily indicate that the United States would be a net exporter of copper. Instead, it may indicate that there is a surplus of copper domestically or that the United States has become more competitive on the global market.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because if the domestic price of copper was lower than the world price, it would not necessarily mean that the demand for U.S. copper would fall. In fact, if the domestic price were lower, it might actually encourage more consumption domestically as people may perceive the product as cheaper or more affordable.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because if the domestic price of copper were higher than the world price, it would not necessarily lead to a growing trade deficit in the United States. Instead, it may indicate that the country is importing more copper than it is exporting, but this does not necessarily imply a growing trade deficit.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is B. If the world price of copper exceeds the domestic price of copper, it would likely result in increased tariffs on imported copper, which could lead to a reduction in imports and potentially reduce the trade deficit between the United States and other countries."
