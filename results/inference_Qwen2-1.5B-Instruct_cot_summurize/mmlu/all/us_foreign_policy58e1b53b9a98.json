The rise of Japan had been exaggerated.\n\nPaul Kennedy argued that the rise of Japan as a global economic power was an exaggeration, and that its economic success was largely due to factors such as favorable demographics and trade policies rather than actual economic growth. He believed that the United States was still the dominant economic power in the world, but that its position was being challenged by other countries, particularly China and India."
