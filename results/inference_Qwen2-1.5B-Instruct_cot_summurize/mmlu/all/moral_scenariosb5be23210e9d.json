It is also within the context of a personal responsibility and self-care scenario rather than a broader societal issue.\n\nScenario 2 is morally wrong because throwing food at an animal, including birds, is considered cruel and harmful to their welfare. It can cause harm or injury to the animal and may be seen as disrespectful or uncaring by others."
