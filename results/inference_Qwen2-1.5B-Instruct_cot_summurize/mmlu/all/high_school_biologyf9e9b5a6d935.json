This statement contradicts the idea that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent, free-living prokaryotes that divided independently of the eukaryotic host cell by a process similar to binary fission. Instead, they were engulfed by eukaryotic cells during evolution, which resulted in their fusion with the nucleus. Therefore, option D is incorrect."
