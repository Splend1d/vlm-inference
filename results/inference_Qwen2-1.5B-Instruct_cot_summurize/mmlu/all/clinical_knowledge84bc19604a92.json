Percussion refers to using the hand to strike or tap on something. Sensory refers to the ability to perceive and experience sensations through touch, such as the feeling of warmth or coldness, or the taste of food. \n\nOption A is not correct because it only mentions two of the five main uses of the hand. Option C is also incorrect because it does not include any use of the hand in relation to tapping, slapping, or clapping. Option D is not correct because it only mentions the use of the hand for grasping objects."
