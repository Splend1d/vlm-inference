Over the years, the farmer had earned a reputation for growing strawberries that were extremely sweet and juicy. For that reason, consumers always looked forward to strawberry season, when the farmer's strawberries would be available. Hoping to capitalize on the farmer's reputation, a produce retailer who operated three stores in the area contacted the farmer about the possibility of carrying the farmer's strawberries in his stores. After lengthy negotiations, the parties executed the following written agreement:\"The farmer will supply the retailer with all of its needs of strawberries from April through July each year for the next three years. The retailer will pay $5. 00 per bushel of strawberries delivered. \"On April 1 of the first year of the contract, the retailer submitted an order for 75 bushels of strawberries. Upon receiving the order, the farmer sent the retailer the following fax:\"Your order was way more than I anticipated. If! sent you that many strawberries I would not have enough for my other customers. I can send you 50 bushels, but no more. \"The retailer then notified the farmer that if he did not deliver all 75 bushels, the retailer would sue him for breach of contract. The agreement entered into between the farmer and the retailer would best be described as a (an)\n\nA. illusory contract.\nB. best efforts contract.\nC. requirements contract.\nD. aleatory contract.\n"

Requirements contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the farmer agreed to supply strawberries to the retailer for the next three years at a price of $5.00 per bushel. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the retailer requested only 50 bushels of strawberries instead of the full 75 bushels ordered. In response, the farmer declined to fulfill the entire order, stating that he could only deliver 50 bushels. This situation does not involve any contractual obligations or expectations beyond what has already been agreed upon, making it an example of a requirements contract."
