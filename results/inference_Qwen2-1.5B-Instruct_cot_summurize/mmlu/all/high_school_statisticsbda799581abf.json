This implies that the sample does not come from a normal distribution (where all values are within one standard deviation of the mean), and therefore, it may contain outliers. Outliers can be defined as data points that are significantly different from other observations in the dataset. They can be caused by errors or measurement errors,\u4eba\u4e3a\u56e0\u7d20\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u5076\u7136\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6570\u548c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u76f8\u7b49\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9009\u9879\u662fC\uff1a\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u504f\u79fb\u3002"
