Increasing heart rate\n\nWhen the body's core temperature increases due to an increase in environmental temperature, the brain signals the hypothalamus to increase the heart rate and breathing rate. This helps to dissipate excess heat from the body through sweating and panting, as well as by increasing blood flow to the surface of the skin. Additionally, the body may also increase its metabolic rate to generate more energy to cool down. However, this is not directly related to salt retention or water loss through the skin."
