His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma. The area is extremely tender to palpation. Which of the following is most likely the primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient?\n\nA. Disruption of vascular basement membranes\nB. Increased hydrostatic pressure\nC. Release of thromboxane\nD. Separation of endothelial junctions\n"

Disruption of vascular basement membranes\n\nThe primary mechanism of edema in this case is due to disruption of the basement membrane, which is a layer of cells that lines blood vessels. This disruption can lead to increased hydrostatic pressure within the capillaries, causing fluid to accumulate in the surrounding tissues.\n\nThis type of edema is known as veno-occlusive edema, and it occurs when there is damage or destruction of the basement membrane in blood vessels. In this case, the patient has sustained an injury to his arm, leading to disruption of the basement membrane and subsequent edema."
