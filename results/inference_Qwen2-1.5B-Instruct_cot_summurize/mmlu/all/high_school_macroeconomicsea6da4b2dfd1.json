This means that the net change in government spending and taxation will be zero, because both increases have the same magnitude.\n\nGiven that the MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume) is 0.75, which represents the proportion of disposable income spent on consumption when the economy is at full employment, we can calculate the expenditure multiplier as follows:\n\nExpenditure Multiplier = (1 + MPC) / (1 - MPC)\n\n= (1 + 0.75) / (1 - 0.75)\n= 2.25 / 0.25\n= 9\n\nTherefore, the expenditure multiplier is 9, indicating an expansionary policy direction.\n\nTo find the tax multiplier, we use the formula:\n\nTax Multiplier = (1 + MPC) / (1 - MPC)\n\n= (1 + 0.75) / (1 - 0.75)\n= 2.25 / 0.25\n= 9\n\nSo, the tax multiplier is also 9, indicating an expansionary policy direction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nPolicy Direction: Expansionary\n\nExpenditure Multiplier: 4\n\nTax Multiplier: 3\n\nPlease note that these calculations assume a stable economy with no external shocks or changes in productivity, so they may not reflect actual economic conditions."
