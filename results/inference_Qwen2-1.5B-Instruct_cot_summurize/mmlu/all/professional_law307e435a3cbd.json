At trial, she offered an expert witness to prove that the drug was a substantial factor in causing the baby's injuries. The expert was a Ph.D. medical researcher with an additional degree in computer science. He had experience in the research and development of similar drugs for other large pharmaceutical companies. He had published relevant articles in peer review journals describing the dangers of these types of drugs. The findings were endorsed by other experts in the field. On the subject litigation, he performed a differential diagnosis, conducted several scientifically valid tests, and made various calculations. He concluded that the drug was the culprit in this case. The Defendants made a Daubert motion challenging the witness' qualifications and the reliability of his testimony, arguing he was a mere researcher and not a physician. Is the court likely to grant the motion and preclude the witness as an expert?\n\nA. Yes, the proposed testimony was not reliable in that it was based on scientific testing only and did not discuss medical science or rule out other causes.\nB. No, the testimony was admissible because several factors militated in favor of the expert's opinion being reliable, and thus helpful to the jury in determining the critical issue of causation.\nC. Yes, the proposed testimony was inadmissible because it was general and did not tie in the expert's knowledge with the case being litigated.\nD. No, the testimony was admissible because the expert's opinion was so authoritative that the court would order the jury to adopt its findings as a matter of law.\n"

No, the testimony was admissible because several factors militated in favor of the expert's opinion being reliable, and thus helpful to the jury in determining the critical issue of causation.\n\nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993) is a landmark United States Supreme Court decision regarding the admissibility of scientific evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. It established the \"Daubert standard,\" which requires that expert witnesses who testify about matters within their area of specialized knowledge must have a background in medicine or a related field.\n\nIn the context of this question, the expert witness was a Ph.D. medical researcher with an additional degree in computer science. His experience in the research and development of similar drugs for other large pharmaceutical companies, including publishing relevant articles in peer-reviewed journals, indicates a strong understanding of the field. Additionally, the expert conducted scientifically valid tests, made calculations, and provided a differential diagnosis, all of which suggest a thorough grasp of the issues at hand.\n\nFurthermore, the Daubert standard emphasizes that the reliability of the expert's testimony should be assessed based on the weight of the evidence presented rather than just the credentials of the individual providing the testimony. In this case, the expert's testimony was supported by a range of sources, including relevant articles from peer-reviewed journals, and the testimony was corroborated by other experts in the field.\n\nTherefore, the court is more likely to grant the motion if the expert's testimony does not tie into the specific facts of the case, or if there is a lack of evidence supporting the expert's opinions. However, the fact that the expert has a PhD in medicine and computer science, has experience in the research and development of similar drugs, and conducted scientifically valid tests and calculations suggests that the court may consider the testimony admissible despite any potential challenges raised by the defendants."
