This is because the covenant against encumbrances specifically prohibits the landowner from conveying or disposing of the property subject to any encumbrance. In this case, the landowner had already conveyed the property to the farmer, but then took out a mortgage on it. Therefore, the farmer's claim that the landowner breached the covenant by allowing the mortgage on the property is valid. The court will consider the amount in principal and interest as damages for the breach of the covenant against encumbrances."
