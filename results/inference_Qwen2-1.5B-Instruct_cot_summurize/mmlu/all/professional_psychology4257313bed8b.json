The chief investigator (who is a licensed psychologist) stresses to the student the importance of the student\u2019s data to the study, but he insists that his data be withdrawn. The investigator should:\n\nA. warn the student that withdrawal from the study will affect his course grade.\nB. remind the student that he signed an informed consent and cannot now request that his data be withdrawn.\nC. tell the student that his name will be removed from all data and include his data in the study.\nD. allow the student to withdraw from the study.\n"

As a licensed psychologist, it is important for you to respect the ethical principles of confidentiality and consent in research studies. It is not appropriate for you to remove someone's data without their consent or without providing them with alternative options. Instead, you should explain the situation clearly and provide alternatives to help the student understand the impact of their decision on the study."
