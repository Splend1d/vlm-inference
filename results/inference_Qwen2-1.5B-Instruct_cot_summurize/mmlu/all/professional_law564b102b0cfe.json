The woman gave her niece a mortgage on the ranch to secure a loan from the niece to the woman in the amount of $500,000. The mortgage was recorded immediately. Two years later, the woman conveyed the ranch to a farmer by quitclaim deed. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. Assume that the woman's quitclaim deed to the farmer made no reference to the mortgage. The woman then defaulted on the mortgage, and the niece brought an in personam action against the farmer to recover the amount of the mortgage due. The mortgagee will probably\n\nA. succeed, because an implied delegation of duties resulted from the woman's conveyance to the farmer.\nB. succeed, because the niece was a third-party beneficiary under the conveyance between the woman and the farmer.\nC. not succeed, because the farmer did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\nD. not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.\n"

Not succeed, unless the farmer had constructive notice of the existence of the mortgage.\n\nUnder the law of real estate, when a grantee (in this case, the farmer) receives land subject to a mortgage, they have the duty to know about the existence of the mortgage. If the farmer does not know or fails to know about the mortgage, they cannot be held responsible for paying off the mortgage debt. Therefore, if the farmer did not have knowledge of the mortgage at the time of the conveyance, they would not be liable for paying off the mortgage debt."
