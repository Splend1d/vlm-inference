This doctrine applies when a remainderman has the power to destroy or extinguish the remainder by some act, and the grantor does not intend that the remainder should remain after the grantee becomes entitled to it. In this case, the homeowner's heir would have the power to destroy the remainder by conveying the property to someone else, which would result in the remainder being destroyed and the property passing back to the original owner. Therefore, the homeowner's heir could potentially bring an action to quiet title against the farmer, asserting that they own the property."
