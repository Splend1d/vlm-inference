The access matrix approach relies on storing information about access to resources in a matrix format, which makes it difficult to manage and update as new processes or changes occur. This can lead to errors or inconsistencies in the data, making it more challenging to ensure accurate and effective protection. Additionally, storing the matrix directly may make it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the system by manipulating the access rules."
