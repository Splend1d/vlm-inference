We should have respect for the dignity of human beings.\n\nNathanson argues that abolishing the death penalty would send a message that human life is valuable and should be respected, regardless of the circumstances or actions of an individual. He suggests that this would encourage more people to seek peaceful solutions to conflicts rather than resorting to violence or taking lives unnecessarily. By emphasizing the importance of respecting human dignity and the value of all individuals, abolition of the death penalty could help promote a more just and compassionate society."
