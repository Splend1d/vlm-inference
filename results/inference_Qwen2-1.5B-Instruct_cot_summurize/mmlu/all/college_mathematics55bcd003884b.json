For example, consider the function f(x) = x^3 on the interval [-1, 1]. This function has a local maximum at x = 0 with a value of 0. However, the derivative of this function at x = 0 is also 0.\nStatement 2 is true. The statement \"There exist non-constant continuous maps from R to Q\" is known as Cantor's theorem in mathematics. It states that there exists no non-constant continuous map from the real numbers (R) to the rational numbers (Q). This result was proven by Georg Cantor in the late 19th century."
