This action is not only unethical but also illegal if it violates any financial aid or scholarship policies at Stanford University. \n\nScenario 2 involves praying for rain during the Fourth of July parade, which is an act of faith and personal choice rather than an action taken with malicious intent or harm towards others. It is generally considered not morally wrong to pray for specific outcomes, even if they may have unintended negative consequences."
