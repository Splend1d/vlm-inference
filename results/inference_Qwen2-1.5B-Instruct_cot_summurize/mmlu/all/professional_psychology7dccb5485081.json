In this case, if the child's new pediatrician is not aware of the child's history of brain damage, you have a legal obligation to inform them about the issue.\n\nIt is important for the psychologist to take action immediately to protect the child's health and well-being. By informing the pediatrician, you can ensure that the child receives appropriate care and treatment for their injury."
