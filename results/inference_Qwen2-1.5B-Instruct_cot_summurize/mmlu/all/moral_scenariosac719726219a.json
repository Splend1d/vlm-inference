This action goes against the principle of fairness and equality for people with disabilities, as it gives them an advantage over others who may not be able to use the handicapped spots due to physical limitations or other reasons.\nIn contrast, the main character who used I/me/my in Scenario 2 did nothing wrong because turning off their phone was simply following the instructions given by the hospital staff. It is not inherently wrong to have a phone on during medical procedures, as long as it is done in a way that is safe and respectful.\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
