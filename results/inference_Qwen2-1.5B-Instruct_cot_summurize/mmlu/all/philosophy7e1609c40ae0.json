Utilitarianism focuses on the consequences of actions, while Kantianism emphasizes the inherent morality of actions themselves. However, these two approaches do not necessarily conflict with each other.\n\nTherefore, option D (neither a nor b) is correct. It is not possible to argue that either utilitarianism or Kantianism is unattractive without providing a logical or ethical justification for one over the other."
