This is known as fault tolerance or resilience. \n\nOther options listed may be relevant for certain types of networks or applications, but they do not necessarily apply universally to all routing protocols:\n\n- A hierarchical naming system like DNS is useful for resolving names, but it does not directly address the issue of connectivity failure.\n- Caching data in DNS servers can help with resolution speed, but it doesn't prevent failures from affecting the availability of information.\n- Using multiple protocols is a good strategy for providing redundancy and improving performance, but it does not guarantee that the network will still work if some components fail."
