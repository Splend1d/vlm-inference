Compiling the program with address sanitizer (ASAN) will make the source of a memory error easier to find.\n\nAddress sanitizer (ASAN) is designed to catch memory access errors by detecting illegal memory accesses before they can cause a crash or hang. By compiling the program with ASAN, you are ensuring that the program's memory accesses are checked and validated at compile-time, rather than being left up to the runtime environment to handle. This can help catch memory errors earlier in the development process, making them more likely to be caught during testing and debugging. However, it does not guarantee that all memory errors will be found, as some errors may still occur during runtime due to bugs or other issues."
