According to Marxist theory, the state is the primary means by which laws are created and enforced, and individuals have no inherent right to participate in or influence the creation of these laws. In a socialist society, where the state has been abolished, there would be no need for individual rights since the state would not exist to enforce them. However, this argument assumes that all societies ultimately lead towards socialism, which may not necessarily be true in all cases. Additionally, some Marxist theorists argue that the concept of rights is itself inherently problematic and that it can lead to conflicts between different groups within a society. Therefore, the rejection of individual rights by Marxist theory is based on the belief that the state should be the sole arbiter of legal rights and duties."
