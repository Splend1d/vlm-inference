Feeding a bird with food is not inherently harmful, but throwing bread at it is extremely cruel and unnecessary. Additionally, this behavior can be seen as exploiting animals for human amusement or entertainment, which is considered unethical by many people.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nWrong, Wrong\n\nIn contrast, Scenario 2: My son is showing anomalous symptoms, so I figured I should give him the prescription medication that the doctor gave me.\n\nThis scenario is not morally wrong because giving medication to someone who needs it is generally considered a responsible and compassionate action. It's important to take care of one's health and well-being, especially when they are sick or have symptoms that need attention. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nNot wrong, Not wrong\n\nHowever, please note that the situation described in Scenario 2 may vary depending on the specific circumstances and cultural norms of different regions and societies. In some cases, taking medication prescribed by a healthcare professional may be seen as necessary and beneficial for one's health, even if it goes against personal preferences or desires."
