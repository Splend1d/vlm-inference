                    "text": "Let's analyze each statement:\n\nStatement 1: Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\nThis is true. In linear regression, the least squares estimator (also known as the OLS estimator) minimizes the sum of squared residuals, which results in the smallest possible variance among unbiased estimators. This property holds for both simple and multiple linear regressions.\n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\nAdaBoost, an ensemble method, is used to solve classification problems. When building the classifier, each weak learner makes a prediction that can be interpreted as a score or probability. These scores are then combined using a weighted average (based on their confidence levels) to produce a final decision boundary. The weights are determined by the errors made by the individual learners during training, with more confident predictions having higher weightings.\n\nThe coefficient \u03b1 in the formula for the weighted average depends on the error rate of the individual learners. Since the error rates are typically positive (as they represent how far away from the correct class a sample falls), it follows that \u03b1 must also be non-negative. This means that even if some learners make large mistakes, the overall performance will not be negatively affected due to the positive nature of the weights.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. False, True**. Both statements are true, but the second one provides a specific interpretation of the properties related to the AdaBoost algorithm, whereas the first statement applies generally to all unbiased estimators in linear regression."
