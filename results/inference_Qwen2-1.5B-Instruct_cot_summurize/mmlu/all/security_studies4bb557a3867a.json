Eurocentrism is a thought style in which the assessment and evaluation of non-European societies is couched in terms of the cultural assumptions and biases of Europeans.\n\nEurocentrism refers to the belief that Europe's culture, values, and historical experiences are superior to those of other cultures, including non-Western ones. It often involves a bias towards Western perspectives and an underestimation of the contributions and experiences of non-Western societies. This perspective can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation for diverse cultural practices and histories."
