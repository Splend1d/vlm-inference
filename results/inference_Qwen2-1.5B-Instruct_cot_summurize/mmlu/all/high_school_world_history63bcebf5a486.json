That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nWhich of the following would best support the author's assertion regarding the \"quantum jump\" that would help Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. The colonization of the interior of Africa\nB. The conquest of the Aztec Empire\nC. The reformation of Catholic Christianity\nD. The isolationism of Tokugawa Japan\n"

                    "text": "The author argues that the ability to achieve global hegemony in the 16th century required an enormous leap in productivity that could not be achieved within the boundaries of existing societies. This was due to the lack of available natural resources and labor force, as well as the inability of existing societies to adapt to new technologies or improve their production methods.\n\nOption A (the colonization of the interior of Africa) is likely to be supported by this argument because it involves expanding the boundaries of a society beyond its current borders, which would require significant amounts of natural resources and labor force to sustain such expansion. Option B (the conquest of the Aztec Empire) also requires significant resources and labor, but it does so in a different context than option A, where the goal is to expand into new territories rather than simply to conquer existing ones. Option C (the reformation of Catholic Christianity) is unlikely to be supported by this argument because it does not involve expanding the boundaries of a society at all, and therefore does not require a leap in productivity.\n\nOption D (the isolationism of Tokugawa Japan) is also unlikely to be supported by this argument because it does not involve expanding the boundaries of a society at all, and therefore does not require a leap in productivity. Additionally, the author suggests that the necessary leap in productivity occurred after 1450 C.E., long after the period covered by this option, and therefore cannot be supported by this argument either."
