It would be best to verify the identity and context of the person or entity you're referring to for more accurate information.\n\n2. The statement \"Van den Haag's argument leads to the conclusion that...\" is incomplete. Without further context or details about Van den Haag's specific argument, it's hard to provide a clear answer.\n\n3. There isn't any widely accepted consensus among philosophers or legal experts regarding whether the death penalty is morally justifiable or even ethical. Some argue it is necessary to prevent serious crimes, while others believe it violates human rights and dignity.\n\n4. Regarding the option C: \"We should institute death by torture.\" This option seems to suggest a very extreme form of execution that goes beyond what is currently allowed under international law and moral standards.\n\n5. Option D: \"Murder is wrong.\" While this is generally true, it doesn't directly address the argument about the death penalty. It might be relevant if someone was arguing against the idea of capital punishment due to its potential for executing innocent people.\n\nIn summary, without more information about the context and the source of these statements, it's difficult to give a precise response."
