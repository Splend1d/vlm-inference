It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes. May the tribes, I pray, ever retain if not love for us, at least hatred for each other; for while the destinies of empire hurry us on, fortune can give no greater boon than discord among our foes.\"\nGermania, Publius Cornelius Tacitus, ca. 98 C.E.\nWhich of the following contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire?\n\nA. Civil wars between rivals for the throne\nB. Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire\nC. The persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire\nD. Demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics\n"

While incursions by barbarian peoples and civil wars between rivals for the throne were significant factors in the decline of the Roman Empire, the persistence of the Senate as an institution continued to play a role in shaping policy and governance in the empire. This persisted despite the fact that the Senate was often at odds with the emperor and the central authority of Rome. Therefore, option C is the most likely contributor to the decline of the Roman Empire based on the given text."
