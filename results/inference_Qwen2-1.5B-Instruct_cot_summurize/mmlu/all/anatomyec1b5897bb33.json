Pupillary constriction, vasodilation of facial vessels, increased facial sweating and decreased lacrimation. \n\nDamage to the cervical sympathetic chain can cause a variety of symptoms, including changes in skin temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size. In some cases, this damage can also cause increased facial sweating, decreased lacrimation (tears), and other symptoms related to the sympathetic nervous system. However, it's important to note that not all patients with cervical sympathetic chain damage will experience these specific symptoms, and the severity and duration of symptoms can vary greatly depending on the individual and the extent of the damage. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."
