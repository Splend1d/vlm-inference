They are typically levied by governments to fund public services such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and defense. Sales taxes can be either a flat rate or a percentage-based tax depending on the jurisdiction. The label \"progressive\" refers to how much of the total tax is paid by higher-income individuals compared to lower-income individuals, while \"regressive\" refers to how much of the total tax is paid by lower-income individuals compared to higher-income individuals. Proportional taxes refer to taxes where the amount paid is directly related to the amount of taxable income or consumption, regardless of the individual's income level."
