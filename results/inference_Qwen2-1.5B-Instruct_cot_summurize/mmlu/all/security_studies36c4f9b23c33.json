The need for civilian expertise, driven by technological developments, led to the adoption of new methods and theories that were not previously used in security studies. The necessity of theory in understanding nuclear technology, which is inherently empirical, necessitated the use of analytical frameworks and models that could help explain complex phenomena. The broader political considerations about the potential implications of long-term mobilization also influenced the development of new approaches to security studies. Finally, the combination of nuclear weapons and Cold War politics required a highly cohesive, strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political, and military planning, leading to the emergence of new institutions and organizations dedicated to the study of security."
