Subsequently, the jury returns a verdict for Plaintiff. The day after the jury returns its verdict, the court enters judgment for Plaintiff. One week later, Defendant moves to set aside the verdict and have judgment entered in accordance with its motion for directed verdict. In the motion, Defendant raises arguments that were not raised at trial. Plaintiff's counsel objects to the court even hearing the motion to set aside the verdict. Should the court consider the motion?\n\nA. Yes, because Defendant has raised new grounds.\nB. Yes, because Defendant had ten days after the jury returned its verdict within which to move to set aside the verdict.\nC. No, because the court denied the motion for directed verdict rather than reserving ruling.\nD. No, because the court entered final judgment for Plaintiff before the motion to set aside the verdict was filed.\n"

This means that, in general, a party cannot raise issues that it did not bring up during trial unless those issues could be fairly considered by the trier of fact.\n\nIn this case, the court denied Defendant's motion for directed verdict, so it is clear that the court considered the motion. Thus, Defendant can now raise any additional grounds it wants to in order to challenge the verdict.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct."
