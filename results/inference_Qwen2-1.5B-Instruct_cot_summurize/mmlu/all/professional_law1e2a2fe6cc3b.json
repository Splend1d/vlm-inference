The surgeon was assisted by an intern, who was assigned to the operation by the hospital, and a nurse, who was on the staff of the hospital. During the patient's convalescence, the patient complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the intern and nurse, who had worked together in bandaging him, had done so in such a way as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the intern, claiming $20,000 in damages. Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident. If the intern brings suit against the nurse for contribution, the most likely result is that the intern will\n\nA. prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.\nB. prevail, because the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur\nC. not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.\nD. not prevail, because the intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C. not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.\n\nIn this scenario, the intern settled with the patient before going to trial. This means that the intern has already recovered some amount of money from the patient, but they have not yet been ordered to pay anything to the nurse. Therefore, the intern cannot recover any additional amounts from the nurse through contribution.\n\nContribution refers to a situation where two or more parties share the same liability for an injury or damage, and each party must contribute towards the total cost of the harm. In this case, if the intern prevails and pays the patient $12,000, the nurse would also be liable for the full amount of the patient's damages, regardless of whether the intern had already paid anything to the patient. However, the nurse would not be able to recover any additional amounts from the intern through contribution.\n\nIndemnification, on the other hand, is a legal doctrine that allows one party to recover compensation from another party when the latter has been found liable for the plaintiff's damages. In this case, the nurse would still be liable for the full amount of the patient's damages, even after the intern settled with the patient. However, the nurse could potentially recover some of their own expenses from the intern, if the intern had previously paid them for their services during the surgery."
