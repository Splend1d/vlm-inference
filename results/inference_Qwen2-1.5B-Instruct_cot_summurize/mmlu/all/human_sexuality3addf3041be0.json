A smaller sample size may limit the generalizability of his findings, while the inclusion of gay and straight groups with different levels of exposure to HIV/AIDS may introduce bias or confounding variables. Additionally, lesbians were not included in the study, which limits our understanding of how brain differences may vary among sexual orientations. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the limitations of any research before drawing conclusions about human behavior or biology."
