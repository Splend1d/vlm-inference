Brain growth is indeed faster during adolescence compared to childhood and adulthood, but it slows down significantly by age 20.\nB. The peak bone mass typically occurs after the growth spurt has ended, which can occur as early as puberty (around age 10-13) and as late as age 25-30.\nC. While girls do tend to gain more weight overall during adolescence due to hormonal changes, they may also experience a decrease in muscle mass if they are active and eat a balanced diet.\nD. Type 2 obesity-related diabetes is becoming increasingly common, with rates increasing among both children and adults. This is particularly concerning because type 2 diabetes is often associated with high blood pressure and heart disease.\n\nTherefore, while there are many factors that contribute to physical development and health during adolescence, each person's experience may be different based on genetics, environment, and lifestyle choices."
