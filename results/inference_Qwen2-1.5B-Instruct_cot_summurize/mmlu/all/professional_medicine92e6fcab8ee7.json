Removal of the nail through endoscopic esophagogastroscopy\n\nEndoscopic esophagogastroscopy (EESG) is the preferred method for removing foreign objects such as nails that may be lodged in the gastrointestinal tract. It involves inserting an endoscope into the mouth and down the throat until it reaches the stomach, where the object can be removed using specialized instruments. This procedure is performed under local anesthesia and usually takes about 30 minutes to complete."
