Mike suffers from erectile dysfunction.\n\nErectile dysfunction (ED), also known as impotence, is a condition in which a person is unable to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual activity. It can affect men of any age, but it is more common in older men. The exact cause of ED is not always clear, but it may be related to factors such as lifestyle habits, psychological factors, medical conditions, or medications. \n\nIn Mike's case, it appears that he is experiencing difficulty getting sexually aroused due to a lack of interest in engaging in sexual activity. This could be due to various reasons such as stress, anxiety, depression, relationship issues, or other underlying health concerns. Erectile dysfunction can be treated with medication, therapy, or lifestyle changes, depending on the underlying cause."
