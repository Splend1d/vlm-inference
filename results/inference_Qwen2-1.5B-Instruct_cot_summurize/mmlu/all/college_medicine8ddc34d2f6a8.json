This was set to varying levels of power. At 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever. At 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever. At 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever. Which of the following power levels corresponds to the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell?\n\nA. 80%\nB. 70%\nC. 60%\nD. Not enough information given.\n"

However, there is not enough information provided in the question to determine which power level would correspond to the absolute threshold. The question only provides data about the number of mice that pressed the lever at different power levels, but does not provide any information about the relative intensity of the sound or the absolute threshold for hearing. Without this information, it is impossible to determine which power level corresponds to the absolute threshold for hearing the bell. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
