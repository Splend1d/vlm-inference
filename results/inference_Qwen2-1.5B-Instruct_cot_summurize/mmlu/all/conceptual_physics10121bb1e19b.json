Increases\n\nIn the absence of an external torque, a spinning system will continue to rotate at the same rate as long as it is not acted upon by any forces that cause it to change direction. When a system contracts (such as when a tire rotates on a rim), it can still maintain its original rotational speed because the net force acting on it is zero. As a result, the angular momentum of the system does not change. However, if the system were to lose contact with something else (such as being dropped) and fall, it would no longer be rotating at the same rate due to the loss of external torque. In this case, the angular momentum would decrease."
