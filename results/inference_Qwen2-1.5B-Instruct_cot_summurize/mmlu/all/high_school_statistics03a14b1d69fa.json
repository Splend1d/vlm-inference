This scenario involves a fixed number of trials (in this case, 10 consecutive drivers) and a known probability of success or failure (drivers wearing seat belts) for each trial. Therefore, it fits the definition of a binomial experiment. \n\nOption A is not applicable because it does not involve a fixed number of trials with a known probability of success. Option B is also not applicable since there is no mention of a fixed number of trials or a known probability of success. Option D is incorrect as none of the options provided fit the criteria for using a binomial distribution to model the situation described."
