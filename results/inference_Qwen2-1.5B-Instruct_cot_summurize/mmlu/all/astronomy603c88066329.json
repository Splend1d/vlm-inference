They are composed of a large number of individual particles that orbit their planet in accordance with Kepler's laws of planetary motion. These particles are typically small icy objects such as comets or asteroids that have been captured by gravity around the planet. \n\nFurthermore, these rings are often found closer to the planet than any of its large moons. In fact, they can be so close that they can obscure some of the brighter features on the moon itself. Finally, while not every planet has a ring system, many do, making option B accurate."
