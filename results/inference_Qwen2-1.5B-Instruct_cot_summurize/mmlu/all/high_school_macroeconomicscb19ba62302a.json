An increase in the marginal propensity to consume. \n\nThe tax multiplier is the change in total output that results from an increase in investment, which is typically calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Multiplier} = \\frac{\\Delta I}{\\Delta T} \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\Delta I \\) is the change in investment and \\( \\Delta T \\) is the change in tax revenue.\n\nIf there's an increase in the marginal propensity to consume (i.e., an increase in how much more consumers spend relative to their income), this would mean that each additional dollar spent by consumers leads to an even larger increase in spending than before, thereby increasing the size of the tax multiplier. This is because it amplifies the effect of the tax on aggregate demand rather than reducing it."
