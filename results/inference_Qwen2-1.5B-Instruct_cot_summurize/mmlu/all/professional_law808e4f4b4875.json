The other woman did not know that her partner had a gun in the shopping bag. After the women placed three dresses into the shopping bag, a clerk became suspicious and approached the women. The women tried to leave the store and, as they did, the clerk grabbed the bag, which fell to the floor. When the bag hit the floor, the gun discharged, killing the clerk. Which of the following would be the women's best defense to the charge of felony murder?\n\nA. They committed a larceny by placing the three dresses in the shopping bag.\nB. The jurisdiction requires the killing to be independent of the felony.\nC. The jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder.\nD. The killing, was accidental and unintended.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C: The jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder.\n\nUnder the agency theory of felony murder, if someone else commits a deadly act during the commission of a crime, the person who planned or authorized the killing can be held liable for the death even though they were not present at the time of the killing. In this case, the clerk was killed while trying to grab the shopping bag, so the agency theory suggests that the women could be held liable for his death under the circumstances described. However, it's important to note that this theory is controversial and there may be different legal opinions on its application."
