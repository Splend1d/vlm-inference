This design allows researchers to compare different groups of participants at multiple points in time to see if there are any changes or differences between them. This can help identify potential effects of a treatment or intervention over time.\nIn this design, each participant's baseline measurements (at the beginning of the study) are compared with their measurements after treatment or intervention has been applied. This allows researchers to determine whether there have been any changes in the participants' characteristics or outcomes since they started the study.\nIt is important to note that while the Multiple Baseline Design can be useful in certain situations, it may not always be appropriate depending on the research question and the availability of data. In some cases, other design approaches such as randomized controlled trials may be more suitable."
