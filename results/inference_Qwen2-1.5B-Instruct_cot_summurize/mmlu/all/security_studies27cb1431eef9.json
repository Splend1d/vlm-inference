Cost of imports soar, including vital resources such as imported medicines. Basic food prices rise, putting even greater pressure on already stretched household budgets.\nB. Reduced health, education, and social welfare spending and the introduction of cost-recovery and user-fees put healthcare and education beyond the reach of many ordinary people. Public sector redundancies and salary freezes lead to fewer teachers and doctors.\nC. Massive redundancies and increased unemployment with no social security provision push families deeper into poverty. Farmers and small companies can no longer afford to borrow money and are forced to reduce production or go out of business.\nD. All of these options.\n"

These policies often involve cutting government spending, privatizing state-owned enterprises, and imposing austerity measures that disproportionately affect vulnerable groups like the poor and marginalized communities. As a result, millions of people around the world have been left behind in the wake of these policies, struggling to make ends meet and access essential goods and services."
