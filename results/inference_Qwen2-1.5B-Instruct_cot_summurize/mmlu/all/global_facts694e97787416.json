Females are more likely to have depression and are more likely to have an alcohol use disorder than males.\n\nDepression is more common in women than men, with about 1 in 5 women experiencing symptoms at some point in their lives. Alcohol use disorders are also more common in women than in men, with about one out of every four women using alcohol problematically compared to one out of every six men.\n\nTherefore, it is not accurate to say that either males or females are more likely to have depression and an alcohol use disorder. The statement \"males are more likely than females to have depression while females are more likely than males to have an alcohol use disorder\" is incorrect based on available evidence."
