A hash function has been applied to each word in the dictionary, and the appropriate entry in the hash table has been set to true. To check the spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is examined.

This is why we use a hash function to map each word to an index in the hash table. If we did not allow for increasing the size of the hash table with the document size, it would become too large and slow down the processing time of the program. \n\nOption I is incorrect because the hash table will not contain any information about whether or not the word was in the dictionary. Option II is also incorrect because the hash function does not provide any information about whether or not the word was in the dictionary."
