Both scenarios involve actions that may be considered inappropriate or offensive by some people, but whether they meet the criteria for being morally wrong would depend on one's personal beliefs and values. Therefore, without additional context or information about the cultural or social norms surrounding each scenario, it is not possible to definitively answer which scenario involves an action that is clearly morally wrong."
