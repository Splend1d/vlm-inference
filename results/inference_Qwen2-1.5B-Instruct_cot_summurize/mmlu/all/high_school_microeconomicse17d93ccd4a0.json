                    "text": "The correct answer is D: environmental concerns reduce the yearly amount of timber that can be harvested. When there is less available timber for paper production, paper producers will need to use more paper pulp from existing trees or other sources, which will cause the supply curve of paper to shift to the left. This is because an increase in the cost of raw materials, such as wood, will lead to a decrease in the quantity supplied of paper. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that paper producers expect lower prices, but this does not necessarily cause a shift in the supply curve. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that the price of pencils increases, which would have no effect on the supply curve of paper. Option C is also incorrect because improvements in technology do not affect the supply curve of paper."
