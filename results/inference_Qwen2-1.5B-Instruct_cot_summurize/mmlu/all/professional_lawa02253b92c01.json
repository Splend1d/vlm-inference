A church in a city located in the state wanted to acquire larger facilities for its school. The city's school board proposed a new state law that would authorize it to sell a vacant public school building, at a price below its fair market value, to the church for use as its school. If enacted, would this law be constitutional?\n\nA. No, because a statute specially authorizing the sale of the building without competitive bidding would violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. No, because the transfer of the building to the church under these circumstances would constitute an establishment of religion prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\nC. Yes, because surplus government property is not subject to the limitations imposed by the establishment clause as incorporated into the establishment clause as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. Yes, because the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church.\n"

Yes, because the law would not primarily or substantially support the religious activities of the church.\n\nUnder the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, laws must treat similarly situated persons equally. In this case, the church was purchasing a property that was being used as a public school, which could have been used by multiple educational institutions. By allowing the church to purchase the property at a discounted rate, the law does not discriminate against other potential buyers who may want to use the property for their own educational purposes. Therefore, the law is constitutional.\n\nAdditionally, the law does not establish any religion, nor does it promote any religion. It simply allows the church to use the property for its educational needs, rather than requiring them to compete with other schools for the same facility."
