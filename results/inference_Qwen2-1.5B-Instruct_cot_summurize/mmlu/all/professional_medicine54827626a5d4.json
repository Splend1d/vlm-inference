The average pulse for the last 2 minutes of the session is 175/min. During the last minute of exercise, various measurements are taken. Compared with the measurement before the session, which of the following is most likely to be decreased?\n\nA. Pulse pressure\nB. Stroke volume\nC. Systolic blood pressure\nD.

Systolic blood pressure\n\nThe answer is C. Systolic blood pressure."
