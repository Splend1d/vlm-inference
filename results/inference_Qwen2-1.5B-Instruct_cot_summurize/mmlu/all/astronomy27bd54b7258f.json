To properly account for the varying distances of the planets from Earth.\n\nIn Ptolemy's model, the planets are thought to orbit around the Sun in circular paths that intersect at the points where the Sun and the planets are closest together (the nodes). The distance between the nodes corresponds to the length of an orbital period, which is determined by the mass and size of the planet. By measuring the lengths of these orbits, Ptolemy was able to determine the masses and sizes of the planets. This allowed him to accurately predict their movements and positions in the sky, even over long periods of time."
