As he was about to leave for eight weeks of basic training, his father said, \"I will buy you a new car at the end of basic training if you promise me not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol while at basic training. \" The son replied, \"You can order the new car right away. I promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol, as you requested. \"At the end of basic training, the son was given a leave and returned home. His father asked, \"Did you abide by your promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol?\" The son replied, \"Yes, Father. \" The father then told the son that he had already ordered the new car and that it would be available for delivery within one month. One week later, the son received the tragic news that his father had died suddenly. At the funeral, the executor of the father's estate told the son that he did not feel compelled to give the son the newly arrived car. In a suit against the executor of the father's estate to recover the new car, the son will\n\nA. succeed, because the son's promise to refrain from drinking alcohol provided sufficient consideration.\nB. succeed, because the son's promise to refrain from taking illegal drugs and drinking alcohol provided sufficient consideration.\nC. not succeed, because the father's promise was only a conditional gift.\nD. not succeed, because the father's promise was void.\n"

This is considered a consideration for the purchase of the new car. Therefore, the son has fulfilled his part of the bargain and the father should have honored his promise to provide the car upon completion of the son's military service.\n\nIt is important to note that the executor of the father's estate may still owe the son money for the car, but the son has successfully obtained the car through the terms of their agreement with the father."
