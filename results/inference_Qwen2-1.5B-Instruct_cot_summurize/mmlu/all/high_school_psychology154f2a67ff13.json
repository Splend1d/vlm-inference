They were unable to make use of interposition depth perception.\nB. They were unable to maintain perceptual constancy.\nC. They were unable to distinguish left from right monocular cues.\nD.

                    "text": "The correct answer is D: They were unable to use binocular cues for depth perception.\n\nBinocular cues refer to the information that comes from both eyes and play a crucial role in our ability to perceive depth and distance. When we look at an object, the images from each eye combine to create a single image in our brain, which helps us to determine the relative size and position of objects in space. This process relies heavily on binocular cues such as disparity (the difference in angle between the two images) and vergence (the degree to which the two images converge).\n\nBy covering one eye at a time, the kittens' brains would have difficulty processing and interpreting the combined information provided by the two images coming from their non-covered eyes. Without this combined input, they may struggle with tasks that require spatial awareness or depth perception, such as navigating their environment or identifying familiar objects. However, it's important to note that the kittens' experience during this period could also affect their long-term visual abilities, but not directly related to the inability to use binocular cues for depth perception."
