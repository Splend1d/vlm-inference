Older adults with higher education and self-esteem are more likely to be sexually active.\n\nResearch has shown that individuals who have completed higher levels of education tend to have better mental health, which can lead to increased sexual desire and activity. Additionally, individuals with high self-esteem are less likely to feel lonely or isolated as they age. \n\nIt's important to note that these factors do not necessarily mean that older adults will always be married for a long time. Marriage rates have been declining in recent years due to various factors such as divorce rates, single parenthood, and changing societal norms."
