Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the mass\n\nUltrasound-guided needle aspiration can help determine the nature of the mass, which would be important for managing further care. Intravenous antibiotics may also be necessary if the cause of the mass cannot be determined or if it appears infected. Penicillin G is commonly used for infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, but other antibiotics should be considered based on the specific type of infection. In this case, it's not clear what antibiotic is indicated without more information about the cause of the mass."
