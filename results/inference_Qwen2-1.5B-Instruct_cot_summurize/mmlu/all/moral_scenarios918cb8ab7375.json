This goes against the principle of honesty and integrity, as it deceives others into believing that the child is not critically ill when they are. It is considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2 involves taking a child to a public place without them being aware of their location, which can be seen as neglectful or irresponsible. However, this scenario is not explicitly wrong from an ethical standpoint unless there is some other reason why the child should not be left unattended. Therefore, option B is correct, as both scenarios involve actions that may go against ordinary moral standards but are not necessarily inherently wrong."
