When euthanasia is used as a form of suicide, it can cause emotional distress and psychological trauma for the patient who is being assisted to die. This is because they may feel guilty about their decision to end their life prematurely, even if they believe it is the best course of action for them.\n\nIn contrast, a patient who has been informed about their options and has made an informed choice to receive treatment that will ultimately lead to their death may not experience the same level of guilt or distress. However, this does not mean that euthanasia is without risks or consequences. It is important to consider all factors before making any decisions related to one's health and well-being."
