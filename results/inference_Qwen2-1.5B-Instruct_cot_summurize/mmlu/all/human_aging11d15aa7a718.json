Normal metabolism produces reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, that can react with other molecules to form free radicals.\n\nB. Excessive consumption of certain vitamins (such as vitamin A) can lead to oxidative stress, which can generate free radicals.\n\nC. Exposure to UV radiation from the sun or other sources can cause damage to cells, leading to the formation of free radicals.\n\nD. A weakened immune system can make it harder for the body to remove free radicals, allowing them to accumulate and cause damage."
