This condition causes bones to become weak and brittle, leading to deformities such as bowing or wobbling. It can also cause pain and swelling in affected areas.\n\nSpinal cord compression is a rare complication of Paget's disease, but it can occur if the disease affects the spine. Heart failure is not a recognized complication of Paget's disease, although it has been reported in some cases. Pathological fractures are not a feature of Paget's disease, but they can occur as a result of other conditions that affect the bone."
