This means that a non-medical problem is framed and treated as a security concern by governments and organizations. Medicalization often involves the militarization of health care, where military tactics and strategies are used to address health issues, and the politicization of healthcare, where health policies and decisions are influenced by political considerations rather than scientific evidence."
