Intraspecific competition\n\nIntraspecific competition occurs when two or more individuals of the same species compete for limited resources, such as food, water, or territory. When two trees of the same species grow closely together, they may be competing for the same resources, leading to a situation where one tree may receive less of them than another. This scenario is an example of intraspecific competition."
