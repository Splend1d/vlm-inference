The first premise states that if either A or B is true, then C must also be true. The second premise states that if D is not true, then A must be true. Since both premises are true, the conclusion follows logically from them.\n\nCounterexample: When B, C, and D are all true, but A is false, the argument becomes invalid. For example:\n\n- B = True\n- C = True\n- D = True\n- A = False\n\nIn this case, the argument would become:\n\n(A \u2228 B) \u2283 C\nTrue \u2283 False\nFalse\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid with the given conditions.
