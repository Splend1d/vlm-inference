Price elasticity of demand is highly elastic.\n\nWhen a tax is imposed on a supplier, the supplier may pass the cost of the tax onto the consumer by increasing the price of their product. The degree to which this happens depends on the price elasticity of demand for the product. If the price elasticity of demand is high (i.e., the product is considered to be an \"inelastic good\"), then consumers are less sensitive to changes in prices and the supplier can absorb the tax without passing it on to the consumer. On the other hand, if the price elasticity of demand is low (i.e., the product is considered to be an \"elastic good\"), then consumers are more sensitive to changes in prices and the supplier will need to pass some or all of the tax on to the consumer. So in general, when there is a high price elasticity of demand, suppliers are more likely to pass the tax on to the consumer."
