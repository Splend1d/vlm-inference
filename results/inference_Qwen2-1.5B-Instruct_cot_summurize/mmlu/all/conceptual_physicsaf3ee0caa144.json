When food or other materials come into contact with gamma radiation, it can cause the atoms in the material to change their energy levels, which can result in the emission of alpha particles (which are not radioactive) and beta particles (which are radioactive).\n\nThese particles can then interact with the DNA in the cell, causing mutations and potentially leading to cancer or other health problems. However, the amount of radiation exposure needed to cause harm depends on various factors such as the dose rate, duration, and type of material being irradiated. Therefore, while gamma radiation can have negative effects on food, it is generally considered safe for consumption when done at safe levels."
