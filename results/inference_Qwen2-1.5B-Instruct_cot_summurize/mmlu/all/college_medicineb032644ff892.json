Sequentially, the teenager's actions have violated societal norms related to sexuality, specifically engaging in consensual sexual intercourse with his sister.\n2. Sequentially, the teenager's actions also violate societal norms regarding tipping behavior at bars, leaving no tip for service rendered.\n3. Sequentially, the teenager engages in non-consensual sexual activities with an unknown woman, which violates societal norms related to consent and respect.\n4. Finally, the teenager's action of vomiting on the steps to the door of a local church is not directly related to any specific societal norm but rather a personal act that may be seen as disrespectful or inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. taboo, folkways, the law, and mores."
