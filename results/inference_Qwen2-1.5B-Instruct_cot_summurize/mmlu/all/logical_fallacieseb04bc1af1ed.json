A form of loaded language that uses an emotionally charged restatement of the claim, often in the form of name calling, in place of support for the claim.\n\nThis type of fallacy occurs when someone makes an argument by using emotionally charged terms like \"evil\" or \"bad,\" without providing any evidence or supporting facts to back up their claims. Instead, they rely on the audience's emotional response to the term itself. This can be particularly persuasive because emotions can cloud judgment and make people more likely to accept arguments based on emotion rather than logic."
