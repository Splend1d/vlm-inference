The player subsequently asserted a claim against the manufacturer of the helmet to recover damages for his injury. At trial, the player's attorney calls a former employee of the manufacturer to testify that three weeks after the player suffered his injury, the manufacturer devised a new design for its football helmets. The former employee's testimony is\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\nB. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.\nC. inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.\nD. inadmissible, because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer.\n"

Admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.\n\nThe fact that the manufacturer developed a new design for their football helmets within three weeks of the player's injury supports the inference that the new design may have contributed to the player's injuries. This type of evidence can be used to establish causation in negligence cases, where one party has created a risk and another party suffers harm due to that risk. However, it cannot be considered direct evidence of the manufacturer's fault or liability."
