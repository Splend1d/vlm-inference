Instead, they can be adjusted based on the performance of each classifier.\nStatement 2 is true. In AdaBoost, the weighted training error \\(e_t\\) of the \\(t\\)-th weak classifier on the training data with weights \\(D_t\\) tends to increase as a function of \\(t\\). This is because the weights are used to adjust the strength of the influence of each example when computing the loss for the classifier. As \\(t\\) increases, more and more examples may have their weight decreased, which can lead to an overall decrease in the weighted training error."
