                    "text": "The coefficient of determination, denoted as R^2 or r-squared, measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (y) that can be predicted from the independent variable (x). The formula for R^2 is:\n\n\\[R^2 = \\frac{\\text{Explained Variance}}{\\text{Total Variance}}\\]\n\nGiven that a correlation of 0.6 indicates that the percentage of variation in y that is explained by the variation in x is half of this value, we can calculate it as follows:\n\n\\[R^2 = 0.6 \\times 2 = 1.2\\]\n\nThis means that 12% of the variation in y can be explained by the variation in x.\n\nTo find out how many times this is compared to a correlation of 0.3, we compare the two values and determine their ratio:\n\n\\[R^2_{\\text{0.3}} / R^2_{\\text{0.6}} = \\frac{1.2}{1} = 1.2\\]\n\nSince 1.2 is equal to 1.2, this indicates that there is no change in the number of times the percentage of variation in y that is explained by the variation in x when comparing a correlation of 0.6 with a correlation of 0.3. Therefore, the answer is not listed among the options provided. \n\nHowever, if you meant to ask about the ratio of these percentages directly rather than the ratio of the coefficients themselves, then the answer would be:\n\n\\[1.2 : 0.3 = 4:1\\]  \nor \n\\[4 : 1\\]  \nwhich matches option C.\n\nSo, the correct interpretation depends on whether you're asking about the ratio of the absolute numbers or the ratios of percentages. In either case, the correct answer would be option C."
