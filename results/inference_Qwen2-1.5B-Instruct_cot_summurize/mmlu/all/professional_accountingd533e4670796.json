                    "text": "To find the standard deviation of the portfolio, we need to calculate the weighted average of the standard deviations of Stocks A and B, taking into account their weights in the portfolio (which are equal).\n\nLet's denote:\n- The total weight of the portfolio as \\(W\\)\n- The standard deviation of Stock A as \\(\u03c3_A = 6\\%\\)\n\nGiven that the weights of Stocks A and B are equal, let's say each has a weight of \\(W/2\\). So, the standard deviation of the portfolio (\\(\u03c3_P\\)) can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\u03c3_P = \\sqrt{\\frac{(W/2) \\cdot \u03c3_A^2 + (W/2) \\cdot \u03c3_B^2}{W}}\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\u03c3_P = \\sqrt{\\frac{(W/2) \\cdot (6\\%)^2 + (W/2) \\cdot (18\\%)^2}{W}}\\]\n\\[\u03c3_P = \\sqrt{\\frac{W^2 / 4 \\cdot 36^2 + W^2 / 4 \\cdot 36^2}{W}}\\]\n\\[\u03c3_P = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W^2 / 4 \\cdot 36^2}{W}}\\]\n\\[\u03c3_P = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot 36^2}{4} \\cdot W}\\]\n\\[\u03c3_P = \\sqrt{36^2 \\cdot \\frac{W}{2}}\\]\n\\[\u03c3_P = \\sqrt{1296 \\cdot W}\\]\n\\[\u03c3_P = 36\\sqrt{W}\\]\n\nSo, the standard deviation of the portfolio is directly proportional to the total weight \\(W\\) of the portfolio.\n\nNow, if we want to know the standard deviation of the portfolio for a specific value of \\(W\\), we would substitute \\(W\\) with any desired amount. For example, if \\(W=1\\), then:\n\n\\[\u03c3_P = 36 \\cdot \\sqrt{1} = 36\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided because it depends on the actual weight of the portfolio, which was not specified in the question. However, based on the calculation above, for a portfolio of equal weights, the standard deviation would indeed be approximately 36%, making option D the closest approximation without requiring additional information about the exact weights."
