The formula for calculating this probability is:\n\nP(H|E, F) = P(E \u2229 F|H) / P(E)\n\nwhere P(E \u2229 F|H) is the probability that both E and F occur given that H has occurred, and P(E) is the probability of observing E.\n\nHowever, without any conditional independence information, it is not possible to determine the exact values of P(E \u2229 F|H) or P(E) directly. Therefore, we can only use the given probabilities to estimate the value of P(H|E, F).\n\nOption A is incorrect because it includes three variables (P(E), P(H), P(E|H)) instead of two variables (P(E) and P(E|H)). Option B is also incorrect because it does not include the probability of F given H, which is necessary to calculate P(H|E, F).\n\nOption C is also incorrect because it does not include the probability of E given H, which is necessary to calculate P(H|E, F)."
