In letters to prospective employers, the witness has described the defendant as very honest and dependable. This type of question goes beyond the proper scope of cross-examination because it involves attacking the credibility of the witness based on statements made outside the courtroom, which is not relevant to the current case or testimony. Cross-examination should focus on questions related to the witness's testimony during the current trial, rather than questions unrelated to the case."
