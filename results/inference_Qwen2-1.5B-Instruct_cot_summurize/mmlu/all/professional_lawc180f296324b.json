The written contract called for the photographer \"to produce a minimum of six acceptable photographs by August 15. \" In exchange, the photographer was to be paid $200. Which of the following is the LEAST accurate statement with regard to the photographer's taking of the photographs?\n\nA. By entering into the contract as written, the photographer assumed the risk that the mother would fail to cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\nB. The mother was under an implied duty to act in good faith to reasonably cooperate with the photographer in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\nC. An implied condition of the photographer's duty of performance was that the mother reasonably cooperate in arranging for the taking of the photographs.\nD. The mother's refusal to cooperate reasonably in arranging for the taking of the photographs would excuse the photographer from further obligation under the contract and also give the photographer a right of action against the mother for breach of contract.\n"

The mother's refusal to cooperate reasonably in arranging for the taking of the photographs would excuse the photographer from further obligation under the contract and also give the photographer a right of action against the mother for breach of contract. This means that if the mother refuses to cooperate, the photographer can still claim their rights under the contract even if they did not fulfill their obligations due to the mother's actions. However, this does not mean that the photographer has no responsibility to cooperate with the mother or that the contract is voided. It simply means that if the mother's actions prevent the photographer from fulfilling their contractual obligations, the photographer may have grounds to sue for breach of contract."
