                    "text": "To determine which harmonics will survive when the pipe is closed at one end, we need to consider how each harmonic's frequency changes as it interacts with the boundary conditions imposed on the pipe.\n\nWhen a sound wave travels through a closed-end tube (like an organ pipe), the pressure wave reflects back in a way that cancels out its original intensity. This means that for a given frequency \\(f\\), the reflected wave has a phase shift of \\(\\pi\\) radians from the original wave, resulting in a new frequency that is inversely proportional to the initial frequency:\n\n\\[f' = f / \\sqrt{2}\\]\n\nFor example:\n- If the original frequency is 50 Hz, then the reflected frequency would be \\(50 / \\sqrt{2} \\approx 31.6\\) Hz.\n- If the original frequency is 150 Hz, then the reflected frequency would be \\(150 / \\sqrt{2} \\approx 94.8\\) Hz.\n\nHowever, this does not affect the magnitude of the amplitude; only the phase difference between the incident and reflected waves affects the perceived pitch. Therefore, the surviving harmonics will have their frequencies multiplied by the square root of 2, but their amplitudes remain unchanged because they are still sinusoidal waves.\n\nGiven the list of harmonics provided: 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz, none of these will survive after closing one end since the frequencies are all multiples of the square root of 2 times the original frequency. Specifically, the surviving harmonics would be those whose frequencies are multiples of \\(2^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) times the original frequency, which simplifies to half of the original frequency or double the original frequency depending on whether the original frequency was odd or even.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer is D. None."
