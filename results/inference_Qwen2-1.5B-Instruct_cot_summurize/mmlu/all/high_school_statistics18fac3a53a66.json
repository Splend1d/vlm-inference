This week his time was two standard deviations lower than his average time.\n\nA runner's z-score indicates how many standard deviations below or above their mean score they are. If a z-score is negative, it means they scored below the mean; if positive, they scored above the mean. In this case, the runner's z-score is -2, which means he scored 2 standard deviations below the mean. Therefore, his time this week was 2 minutes lower than his average time."
