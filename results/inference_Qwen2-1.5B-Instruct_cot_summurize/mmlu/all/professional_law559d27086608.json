Could a state law requiring citizenship for teachers prevent him from doing so?\n\nA. Yes, because states can regulate aliens.\nB. Yes, because the teacher could exert too much influence.\nC. No, unless they use the rationally related to a legitimate state interest standard.\nD. No, there is no compelling state interest.\n"

No, unless they use the rationally related to a legitimate state interest standard.\n\nThe Constitution of the United States guarantees the right to due process and equal protection under the law, including the right not to be denied admission or employment based on nationality or citizenship status. Therefore, it would be unconstitutional for a state law requiring citizenship for teachers to prevent Liang from teaching in the state. However, if the state law were narrowly tailored to serve a legitimate state interest, such as protecting students from dangerous or unstable individuals, it might be upheld. The \"rational basis\" test would apply here, which requires that the law be based on a legitimate state interest and not excessively broad."
