This implies that \\(f(x)\\) is increasing everywhere in this interval.\n\nGiven \\(f(3) = 5\\), let's assume that \\(f(x)\\) is continuous and differentiable at \\(x=3\\). Since \\(f\\) is differentiable and its derivative is always non-negative (i.e., \\(f'(x) \\geq -1\\) for all \\(x\\)), it follows that \\(f''(x) \\leq 0\\) for all \\(x\\) within the interval \\((-1, 4)\\).\n\nSince \\(f(3) = 5\\), and \\(f\\) is an increasing function, there exists some point \\(c\\) between \\(3\\) and \\(0\\) such that \\(f(c) > 5\\). Let's denote \\(f(c) = m > 5\\).\n\nNow, we want to maximize \\(f(0)\\). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, since \\(f\\) is continuous on \\((-1, 4)\\), it must take on every value between \\(f(-1)\\) and \\(f(4)\\), which are both less than or equal to \\(m\\) because \\(f\\) is increasing.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\(f(0)\\) occurs when \\(f(0) = m\\), where \\(m > 5\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. 5**."
