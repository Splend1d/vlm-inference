E \u2283 F - This statement implies that if E is true, then F must also be true. However, this is not necessarily an immediate consequence because it requires more information than just the premises given.\n  \nB. F \u2283 G - This statement means that if F is true, then G must also be true. This is not necessarily an immediate consequence either, as it only gives us one way that G could be true.\n  \nC. H \u2283 ~E - This statement says that if H is true, then ~E must be true. Since we know that ~E is equivalent to E being false, this statement does imply that H must be true when E is false. Therefore, this is an immediate consequence of the given premises.\n  \nD. ~H - This statement says that if H is false, then ~H must be true. This is not necessarily an immediate consequence because it only tells us that ~H is true when H is false, but doesn't provide any additional information about what happens with ~H when H is true.\n  \nTherefore, the correct answer is C. H \u2283 ~E."
