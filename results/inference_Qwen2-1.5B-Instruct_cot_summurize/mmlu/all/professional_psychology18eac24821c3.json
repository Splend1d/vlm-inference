Forward a photocopy of the file to the psychologist as requested.\n\nDr. Browne's request indicates that she has received permission from the client to share the client's file with her. As a healthcare provider, it is important to respect patient autonomy and confidentiality when sharing medical records. Therefore, forwarding a photocopy of the file to the psychologist is appropriate. It is not necessary to include only information related to the client's current condition or summarize the entire file in a summary format. Instead, simply forwarding a copy of the file will allow Dr. Browne to review the client's medical history and treatment plan without having to go through the process of obtaining consent again."
