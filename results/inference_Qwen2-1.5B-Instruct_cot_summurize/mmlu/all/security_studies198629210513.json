Realism is the view that international politics is primarily driven by self-interest and competition for resources, power, and influence.\n\nTherefore, option D - all of the above - accurately describes the relationship between HM and realism. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while both HM and realism acknowledge the existence of discernible realities within society, they do not share the same perspective on the nature of these realities.\n\nOption B is partially correct; HM does have some similarities with realism, liberalism, and social constructivism. However, it also offers something distinct in focusing on class conflict within capitalism as its central theme.\n\nOption C is incorrect because HM acknowledges the importance of the state as an actor within the international system, but it does not claim that states prioritize the interests of the ruling-class elite. Instead, HM suggests that states may act in ways that benefit their own interests rather than those of any particular group.\n\nIn summary, option D is the most accurate representation of the relationship between HM and realism."
