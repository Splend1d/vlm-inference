Greater than $200 but less than $500.\n\nThe reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks must keep as reserves with the central bank to cover any withdrawals or losses they might incur. In this case, the reserve ratio is set at 0.1 (or 10%).\n\nIf a bank has $200 in deposits and wants to lend out some money, it must first deposit the equivalent value into its reserve account with the central bank. This means the bank will have $200 - $20 = $180 available for lending.\n\nTo calculate the maximum amount the bank can lend out, we divide the total amount it has by the reserve ratio:\n\n$180 / 0.1 = $1800\n\nSo, the bank can lend out up to $1800, which falls within the range of options D."
