The dormant public is the group that is not currently engaged or interested in an issue or topic but could become so if given sufficient attention. This group may also be referred to as \"latent\" or \"hidden.\" The aware public is one that has been informed about a particular issue or situation but is still uncertain about what to do or how to respond. Finally, the active public is the group that is actively involved in addressing a particular issue or situation. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Dormant."
