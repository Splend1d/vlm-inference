This allowed LEAs to make decisions about their own programs, policies, and budgets based on market forces, such as competition and efficiency.\n\nThis shift in power and authority was seen as a way to increase flexibility and responsiveness to local needs, but it also raised concerns about the potential for corruption and waste. Some states and localities have since sought to limit the delegation of power further by creating new structures or implementing stricter regulations."
