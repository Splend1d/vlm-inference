This means that there is some positive probability that any particular taxi chosen from the population will have been driven over 80,000 miles.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of selecting a taxi that has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has already been driven more than 80,000 miles. We can do this using the definition of conditional probability:\n\n\\[P(X < 100,000|X > 80,000) = \\frac{P(X < 100,000 \\cap X > 80,000)}{P(X > 80,000)}\\]\n\nSince \\(X > 80,000\\) implies \\(X > 100,000 - 80,000 = 20,000\\), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[P(X < 100,000|X > 80,000) = \\frac{P(20,000 < X)}{P(X > 80,000)}\\]\n\nWe don't actually need to calculate the exact values of \\(P(20,000 < X)\\) and \\(P(X > 80,000)\\) because they are not needed to solve the problem. Instead, we can directly use the fact that the total miles driven by all taxis is approximately 750,000 miles (since \\(75,000 \\times 12,000 = 900,000,000\\)).\n\nThe total distance covered by all taxis that have been driven more than 80,000 miles would be:\n\n\\[900,000,000 - 80,000,000 = 820,000,000\\]\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected taxi has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles is simply:\n\n\\[P(X < 100,000|X > 80,000) = \\frac{820,000,000}{900,000,000} = 0.94\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 0.94**."
