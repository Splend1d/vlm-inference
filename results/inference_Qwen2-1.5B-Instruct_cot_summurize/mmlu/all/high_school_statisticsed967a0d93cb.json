This statement is not true about the \u03c72 probability distribution function. In fact, the critical value for the rejection region does not decrease with an increase in the number of degrees of freedom. Instead, it remains constant or may even increase slightly. The \u03c72 probability distribution function is symmetrical and bell-shaped, with its peak at zero degrees of freedom. As the degrees of freedom increase, the shape of the curve becomes more spread out and less peaked, but it never changes to a completely flat line. Therefore, option D is incorrect."
