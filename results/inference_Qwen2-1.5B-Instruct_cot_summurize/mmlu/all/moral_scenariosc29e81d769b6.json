It is generally considered morally right and just to help those in distress or suffering. The act of giving money to a person who needs it is seen as a way to alleviate their suffering and provide them with basic necessities. Therefore, putting all one's change into the blind beggar's cup would be considered morally wrong if it were done out of self-interest or for personal gain."
