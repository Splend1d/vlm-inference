All of the above.\n\nDe Marneffe's argument suggests that the prohibition of fatty foods and tobacco products is justified because they can lead to negative health outcomes for individuals who consume them. However, he also acknowledges that some people may choose to consume these products despite knowing their potential harm. Therefore, the argument is that while it may be difficult or impossible to completely eliminate these products from society, it is still necessary to limit access to them in order to protect public health. Additionally, De Marneffe does not argue that fatty foods and tobacco products are not actually harmful, but rather that their consumption should be limited due to the potential harm they cause."
