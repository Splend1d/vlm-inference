On August 1, the widower handed his friend a deed conveying the quarry to his niece and said to the friend, \"Give this to my niece. \" Unknown to the widower, the niece was in Africa. The next week, the friend properly recorded the deed with the Recorder's Office. One month later, the widower died, and in his will he devised the quarry to his daughter. Thereafter, the niece returned from Africa, and a dispute arose between the niece and the daughter regarding ownership of the quarry. In a suit to quiet title to the quarry, the court ruled in favor of the niece. The ruling was most likely based upon which of the following?\n\nA. There was an effective \"causa mortis\" gift.\nB. The delivery was effective when the widower handed the deed to the friend.\nC. The delivery was effective when the friend recorded the deed.\nD. The deed was recorded before the devise was effectuated.\n"

This means that even though the deed was not yet legally executed or recorded at the time it was given to the friend by the widower, the fact that the friend had possession of the deed for a reasonable period of time (in this case, one week) would have been sufficient for the deed to be considered valid under the law. Therefore, the friend could claim the quarry as their own property, and the niece would have no legal claim to it until the deed was properly recorded and executed."
