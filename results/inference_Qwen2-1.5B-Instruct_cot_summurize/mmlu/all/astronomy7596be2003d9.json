Hawking radiation.\n\nHawking radiation is the phenomenon observed by Stephen Hawking that occurs when a black hole emits particles and energy as it evaporates over time. The process involves the emission of photons, which are electromagnetic waves, from the event horizon of the black hole. These photons carry away some of the mass-energy of the black hole, causing its size to shrink and eventually evaporate completely. This process is also known as \"black hole thermodynamics\" or \"the evaporation of black holes.\""
