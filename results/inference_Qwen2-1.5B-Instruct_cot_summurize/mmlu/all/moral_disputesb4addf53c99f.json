All of the above.\n\nMcGregor is known for his work on the philosophy of law and ethics, particularly in relation to the nature of rights. He argues that rights are not limited to any particular set of values or principles, but rather they are fundamental aspects of human nature and society. These rights include freedom from harm, protection against arbitrary action by others, and the ability to pursue one's own interests without interference. Therefore, McGregor would argue that these rights carve out the domain of our personal identity, as well as the domain of our community, as they are essential for living a fulfilling life."
