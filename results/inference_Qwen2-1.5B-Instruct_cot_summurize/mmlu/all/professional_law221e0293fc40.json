That evening, the buyer was preparing dinner and poured himself a glass of milk from the container purchased at the market. He then sat down to eat his meal and proceeded to take a mouthful of milk. As he did so, the buyer felt something furry lodge in his mouth. He immediately spat out the furry object and saw that it was a dead mouse. The buyer suffered severe emotional distress but did not suffer any physical illness or injury. If the buyer asserts a claim against the dairy based on negligent manufacturing, he will most likely\n\nA. recover, because he suffered severe emotional distress.\nB. recover, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nC. not recover, because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.\nD. not recover, because the buyer's proper cause of action is for intentional infliction of mental distress.\n"

In this case, the buyer suffered severe emotional distress due to the unexpected presence of a dead mouse in his glass of milk. This event gives rise to a reasonable inference of negligence on the part of the dairy, as they were responsible for ensuring the safety and quality of their products. Therefore, the buyer can recover damages under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur."
