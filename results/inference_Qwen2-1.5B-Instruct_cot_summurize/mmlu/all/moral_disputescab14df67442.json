Such a policy would wrongly disrespect existing citizens who belong to that race.\n\nThis claim aligns with Wellman's view that freedom of association can sometimes lead to discrimination against certain groups, including those belonging to a particular race. By allowing individuals to form associations based on their shared beliefs or identities, wellman argues that there may be unintended consequences that can be detrimental to certain groups. This includes potentially excluding people from a specific race or ethnicity from entering countries or regions where they might not feel welcome due to cultural or historical reasons. Therefore, option A accurately reflects Wellman's perspective on this issue."
