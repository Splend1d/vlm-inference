Some critics argued that the images were too explicit or sexualized, while others defended the artistic freedom to explore diverse subjects.\n\nThis exhibition became a landmark case in the United States Supreme Court's landmark decision in the case of Texas v. Johnson (1989), which established the principle that artists have the right to create works that challenge societal norms and provoke public discussion. The court ruled that the First Amendment protected the right to criticize government policies through art."
