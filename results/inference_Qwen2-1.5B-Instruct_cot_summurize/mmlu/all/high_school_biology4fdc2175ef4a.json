In this case, since there is no information given about the genetic makeup of either parent, we cannot determine the exact probability. However, if we assume that both parents are heterozygous (i.e., each has one copy of the sickle-cell gene), then the probability of inheriting the disease would be 50%. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 50%."
