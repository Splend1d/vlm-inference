He suggests that intentional acts of objectifying people based on their physical appearance without considering their humanity are also forms of sexual objectification.\n\nTherefore, option B correctly identifies that Papadaki argues against the narrow view of sexual objectification, which focuses solely on physical appearance at the expense of considering the person's humanity. The other options do not accurately reflect Papadaki's argument or his stance on the topic."
