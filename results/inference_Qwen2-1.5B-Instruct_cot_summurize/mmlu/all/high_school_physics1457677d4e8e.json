Images produced by convex mirrors can be both real and virtual.\n\nThis is because a convex mirror acts as a converging lens, which means that it focuses light rays towards a point in front of it (the focus). This results in an image that is formed behind the mirror, which is also called the \"virtual\" image. However, if the object is further away from the mirror than its focal length, then the light rays converge more sharply at the focus, resulting in an image that is closer to the mirror than the object itself (which is also called the \"real\" image). So, convex mirrors can produce both real and virtual images."
