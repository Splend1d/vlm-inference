It is often associated with the theory of economies of scale.\n\nThe correct answer would be:\n\nD. The addition of rural jobs created by the urban economy.\n\nThis option reflects the idea that when an urban economy grows, it can create new job opportunities in rural areas as well. These jobs may not directly benefit from the growth of the urban economy, but they can contribute to its overall success. This is known as the \"multiplier\" effect because each additional dollar invested in the urban economy generates multiple dollars in economic activity."
