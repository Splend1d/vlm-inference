For our data, this will be approximately -1.645 because \\( \\alpha = 0.5 \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ Q_1 = 3,250 - (-1.645) \\times 320 = 3,250 + 529.2 = 3,779.2 \\]\n\nFor the upper quartile (Q3), we use the formula:\n\n\\[ Q_3 = \\mu + (z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\sigma) \\]\n\nAgain, using an alpha level of 0.5 and a sample size of 3,250, this gives us approximately 1.645 as the z-score.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ Q_3 = 3,250 + 1.645 \\times 320 = 3,250 + 529.2 = 3,779.2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days would be from the lower quartile to the upper quartile:\n\n\\[ 3,779.2 - 3,250 = 529.2 \\]\n\nThis corresponds to option A: (3,034, 3,466)."
