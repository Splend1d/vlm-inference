This perspective emphasizes the emotional, sensory, and cognitive aspects of consumption that go beyond functional use or brand recognition to focus on the enjoyment and pleasure derived from these experiences.\n\nOption A (Social interaction perspective) might involve social aspects of consumption but does not directly address the hedonic nature of the experience itself. Option B (Functional utilization perspective) focuses more on the practical or utilitarian aspects of consumption rather than the emotional or aesthetic dimensions of the experience. Option D (Brand management perspective), while relevant in marketing and product strategy, does not specifically explore the hedonic aspect of consumption as it relates to how people perceive and value the products they consume.\n\nTherefore, based on the given options, the best answer is:\n\nC. Experiential consumption."
