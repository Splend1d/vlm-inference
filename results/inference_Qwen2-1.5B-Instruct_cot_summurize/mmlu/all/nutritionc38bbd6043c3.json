The end-product of glycolysis in red blood cells is pyruvate.\n\nGlycogen synthesis and breakdown do not occur in red blood cells. Therefore, the only end product of glycolysis in red blood cells is pyruvate. \n\nGlucose-6-phosphate is converted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (the first step of glycolysis) by hexokinase, then it is further reduced to lactate or pyruvate during the process of glycolysis. \n\nGluconeogenesis does not take place in red blood cells as well. This process occurs in liver cells to produce glucose from non-carbohydrate molecules such as amino acids, fatty acids, and other organic compounds.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer."
