It is well to notice this advantage\u2014the advantage of complete organization. They are organized; and yet were not at the pains of creating their organizations. The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nWhich of the following groups would be most likely to support the perspective of Frederick Douglass?\n\nA.

This aligns with the interests of the slaveholders.\n\nSouthern Democrats in the 1880s, Western ranchers in the 1850s, and Southern farmers in the 1830s did not have any interest in supporting slavery or opposing it. Therefore, these groups would not be likely to support the perspective of Frederick Douglass.\n\nNorthern Republicans in the 1860s had different views on slavery than Frederick Douglass. They supported abolitionist policies such as the Fugitive Slave Act and the Dred Scott decision, which were seen as a threat to the institution of slavery. However, they did not necessarily see themselves as opposed to slavery in general. Therefore, they would not be likely to support the perspective of Frederick Douglass either.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Northern Republicans in the 1860s."
