Therefore, option A is correct.\n\nThe auditory tube is not derived from the second pharyngeal pouch, which is formed during embryonic development, but rather from the tympanic arch or tympanic crest, which develops into the eardrum and outer ear structures. The auditory tube is also not opened by the action of levator veli palatini or closed by the action of tensor veli palatini muscles.\n\nTherefore, options B, C, and D are incorrect."
