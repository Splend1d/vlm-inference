However, definitions of such a structure often contain declarations of components of the structure (e.g., the header file for a C++ class may contain declarations of its private components). For such a language, an object's name could be bound at run time to stack storage for its component values (direct representation) or to a stack pointer referencing heap storage for its component values (indirect representation). Which of the following statements about comparisons between direct and indirect representations is (are) true?\nI. Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time.\nII. Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable.\nIII. When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed.\n\nA. I only\nB.

II and III only. \n\nIndirect representation requires more memory than direct representation because it allocates space on the heap rather than on the stack. This means that each time a new instance of the object is created, additional memory needs to be allocated on the heap. Additionally, indirect representation requires more compiler passes to optimize the code, which can increase compile time. \n\nHowever, indirect representation allows for more efficient use of memory, as the object's components can be accessed directly from the object itself without needing to traverse the object hierarchy. This means that when the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed, since the modified component can be accessed directly from the object instead of having to traverse up the object hierarchy to find it. \n\nTherefore, while indirect representation requires more memory and takes longer to compile, it also allows for more efficient use of memory and minimizes the number of recompilations required when component sizes change."
