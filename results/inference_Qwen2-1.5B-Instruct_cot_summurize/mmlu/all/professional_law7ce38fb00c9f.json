The day that the defendant was to drive back to college, his roommate asked him if he would deliver a package to one of their classmates. The defendant agreed, and the roommate gave him a small package, which the defendant placed in his glove compartment. While driving back to school, the defendant was stopped for speeding. When the state trooper asked the defendant for his license and registration, he reached into the glove compartment. As he did, the package that his roommate had given him fell onto the floor. When it hit the floor, the box broke open and a plastic envelope containing a white substance slid out. Seeing that the substance appeared to be cocaine, the state trooper arrested the defendant for possession of illegal narcotics under a state statute making it a felony to willfully possess a controlled substance. The package did, in fact, contain cocaine. If the defendant is later brought to trial for this charge, his best defense is that\n\nA. the defendant didn't know what was in the package.\nB. the roommate didn't tell him he was carrying illegal narcotics.\nC. the package didn't belong to him.\nD. the cocaine was illegally seized.\n"

This could potentially exonerate him from any charges related to possessing illegal narcotics since he did not have legal ownership or control over the substance. However, it is important to note that this defense may not be enough to completely clear the defendant of all charges as other factors such as the circumstances surrounding the incident, the evidence presented at trial, and the laws applicable in the jurisdiction where the case is being tried may also play a role."
