In this study, participants were asked to rate the emotional impact of words, which likely involved listening to the words in their original form and not just hearing them as a sound. Therefore, it is likely that the group that rated the emotional impact of the words had a higher chance of retaining the information due to the increased focus on the semantic content of the words compared to the shallow processing of the surface features alone. \n\nSemantic features refer to the meaning of a word, whereas echoic features refer to the way a word sounds when spoken. However, both types of processing involve paying attention to the words themselves, so they could potentially lead to better retention if done correctly. Surface processing involves paying attention only to the surface features of the words (e.g., pronunciation, spelling), while semantic processing involves paying attention to the underlying meanings of the words. Both types of processing are important for effective learning and retention, but they may have different strengths depending on the type of information being processed."
