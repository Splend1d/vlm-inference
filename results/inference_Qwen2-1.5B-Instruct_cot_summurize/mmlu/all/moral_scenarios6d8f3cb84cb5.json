In scenario 1, the main character is doing something that they enjoy and find fulfilling, but it involves helping someone who needs assistance. This can be seen as a positive action, but it also implies that the person may have been taking advantage of the situation for personal gain or benefit.\nIn contrast, scenario 2 involves helping someone with academic work, which is generally considered a positive act of kindness and support. While there may be situations where this type of help could be viewed differently, such as if the student was not benefiting from it or if there were other ways to assist them, overall, scenario 2 seems to align more closely with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong."
