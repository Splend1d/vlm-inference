This can be seen as a form of subsidy or support for producers, which can help them maintain profitability and invest in long-term growth. However, it is important to note that setting a price floor can also have unintended consequences, such as encouraging hoarding or reducing consumer choice. Therefore, the effectiveness of a price floor depends on its design and implementation."
