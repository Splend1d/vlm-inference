The second hidden layer has $10$ activations. The output is a scalar representing the house price. Assuming a vanilla network with affine transformations and with no batch normalization and no learnable parameters in the activation function, how many parameters does this network have?\n\nA. 111021\nB. 110010\nC. 111110\nD. 110011\n"
