A trade deficit occurs when a country imports more goods and services than it exports, which means that its producers have to pay for those goods and services. In this case, the US had a trade deficit of $603 billion, so the amount of goods and services imported by the US was greater than what was exported, indicating that Americans consumed more than they produced. The other options are not supported by the information provided: A net export would be negative (since exports exceed imports), C the government spending does not necessarily correlate with trade deficits, D capital flows can occur but are not directly related to trade deficits or surpluses."
