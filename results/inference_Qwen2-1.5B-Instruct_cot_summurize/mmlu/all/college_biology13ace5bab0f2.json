The starch granules are small enough to enter the lower airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. If this theory is true, which of the following is a correct statement?\n\nA. The interior of the pollen grains was hypotonic compared to the surrounding environment.\nB. The interior of the pollen grains had a higher osmotic pressure than did the surrounding environment.\nC. The pollen grains underwent plasmolysis prior to releasing their contents.\nD. The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\n"

                    "text": "The correct statement is:\n\nD. The pollen grains underwent shrinking before they ruptured and released their contents.\n\nThis theory suggests that when pollen grains come into contact with water or other moist environments, the starch granules inside them swell up due to the high osmotic pressure from the moisture. This swelling causes the starch granules to rupture, releasing their contents (usually proteins) that can trigger an asthma attack in susceptible individuals. The theory does not specifically mention plasmolysis, but it does suggest that the pollen grains undergo some form of swelling or expansion before the contents are released. However, the term \"plasmolysis\" refers to a different process where cells shrink and contract in response to changes in internal osmolarity. Therefore, option D is the most accurate description based on the information provided."
