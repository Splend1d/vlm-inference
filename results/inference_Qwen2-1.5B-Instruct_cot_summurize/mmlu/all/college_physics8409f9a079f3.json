The problem statement mentions that the mass is released with a certain velocity, but it does not specify whether the acceleration is due to gravity or another force. \n\nWithout additional information about the nature of the restoring force, we cannot definitively determine the final kinetic energy. Therefore, based solely on the given data, the correct answer would be C. 0.48 mJ. However, for a complete solution, more details about the forces involved in the system should be provided."
