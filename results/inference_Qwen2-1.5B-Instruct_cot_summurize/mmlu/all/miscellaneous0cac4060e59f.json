It has been estimated that there were only about 300 blue whales alive in the world at the beginning of the 20th century, making them one of the most endangered species of marine mammals today. The blue whale is known for its large size, but it also possesses some unique adaptations that allow it to survive in the ocean, including its streamlined body shape, powerful blowhole, and ability to dive to depths of over 10,000 feet."
