Once inside the cell, they begin to replicate their genetic material (RNA) using the host's own RNA polymerase enzyme. This results in the synthesis of new viral RNA molecules that can then be used to make more copies of the virus.\n\nIt is not true that influenza viruses incorporate viral DNA into the host cell's chromosome or destroy the transcriptional machinery, as these processes are not characteristic of influenza\u75c5\u6bd2\u611f\u67d3\u3002Similarly, it is not accurate to say that influenza viruses use a viral copy of reverse transcriptase to manufacture viral DNA, since this process is not typical for influenza viruses. Instead, influenza viruses rely on the host's own ribonucleotide reductase enzyme to synthesize viral RNA from the host's DNA."
