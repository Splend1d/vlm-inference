K0H + HClO4\n\nIn this reaction, potassium hydroxide (KOH) and perchloric acid (HClO4) react to form potassium perchlorate (KClO4) and water (H2O). There are no ionic compounds formed in this reaction, as all the ions involved in the formation of each compound cancel out.\n\nNa2SO3 (sodium sulfite) and FeCl2 (iron(II) chloride) do not react with each other, so there would be no net ionic equation for that pair.\nCaCl2 (calcium chloride) does not react with MnSO4 (manganese(II) sulfate), so there would also be no net ionic equation for that pair.\nNH4I (ammonium iodide) and Pb(NO3)2 (potassium bisulfate) do not react with each other, so there would also be no net ionic equation for that pair."
