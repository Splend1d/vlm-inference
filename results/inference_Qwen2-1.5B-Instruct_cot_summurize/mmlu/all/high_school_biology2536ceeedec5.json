                    "text": "B. Increasing the concentration gradient of the solute across the membrane\n\nWhen the concentration of a solute increases across a cell membrane, it becomes more difficult for the solute to diffuse into or out of the cell because the concentration gradient opposes its movement. This can lead to a decrease in the rate of diffusion. Conversely, decreasing the concentration gradient can increase the rate of diffusion by making the solute more mobile.\n\nIncreasing the concentration gradient of a solute across the membrane will also increase the rate of diffusion because the solute molecules will have a higher tendency to move against their concentration gradient. However, this effect may be offset by other factors such as osmotic pressure and the presence of other solutes that compete with the solute for transport across the membrane.\n\nThe other options do not directly affect the rate of diffusion:\n\nA. Decreasing the number of different solutes in the solution that bathes the cells does not necessarily increase the rate of diffusion because the solute's ability to diffuse depends on both its concentration and the properties of the surrounding environment (such as the solubility and affinity of the solvent).\n\nC. Increasing the ratio of phospholipids to proteins in the membrane has no direct effect on the rate of diffusion because phospholipids and proteins can interact with each other and form complexes that alter the permeability of the membrane rather than affecting the diffusion of solutes.\n\nD. Decreasing the membrane potential across the membrane also affects the rate of diffusion but indirectly through changes in ion transport, which can affect the movement of ions that carry energy to drive diffusion processes. However, changing the membrane potential does not change the overall concentration gradient of the solute across the membrane."
