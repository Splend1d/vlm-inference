Self-governance is morally irrelevant to the immigration debate.\n\nMacedo, a proponent of self-governance and the idea that states should be able to make their own decisions regarding immigration, likely believes that self-governance is an important aspect of democracy and should not be compromised in favor of any other considerations, including the impact of immigration policies on income distribution among citizens. Therefore, Macedo would likely disagree with statement C, which suggests that self-governance is morally irrelevant to the immigration debate."
