Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nWhich of the following best explains the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E.?\n\nA. Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.\nB. Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.\nC. Sub-Saharan Africans depended on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves.\nD. Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.\n"

This was because the Europeans introduced crops such as potatoes, tomatoes, maize, and cassava, which were not indigenous to the region and required extensive cultivation. These crops allowed for increased agricultural productivity and contributed to population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa."
