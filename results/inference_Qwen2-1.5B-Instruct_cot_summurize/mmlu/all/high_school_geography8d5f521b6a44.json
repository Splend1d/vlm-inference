This statement assumes that the city has an economy and can produce goods or services that contribute to the overall economic growth of the country. However, it does not necessarily mean that the city is a major center for manufacturing or trade, as many cities in the developing world have more diverse economies that involve agriculture, tourism, and other sectors. Therefore, option D is not a characteristic of a typical city in the developing world."
