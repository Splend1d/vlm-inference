The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage.\nB. Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Military action always results from a failure of negotiations and from a shift from the diplomatic to the military sphere.\nC. The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed.\nD. The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.\n"

This is because limited force refers to the use of less force than would normally be necessary for achieving the coercer's interests, while full-scale war involves the use of all available resources to achieve victory over the adversary.\n\nLimited force can take many forms, such as economic sanctions, trade embargoes, or diplomatic pressure. It relies on persuasion and negotiation rather than direct military confrontation to achieve the desired outcomes.\n\nOn the other hand, full-scale war involves a massive deployment of military forces, including artillery, tanks, aircraft, and naval vessels, with the aim of defeating the adversary through physical force. This type of conflict requires a significant commitment of resources and can lead to catastrophic consequences for both sides.\n\nTherefore, the distinction between limited force and full-scale war is essential because it determines the level of violence and destruction that will be unleashed by the coercer, and whether they will ultimately achieve their objectives or not."
