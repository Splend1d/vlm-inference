Beta-2 adrenergic agonists, such as albuterol or formoterol, can help relax the airways in patients with asthma who are experiencing bronchospasm due to allergic reactions. They work by blocking the effects of histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Other options like alpha-adrenergic agonists or antagonists would not be effective for treating an allergic reaction. Alpha-adrenergic antagonists may decrease blood flow and heart rate, which could exacerbate symptoms in this situation."
