It proposes that there is a general limit to the amount of information that can be processed at any given time, and that this limit is influenced by the level of attention being focused on. The theory suggests that when one task requires more attention than another, the less important task may be \"overloaded\" and its performance may suffer as a result. Additionally, it proposes that selective attention allows for the inhibition of return - meaning that if an attentional focus is shifted away from a particular stimulus, the brain will automatically switch back to that stimulus once again in order to maintain some level of awareness or control over it."
