They both lived during the same time period (around 2 million years ago) and shared a common ancestor that went extinct around 7 million years ago. \n\nHowever, while Homo sapiens developed complex language, tool use, and cultural practices, Australopithecus afarensis was a more primitive species with less developed cognitive abilities."
