This suggests that the rock has displaced some amount of water.\n\nGiven that the rock's weight when submerged in water (3 N) is greater than its weight when suspended by the scale (5 N), we can infer that the rock has displaced more water than its own weight when submerged.\n\nTherefore, the buoyant force on the rock would be equal to the weight of the displaced water, which is 3 N.\n\nSo the answer is A. 3 N."
