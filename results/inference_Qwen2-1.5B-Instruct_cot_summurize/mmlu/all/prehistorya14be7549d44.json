The presence of sharp canine teeth indicates that they used these teeth to tear flesh from animals or crack nuts. This suggests that they engaged in hunting activities.\n\n2. Animal bones were found with cave deposits that showed stone tool cut marks but no animal teeth marks. Stone tools made by humans indicate that they were capable of using tools to hunt. This further supports the idea that Neandertals were hunters. \n\n3. Bones of large animals like elephants and horses have been found in cave deposits, indicating that Neandertals may have hunted these larger animals for food. While not all Neandertal sites contain evidence of hunting, some do, suggesting that they did engage in hunting at least occasionally.\n\n4. Cave paintings, which date back several thousand years, depict scenes where Neandertals are depicted hunting and killing large game. These paintings suggest that Neandertals had the cognitive capacity to plan hunts and target specific prey, which would be necessary for hunting activities.\n\nIn summary, while evidence is mixed, both A (Neandertal canine teeth) and C (bones of large animals) point towards hunter-gatherer societies with the capacity to hunt large game. Therefore, option D (both A and C) accurately reflects the evidence available."
