This process is known as aerobic resynthesis and it occurs through the breakdown of fatty acids and ATP. The rate of this process depends on several factors such as the duration of the exercise, the individual's fitness level, and the presence of additional oxygen in the muscles. Once the creatine phosphate stores have been replenished, the body will continue to use the creatine kinase enzyme to regenerate ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate during subsequent periods of intense exercise."
