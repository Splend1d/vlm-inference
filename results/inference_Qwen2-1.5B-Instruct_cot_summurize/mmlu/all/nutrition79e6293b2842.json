Weight loss in more than 10% or birth weight is not regained by day 14.\n\nThis is because babies are expected to gain back some of their lost weight within the first few days of life. If they do not regain this weight and there is significant weight loss, it may indicate a problem with the baby's health or development. It is important for parents to seek medical attention if they notice any concerning signs or symptoms."
