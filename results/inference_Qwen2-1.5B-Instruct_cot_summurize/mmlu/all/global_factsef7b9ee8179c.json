However, if we assume that the data was adjusted for inflation and PPS adjustment, then we can make an educated guess based on general trends.\n\nBased on historical data, it is likely that GDP per capita has increased over time in most countries, including Japan. Inflation rates have varied across different countries and over time, but in general, they tend to be higher in developing countries than in developed countries. The purchasing power parity (PPP) adjustment would also help to adjust for changes in relative prices over time, which could further impact GDP per capita growth.\n\nWithout more specific information, it is difficult to provide a precise answer to this question. However, given the trend of GDP per capita growth in many countries, it is possible that Japan's GDP per capita may have increased by 10-20 fold over the past 70 years."
