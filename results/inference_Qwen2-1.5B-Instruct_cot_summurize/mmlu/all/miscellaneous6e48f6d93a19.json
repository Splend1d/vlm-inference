However, the responsibility that has the most potential to negatively affect a company is likely to be A: recruiting and hiring new employees.\n\nWhen a human resources manager does not effectively recruit and hire new employees, it can lead to a lack of diversity and inclusion within the organization. This can result in a lack of representation of underrepresented groups within the workforce, which can impact the overall culture and performance of the company. Additionally, failing to attract top talent can limit the company's ability to innovate and compete in today's fast-paced business environment.\n\nIt is important for human resources managers to ensure that they are actively seeking out diverse candidates and implementing effective recruitment strategies to help improve diversity and inclusion within the organization. By doing so, they can create a more inclusive workplace culture that fosters innovation and success."
