                    "text": "The correct answer is D. For a given level of government spending, automatic fiscal policy stabilizers produce a surplus during a recession and a surplus during an expansion.\n\nAutomatic stabilizers are mechanisms that automatically adjust government spending and taxes in response to changes in economic conditions without explicit intervention from policymakers. This helps stabilize the economy by preventing it from entering into prolonged recessions or expansions.\n\nIn terms of automatic fiscal policy stabilizers:\n\n- A deficit during a recession means that too much government spending is being allocated for economic stimulus purposes (e.g., through unemployment benefits, infrastructure investments), which can lead to higher deficits over time as more money is needed to maintain this level of spending.\n- An expansion during an economic recovery means there is less need for stimulus measures because the economy is growing faster than expected, reducing the need for additional government spending.\n  \nTherefore, these automatic stabilizers help prevent long-term economic downturns by allowing the economy to recover faster after a recession. However, they do not create a surplus during expansions, as this would require significant cuts in government spending.\n\nOption C, \"The regressive tax system is a fundamental component of automatic stabilizers,\" is incorrect because automatic stabilizers rely on changes in government spending rather than tax rates to stabilize the economy. The regressive nature of taxation refers to how much tax a person pays relative to their income, while automatic stabilizers aim to stabilize the economy's output and employment levels, regardless of income distribution."
