The P generation father is X-Y. \n\nThe information given in the pedigree indicates that the father has an X chromosome (Y) and the mother has an X chromosome (X). Therefore, the father cannot pass on his Y chromosome to his daughter, as it is not present in her genetic makeup. However, the father can still pass on his X chromosome to his daughter if he is healthy.\n\nIf the mother is also healthy, then the chance that their daughter will inherit alkaptonuria from both parents is 25%. This is because both parents carry one copy of the defective gene for alkaptonuria, which means that each carrier parent contributes one copy of the defective gene to their offspring. Since there are two carriers, the probability of having a child with alkaptonuria is 25%.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the information provided does not indicate that the P generation mother is X-X. Option C is also incorrect because the information does not provide any details about the chances of inheriting alkaptonuria from parents 1 and 2. Finally, option D is incorrect because the information does not specify the genotype of woman 1."
