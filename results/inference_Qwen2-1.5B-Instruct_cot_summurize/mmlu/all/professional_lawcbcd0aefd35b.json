I absolutely did not drive erratically.\" On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks, \"Isn't it true you lied in your divorce trial last year?\" If Jones' attorney objects, the court will likely hold the prosecutor's question is\n\nA.

Not admissible because it is irrelevant.\n\nThe court may rule that the prosecutor's question is not admissible because it pertains to Jones' past behavior unrelated to the current case (his divorce trial). While the prosecutor's question may go to Jones' credibility as a witness, it does not directly relate to whether or not he drove under the influence of a controlled substance while high on marijuana. Therefore, the court would likely exclude the question on grounds of relevance."
