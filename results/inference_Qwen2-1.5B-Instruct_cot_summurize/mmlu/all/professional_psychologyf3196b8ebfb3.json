Having multiple people around can provide additional support and resources, such as calling for help or providing physical assistance if needed. Additionally, having multiple people present can also increase the likelihood that someone will recognize the need for help and take action. However, it's important to note that the number of bystanders may not necessarily determine whether or not someone receives help in an emergency situation. Other factors such as situational awareness, knowledge of the situation, and ability to act quickly can also play a role in determining whether or not someone receives help."
