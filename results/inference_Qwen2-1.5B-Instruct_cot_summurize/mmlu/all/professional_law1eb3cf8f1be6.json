Conversion is an intentional tort and the pizza owner acted intentionally to convert and did convert part of the burger business.\n\nIn order to succeed in a conversion claim, the plaintiff must show that the defendant converted or appropriated the plaintiff's property without permission and for the benefit of themselves or others. In this case, the pizza owner made false statements about the burger restaurant's food and caused harm to the burger restaurant's reputation and customer base, effectively converting the burger restaurant's business by diverting customers away from it. This constitutes intentional conversion, which is required for recovery under many jurisdictions' laws regarding conversion."
