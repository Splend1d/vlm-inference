This can result in a higher export volume and a lower import volume, leading to a balance of trade surplus. However, it is important to note that a balance of trade surplus does not necessarily indicate a healthy economy or a strong currency. It can also be caused by factors such as government subsidies, trade barriers, or changes in consumer behavior."
