In other words, for any two vertices u and v in G, there exists at most one path from u to v or vice versa.\n\nNow let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Vertex with no incoming edge**: This means that every edge coming into this vertex has been reversed. Since we're dealing with a directed graph, this means that the vertex is not reachable from its incident edges. Therefore, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **Vertex with no outgoing edge**: This also implies that the vertex cannot reach any of its incident edges. Again, since we're dealing with a directed graph, this means that the vertex is not reachable from any of its incident edges. Thus, this statement must also be true.\n\n3. **Isolated vertex**: An isolated vertex is a vertex that has no incident edges. For a graph to have more than one isolated vertex, it would need to contain at least two disconnected components. However, since we're considering a finite graph, it cannot contain more than one component. Therefore, an isolated vertex must exist.\n\nHence, based on these observations, all three statements must be true. The correct answer is **(D) I and II only**."
