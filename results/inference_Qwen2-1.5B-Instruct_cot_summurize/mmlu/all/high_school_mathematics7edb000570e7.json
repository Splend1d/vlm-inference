So, \\(n=6\\) and \\(k=5\\).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{5} = \\frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the factorials:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6!}{5!1!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5!}{5! \\times 1} = \\frac{6}{1} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 6 ways to select 5 students from a group of 6 students.\n\nThe correct answer is D. 6."
