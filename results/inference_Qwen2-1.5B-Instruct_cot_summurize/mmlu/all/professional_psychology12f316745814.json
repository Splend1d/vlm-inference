This helps to maintain the system's overall stability and prevent instability. It is a fundamental principle in many systems theories, including general systems theory, which suggests that stable systems have complex interactions between their components, and that these interactions can be disrupted by external factors or disturbances. Therefore, negative feedback plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of a system."
