This model is characterized by a reduction in the concentration of population and economic activity in the central urban area.\n\nTherefore, options A and D are correct. \n\nOption B, which suggests that the gender distribution in public spaces has shifted due to the presence of more female users, does not necessarily imply a decentralized city. While it's possible for women to use public spaces more than men, this could also occur in cities with high concentrations of women employed in the workplace or living in the same neighborhoods as the public spaces. So option B cannot be considered a characteristic of a decentralized city.\n\nOption C, which suggests that gentrification has led to the return of middle-class people to the inner city, is also incorrect because gentrification typically leads to displacement and change in demographics, rather than creating new centers of employment and services. Gentrification often involves the renovation of older buildings, which can attract higher-income residents but may also lead to displacement of lower-income populations."
