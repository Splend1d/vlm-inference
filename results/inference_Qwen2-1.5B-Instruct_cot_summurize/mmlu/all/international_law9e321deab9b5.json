                    "text": "Customary law is a source of international law that has been established through long-term practice or custom among states without any formal legislative process. Treaty provisions, on the other hand, are agreements between states that are intended to create legal obligations for the parties involved.\nIn some cases, treaties may codify customary law by explicitly stating that certain practices or rules have become part of international law. For example, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) includes provisions that codify certain customary practices related to maritime boundaries and territorial waters.\nTreaties may also crystallize customary law by creating new rights or obligations that are based on existing customs or traditions. This can happen when a state enters into a treaty with another state and agrees to follow the terms of the treaty, including its provisions related to customary law.\nAdditionally, treaties can contribute to the emergence of customary law by promoting adherence to certain norms and values, which can lead to changes in customary behavior over time. This is because treaties often require states to take certain actions or refrain from certain conduct, which can influence how states interpret their own laws and customs.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Treaties may 1) codify customary law, 2) 'crystallise' customary law, 3) lead to the emergence of customary law."
