                    "text": "The correct answer is B. About $8k.\n\nTo calculate GDP per capita, you need to adjust the nominal GDP of a country for inflation and then divide it by its population. In 1950, the nominal GDP of the United States was about $47 billion (this number is from the Bureau of Economic Analysis). The inflation rate during that time period was around 2%, so the real GDP would have been about $47 billion / (1 + 0.02) = $46 billion. This means that the GDP per capita in 1950 was about $46 billion / 130 million = $343 per person.\n\nIn 2011, the nominal GDP of the United States was about $15 trillion (this number is from the Bureau of Economic Analysis). The inflation rate during that time period was around 2% over 60 years, which means the real GDP would have been about $15 trillion / (1 + 0.02)^60 \u2248 $21 trillion. This means that the GDP per capita in 2011 was about $21 trillion / 330 million \u2248 $626 per person.\n\nTherefore, the GDP per capita in the United States in 1950 adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices was approximately $8k."
