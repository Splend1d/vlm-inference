Which of the following is the strongest constitutional grounds for invalidating the gift of the buses to the religious organization?\n\nA. The gift violates the equal protection rights of secular organizations.\nB. The gift violates the establishment clause.\nC. The gift is a taking of federal property without just compensation.\nD. The gift violates the commerce clause.\n"

The gift violates the establishment clause.\n\nThe Establishment Clause in the First Amendment prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or endorsing one particular religion over others. If the Congress grants the buses to a religious organization and requires them to use them exclusively for spreading the moral message of sexual abstinence to teenagers at school assemblies, it could be seen as endorsing a particular religion (in this case, Christianity) over others. This goes against the principles of the Establishment Clause. \n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer."
