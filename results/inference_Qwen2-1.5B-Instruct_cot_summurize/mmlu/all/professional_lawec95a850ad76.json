How should the court rule on the admissibility of the store manager's testimony?\n\nA. The testimony is admissible in its entirety as the statement of an opposing party.\nB. The testimony about the water is an admissible statement of an opposing party, but the rest of the testimony is inadmissible as an offer to pay medical expenses.\nC. The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because it is hearsay not within any exception.\nD. The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because the manager's statement is in the context of an offer to pay medical expenses.\n"

The testimony is inadmissible in its entirety, because the manager's statement is in the context of an offer to pay medical expenses.\n\nHearsay is generally inadmissible in court unless it falls under one of the recognized exceptions. In this case, the statement made by the store manager to the plaintiff is an example of an offer to pay medical expenses. However, such statements are typically excluded from evidence under the business records exception to the hearsay rule (Evid. Rule 803(1)(c)), which allows for the admission of documents created or compiled by a person in the course of employment or business if they were made solely for use in the litigation. In this situation, the statement would likely be considered an admission of liability for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff.\n\nHowever, since the manager's statement was offered to prove the defendant's liability in the case, it is more likely to fall under the hearsay exception known as an offer to pay for damages (Evid. Rule 804(b)). This exception allows for the admission of offers to pay damages even though they do not form part of the actual transaction between the parties. \n\nIn this case, however, the statement is also offered to show the extent of the defendant's liability, which is an aspect of liability rather than an offer to pay damages. Therefore, the statement is admissible only to the extent it shows the extent of the defendant's liability, not the amount of the offer itself.\n\nGiven these considerations, the court would most likely exclude the entire statement as hearsay, except for the extent to which it shows the extent of the defendant's liability."
