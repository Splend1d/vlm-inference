He had an anterior myocardial infarction 3 years ago and has had shortness of breath with mild exertion since then. Current medications include labetalol and daily aspirin. He has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. His pulse is 100/min and regular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/75 mm Hg. There are jugular venous pulsations 5 cm above the sternal angle. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. There is edema from the midtibia to the ankle bilaterally. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?\n\nA. Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\nB. Impaired contractility of the left ventricle\nC. Prolapse of the mitral valve\nD. Thrombosis of the superior vena cava\n"

This is supported by his previous myocardial infarction and recent onset of fatigue, ankle swelling, shortness of breath with exercise, and crackles in the lungs.\n\nThe presence of jugular venous pulsations, increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, decreased cardiac output (as indicated by reduced blood pressure), and edema suggests impaired contractility of the left ventricle, which is characteristic of CHF.\n\nDecreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure would not be expected in this patient, as it is typically seen in conditions like right-sided heart failure or pulmonary hypertension.\nImpaired contractility of the left ventricle would also be expected given the patient's history of chronic heart disease and recent exacerbation of symptoms.\nProlapse of the mitral valve and thrombosis of the superior vena cava are unlikely to occur without other specific signs and symptoms present.\nThrombosis of the inferior vena cava is more commonly associated with congestive heart failure due to the location of the inferior vena cava relative to the right atrium."
