Replacement fertility is achieved.\n\nReplacement fertility refers to the level of fertility that maintains the same number of people in a society over time. In other words, it's the average number of children a woman should have to replace the total number of people in her community or country. \n\nFor example, if a country has a replacement fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman, this means that for every woman who has two children, there will be one person born and one person dying, resulting in no net change in the population size.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer."
