                    "text": "The density of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its molar mass (or molecular weight) and inversely proportional to its temperature. Therefore, the density increases with increasing molar mass and decreasing temperature.\n\nSince all three containers have the same volume, they must also have the same molar mass and thus the same density. This eliminates option A.\n\nOption B states that the number of molecules in all the containers is the same. However, since the molar mass and temperature are the same for all containers, this means there would be the same number of molecules regardless of their composition. So option B is correct.\n\nOption C states that the pressure in all three containers is the same. Again, if the molar mass and temperature are the same for all containers, then the pressure will be the same because pressure is directly proportional to the number of molecules per unit volume. So option C is correct.\n\nOption D states that the average speed of all the molecules is the same. The average speed of all molecules can only be determined by knowing the total energy of the system and dividing it by the number of particles. Since we don't know the total energy or the number of molecules, we cannot determine the average speed. So option D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the FALSE statement from the given options is option D."
