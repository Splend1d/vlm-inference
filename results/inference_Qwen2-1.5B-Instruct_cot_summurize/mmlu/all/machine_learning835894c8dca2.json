Density-based clustering\n\nDensity-based clustering, also known as DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), is an algorithm that groups together points in space based on their density rather than their proximity or distance. It can be used for clustering spatial data such as house locations by assigning each point its own cluster based on how densely it is located within the dataset.\n\nThe other options - Decision Trees, Model-based clustering, and K-means clustering - are not suitable for performing clustering on spatial data because they do not take into account the inherent spatial relationships between the data points. Decision Trees and Model-based clustering rely on the properties of individual features, while K-means clustering assumes that all data points belong to a single cluster."
