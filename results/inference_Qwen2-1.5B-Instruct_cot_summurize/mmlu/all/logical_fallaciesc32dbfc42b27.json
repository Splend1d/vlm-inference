Appeal to ignorance\n\nThe fallacy of appeal to ignorance occurs when someone argues that a lack of evidence proves something, based on the assumption that there is no evidence available to support the opposite conclusion. In other words, they assume that the absence of evidence means the thing being argued for must be true, without considering whether it can be proven false as well. This is different from an argument where the claim is supported by insufficient evidence and therefore requires further investigation or testing before it can be fully assessed."
