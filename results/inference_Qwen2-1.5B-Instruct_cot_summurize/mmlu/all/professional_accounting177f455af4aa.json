Accounts actually confirmed may not be representative of the population.\n\nWhen an auditor uses a blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation, they may not receive any responses from the account holders. This means that the confirmation process is not effective in identifying all accounts with potential problems or non-payment issues. Therefore, the results of the confirmation process may not accurately reflect the overall population of accounts receivable.\n\nIn contrast, if the auditor receives responses from account holders, it provides them with an opportunity to confirm the accuracy of the information provided by the debtor and to determine whether there are any discrepancies or errors in the records. This can help identify potential problems with the accounts receivable before payment is made."
