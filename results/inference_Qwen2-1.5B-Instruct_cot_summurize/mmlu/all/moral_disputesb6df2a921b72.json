Keeping actual inequalities as small as possible.\n\nLiberal egalitarians generally believe in promoting equality and reducing inequality in society. However, they also acknowledge that some forms of inequality may be necessary for certain groups or individuals to thrive. For example, Carens notes that there may be legitimate reasons for different groups to have access to certain resources or opportunities based on factors such as race, gender, or disability. In these cases, it would be unfair to eliminate all forms of inequality altogether. Therefore, while liberals may prioritize reducing overall inequality, they do not necessarily advocate for keeping actual inequalities as small as possible at all times."
