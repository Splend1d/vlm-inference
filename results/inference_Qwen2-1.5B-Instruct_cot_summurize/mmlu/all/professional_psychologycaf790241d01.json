The therapist would work with the client to create a coherent sense of self by integrating different aspects of their personality, such as their conscious and unconscious mind, their emotions and thoughts, and their behavior patterns. This integration can lead to a greater sense of self-efficacy and a more positive outlook on life (options B and C). Additionally, the therapist may also aim to help the client develop a \"success identity\" or a sense of purpose in life (option D), which can provide direction and motivation for personal growth and development."
