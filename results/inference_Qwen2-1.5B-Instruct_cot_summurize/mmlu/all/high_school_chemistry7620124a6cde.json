We can use the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log\\left[\\frac{\\text{concentration of H+}}{\\text{concentration of OH-}}\\right] \\]\n\nThe concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution can be calculated using the ionization constant (Ka) of the acid. For hypochlorous acid, the Ka is given as 3.0 \u00d7 10^-4.\n\nThe formula for calculating the concentration of hydrogen ions from the Ka is:\n\n\\[ \\text{[H+]} = \\sqrt{K_a} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{[H+]} = \\sqrt{3.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = 1.76 \\times 10^{-2}\\, M \\]\n\nNow, we know that [OH-] = [H+], since hypochlorous acid is a strong acid. Thus, the concentration of hydroxide ions is also 1.76 \u00d7 10^-2 M.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the pH:\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log\\left(\\frac{1.76 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.76 \\times 10^{-2}}\\right) = -\\log(1) = 0 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 1.76."
