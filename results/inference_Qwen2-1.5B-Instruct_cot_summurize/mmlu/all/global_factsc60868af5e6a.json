So,\n\nGDP per capita (in 2016) = $12,376 / $246 = 50\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage change:\n\nPercentage change = ((2016 GDP per capita - 1950 GDP per capita) / 1950 GDP per capita) * 100%\n\nPercentage change = ((50 - 246) / 246) * 100% = (-196 / 246) * 100% \u2248 -78%\n\nThis means that the GDP per capita decreased by approximately 78%. Therefore, the correct answer is not among the options given.\n\nThe closest option to this result would be D. by 32 fold. However, this does not accurately reflect the actual decrease in GDP per capita between 1950 and 2016 in China. \n\nIt seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the provided data. The calculation above suggests that the GDP per capita actually increased significantly over time in China, not decreased as stated in the options. If you could provide more accurate information, I'd be happy to help with the correct answer."
