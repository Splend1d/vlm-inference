They knocked and announced, and hearing no response, forcibly broke open the door and entered the house. They didn't find anyone but seized a handgun that was in plain view. The suspect was later arrested for murder; he filed for suppression of the gun. Will the suppression court throw out the gun?\n\nA. No, the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances and the gun was in plain view.\nB. No, the entry did not require an arrest warrant because the authorities already had established probable cause.\nC. Yes, the entry was a violation of the knock and announce rule.\nD. Yes, the police must obtain an arrest warrant to enter someone's home for an arrest.\n"

No, the entry did not require an arrest warrant because the authorities already had established probable cause.\n\nWhen law enforcement officers have probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime, they can enter a person's home without a warrant. In this case, the police had probable cause to believe that the suspect had committed murder, so they were allowed to go to the suspect's home and arrest him without needing a warrant. Once they had the suspect in custody, they could then search his home for any evidence of the crime.\n\nTherefore, even though the police used force to break down the door, their entry into the home was still lawful because they already had probable cause to believe that the suspect had committed a crime. As long as the police acted within the bounds of the law and did not violate the Fourth Amendment's requirement of a warrant before entering someone's home, they will likely be able to keep the gun seized during the arrest."
