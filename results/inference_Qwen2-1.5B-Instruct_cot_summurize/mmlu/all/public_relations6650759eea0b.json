This suggests that the key to success in winning approval for a project is to communicate effectively and build relationships with stakeholders, rather than relying on force or intimidation. By being kind and understanding towards those who oppose the project, it may be possible to sway their opinions and ultimately gain approval. It is important to remember that effective communication involves not only presenting information but also building trust and rapport with those involved."
