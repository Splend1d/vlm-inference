It can be seen as a subjective experience, influenced by individual beliefs, values, and experiences.\n\nOption C (internal meaning) is the most accurate answer, as it suggests that meaning in life comes from within oneself rather than being determined by external factors such as religion or belief systems. Internal meaning may involve personal goals, relationships, creativity, or spirituality, among other things."
