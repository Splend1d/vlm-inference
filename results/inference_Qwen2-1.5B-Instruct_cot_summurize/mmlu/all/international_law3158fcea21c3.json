GA Resolutions are considered as material source, in the sense that they may enunciate statements of customary law.\n\nGA Resolutions are not considered as additional sources of international law or binding upon States. They do not have the same status as treaties or customary international law. Instead, GA Resolutions are considered as material sources, which means that they may enunciate statements of customary law. This means that if a country consistently follows a GA Resolution, it may be treated as a statement of customary practice and thus binding on other states. However, this does not mean that a country must follow a GA Resolution, only that it may be bound by its content if it consistently follows it."
