At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher\u2019s observation?\n\nA. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.\nD. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.\n"

The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.\n\nThis is because the teacher's reward system creates a fixed-ratio schedule where students earn stickers based on their punctuality or quiz scores. This type of schedule provides immediate feedback and reinforcement, which can be highly effective in increasing student behavior. In contrast, the variable-interval schedule mentioned in option C suggests that the teacher rewards students after a period of time rather than immediately upon completion of an action (e.g., completing a quiz). This may not provide as strong an incentive for students to improve their punctuality or perform better on quizzes, as they do not have immediate feedback on their progress.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most accurate explanation for why the teacher's observation about the students' behavior change being stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule rather than a variable-interval schedule occurred."
