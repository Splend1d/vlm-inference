Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa.\"\nWalter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974\nBased on your knowledge of world history, which of the following contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E.?\n\nA. The invention of the machine gun\nB. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases\nC. The development of the joint-stock company\nD. The invention of steam-powered ships\n"

The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases did not contribute significantly to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during the period 1750 to 1900 C.E. Instead, the invention of the machine gun and steam-powered ships had a greater impact on European exploration and colonization of Africa.\n\nThe invention of vaccines for tropical diseases was important because it allowed Europeans to treat and prevent diseases such as smallpox and\u5929\u82b1 (cholera), which had previously been fatal. However, these vaccines were not widely available until much later in the 18th century, after the Europeans had already established their dominance over much of Africa. Therefore, while the invention of vaccines was an important development, it did not have a significant impact on Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during the period you specified.\n\nIn contrast, the invention of the machine gun and steam-powered ships were revolutionary developments that greatly accelerated European exploration and colonization of Africa. The machine gun allowed Europeans to quickly and efficiently eliminate enemy troops and fortifications, while steam-powered ships made long-distance travel possible, allowing Europeans to establish colonies and trade routes throughout the continent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases did not contribute significantly to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during the period 1750 to 1900 C.E."
