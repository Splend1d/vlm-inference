A reservation is invalid only when it is incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law (jus cogens). \n\nJus cogens, also known as jus cogens normes or jus cogens principles, are norms that are fundamental and cannot be derogated from by any treaty. These norms include prohibitions on torture, genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\nReservations made to a treaty can be deemed invalid if they go beyond the scope of what was agreed upon in the treaty itself and conflict with jus cogens norms. If a reservation goes against these norms, it may be considered null and void and not enforceable by other states parties to the treaty."
