Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms that can use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds, such as glucose. They can also produce oxygen as a byproduct. In contrast, green algae are not photosynthetic and cannot produce their own food through photosynthesis.\n\nB. Cyanobacteria lack a nucleus and are often referred to as prokaryotes because they lack a true cell membrane. Green algae, on the other hand, have a true cell membrane and a nucleus.\n\nC. Cyanobacteria have nuclei, which contain DNA and control genetic information for the organism. Green algae do not have nuclei, so their genetic material is contained within the cytoplasm.\n\nSo, while both cyanobacteria and green algae are algae, cyanobacteria are unique in their ability to perform photosynthesis and lack a nucleus."
