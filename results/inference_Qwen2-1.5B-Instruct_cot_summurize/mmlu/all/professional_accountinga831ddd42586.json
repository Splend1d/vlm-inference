A contract was formed on the day Jackson received Sands' acceptance.\n\nUnder the Sales Article of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), contracts for the sale of goods must be in writing and must include an expiration date or other means of indicating when the offer expires. In this case, Jackson's letter stated that he would sell 500 electric fans at $10 per fan, but it did not specify an expiration date. Therefore, the offer was not enforceable until Sands accepted the offer, which occurred on day 7. \n\nJackson's revocation of the offer on day 6 also failed to meet the requirements of the UCC, as it did not specify an expiration date. Sands received the revocation on day 6, but Sands did not accept the revocation until day 9, when they mailed their acceptance back to Jackson. Since the offer was not valid until Sands accepted it, the contract could not have been formed on any earlier date than day 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. A contract was formed on the day Jackson received Sands' acceptance."
