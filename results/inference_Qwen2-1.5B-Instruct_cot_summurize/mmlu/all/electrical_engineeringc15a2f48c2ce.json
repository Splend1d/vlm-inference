The correct answer is:\n\nB. square of instantaneous current.\n\nThis is because the voltage across an inductor is directly proportional to the instantaneous current through it, and this relationship is described by Ohm's law: V = IR, where V is the voltage across the inductor, I is the current through the inductor, and R is the resistance of the circuit. Therefore, the instantaneous power in an inductor can also be expressed as P = VI = I^2R, which is the square of the instantaneous current multiplied by the resistance of the circuit."
