The question assumes that one must choose between beating someone and not beating them, without considering other factors such as the severity of the abuse, the relationship dynamics, or the impact on the victim's well-being. It also assumes that the answer can only be yes or no, which is not necessarily true in all situations. Therefore, the correct answer would be A. Attacking the Person (ad hominem)."
