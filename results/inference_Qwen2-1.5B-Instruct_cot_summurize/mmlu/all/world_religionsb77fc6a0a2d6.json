Akhenaten, the pharaoh of Egypt during the 18th dynasty, made a significant effort to eliminate the worship of the traditional Egyptian deities such as Osiris, Anubis, and Thoth, and instead dedicated his reign to the worship of Aten (or Ra) as the sole god in the pantheon. This was part of his attempt to establish monotheism in Egypt."
