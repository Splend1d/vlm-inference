We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, \"A plague on both your houses.\" \u2026 Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.\n\u2014Senator George McGovern, \"The Lessons of Vietnam,\" April 25, 1967\nPolitical discord during the Vietnam War most closely resembled the political dissensions during which of the following?\n\nA. The Spanish-American War\nB. The Mexican War\nC. World War I\nD. World War II\n"

However, it does mention that Senator George McGovern criticized the bombing of North Vietnam as not effectively halting or checking troop movements to South Vietnam and potentially increasing Hanoi's war efforts. This could be interpreted as a critique of US policy at the time rather than an analysis of historical conflicts. Therefore, without additional context, the correct answer cannot be definitively determined based on the information provided."
