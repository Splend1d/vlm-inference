Expenses should be expensed as incurred in the current period.\n\nAcquisition costs associated with the purchase of net assets should be expensed in the current period when the assets are acquired. This is because the company has purchased ownership rights to the assets, which means it has assumed responsibility for their future economic benefits. The acquisition costs represent the expenses that have been incurred in order to acquire these assets. Therefore, they should not be capitalized or deferred. Instead, they should be recognized as expenses in the current period when the assets are acquired."
