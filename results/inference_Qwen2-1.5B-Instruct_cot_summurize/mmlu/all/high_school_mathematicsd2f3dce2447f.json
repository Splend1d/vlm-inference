The general form of a line's equation in two dimensions is:\n\n\\[y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\]\n\nWhere \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line and \\(m\\) is its slope. We can use the point \\((4, 4)\\) because that's where \\(y = 4\\), so:\n\n\\[y - 4 = 8(x - 4)\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[y - 4 = 8x - 32\\]\n\n\\[y = 8x - 28\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. y \u2013 4 = ln 2(x \u2013 5)**."
