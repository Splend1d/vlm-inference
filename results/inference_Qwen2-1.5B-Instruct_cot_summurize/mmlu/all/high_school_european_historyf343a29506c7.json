All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter; Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French radicals and German police spies.\nTwo things result from this fact.\nI. Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be in itself a power.\nII. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself.\"\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, 1848\nTo modern historians, the publication of this pamphlet is remembered for coinciding with which of the following events?\n\nA. A series of revolutions that gripped Europe in the same year\nB. The Ottoman Empire's increasing pressure upon the Greek Peninsula\nC. A new system of underground pamphlet distribution\nD. The re-emergence of anti-Semitism as a potent European force\n"

The re-emergence of anti-Semitism as a potent European force.\n\nThe Communist Manifesto was published in 1848 during a period of rising tensions between different political ideologies in Europe, including communism. The document argues that communism is an ideology that can unite people across class lines and that it will eventually replace capitalism. This could potentially lead to the overthrow of capitalist systems and the establishment of a communist society.\n\nHowever, the publication of the Communist Manifesto also had significant implications for contemporary European politics and society. It sparked debates about the role of religion, government, and individual rights in a socialist society. Additionally, the manifesto contributed to the rise of anti-Semitic sentiment in Europe, particularly among some groups of workers who felt threatened by the perceived threat of communism.\n\nTherefore, while the Communist Manifesto may not directly correspond to any specific event like a revolution or a territorial dispute, its publication did contribute to the wider context of rising tensions and ideological conflict in Europe at the turn of the 20th century."
