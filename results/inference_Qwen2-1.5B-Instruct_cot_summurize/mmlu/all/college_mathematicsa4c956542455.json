This means that multiplying v by A does not change its direction but scales it by the same factor as \u03bb.\n\nNow, let's consider the matrices 2A and A^2:\n\n1. If v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue \u03bb, then applying 2A to v will scale it by a factor of 2: 2Av = 2\u03bbv = 2\u03bb * (\u03bbv) = 2\u03bb^2v. So, 2Av is still an eigenvector of A with the same eigenvalue \u03bb.\n\n2. Similarly, if v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue \u03bb, then applying A^2 to v will scale it by a factor of \u03bb^2: A^2v = \u03bb^2v. So, A^2v is also an eigenvector of A with the same eigenvalue \u03bb.\n\n3. Finally, if v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue \u03bb, then applying A^(-1) to v will scale it by the reciprocal of \u03bb: A^(-1)v = 1/\u03bbv. Since we know that v is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue \u03bb, this means that A^(-1)v is also an eigenvector of A with the same eigenvalue \u03bb.\n\nTherefore, all three statements are true. The correct answer is D. I, II, and III."
