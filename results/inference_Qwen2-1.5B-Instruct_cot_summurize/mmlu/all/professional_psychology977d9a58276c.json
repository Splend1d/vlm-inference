This refers to the phenomenon where people incorrectly perceive an association between two events when in reality there is no causal relationship between them. In this case, the friend is misinterpreting their own inability to travel as evidence for a general pattern of crises occurring due to planning vacations. The other options do not fit the context provided. Psychological reactance and fundamental attribution bias involve different aspects of decision-making processes and cognitive biases, while the base rate fallacy involves overestimating the likelihood of a specific event based on its prevalence rather than considering all possible outcomes."
