Rods and cones; bipolar cells; ganglion cells; optic nerve.\n\nThis sequence accurately represents the path of visual information in the human eye:\n\n1. Retina: The light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye.\n2. Ganglion cells: These are the neurons that transmit signals from the retina to the brain via the optic nerve.\n3. Bipolar cells: They form the inner part of the retina, where they connect with the ganglion cells.\n4. Rods and cones: These are specialized photoreceptors responsible for color vision and low-light vision respectively.\n5. Optic nerve: This is the main sensory pathway that carries visual information from the retina to the brain.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is D. Rods and cones; bipolar cells; ganglion cells; optic nerve."
