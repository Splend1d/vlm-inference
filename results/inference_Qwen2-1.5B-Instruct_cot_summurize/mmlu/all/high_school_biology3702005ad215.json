Innate immunity activates a humoral response.\n\nInnate immunity does not activate a humoral response; it primarily relies on the body's natural defenses and the presence of specific antibodies to fight off infections. The adaptive immune system, which includes both innate and adaptive components, works by recognizing and responding to pathogens after they have been infected. Innate immunity plays an important role in protecting the body against immediate threats such as bacteria or viruses, while the adaptive immune system is responsible for fighting off more complex infections like cancer or autoimmune diseases."
