The deed recited that the title was conveyed to the three siblings \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" One of the sisters, during the lifetime of all three, conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party. The third party died, leaving a will that bequeathed her one-third interest to her son. Is the son's ownership interest enforceable in the face of the claim by the two non-selling sisters that they own 100% of the property pursuant to the law regarding joint tenancies?\n\nA. No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\nB. Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\nC. Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\nD. No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is C: yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\n\nJoint tenancy refers to a type of ownership where two or more parties own a piece of property together as though they owned it individually, but if any of them dies without having specified who will receive their share, then the deceased's share automatically goes to their heirs (if any). However, if there is no such inheritance clause, the deceased's share passes through probate, which means the property is sold and proceeds divided among the surviving joint tenants according to their shares in the property.\n\nIn this case, since the deed states that the title was conveyed to the three siblings \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship,\" it implies that the property was intended to be owned jointly and equally by all three sisters. However, the daughter attempted to convey a one-third interest to a third party before the death of both parents, violating the intent behind the joint tenancy agreement. This violates the doctrine of severance, which occurs when a joint tenancy is severed due to a legal action taken by one of the joint tenants.\n\nTherefore, the third party cannot assert ownership of the one-third interest she received from the daughter, as it is not valid under the terms of the joint tenancy agreement. The sale and subsequent transfer of the property to the third party would have been valid had the deed been properly executed, but since it contained the language stating the title was conveyed \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship,\" the deed itself was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\n\nThus, the second option, B, is incorrect because it suggests that only a will can create a joint tenancy, whereas in fact, the deed itself can also establish a joint tenancy. The first option, A, is also incorrect because it claims that each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, which is not supported by the facts of the case. The third option, D, is also incorrect because it argues that the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party, which is irrelevant to the issue at hand."
