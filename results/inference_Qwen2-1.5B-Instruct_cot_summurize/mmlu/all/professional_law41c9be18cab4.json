The building was called a \"twin\" home, i.e., it was divided into two separate residential units. However, the front entrance was located entirely on one of the lots; there was a door through the party wall that the occupants of the adjoining residence used to access their home. Owner sold the lot on which the stairway was located to the buyer, and owner continued to reside in the remaining part of the building. The deed did not contain a reservation of a right to use the doorway. The parties later disputed whether owner could continue to use the entrance that was located on the lot that he sold. What will a court most appropriately decide regarding the rights of the disputing parties?\n\nA. The owner retained an implied right to an exclusive license by necessity to use the doorway.\nB. The buyer can prevent access to owner because the deed was defective in not reserving a right to use the doorway.\nC. The court will automatically order a new deed be drafted containing court-ordered language that includes a reservation of rights.\nD. The court will conclude that an implied easement is created by law for the benefit of owner to use the doorway.\n"

This is because the deed does not contain a reservation of a right to use the doorway, and the doorways were necessary for the owner's use of his property. Additionally, the fact that the doorways were necessary for the owner's use suggests that they may have been intended to be open to public use, which would further support the conclusion that the owner has an implied right to use them."
