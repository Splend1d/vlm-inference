The three-story building had a store on the ground floor and apartments on the other two floors. The writer entered into a leasehold agreement with a shopkeeper, who would lease the first floor, where she planned to open a sporting goods store. After identifying the parties, the operative words of the lease were as follows: \"Landlord hereby agrees to lease for the three years the first floor of his building in the city to tenant, reserving unto said landlord annual rental in the sum of $12,000 payable in advance in monthly installments of $1,000. \"At the moment of signing, the leasehold agreement entered into between the writer and the shopkeeper\n\nA. created a periodic tenancy.\nB. could be terminated at will by either party.\nC. did not convey to the shopkeeper a term of years at law.\nD. was void, invalid, and had no legal effect.\n"

In this case, the landlord (the writer) agreed to lease the first floor of their building to the shopkeeper (tenant), but reserved the right to collect rent from the tenant. Therefore, the lease is considered a periodic tenancy because the landlord has the option to terminate it at any time.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the lease does not specify a fixed duration, so it cannot be terminated at will by either party. Option C is also incorrect because the lease conveyed to the tenant a term of years at law. Option D is incorrect because the lease is valid and enforceable under most jurisdictions."
