This process is regulated by a complex interplay between estrogen and progesterone. When estrogen levels rise, it signals to the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) to thicken and become more receptive for implantation of an egg. As estrogen levels peak, progesterone levels also increase, which helps to maintain the uterine lining in readiness for potential pregnancy.\n\nWhen the egg is released from the ovary during menstruation, the hormone levels drop sharply, signaling the beginning of the menstrual period. The decline in estrogen and progesterone levels triggers the shedding of the uterine lining, leading to the flow of blood during menstruation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: a sharp increase in estrogen and progesterone levels."
