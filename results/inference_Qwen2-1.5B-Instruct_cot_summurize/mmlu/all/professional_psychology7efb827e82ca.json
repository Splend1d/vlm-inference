The study does not provide any specific information about the likelihood of behavior problems in boys or girls based on marital status.\n\nTherefore, option A (neither child is more likely to manifest an immediate behavior problem than are children of stable marriages) is incorrect. Option B (the girl is more likely than the boy to manifest an immediate behavior problem) is also incorrect because the study does not provide any data on the likelihood of behavior problems in girls versus boys based on marital status.\n\nOption C (the boy is more likely than the girl to manifest an immediate behavior problem) is incorrect for similar reasons as option B. The study does not provide any data on the likelihood of behavior problems in boys versus girls based on marital status.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is D (both children are equally likely to manifest an immediate behavior problem)."
