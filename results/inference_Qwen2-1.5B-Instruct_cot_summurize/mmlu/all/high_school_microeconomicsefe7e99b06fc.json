The marginal revenue is calculated by taking the derivative of the revenue function with respect to quantity and setting it equal to zero:\n\n$$\\frac{dR}{dq} = MR = 0$$\n\nwhere R is the revenue function and q is the quantity produced. This means that the monopolist has reached the point where adding another unit of output does not increase profits or decrease losses.\n\nTherefore, the government should set the price at which marginal revenue equals zero in order to ensure that the monopolist produces the socially optimal amount of output."
