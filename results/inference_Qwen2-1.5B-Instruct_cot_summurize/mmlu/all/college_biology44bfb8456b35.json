They also maintain a stable blood glucose level through insulin and glucagon hormones, as well as a stable blood pH through bicarbonate ions. Metabolic rate refers to the rate at which energy is consumed or produced by the body, and it can vary depending on factors such as diet and exercise levels. However, it is not directly related to homeostasis as described above."
