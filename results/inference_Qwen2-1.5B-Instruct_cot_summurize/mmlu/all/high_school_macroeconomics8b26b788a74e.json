This can lead to financial losses for those who did not anticipate inflation and had to pay higher prices for goods and services.\n\nIn contrast, inflation also hurts debtors as they have to pay more interest on loans and mortgages due to the increased cost of borrowing. Additionally, if inflation is too high, it can lead to deflationary pressures, which can further harm borrowers' ability to repay debts.\n\nTherefore, both creditors and debtors are affected by inflation, but the impact varies depending on their level of anticipation and sensitivity to price changes."
