They bought a house together but the deed went in the man's name alone due to better credit and ability to obtain a mortgage in his name. He worked as a school vice-principal. She gave up her night law school classes to stay home and be a homemaker. She worked as a waitress and paid for all household expenses, food, laundry and other items. He paid for the mortgage, taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and other expenses. After several years, they became estranged and the man ordered the woman out of the house. She moved out and brought an action to obtain one-half of the home's equity value and a share of the other property and accounts built up in the man's name during the marriage. Which of the following is the best and strongest argument that the woman may assert to obtain a fair share of the property?\n\nA. There is an express contract between them to share the property equally.\nB. He has been unjustly enriched and he owes her restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory.\nC. She is entitled to damages based on a legal theory of fraudulent conversion.\nD. She is may be remunerated under the federal civil rights laws prohibiting gender discrimination.\n"

He has been unjustly enriched and he owes her restitution under a quasi-contract legal theory.\n\nThis is because the couple lived together for many years without being legally married, which means they had a cohabitation agreement or some form of informal partnership. Under this arrangement, both partners should have equal rights and responsibilities regarding the property acquired during their relationship. The man received the deed to the house, which indicates that he was the primary beneficiary of the property. However, the couple shared the costs and responsibilities of running the household, including paying for bills, so it would not be fair to deny her any portion of the property she contributed to over the years. This situation could potentially fall under the concept of \"quasi-contract,\" where a person agrees to a certain course of conduct, and if one party fails to perform their part of the agreement, the other party can seek restitution from the one who failed to fulfill their end of the bargain."
