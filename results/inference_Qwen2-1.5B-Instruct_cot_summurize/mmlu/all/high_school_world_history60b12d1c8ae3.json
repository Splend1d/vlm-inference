A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nBased on the speech, the French saw Africa as which of the following?\n\nA. A collection of republics tottering into anarchy\nB. A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War\nC. Important due to the Sahara's natural resources\nD. A strong political union\n"
