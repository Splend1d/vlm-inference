This makes them ideal for intermittent work where production needs may fluctuate.\n\nIndirect arc furnaces can also be used for intermittent work, but they have higher energy consumption compared to coreless furnaces. Additionally, indirect arc furnaces may require more maintenance than coreless furnaces due to their complex operation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Core less furnace."
