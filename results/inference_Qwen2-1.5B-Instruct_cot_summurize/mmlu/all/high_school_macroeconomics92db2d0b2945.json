This is because businesses may cut back on production and hire fewer workers, which can lead to lower prices and higher real wages.\n\nOn the other hand, the long-run Phillips curve is vertical, meaning that there is no fixed relationship between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. This means that in the long run, even if the economy were perfectly competitive and there was no natural tendency for prices to adjust towards their equilibrium level, the inflation rate would not be affected by changes in the unemployment rate. In this case, the only way to reduce unemployment without increasing inflation is to increase the supply of goods and services in the economy through expansionary fiscal policy or monetary policy."
