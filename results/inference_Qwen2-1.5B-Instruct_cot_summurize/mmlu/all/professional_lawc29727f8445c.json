While he was watching television in his hotel room, a thief picked the lock on the hotel room door, entered, hit the traveler over the head, and stole his wallet. The traveler, who suffered a concussion, was hospitalized for three days.

Premises liability claims typically require strict compliance with applicable safety regulations, but this case does not meet those requirements as the hotel's lock was compliant with the local ordinance prescribing minimum security standards.\n\nB. Even if the traveler is considered a \"business visitor\" on the hotel's property (which may be relevant to the defense), the fact that the hotel did not use reasonable care in selecting the lock does not automatically make the hotel liable.\n\nC. Intervening causes doctrine applies here, which states that a subsequent event that breaks up a chain of causation cannot render an intervening cause actionable. In this case, the theft by the thief after hitting the traveler over the head constitutes an intervening cause, meaning the thief's action should not be held responsible for the traveler's injuries.\n\nD. Using reasonable care in selecting a lock would have reduced the risk of harm to the traveler, which could mitigate the hotel's liability. However, without evidence showing the hotel failed to exercise such reasonable care, it cannot be assumed the hotel used unreasonable care in selecting the lock.\n\nThus, the most appropriate answer is D, where the hotel would not prevail if it used reasonable care in selecting the lock."
