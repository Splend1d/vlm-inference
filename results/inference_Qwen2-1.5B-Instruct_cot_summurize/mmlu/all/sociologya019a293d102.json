While there have been concerns about the spread of misinformation and the erosion of traditional media outlets, the internet has also provided new platforms for marginalized voices and movements to be heard. Additionally, the rise of social media platforms has created a more immediate and interactive way for people to participate in public discussions. Overall, while the internet may have changed the way we engage with each other, it has not replaced the public sphere entirely."
