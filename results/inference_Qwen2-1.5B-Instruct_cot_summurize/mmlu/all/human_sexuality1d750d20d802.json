However, chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection that can cause genital infections and symptoms such as itching, redness, and swelling. Itching and skin irritation around the genitals could also be caused by other conditions like eczema or contact dermatitis. Therefore, it would be best to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment."
