                    "text": "To calculate the holding period return on an investment, we can use the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Holding Period Return} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Ending Value} - \\text{Initial Investment}}{\\text{Initial Investment}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nGiven that the initial investment was made at 104.1 and sold at 82 in the third year, the ending value would be \\(104.1 + 82 = \\$186.1\\).\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives us:\n\n\\[ \\text{Holding Period Return} = \\left( \\frac{186.1 - 104.1}{104.1} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Holding Period Return} = \\left( \\frac{82}{104.1} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Holding Period Return} = 0.795 \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Holding Period Return} = 79.5\\% \\]\n\nThis means that the holding period return on the investment is approximately 79.5%. \n\nHowever, given the options provided, none of them match exactly. Let's check if there's any mistake in our calculation or interpretation.\n\nUpon re-evaluating the calculations, we realize that there seems to have been a misunderstanding in how the final calculation should be approached based on the information given.\n\nThe correct approach is to recognize that the coupon payments are not reinvested. Therefore, after selling the bond, the investor does not receive the principal amount back but only the present value of future cash flows discounted by the effective interest rate per year.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the effective annual interest rate is r%. Then, the present value of the future cash flows from the bonds (including the original purchase price and the future coupons) can be calculated as follows:\n\\[ PV = \\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \\left[ \\frac{FV}{(1+r)^t} \\right] \\]\nwhere \\(FV\\) is the future value of the coupon payment at time t, \\(PV\\) is the present value of the future cash flow, and T is the number of years until maturity.\n\nFor the first coupon payment at t=0, \\(FV = 8\\% \\times 100 = 8\\) dollars.\nFor each subsequent coupon payment at t=k, \\(FV = FV_{k-1} + 8\\%\\times FV_{k-1}\\), where \\(FV_0 = 8\\) dollars.\nSince there are no other payments, T = 5 years.\n\nTherefore,\n\\[ PV = 8 + \\sum_{k=1}^{5} \\left[ \\frac{8}{(1+r)^k} \\right] \\]\n\nLet's calculate this sum for each option and compare:\n\nOption A: \\(r = 8\\%, \\text{Holding Period Return} = \\left( \\frac{82}{104.1} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 79.5\\%\\)\n\nOption B: \\(r = 8\\%, \\text{Holding Period Return} = \\left( \\frac{82}{104.1} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 79.5\\%\\)\n\nOption C: \\(r = 8\\%, \\text{Holding Period Return} = \\left( \\frac{82}{104.1} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 78.76\\%\\)\n\nOption D: \\(r = 8\\%, \\text{Holding Period Return} = \\left( \\frac{82}{104.1} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 79.5\\%\\)\n\nAll options give a holding period return of approximately 79.5%. This matches Option A correctly.\n\nSo, the answer is **Option A**."
