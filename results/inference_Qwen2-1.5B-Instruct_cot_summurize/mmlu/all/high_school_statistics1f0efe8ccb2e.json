                    "text": "The correct answer is B. 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40\n\nExplanation: The interquartile range (IQR) of a normal distribution is calculated as follows:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\n\nwhere Q1 is the first quartile and Q3 is the third quartile.\n\nIn this case, we know that the mean (\u03bc) is 25 and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is 4. We also know that the IQR is approximately equal to 2.70.\n\nUsing the formula above, we can calculate the values for Q1 and Q3:\n\nQ1 = \u03bc - (\u03c3 * (n/4))\nQ3 = \u03bc + (\u03c3 * (n/4))\n\nSince n = 4 in this case, we have:\n\nQ1 = 25 - (4 * 4)\nQ1 = 25 - 16\nQ1 = 9\n\nQ3 = 25 + (4 * 4)\nQ3 = 25 + 16\nQ3 = 41\n\nNow we can calculate the IQR:\n\nIQR = Q3 - Q1\nIQR = 41 - 9\nIQR = 32\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40."
