REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep.\n\nDuring REM sleep, the brain is in a state of rapid eye movement, which means that the person will have dreams and may move their body parts around during sleep. This is why the participant's eyes are darting when they enter REM sleep. REM sleep is typically associated with dreaming and can last for anywhere from 15-60 minutes per night.\n\nBeta sleep, also known as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep, is characterized by slow, deep brain activity and low heart rate. This is the most restorative phase of sleep and is essential for recovery and growth.\n\nNREM sleep stages A-D are typically referred to as non-rapid eye movement sleep, and these stages are characterized by lower levels of brain activity and slower heart rates compared to REM sleep. These stages are less important for health than REM sleep because they do not result in dreams or muscle movements like REM sleep does."
