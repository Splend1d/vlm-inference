His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nA nineteenth-century Russian historian evaluating this passage would probably be most interested in\n\nA. the Russian interest in French culture\nB. the spirit of camaraderie amongst the miners\nC. the sense of continual class struggle\nD. the need for noblesse oblige\n"

The character compares the French workers' desire to uncover a treasure and consume it later to their own class struggles, arguing that they lack the courage to share the wealth they gain with others.\n\nGiven this context, the nineteenth-century Russian historian might be most interested in understanding the historical context and the attitudes towards wealth, social mobility, and class struggle during that time period. Therefore, option C, \"the sense of continual class struggle,\" would be the most relevant answer based on the given passage."
