According to Thomas Hobbes, a law of nature is an innate understanding that guides human behavior and prevents individuals from acting in ways that would harm themselves or others. This understanding comes from the natural instincts and desires of humans, rather than being imposed by divine authority or rational thought. Therefore, option C is the most accurate description of a law of nature according to Hobbes."
