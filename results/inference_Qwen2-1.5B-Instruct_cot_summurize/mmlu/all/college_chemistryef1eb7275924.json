                    "text": "To calculate the equilibrium polarization of 13C nuclei in a 20 T magnetic field at 300 K, we can use the following equation:\n\nP = B * A / (h * c)\n\nWhere:\n- P is the equilibrium polarization,\n- B is the magnetic field strength,\n- A is the area of the sample,\n- h is Planck's constant,\n- c is the speed of light.\n\nFor 13C nuclei, the atomic number is 6 and the atomic mass is 13. So, the mass number is 19.\n\nThe magnetic field is given as 20 T, which means it has a value of 2\u03c0 * 10^3 N/A^2.\n\nThe temperature is given as 300 K, which is equivalent to 300 * 10^-3 J/K.\n\nPlugging these values into the equation gives:\n\nP = 2\u03c0 * 10^3 N/A^2 * (19) / ((6.626 * 10^-34) * (3*10^-8))\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\nP \u2248 2\u03c0 * 10^3 N/A^2 * 19 / (6.626 * 10^-34) \u2248 1.71 x 10^-5\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 1.71 x 10^-5."
