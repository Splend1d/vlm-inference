Instead, it is proposed that different groups within society have their own interests and concerns, and that these interests should be represented by different political actors or parties.\n\nThis theory also suggests that the ruling elite may come from diverse class backgrounds, rather than being exclusively drawn from one particular class or group. This is because the pluralist theory argues that the distribution of power and resources within a society is complex and multifaceted, and that different groups may have varying levels of influence and access to resources.\n\nFinally, the pluralist theory argues that political parties do not necessarily represent the preferences of voters, but rather seek to appeal to a broad range of individuals who share certain values or beliefs. This means that parties need to compete for the support of consumers (i.e., voters) in order to gain traction and influence in politics. So options B and C are incorrect according to the pluralist theory, while option D is partially correct as it acknowledges the complexity of power distribution and the potential for multiple parties to emerge. However, the pluralist theory does not explicitly state that there is a close alignment between class background and party preference."
