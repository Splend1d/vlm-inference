If the population in which the disease is measured increases.\n\nIf the population increases, there will be more individuals to spread the disease among each other, leading to an increase in the number of cases and therefore an increase in the prevalence of the disease. This is known as the \"incidence rate\" or \"case fatality ratio,\" which measures how many new cases appear in a given period of time. As the population size increases, so does the potential for an outbreak to occur, making it more likely that the disease will become prevalent within the population."
