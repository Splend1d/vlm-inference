During this process, potential jurors are selected based on their ability to serve as impartial jurors. The defendant may request to see a list of these potential jurors before they are called for service. However, it is important to note that the defendant must show good cause for requesting this information, which can include factors such as age, health, or bias. It is up to the judge to determine whether the defendant's request meets the criteria for access to this information."
