She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\nA. Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\nB. Complication of the IVC filter placement\nC. Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\nD. Hematoma of the left thigh\n"

                    "text": "C. Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n\nThe symptoms described by the patient (persistent tingling and numbness in the left thigh) suggest compression of a peripheral nerve. The patient mentions a history of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage and anticoagulant therapy, which could have caused damage to the nerves. However, the symptoms were not reported during the hospital stay, indicating that they may have resolved or been masked by other factors. Additionally, the patient reports a hematoma on discharge that was resolving, which suggests a recent event rather than a long-term condition.\n\nThe lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is responsible for sensation in the lower outer quadrant of the thigh and the lower outer third of the calf. Compression of this nerve can lead to sensory loss in these areas. The presence of a hematoma on discharge also supports the idea that there has been some form of injury or trauma in the leg, potentially compressing the nerve.\n\nOption A, cerebral infarction during hospitalization, is unlikely given the absence of any neurological deficits noted at the time of admission. Option B, complication of the IVC filter placement, while possible, does not explain the specific symptoms described by the patient. Option D, hematoma of the left thigh, is consistent with the history provided but does not explain the duration of symptoms or the specific location of the symptom."
