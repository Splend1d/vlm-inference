For example, when you see a red apple on your desk, this is an impression because it represents a specific color and shape.\n\nIdeas, on the other hand, are more abstract concepts that require some mental processing to understand. They can be thought of as the result of our cognitive processes, such as reasoning, interpretation, and analysis. For instance, when you think about the taste of an apple, this is an idea because it involves using your mind to analyze the flavors and textures of the fruit.\n\nSo, Hume's division between impressions and ideas accurately reflects the difference between sensory experiences and abstract thoughts."
