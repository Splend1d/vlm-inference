Determining the conclusion one wants first, then accepting only evidence supporting that conclusion, or interpreting all evidence as support for that conclusion.\n\nThis type of fallacy occurs when someone argues their position based on what they want to happen rather than presenting evidence and arguments in favor of their viewpoint. They may also interpret all available evidence in a way that supports their argument, even if other interpretations could equally well be valid. This can lead to an incomplete understanding of the situation and a lack of logical consistency in one's reasoning."
