Aposomatic coloration\n\nAposomatic coloration is a type of camouflage in which an animal changes its color to match the background, allowing it to blend into its environment and avoid detection by predators or prey. This type of coloration is often associated with animals that have evolved chemical defenses, such as certain species of fish and insects. For example, some species of damselflies produce bright colors to attract mates, but their brightly colored bodies also serve as a warning to potential predators. When threatened, these insects may change color to match their surroundings, making them less conspicuous to predators."
