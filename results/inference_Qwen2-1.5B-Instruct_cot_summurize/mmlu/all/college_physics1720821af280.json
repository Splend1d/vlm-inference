The speed of sound decreases by 3% on a colder day, so the new speed of sound \\(v\\) is given by:\n\n\\[v = v_0 - 0.03 \\cdot v_0 = 0.97v_0\\]\n\nThe frequency (\\(f\\)) and wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) of the pipe are related by the equation:\n\n\\[f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda}\\]\n\nOn a warmer day (at 20\u00b0C), the pipe resonates at 440 Hz. Let's find the corresponding frequency on a colder day using the relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength:\n\n\\[\\frac{v}{\\lambda} = f\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(v\\) with \\(0.97v_0\\) and \\(f\\) with 440 Hz gives us:\n\n\\[\\frac{0.97v_0}{\\lambda} = 440\\]\n\nSolving for \\(\\lambda\\) gives:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{440 \\times 0.97v_0}{v_0} = 414\\]\n\nThis means that on a colder day, the pipe resonates at 414 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 414 Hz."
