During the second half of the first year, normal children increase the variety of sound, whereas deaf children may have difficulty with this process. This is because deaf children's hearing loss makes it difficult to understand the complex sounds they need to hear to develop language skills.\n\nB. The timing of when deaf children start vocalizing is different from normal children. While normal children tend to vocalize around 6 months old, some studies suggest that deaf children may start vocalizing earlier or later than this.\n\nC. Babbling is a common activity among both deaf and normal infants. However, the way deaf infants babble can be different from normal infants. For example, deaf infants may use gestures instead of vocalizing to communicate with others.\n\nD. The range of sound output that deaf children can produce is limited compared to normal children. This is due to their hearing loss and the fact that they cannot hear as much as normal children do. As a result, deaf children may have a harder time producing complex sounds and variations of sound that normal children can easily do.\n\nTherefore, option D (during the first 6 months, normal children increase their range of sound output more than deaf children do) is incorrect based on the information provided."
