The ratio 2/5 is equal to the ratio 1/2, which means that they both represent the same value when divided by each other. Similarly, the ratio 4/25 is equal to the ratio 2/5, so they also form a proportion. On the other hand, the ratios 2/5 and 8/10 cannot form a proportion because their product is not equal to 1 (the unit of measurement for division). Additionally, the ratio 2/5 and 10/15 cannot form a proportion because their product is not equal to 1 either. Finally, the ratio 2/5 and 6/15 cannot form a proportion because their product is not equal to 1 either. Therefore, only pairs A and C can form a proportion."
