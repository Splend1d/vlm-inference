This action could be considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair onto a busy highway, which also goes against the principle of treating others with respect and kindness. It can be seen as aggressive or dangerous behavior that may cause harm to the elderly woman and other road users.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions. The correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
