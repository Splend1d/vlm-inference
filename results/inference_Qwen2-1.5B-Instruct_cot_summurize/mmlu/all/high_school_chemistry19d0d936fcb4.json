At equilibrium, Q = Kc, where Kc is the equilibrium constant for the reaction. If we increase or decrease the temperature, the concentrations of reactants and products will change, resulting in a new Q that is different from the original Q. This means that the equilibrium constant will also be different. \n\nTherefore, the only way to change the numerical value of the equilibrium constant is by changing the temperature."
