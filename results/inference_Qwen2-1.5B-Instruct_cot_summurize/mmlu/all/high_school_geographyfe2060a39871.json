Contagious\n\nEnglish was introduced to India during the British colonial period as a means of communication with the British, who were using it extensively for administrative purposes. The spread of English in India was contagious, meaning that people picked up the language from their surroundings and began to use it themselves. This led to the formation of a new class of educated Indians who spoke English fluently, which had a significant impact on Indian society and culture."
