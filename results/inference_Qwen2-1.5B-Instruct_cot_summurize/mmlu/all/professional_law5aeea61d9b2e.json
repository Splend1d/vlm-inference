The surgeon moved to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion and set discovery cutoff and trial dates. The surgeon has appealed the denial of the motion. Should the appellate court hear the merits of the surgeon's appeal?\n\nA. No, because the appellate court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.\nB. No, because the district court's decision on jurisdiction is final.\nC. Yes, because a contrary appellate decision could terminate the action.\nD. Yes, because the surgeon's personal- jurisdiction challenge raises a constitutional question.\n"

Yes, because a contrary appellate decision could terminate the action.\n\nIn general, an appellate court does not have jurisdiction over a case where the lower court made a ruling that was correct but based on incorrect legal principles. In this case, the district court ruled correctly on the issue of personal jurisdiction, which is the authority of a court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant. This ruling is considered final and cannot be overturned by an appellate court.\n\nTherefore, if the appellate court were to find that the district court erred in denying the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, it would not have jurisdiction to review the correctness of that ruling. Instead, the appellate court would need to consider whether the error in the district court's ruling constituted reversible error under the applicable law, such as the principles of due process or equal protection. If the appellate court finds that there was no error in the district court's ruling, it will not have jurisdiction to review the case further."
