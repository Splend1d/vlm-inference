This means that massive objects like planets, stars, and galaxies have an influence on nearby objects. The force of gravity between two objects depends on their masses and the distance between them. \n\nLight cannot escape a black hole because it has no way out of its gravitational pull. However, according to General Relativity, gravity also causes time dilation, making clocks run slower near a massive object compared to those far away. Therefore, all four options (mass distorts spacetime, gravity affects clocks, light can't escape from a black hole, and All of these) are correct."
