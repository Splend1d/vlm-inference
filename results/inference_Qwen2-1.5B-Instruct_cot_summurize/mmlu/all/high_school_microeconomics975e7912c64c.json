This leads to a highly competitive environment where prices and output are determined by supply and demand curves that slope downward from left to right (inverted U-shape). As a result, firms' profits tend to be small and volatile, which makes them less likely to invest in long-term growth strategies like expanding their market share or diversifying their product lines.\n\nTherefore, if firms are entering an industry that is monopolistically competitive, they will face intense competition and may experience a decrease in demand for their products, leading to lower profits and potentially even losses. This is because the low barriers to entry means that new competitors can quickly enter the market, driving down prices and eroding profits for established firms. In this scenario, the demand for existing firms will shift leftward as they try to maintain or increase their share of the market while facing increasing competition."
