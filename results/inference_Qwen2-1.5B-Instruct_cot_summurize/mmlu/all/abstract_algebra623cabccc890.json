The degree of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}$ is 2 because $\\sqrt{2}$ can be expressed as $a + b\\sqrt{2}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers.\n2. The degree of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})/\\mathbb{Q}$ is also 2 because $\\sqrt{3}$ can be expressed as $c + d\\sqrt{3}$ where $c$ and $d$ are integers.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $2 - 2 = 0$. So the correct answer is A. 0."
