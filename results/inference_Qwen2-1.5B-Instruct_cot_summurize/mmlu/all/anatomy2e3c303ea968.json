The cricopharyngeus muscle is one of these muscles that helps with this process. It relaxes when you start swallowing and contracts again as you finish swallowing. This allows the food to move smoothly through your throat and into your stomach.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe what happens during swallowing:\n\n- A. The auditory tube (which is actually part of the middle ear) does not open or close for swallowing.\n- C. The rima glottis is the opening at the top of the vocal cords where air enters and leaves the lungs. When you speak, it opens and closes, but it doesn't open on its own during swallowing.\n- D. The gag reflex is a response to foreign objects entering your mouth or throat, not related to normal swallowing. It can be triggered by choking or other situations, but it isn't suspended while swallowing."
