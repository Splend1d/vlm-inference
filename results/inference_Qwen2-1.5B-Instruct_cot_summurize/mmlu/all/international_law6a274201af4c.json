The form in which a treaty is designated can affect its legal validity, but it does not necessarily determine the nature of the agreement itself.\n\nFor example, a treaty may be designated as an \"International Treaty\" by one party, while another party designates it as an \"Agreement\". These designations do not change the substance of the treaty, only its legal status within the international community.\n\nTherefore, treaties do not need to assume a particular form or designated as such, and their formality should not impact their legal validity."
