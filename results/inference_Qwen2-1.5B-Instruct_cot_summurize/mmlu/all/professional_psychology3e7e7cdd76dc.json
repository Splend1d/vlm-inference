The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) suggests that these three factors can be used to predict an individual's intentions to engage in a particular behavior. Attitude towards the behavior refers to an individual's overall positive or negative feelings towards performing the behavior. Subjective norms refer to an individual's perceptions of what others expect them to do regarding the behavior. Perceived behavioral control refers to an individual's belief in their ability to perform the behavior effectively. These factors together determine how likely an individual is to engage in the behavior."
