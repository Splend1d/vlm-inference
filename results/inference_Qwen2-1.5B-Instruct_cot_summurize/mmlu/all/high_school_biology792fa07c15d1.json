Fungus.\n\nFungi are decomposers that break down dead organic matter, including plant and animal remains, into simpler compounds such as carbon dioxide, water, and minerals. They play a crucial role in nutrient cycling by recycling nutrients back into the soil and contributing to the decomposition of organic material. \n\nWhile some other organisms, like cacti and bats, may also contribute to the breakdown of organic matter through their feeding habits or adaptations, fungi are the primary decomposers in most ecosystems."
