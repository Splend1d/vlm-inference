                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Differences in gene expression which may establish a pattern in the embryo as the cells divide.\n\nDuring fertilization, the sperm and egg fuse to form a zygote. The zygote then undergoes cell division, leading to the formation of multiple early blastocysts. Each blastocyst contains a set of identical genetic material from the parents, known as diploidy. However, some cells within each blastocyst will have undergone additional rounds of cell division (triploidy or tetraploidy), resulting in a more complex genetic makeup.\n\nThis differential distribution of substances in the egg most commonly leads to differences in gene expression that can influence embryonic development. For example, certain genes might be overexpressed or silenced depending on whether they are present at higher levels in diploids compared to triploids or tetraploids. This can result in different patterns of tissue development and organ function in the developing embryo.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this process does not necessarily lead to loss of specific genes during development. Instead, it allows for variation in gene expression and potentially contributes to the diversity of traits observed among different organisms."
