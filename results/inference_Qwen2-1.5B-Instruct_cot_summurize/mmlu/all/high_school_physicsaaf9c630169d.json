In fact, the frequency of the sound should remain constant or decrease slightly as the object falls due to the laws of physics.\n\nHowever, if the student were using an oscilloscope that has a high sampling rate (i.e., can measure very fast changes in voltage), they may notice a slight increase in the amplitude of the signal at the time of the fall. This could give the impression that the frequency is increasing, even though it is not.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer would be D. appears lower than 400 Hz and the frequency increases as it falls. However, it is important to note that the student's measurement is likely influenced by the sensitivity of their oscilloscope and the speed at which they observe the event."
