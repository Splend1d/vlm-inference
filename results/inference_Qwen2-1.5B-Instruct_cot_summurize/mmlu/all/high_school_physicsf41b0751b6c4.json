This is due to conservation of energy. However, if an object slides down an incline without rotating, the work done by friction will increase the kinetic energy of the object as it moves down the incline. This means that the final kinetic energy of the object will be less than its original gravitational potential energy, since some of the gravitational potential energy has been converted into thermal energy and kinetic energy. Therefore, the correct answer is (D)."
