The responsibility to remain sovereign.\n\nThis is because the responsibility to protect (R2P) refers to the international community's obligation to intervene when a state fails to protect its population from mass atrocities. It does not involve the sovereignty of any particular state or entity, but rather the collective responsibility of the international community to act together to ensure human rights and fundamental freedoms are protected. Therefore, option C is incorrect in this context."
