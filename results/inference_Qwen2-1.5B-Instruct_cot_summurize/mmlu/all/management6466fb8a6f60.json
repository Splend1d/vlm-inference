The way things should be.\n\nA normative perspective refers to the idea that certain actions or behaviors are considered right or wrong, and that people have a moral obligation to follow them. This perspective is based on ethical principles such as fairness, honesty, respect for others, and the common good. It is used in legal systems, religious teachings, political ideologies, and other areas of human culture.\n\nOn the other hand, an epistemic perspective focuses on what we know about the world, while a descriptive perspective describes how things actually are. A prescriptive perspective suggests what we should do, but it does not necessarily tell us whether our actions will be successful or effective."
