The minor premise must either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent. \n\nA valid disjunctive syllogism consists of three statements, each of which can be true or false independently of the others. The key characteristic that distinguishes a valid disjunctive syllogism from invalid ones is that at least one of the premises must be a disjunction (either \"both p and q\" or \"not both p and q\"). This means that there must be at least one case in which the conclusion is true but not in all cases.\n\nIn terms of the other options:\n\n- B is incorrect because it does not specify what the minor premise must do.\n- C is incorrect because it implies that the minor premise cannot be missing, which is not necessarily true.\n- D is incorrect because while a valid disjunctive syllogism reaches a truthful conclusion, this is not a necessary condition for its validity."
