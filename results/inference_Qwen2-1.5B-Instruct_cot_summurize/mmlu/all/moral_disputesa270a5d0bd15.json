While the Confucian approach may not be as efficient or effective at solving collective action problems as other models, it still recognizes the need for cooperation and shared responsibilities within society. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect, as the Confucian model values individual autonomy and respects people's rights and dignity. Option C is correct, as the Confucian model acknowledges that real social change requires both changes in individual behavior (actions) and changes in societal norms and institutions (mindsets). It does not accept coercion outright, but rather views it as a means to an end that should be used only when necessary and with careful consideration of the consequences."
