Deliberation should include sympathy and direct attendance to concrete particulars. \n\nCare ethics is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of considering the feelings and interests of others in decision-making processes. It suggests that deliberation should be characterized by empathy and concern for the well-being of those involved, including consideration of their specific needs and circumstances. This means that decisions should take into account both general principles and individualized concerns, rather than simply focusing on abstract or distant goals."
