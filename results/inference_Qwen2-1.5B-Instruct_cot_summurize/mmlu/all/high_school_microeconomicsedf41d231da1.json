As the demand for lawn-mowing services increases, the supply curve shifts rightward, indicating that it becomes more expensive to provide the service. This is due to the fact that as the number of units demanded increases, the opportunity cost of using time and resources decreases, leading to an increase in the willingness to pay for the service. Therefore, the supply curve slopes upward as the opportunity cost of time decreases."
