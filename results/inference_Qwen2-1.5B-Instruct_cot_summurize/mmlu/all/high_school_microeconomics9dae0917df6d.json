This means that buyers can buy more of the good at this lower price than they could otherwise, resulting in a surplus of the good above the market equilibrium. As a result, producers may produce more or less than they would if there were no price floor, leading to a surplus of the good above the market equilibrium. This surplus of the good above the market equilibrium is known as deadweight loss and is considered a negative outcome of a price floor. Therefore, option C is correct."
