However, without more context or information about the specific circumstances and norms of the situation, it is impossible to determine whether this action is indeed morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character takes their phone out during a movie at the theater to record it. This action may also be considered morally wrong depending on the norms and expectations surrounding watching movies.
