Reduced amount of gastric acid.\n\nHypochlorhydria refers to an insufficient production or release of stomach acid, which can cause digestive problems such as nausea, heartburn, and abdominal pain. It is more common in people with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or obesity, as well as those who take certain medications that suppress the stomach's acidity. Hypochlorhydria can also be caused by other factors like stress, smoking, or alcohol consumption."
