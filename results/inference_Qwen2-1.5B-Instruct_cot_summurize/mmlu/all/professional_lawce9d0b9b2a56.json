The woman continued to take powerful pain medication for several weeks after she returned home. During her recovery, she offered to sell her car for $450 to her neighbor, who owned a house-cleaning service. The neighbor said, \"That's great! I need a car to transport all the people who work for me to their job sites.\" In fact, the woman's car was worth $3,000, and the neighbor knew this. He was also aware that the woman had undergone surgery and noted that she seemed \"out of it\" because of the medication she was taking. Several days later, the woman's son found out about the deal and contacted the neighbor, telling him that the woman would sell him the car, but for $3,450. The next day, when the neighbor tendered $450 and demanded that the woman give him the car, she refused. If the neighbor sues the woman for breach of contract, will he be likely to prevail?\n\nA. No, because the contract was voidable due to the woman's apparent incapacity.\nB. No, because the woman put nothing in writing.\nC. Yes, because the neighbor's reliance on the otherwise voidable contract made it enforceable.\nD. Yes, because the woman's offer and the neighbor's acceptance created an enforceable contract.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Yes, because the woman's offer and the neighbor's acceptance created an enforceable contract.\n\nIn order for a contract to be enforceable, there must be an offer, acceptance, and consideration. In this case, the woman made an offer (to sell her car) and the neighbor accepted it by offering money and requesting the car. The neighbor's acceptance of the offer is sufficient to create a binding contract between them. \n\nHowever, if the woman is unable to understand or appreciate the terms of the contract due to her health or mental state, the contract may be considered voidable at the option of either party. In this case, the woman's son could have voided the contract under the doctrine of undue influence. But since the woman was able to understand and appreciate the terms of the contract, it cannot be said that the contract was voidable due to the woman's apparent incapacity.\n\nTherefore, the neighbor is more likely to prevail in his lawsuit against the woman for breach of contract."
