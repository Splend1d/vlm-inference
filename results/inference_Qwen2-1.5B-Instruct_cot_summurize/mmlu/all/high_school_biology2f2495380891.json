This term refers to the characteristic feature of Barr bodies on the Y chromosomes of women who have not yet had children. These cells contain one inactive X chromosome (from the mother) that is inactivated during meiosis II, leaving only the Y chromosome active. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"the Y-chromosome mystery\" or \"the Y-chromosome paradox.\""
