After a hard day at work during which he is under incredible pressure to perform well, he goes home to his wife who proceeds to spank him, tie him to their four poster bed, and tease him until he begs for intercourse. According to psychological theory, what is the most likely reason Benny finds this alluring?\n\nA. As a child be became sexually aroused pretending to be a powerful executive, so he now becomes aroused at work and must discharge this when he gets home.\nB.

He is overwhelmed with pressures and responsibilities at work, and the masochistic behaviour allows him to escape from being an autonomous, separate individual.\nD.

It can involve various forms of physical and emotional play between partners, including bondage, discipline, domination, submission (BDMS), and sadism (SDM). Sadomasochists often engage in activities that they believe will cause them pain or humiliation, but also provide a sense of power and control over their partner(s).\n\nIn the context of your scenario, Benny's experience may stem from feeling overwhelmed with stress and pressure at work. The act of being tied up and teased by his wife could trigger his own internalized desires and anxieties related to authority, power, and control, leading him to seek out these behaviors as a way to cope with his stress.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most plausible explanation based on the given information."
