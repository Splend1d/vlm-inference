This statement is true because every group has an automorphism (i.e., an endomorphism) that maps the identity element to itself, which can be considered as a homomorphism from the original group to itself.\n\nStatement 2: \"Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map\". This statement is false in general. While it's true for some specific types of homomorphisms, such as those between vector spaces or modules over a ring, not all homomorphisms are necessarily injective. A homomorphism may preserve only the set-theoretic structure of the underlying sets without necessarily preserving individual elements."
