No, there are no ciphers with perfect secrecy\n\nPerfect secrecy means that the ciphertext can be perfectly indistinguishable from random noise to an eavesdropper who has unlimited computational resources and access to the plaintext. However, even if the key used in a stream cipher is truly secure (i.e., it is chosen uniformly at random), this does not guarantee perfect secrecy because the ciphertext is still dependent on the key. In other words, there will always be some information leaked about the key, which could be used to break the encryption. Therefore, while a stream cipher using a truly secure key may provide good security, it cannot achieve perfect secrecy."
