To promote a diversity of industries.\n\nWhile promoting a diversity of industries can be a benefit of trade, it is not necessarily an argument for restricting trade. The other options listed (protecting infant industry, promoting employment, and fighting inflation) are all valid reasons to restrict trade. Restricting trade can help protect domestic industries from foreign competition, create jobs in the country, and prevent inflationary pressures on domestic prices."
