When individuals have more disposable income to spend, they will be able to consume more goods and services, which increases aggregate demand. This can lead to an expansion in economic activity and overall growth. Higher import levels or a higher real interest rate would decrease aggregate demand, while lower consumer wealth would also decrease aggregate demand but not as much as lowering taxes on personal income."
