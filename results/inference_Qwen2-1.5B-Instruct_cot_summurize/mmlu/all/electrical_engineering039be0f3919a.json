This can be due to the equipment being faulty, human error in data entry or interpretation, or a bias in how the experiment was conducted. Observational errors refer to inaccuracies in observing an event or phenomenon, while instrument errors involve problems with measuring instruments themselves. Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light can also introduce systematic errors into measurements."
