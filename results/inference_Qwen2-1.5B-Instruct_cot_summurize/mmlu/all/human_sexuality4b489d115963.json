For example, a study published in the Journal of Sex Research found that watching pornographic videos increased participants' interest in having sex with specific types of partners (e.g., men, older women, etc.).\n\nHowever, other studies have found that exposure to erotica can also lead to changes in sexual attitudes and behaviors. For example, a study published in the Journal of Sex Research found that regular consumption of erotica was associated with lower levels of sexual satisfaction and greater likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behaviors such as unsafe sex.\n\nOverall, while it's difficult to say definitively whether erotica has any direct impact on sexual behavior, the available research suggests that it can have both positive and negative effects depending on how it is consumed and who is consuming it. It's important to note that everyone's experience with erotica will be different, and what works for one person may not work for another."
