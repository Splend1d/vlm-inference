However, he also recognized that these calculations could only provide a rough guide and that more nuanced considerations such as justice, fairness, and respect for individual rights would still play a role in determining the best course of action. Therefore, while it is important to consider the potential consequences of actions when making decisions, it is not necessary to perform an explicit utilitarian calculation every time one takes a decision. Rather, one should strive to make decisions that balance different values and priorities, taking into account both the immediate and long-term impacts of one's actions."
