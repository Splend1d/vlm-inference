Howard's vision for the Garden City was based on the idea that a town could be designed with a mix of housing, industry, agriculture, and recreation in order to create a sustainable community. The idea was that these separate but interconnected elements would work together to provide all the amenities needed for a healthy and happy life. This approach was intended to break down the traditional hierarchical structure of society and encourage people to live closer to their workplaces and communities."
