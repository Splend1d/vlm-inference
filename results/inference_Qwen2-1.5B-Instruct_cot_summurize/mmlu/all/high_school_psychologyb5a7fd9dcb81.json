Fixed-ratio. \n\nA fixed-ratio schedule means that the number of rewards (in this case, ice cream purchases) given to an animal or human is determined in advance and fixed for each session. In other words, after every ten purchases, the animal gets their next purchase free. This type of schedule is most effective when there is a clear end point, such as reaching a certain number of purchases.\n\nOption A, variable-ratio, would mean that the frequency of rewards increases or decreases randomly, without any pattern. Option B, variable-interval, would mean that rewards are given at random intervals, but not necessarily in pairs. Option D, fixed-interval, would also mean that rewards are given at regular intervals, but again, with no specific pattern.\n\nTherefore, the best match for the given information is option C, fixed-ratio."
