It is an important factor in determining overall calorie needs for weight management or nutrition planning.\n\nIn response to weight loss, BMR typically decreases due to a decrease in body weight. This is because weight loss leads to a reduction in muscle mass, which requires less energy than fat. As a result, the body must adjust its metabolism to use fewer calories to sustain itself during periods of low energy expenditure.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct."
