                    "text": "A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?\n\nA. The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.\nB. The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.\nC. The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.\nD. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.\n\nIn the case of riparian rights, the doctrine of \"prior appropriation\" typically applies when there is evidence of continuous and exclusive use of a water source by one party over another, even if the parties did not physically occupy the same location. This can be true even if both parties have taken water from the same stream, with one party using the water for domestic purposes and the other party using the water for agriculture.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the millionaire's water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher because he has continuously used the water for domestic purposes since before the rancher began using the water for domestic purposes in 1986. Additionally, the millionaire has put the water to a beneficial use (irrigating his farm) and has continuously used the water since before the rancher began using the water for domestic purposes in 1986."
