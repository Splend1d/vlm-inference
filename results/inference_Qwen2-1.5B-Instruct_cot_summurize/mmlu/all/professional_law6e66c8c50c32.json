After approving the license to the utility company, the city council then passed a measure by which the utility company was required to insert in its monthly billing statements a letter from a private consumer group criticizing the high cost of electrical service. The cost of printing and mailing the monthly letter was paid entirely by the consumer group. Nonetheless, the utility company vehemently objected to having such a critical letter enclosed in their monthly billing statements. However, the city council warned the utility company that unless it complied with the directive, the city would revoke its license for electrical service. The utility company filed suit in federal court seeking a hearing prior to its license being revoked by the city council. Which of the following constitutional provisions would provide the utility company with the strongest grounds with which to challenge the city council measure?\n\nA. The due process clause.\nB. The equal protection clause.\nC. The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIv.\nD. The commerce clause.\n"

This clause guarantees that people are entitled to be heard before they are deprived of any property or liberty without due process of law. In this case, the utility company argues that the city's requirement to include a letter criticizing the cost of electricity in their monthly bills violates its right to due process."
