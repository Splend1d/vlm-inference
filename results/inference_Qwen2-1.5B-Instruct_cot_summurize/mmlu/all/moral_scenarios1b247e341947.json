In scenario 1, swimming in a place where there is a high risk of harm to oneself or others is considered morally wrong because it could cause harm to innocent people who live nearby. In scenario 2, using physical force on someone against their will without consent is also considered morally wrong. Both actions go against the principles of respecting one's autonomy and bodily integrity."
