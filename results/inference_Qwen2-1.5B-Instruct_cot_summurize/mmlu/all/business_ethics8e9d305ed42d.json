A fiduciary duty is a legal obligation that requires individuals or organizations to act in the best interest of another party, such as a shareholder. In this case, managers and directors have a fiduciary responsibility to manage the company's assets and ensure that they are being used for the benefit of the shareholders. This includes making decisions that are in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders, including employees, customers, and suppliers. Additionally, managers and directors must be transparent about their actions and decision-making processes, so that shareholders can understand how their investments are being managed."
