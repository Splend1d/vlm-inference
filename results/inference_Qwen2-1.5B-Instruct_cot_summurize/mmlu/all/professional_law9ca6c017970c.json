The contractor who was working on the restaurant expansion found that the north wall of the new structure needed extensive support, so anchor rods and concrete were added. The supporting anchor rods and concrete extended into a neighboring property farther to the north at a point 20 feet below the surface. Although there was no impact on the surface of his land or on existing uses, the owner of the neighboring property has sued the restaurant owner for trespass. Which party is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The neighboring property owner, because he should have been given notice of the intrusion before it occurred.\nB. The neighboring property owner, because the restaurant intruded upon his property the restaurant intruded upon his property without permission.\nC. The restaurant owner, because the decision to provide the additional support was reasonable.\nD. The restaurant owner, because there was no disturbance of peaceful enjoyment of the neighboring property. \u0080\u0083\n"

The restaurant owner is likely to prevail because the decision to provide the additional support was reasonable.\n\nWhen an individual builds onto their property, they have the right to do so as long as it does not significantly interfere with the use or enjoyment of the adjacent property. In this case, the restaurant built onto their property and provided additional support, which may have caused some inconvenience to the neighbor but did not cause significant interference with their use or enjoyment of the land. Therefore, the restaurant owner can argue that their actions were reasonable and therefore not liable for trespass.\n\nIt's worth noting that if the neighbor had provided proper notice of the construction plans and had requested any compensation or restrictions, the restaurant would be more likely to win in court. However, since the neighbor did not take any action to prevent the construction, the restaurant owner is still likely to prevail based solely on the fact that the addition of the supporting structures was necessary to ensure the safety of the structure itself."
