The population of SAT scores from each group must be normally distributed.\n\nThe t-test assumes that the data comes from a normal distribution, which means that the sample means come from a normal distribution with a standard error that is proportional to the square root of the sample size (n-1). This allows us to use the t-distribution as an approximation for the normal distribution when n is large.\n\nIf the population of SAT scores from each group is not normally distributed, then we cannot use the t-test and instead need to use other statistical tests such as the z-test or chi-square test. Additionally, if the population variances from each group are not known, we would need to use the F-test to compare the variances.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
