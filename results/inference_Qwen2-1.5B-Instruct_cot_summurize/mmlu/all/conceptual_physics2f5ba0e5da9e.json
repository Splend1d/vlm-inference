This means that if one particle has a positive charge, it will repel the negative charge of its partner, causing the particles to move away from each other at an equal but opposite rate. If one particle has a negative charge, it will attract the positive charge of its partner, causing the particles to move towards each other at an equal and opposite rate.\n\nTherefore, the signs of the charges on the particles must be opposite for them to accelerate towards each other and move apart."
