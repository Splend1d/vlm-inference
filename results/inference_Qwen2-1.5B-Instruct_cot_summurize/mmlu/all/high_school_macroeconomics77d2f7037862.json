In this case, the reserve ratio is 25%, which means that for every $1000 in deposits, banks must hold $250 in reserves.\n\nTo find the amount of excess reserves, we subtract the required reserves from the total deposits:\n$1000 - $250 = $750\n\nSo the bank has $750 in excess reserves.\n\nTo find the size of the money multiplier, we divide the deposit multiplier (the number of times the deposit will be multiplied) by the reserve ratio. The deposit multiplier is typically between 4 and 6, depending on the country's banking regulations.\nIn this case, the deposit multiplier is 4 (since the reserve ratio is 25%), so the money multiplier is $1000 / $250 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 25% $750 M = 4."
