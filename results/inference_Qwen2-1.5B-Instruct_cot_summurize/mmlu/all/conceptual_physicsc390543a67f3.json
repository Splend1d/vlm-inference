As the Earth orbits around the Sun, it experiences gravitational forces that cause it to move away from the center of the Sun at a speed known as orbital velocity. If the Sun collapses to form a black hole, this gravitational force would increase dramatically, causing the Earth to be pulled towards the center of the black hole at an even faster speed than before. This would result in a catastrophic event called a \"black hole collision\" where the Earth would be pulled apart and destroyed. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
