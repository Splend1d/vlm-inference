They are produced by various processes in the universe, including supernovae explosions and radioactive decay.\n\nParticles that interact weakly with other particles include neutrinos, which means they do not carry any electric charge and can pass through matter relatively easily. This makes them useful for studying particle physics at high energies where charged particles cannot be detected or measured directly.\n\nOn the other hand, muons (a type of electron) and pions (a type of meson) have stronger interactions with other particles than neutrinos. For example, muons can interact with each other and with electrons to produce other particles, while pions can also interact with each other and with nucleons to produce other particles.\n\nAntiparticles are particles that have opposite charges and properties compared to their normal counterparts. However, antineutrinos are not considered as \"particles\" in the same way as other types of particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons. Instead, antineutrinos are particles that have an energy greater than their rest mass energy, but they do not have any net charge. So, they do not interact with other particles in the same way as ordinary neutrinos."
