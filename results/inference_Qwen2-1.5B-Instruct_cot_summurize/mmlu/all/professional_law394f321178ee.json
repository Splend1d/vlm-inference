Since he did not fulfill the university residency requirement, the student was required to pay $1,800 tuition each semester, which was $400 more than the tuition of state resident-students. In an action by the student challenging the constitutionality of the provision governing the determination of residency for the purpose of fixing a fee differential for out-of-state students in public college, the court will most likely declare the provision\n\nA. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\nC. constitutional, because the fee differential promotes a compelling state interest.\nD. constitutional, because the provision does not trigger strict scrutiny.\n"

The provision does not trigger strict scrutiny because it serves a legitimate state interest (promoting a compelling state interest) and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest (it requires only that the student have been in the state for at least one year). Therefore, option D is correct."
