The customer contended that at the time of the mishap, the doors were programmed to swing outward, taking would-be customers entering the store, by surprise. At trial, the customer testified to both the nature of his injuries and the events leading up to their occurrence. The grocery store denied that the doors to its store were in any way unsafe or that the customer's injuries were caused by his encounter with the doors. The customer's sister testified at trial that she accompanied her brother to the store the day of the accident and witnessed the outward swinging doors, which struck him. She further alleged that when she returned to the store the following week, the doors had been re-programmed to swing inward. The trial judge should rule the sister's testimony\n\nA. admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.\nB. admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent.\nC. inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy.\nD. inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations.\n"

Common sense impressions are generally considered admissible in court to prove what a reasonable person would have known or believed about a fact in question. In this case, the customer's sister's testimony provides a common-sense understanding of how the doors were programmed and how they functioned, which is relevant to the customer's claim of injury.\n\nOption B (admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent) is incorrect because the customer's sister did not make an explicit statement admitting the truth of the facts, but rather provided an inference based on common sense.\n\nOption C (inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy) is also incorrect because the sister's testimony is relevant to the customer's claim of injury, which is a fact of relevance to the case.\n\nOption D (inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations) is also incorrect because there is no public policy consideration at play here; instead, the issue is whether the testimony is admissible under the rules of evidence."
