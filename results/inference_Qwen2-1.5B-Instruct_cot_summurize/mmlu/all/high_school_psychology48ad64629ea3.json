Increase in secretion of stress hormones.\n\nPhysiological arousal, also known as fight or flight response, involves several physical and psychological changes that occur in the body to prepare for either danger or stress. These include:\n\n1. Dilation of the pupils: This increases blood flow to the eyes and brain, enhancing vision and alertness.\n2. Increase in salivation: Saliva production increases, which helps in digestion and lubricates the mouth and throat.\n3. Increase in perspiration: The skin produces sweat to cool down the body and regulate body temperature.\n4. Release of stress hormones: Adrenaline (epinephrine) and cortisol are released into the bloodstream, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolism. \n\nTherefore, all of these are characteristics of physiological arousal except for an increase in secretion of stress hormones."
