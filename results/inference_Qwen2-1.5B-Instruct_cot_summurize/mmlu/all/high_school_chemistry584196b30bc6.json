The temperature of the mixture rose to reach a final temperature of 35 \u00b0C. Which of the following can be concluded?\n\nA. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained.\nB. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did, but the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\nC. The sample temperature changed more than the water temperature did; therefore the CP of the sample must be greater than the CP of the water.\nD. The final temperature is less than the average starting temperature of the sample and the water; therefore the total energy of the sample and water decreased.\n"

                    "text": "We need to calculate the specific heat capacity (CP) of the sample and the water based on their initial and final temperatures.\n\nThe change in temperature for both the sample and the water can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394T = (final temperature - initial temperature) / m\n\nwhere \u0394T is the change in temperature, m is the mass of the substance, and T1 and T2 are the initial and final temperatures respectively.\n\nFor the sample:\n\u0394T_sample = (35\u00b0C - 10\u00b0C) / 25g = 1.6\u00b0C/g\n\nFor the water:\n\u0394T_water = (35\u00b0C - 22\u00b0C) / 100g = 1.3\u00b0C/g\n\nSince the sample has a higher initial temperature than the water, its \u0394T will be greater than the water's \u0394T. Therefore, option A is correct. However, we cannot conclude that the sample lost more heat energy than the water gained because we don't have enough information about how much heat energy each substance lost or gained during the process.\n\nOption B is incorrect because we don't know if the sample lost the same amount of heat energy as the water gained.\n\nOption C is incorrect because we don't have enough information to determine whether the CP of the sample is greater than the CP of the water.\n\nOption D is incorrect because we don't have enough information to determine if the total energy of the sample and water decreased."
