He immediately sent a purchase order which stated \"our law firm accepts your $1,000 offer for 10,000 envelopes for $1,000 CIF.\"\u009d Costco then sent Rainmaking an order confirmation which stated \"Envelope order acceptance conditional upon a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes.\" If the parties disagree on the proper contract relationship, a court would likely rule:\n\nA. A contract at $1,000 because the offer terms CIF means cost, insurance and freight including all loading charges.\nB. A contract at $1,500 because the loading charges are to be included.\nC. No contract because the order confirmation was a counteroffer which was not accepted.\nD. No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, can not be deviated from.\n"

No contract because the purchase order was the offer and, under the mirror image rule, cannot be deviated from.\n\nIn this scenario, the purchase order from Rainmaking Lawfirm to Costco states that they accept the offer of $1,000 for 10,000 envelopes CIF. However, when Costco sends the order confirmation stating that the envelope order acceptance is conditional upon a loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes, it is essentially a counteroffer.\n\nUnder the mirror image rule, if an offer includes conditions or limitations (such as the loading charge), the offeree cannot accept the offer unless those conditions are also met. In this case, the conditions in the order confirmation (loading charge of $50 per thousand envelopes) are not acceptable by the Rainmaking Lawfirm, so there is no contract between the two parties.\n\nTherefore, the court would likely rule that there is no contract between Rainmaking Lawfirm and Costco based on the mirror image rule."
