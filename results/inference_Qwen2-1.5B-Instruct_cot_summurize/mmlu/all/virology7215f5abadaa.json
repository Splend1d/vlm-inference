This allows the immune system to develop immunity to the specific pathogen without causing the actual illness, making it less likely to spread the disease to others. Vaccines can also provide protection against future exposure to the same strain of the pathogen if the vaccine is updated with new strains. Therefore, preventing infection, disease, and transmission are all important goals of vaccination."
