This is because protein is broken down by the body during metabolism and its waste products (ammonia) are eliminated through urine. The amount of nitrogen lost in urine can then be used to calculate the amount of protein oxidized.\n\nOxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production are related to respiration but do not directly provide information about protein oxidation. Breath collection does not involve any measurement of nitrogen or protein content."
