These fatty acids are precursors for the synthesis of eicosanoids, which are important hormones involved in inflammation, pain, and immune response.\nIn the body, these fatty acids can be converted into eicosanoids by enzymes called cyclooxygenases (COX). COXs produce prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes as side products during the conversion of arachidonic acid to other fatty acids. Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are known to play key roles in inflammation and immune response, while thromboxanes are involved in platelet aggregation and coagulation.\nTherefore, it's important to note that polyunsaturated fatty acids like those found in fish oil supplements are not directly converted into eicosanoids in the human body, but they may influence the production or effects of eicosanoids through their potential role in altering the activity of COXs."
