                    "text": "The correct answer is A. elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.\n\nWhen sodium bicarbonate (also known as baking soda) is ingested, it reacts with water to form carbon dioxide gas and sodium hydroxide (lye). The carbon dioxide gas produced by the reaction can be expelled from the body through respiration, which helps to raise the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood and reduce the partial pressure of carbon dioxide. This can help to improve endurance performance by reducing fatigue during exercise.\n\nIn addition, sodium bicarbonate has buffering capacity, meaning that it can absorb excess hydrogen ions from the extracellular fluid, which can help to maintain a stable pH level in the muscles. This stability allows for better nutrient delivery and more efficient energy production, which can lead to improved performance over time."
