However, it is true that older workers may face certain challenges and obstacles in the workplace due to age-related issues such as physical limitations, cognitive decline, and retirement planning.\n\nIt is also possible that some older workers may have been laid off in recent years due to economic downturns or restructuring of businesses. Therefore, the correct answer would depend on the specific context and data being considered.\n\nIn general, it is important to consider the individual circumstances and experiences of older workers when assessing their productivity and job satisfaction, rather than making blanket statements about all older workers."
