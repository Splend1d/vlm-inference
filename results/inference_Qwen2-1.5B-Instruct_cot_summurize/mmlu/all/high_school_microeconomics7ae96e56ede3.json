Marginal Product of Labor is Rising.\n\nWhen the total product of labor (TPL) is rising at an increasing rate, it means that each additional unit of labor input is producing more output than before. This indicates that the marginal product of labor is rising, which means that each additional unit of labor is contributing more to the overall production output. \n\nOn the other hand, when the marginal product of labor is falling or declining, it suggests that the additional unit of labor is not adding as much value to the production process. Therefore, the marginal product of labor is at its minimum when the marginal product is zero and the marginal product starts decreasing after that point. \n\nMarginal Cost refers to the additional cost incurred for producing one more unit of output beyond the initial level of production. If marginal cost is rising, it means that the additional cost is increasing with each additional unit of output produced, indicating that the firm is experiencing diseconomies of scale. However, if marginal cost is constant or declining, it suggests that the firm is operating efficiently and maximizing profits."
