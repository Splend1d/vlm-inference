                    "text": "The net force on an object thrown upwards due to gravity will be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the acceleration due to gravity, which is $-g$ (negative because it's acting downwards). The acceleration due to gravity at any point along the path of motion is given by $-g = -\\frac{GM}{r^2}$, where $M$ is the total mass of all objects in the system and $r$ is the distance from the center of mass of those objects.\n\nAt the top of the trajectory (height 20m), the ball has reached its maximum height. In this case, we can consider the ball as having no mass (since it was initially thrown upwards with negligible mass) and the initial velocity when thrown upwards is zero. Therefore, the only force acting on the ball is gravity, so the net force is just $-g$, which is also the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nSo, the net force on the ball at the 10-m position halfway up the trajectory is:\n\n$$F_{net} = -g = - \\left(-9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2\\right) = 9.8 \\text{ N}$$\n\nHowever, you've asked for the net force at the 10-m position, not halfway up the trajectory. Since the acceleration due to gravity is constant throughout the entire trajectory, the net force at any point along the trajectory will be $-g$. Thus, at the 10-m position halfway up the trajectory, the net force is still:\n\n$$F_{net} = -g = - \\left(-9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2\\right) = 9.8 \\text{ N}$$\n\nThis matches option A, 2mg."
