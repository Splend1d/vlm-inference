                    "text": "The correct answer is D. Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, low serum transferrin receptors, high hepcidin.\n\nIron deficiency is often accompanied by anemia, which can lead to low haemoglobin levels. Ferritin stores iron in the body, so low ferritin levels suggest that there may not be enough iron available for storage or use. Serum transferrin receptors help transport iron from the bloodstream into cells, so a high level suggests that there may be too much iron being absorbed from the diet or being used up too quickly. Hepcidin is a hormone that regulates iron metabolism and can affect how well iron is stored and released from the body. Infection can alter these processes, leading to changes in iron status markers. Therefore, all four options listed are possible findings in someone with both iron deficiency and a severe infection."
