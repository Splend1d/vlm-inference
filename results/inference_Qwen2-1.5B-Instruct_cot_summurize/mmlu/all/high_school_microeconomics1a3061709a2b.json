A superstar basketball player's $50 million earnings is an example of an economic rent because it is not earned through labor or effort but rather through the unique skill and abilities of the individual, which gives them a premium over other players in the market.\n\nB. A social security retirement income is an example of a transfer payment, such as unemployment insurance or child support, which are typically paid by the government and do not create economic rents.\n\nC. A welfare payment from social services is also an example of a transfer payment that does not create economic rents.\n\nD. A check to a college student from a parent or guardian is an example of an economic rent because it is earned through labor or effort, such as working part-time jobs to pay for tuition and living expenses."
