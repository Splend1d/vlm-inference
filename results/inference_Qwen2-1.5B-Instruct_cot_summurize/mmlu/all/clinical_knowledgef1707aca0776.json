These fibers are more efficient at generating power and endurance, but they require a higher level of oxygen and nutrients for recovery.\n\nType II fibers (also known as fast-twitch glycolytic fibers) are less efficient at generating power but are more resistant to fatigue. They are often found in larger quantities in muscles that perform tasks that require rapid contractions, such as jumping or kicking.\n\nType III fibers (also known as slow-twitch fibers) are less active during short bursts of activity and are more efficient at generating slow, sustained contractions. They are found in most of the body's muscles and are responsible for the majority of daily movement.\n\nSo, based on your options, the correct answer would be A. Type I fibers."
