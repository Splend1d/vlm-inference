If A and C are connected, then B is connected.\n\n- A is a proper subset of B: Since A is connected, it means there exists at least one path between any two points in A. Similarly, for B to be connected, we need to ensure that there exist paths connecting every pair of points in B as well. However, since A is a proper subset of B, this condition is satisfied automatically because if point x is not in A, then there must be some path from x to an element of A (since A is a proper subset), which would form part of the path from x to some other point in B. Therefore, B is also connected.\n\nII. If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\n\n- A is a proper subset of B: This condition implies that both A and B have finite subcoverings. In topology, a cover is said to be a collection of sets whose union equals the whole space. A finite subcollection of a cover ensures that the whole cover can be covered by finitely many elements of the subcollection. Thus, if A is compact, it has a finite subcover. Similarly, B also has a finite subcover because A is a proper subset of B. Therefore, B is compact.\n\nIII. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\n\n- A is a proper subset of B: This condition implies that both A and B have separation axioms (like being Hausdorff). Separation axiom means that for any two distinct points x and y in A or B, there exist disjoint open sets U_x and V_y containing x and y respectively. Since A is a proper subset of B, it follows that B contains all the points in A and possibly more. Hence, for any two distinct points x and y in B, they will either be contained in different components of the separation of A or they will belong to different components of the separation of B. Thus, B is Hausdorff.\n\nCombining these results, we see that statements I and II are both true, and statement III is also true. Therefore, the correct answer is D. I, II, and III."
