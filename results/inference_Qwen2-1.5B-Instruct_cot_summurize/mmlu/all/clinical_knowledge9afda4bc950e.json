Additionally, rectal cancer is not necessarily the most common cause of rectal bleeding. However, the statement that \"rectal cancer is the commonest cause of rectal bleeding\" is generally true and can lead to significant complications if left untreated. It is important for patients with rectal bleeding to undergo proper evaluation and treatment, which may include a colonoscopy, endoscopy, or biopsy depending on the underlying cause."
