Once the connection is made, the entire file is sent.\n\nWhen a user enters a web address in their browser, the browser sends a HTTP request to the server asking for the requested file. This request is typically done over an internet connection. The server then sends back a response containing the file that was requested by the browser. This process involves sending data through multiple layers of servers, including load balancers and firewalls, before reaching the final destination.\n\nOnce the file has been received at the end point (e.g., the user's computer), it can be accessed and downloaded as needed. However, if the connection between the user's computer and the server is not established or fails during this process, the browser will typically display an error message indicating that the connection could not be established. In this case, the file would need to be retrieved from another source or attempted again later."
