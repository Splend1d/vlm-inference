None of the above.\n\nAugustine argues that all created things are inherently flawed and imperfect, and that this is why they cannot be considered eternal or unchangingly good. He believes that while some things may appear to be good when taken individually, their true goodness lies in their relationship with God and their ultimate purpose in life. Therefore, Augustine does not believe that all created things are eternally and unchangeably good."
