The inequality given here suggests that adding more information about one variable (\\(x\\)) does not necessarily make specifying its value easier for a given amount of information about another variable (\\(y\\)). In other words, if knowing more about \\(y\\) (the marginal entropy of \\(y\\)) makes it harder to determine the value of \\(x\\), then \\(H[x, y]\\) will be greater than or equal to \\(H[x] + H[y]\\).\n\nThis is correct because when you know more about one variable, this can potentially reduce the uncertainty associated with the second variable. However, this only holds true for situations where there's no direct dependency between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). If \\(x\\) depends on \\(y\\), then knowing more about \\(y\\) could actually increase the uncertainty about \\(x\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is **False**.\n\nStatement 2: \"For some directed graphs, moralization decreases the number of edges present in the graph.\"\n\nMoralization in the context of graph theory refers to the process of adding edges between vertices such that every vertex has an even degree (i.e., all vertices have the same number of incoming and outgoing edges). This is done to ensure that the resulting graph is connected but also has as few edges as possible, which can sometimes lead to fewer cycles.\n\nIn terms of the number of edges, moralization might indeed decrease the total number of edges in a graph by creating new connections without increasing the overall connectivity of the graph. However, the impact of moralization on the number of edges is highly dependent on the specific graph structure and the desired properties of the graph.\n\nSince the question asks whether moralization decreases the number of edges in general, and based on the analysis above, it seems likely that moralization may indeed lead to a reduction in the number of edges, particularly in certain cases. However, without more specific examples or conditions, it's difficult to definitively say that moralization will always result in fewer edges in all cases. Therefore, the answer is **True**, but the exact implications depend on the specifics of the situation.\n\nSo, the correct choice would be **B. False, False**."
