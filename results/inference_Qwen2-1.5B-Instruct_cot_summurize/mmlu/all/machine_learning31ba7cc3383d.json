In theory, a Gaussian kernel SVM (Gaussian process SVM) can model any complex separating hyperplane, as long as it has enough training data and the covariance matrix of the input features is positive semi-definite.\n\nC. Yes, for every kernel function used in a Support Vector Machine (SVM), one can obtain an equivalent closed-form basis expansion. This means that we can represent the decision boundary using a set of polynomials or other basis functions derived from the input features, which allows us to use techniques like kernel trick to improve computational efficiency.\n\nD. Overfitting in an SVM is not a function of the number of support vectors. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns, regardless of how many support vectors you have. The number of support vectors does not directly affect overfitting."
