Because the professor was such a popular and well-respected individual in the bar review industry, there was much speculation and interest concerning his termination. A reporter for the local law journal telephoned the bar review course's administrative director and inquired why the professor had been fired. The director told the reporter that the professor was fired because the president of the bar review course believed that the professor had embezzled money. The next day, the reporter wrote an article that was published by the law journal, which quoted the director and stated that the professor \"was fired because he had embezzled money. \" It was later learned that the professor was not responsible for any unlawful conduct and had not embezzled funds. If the professor asserts a defamation action against the law journal, he will most likely\n\nA. prevail, if the professor proves malice.\nB. prevail, if the newspaper was negligent in notascertaining whether the professor had actually embezzled any funds.\nC. not prevail, because the director was merely providing an opinion about the reason for the professor's termination.\nD. not prevail, because the law journal was merely repeating what it had been told by a source.\n"

The professor may prevail if the newspaper was negligent in not verifying whether the professor had actually embezzled any funds.\n\nMalice refers to intent to cause harm or damage to someone or something. Negligence, on the other hand, means failing to exercise reasonable care or diligence in performing one's duties. In this case, the reporter did not verify whether the professor had embezzled any funds before publishing the article. This negligence could potentially make the newspaper liable for defamation.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the professor must also prove actual malice, meaning that the defendant acted with knowledge or reckless disregard of the truth. Without proof of actual malice, the professor may still be able to recover damages for defamation, but they would have a lower chance of success than if the professor were able to prove actual malice."
