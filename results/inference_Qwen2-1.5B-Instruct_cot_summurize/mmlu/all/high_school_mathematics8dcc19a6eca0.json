Setting \\( f(x) = 0 \\) gives us:\n\\[ 0 = \\frac{(x - 2)^2 - 9}{3} \\]\nMultiplying both sides by 3:\n\\[ 0 = (x - 2)^2 - 9 \\]\nAdding 9 to both sides:\n\\[ 9 = (x - 2)^2 \\]\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\\[ 3 = |x - 2| \\]\nThis gives us two solutions: \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\). Thus, there are two x-intercepts at \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Y-intercept**: This occurs when \\( x = 0 \\):\n\\[ f(0) = \\frac{(0 - 2)^2 - 9}{3} = \\frac{-9}{3} = -3 \\]\n\nThe polygon is formed by connecting these points on the graph. To find its area, we can use the Shoelace Formula or recognize it as an equilateral triangle with side length 3.\n\nArea of an equilateral triangle = \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times (\\text{side length})^2\\)\n\nGiven that each side length of the equilateral triangle is 3, the area is:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 3^2 = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\]\n\nSimplifying this gives approximately:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\approx \\frac{9 \\times 1.732}{4} = \\frac{15.398}{4} = \\frac{15.398}{4} \\approx 3.8497 \\]\n\nThus, rounding to the nearest hundredth, the area of the polygon is approximately 3.85 square units. However, the question asks for the area in terms of fractions:\n\n**Correct Answer:** C. \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2465}}{9}\\)"
