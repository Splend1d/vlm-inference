The end of the Cold War created the space for security policy and security studies to be re-considered in light of growing environmental consciousness underlined by multilateralism in policy action.\nB. In 1973 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) restricted oil supplies which underlined the industrial capacity of the military leaving a profound psychological impact requiring that security be linked to national interests: the securing of energy deals and the environment became related to military capability diplomacy.\nC. Ideologically driven military security was replaced by a need to preserve territorial integrity in wake of the collapse of communism. Military security was a high priority given the threat of spill-over. The environment remained a peripheral concern to the security institutions occupied with the new security environment post-Cold War.\nD. The end of the Cold War order created the intellectual space for the broadening of security issues beyond Cold War military mentalities. Research among political and environmental scientists discussed ways in which new security issues could be addressed. The plethora of publications produced, however, had little effect on policy.\n"

The end of the Cold War created the space for security policy and security studies to be re-considered in light of growing environmental consciousness underlined by multilateralism in policy action.\n\nAs the Cold War came to an end, there was a shift towards greater awareness of environmental concerns. This led to a broader focus on security issues beyond just traditional military threats. Security policies began to take into account environmental factors, such as climate change and natural resource management. Multilateralism also played a role in this process, with countries coming together to address global challenges.\n\nThis shift towards environmental security perspectives has been reflected in various areas of security studies, including international relations, environmental law, and sustainable development. It has also influenced military strategy and planning, with increased attention to protecting ecosystems and natural resources from potential threats.\n\nOverall, the end of the Cold War provided the intellectual and political framework for a more holistic approach to security, one that took into account not only military and economic threats but also environmental ones."
