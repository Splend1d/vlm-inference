This implies that if unlimited property rights were accepted, there would be no way for individuals to agree on how to allocate resources and resolve conflicts without resorting to violence or chaos. Therefore, Wellman's position supports the idea that unlimited property rights can lead to anarchy. \n\nOption A (Deontology) refers to ethical principles based on duties and obligations, rather than consequences. Option B (Egalitarianism) focuses on promoting equal distribution of goods and resources, while not necessarily advocating for unlimited property rights. Option C (Consequentialism) involves evaluating actions based on their outcomes, but it does not imply that unlimited property rights are necessary to achieve this goal."
