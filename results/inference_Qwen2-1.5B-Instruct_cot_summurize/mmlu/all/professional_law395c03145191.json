In such cases, the property passes to the surviving spouse or children first, with any remaining property passing to the next-of-kin (usually a sibling) and then to the state as public land. \n\nIn this scenario, the husband's niece would inherit the property only if there are descendants left by the deceased husband's wife, who is also the husband's widow. If there are no descendants, the property would pass to the husband's wife's cousin, who is also the husband's sister-in-law. Therefore, her niece would receive nothing under these circumstances unless there are heirs of the deceased husband's wife."
