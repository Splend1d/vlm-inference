One night the customer was sitting at the bar and ordered a club soda. After serving him, the owner walked to the other end of the bar to wait on another customer. As he did so, the customer leaned over the bar and grabbed the gun. The customer pointed the gun at the owner and said, \"This is a robbery. . . hand over all your money. \"Knowing the gun was unloaded, the owner refused to comply. The customer dropped the gun and ran out of the bar. Besides larceny of the gun, the customer will be convicted of\n\nA. attempted larceny.\nB. attempted robbery.\nC. assault.\nD. assault and attempted larceny.\n"

In this case, the customer took the gun from the bar, which constitutes larceny.\n\nRobbery occurs when someone uses force or intimidation to take property from another person. In this case, the customer used fear (pointing the gun) to take the gun, which constitutes robbery.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the customer committed both larceny and robbery, they are not necessarily guilty of both crimes. The law considers whether an individual intended to commit one crime or the other. If the intent is clear and the crime was completed, then the person can only be charged with the most serious crime.\n\nIn this case, the customer intentionally threatened to use force against the owner, which suggests that they had the intention to rob the owner. Therefore, the customer would likely be charged with attempted robbery, even though they may have also been charged with attempted larceny for taking the gun."
