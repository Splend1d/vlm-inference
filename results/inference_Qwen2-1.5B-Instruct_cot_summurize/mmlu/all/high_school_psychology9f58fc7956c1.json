They are designed to provide a fair comparison between different groups of students, such as those who have been taught differently or from different cultural backgrounds. The direction of the test is not important, but it should be standardized (i.e., all students take the same test). Norms, which indicate average, high, and low scores for the test, are also important because they help to identify how well students performed relative to their peers. Finally, standardized tests can be used to compare a student's performance with that of a larger group of students who have taken similar tests before."
