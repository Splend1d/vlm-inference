Some mutations produce alleles that are recessive and may not be expressed. While recessive mutations can be rare, it does not necessarily mean that the frequency of mutation is low. In fact, some recessive mutations can have significant effects on the phenotype and contribute to the evolution of new species. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer. \n\nOption B is also incorrect because while undesirable phenotypic traits may be prevented from reproducing, this does not necessarily result in a low frequency of mutation. Some mutations may still be beneficial or neutral, depending on their effect on the organism's fitness.\n\nOption C is also not correct because while extreme phenotypic changes may remove certain alleles from the gene pool, this does not necessarily lead to a low frequency of mutation. It depends on how many other genes are present and how often they mutate.\n\nOption D is the most likely reason for the low frequency of mutation appearing to be due to the statement D. Predictable rates of mutation result in ongoing variability in a gene pool. As more variation occurs, there will be more opportunities for different mutations to occur, leading to increased genetic diversity and potentially higher frequencies of advantageous mutations over time. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."
