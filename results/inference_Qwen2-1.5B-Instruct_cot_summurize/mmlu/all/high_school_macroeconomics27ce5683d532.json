GDP measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within an economy over a specific period of time (usually one year). It includes both private consumption, government spending, net exports, and investment. The purchase of stocks involves buying financial assets that do not produce any physical output or have a direct impact on the production process.\n\nTherefore, buying XYZ Corporation's shares does not affect GDP since it only represents money spent on purchasing financial instruments rather than tangible goods or services."
