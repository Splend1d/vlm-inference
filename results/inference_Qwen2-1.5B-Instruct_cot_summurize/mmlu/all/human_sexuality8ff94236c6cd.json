This theory has been influential in the development of modern evolutionary psychology, including theories about the origins of gender differences such as sex differences in behavior and brain structure. The theory of sexual selection is also used by sociobiologists to explain the evolution of gender differences, particularly in terms of how these differences may arise from competition for resources or access to mates."
