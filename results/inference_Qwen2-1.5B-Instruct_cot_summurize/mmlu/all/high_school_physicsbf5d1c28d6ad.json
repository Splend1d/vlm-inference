However, if we consider negative angles, we get:\n\n\\[ \\theta = -\\arccos(\\sin(\\theta)) = -\\arccos(-\\cos(\\theta)) = \\arcsin(\\cos(\\theta)) \\]\n\nTherefore, the angle \\( \\theta \\) that maximizes the range must be \\( \\arcsin(\\cos(\\theta)) \\), which is not directly related to any of the options provided. \n\nHowever, looking at the correct answer choices, none of them are equivalent to the arctangent function of \\( \\theta \\), but rather they are related to trigonometric functions or their inverses in different ways. \n\nBased on the context of projectiles, it seems more likely that the question was intended to ask about the angle \\( \\theta \\) such that the range equals the maximum vertical distance achieved during flight. In this case, the correct angle would be one where the range is exactly equal to the maximum height reached. This happens at the apex of the parabola, where \\( \\theta \\) is \\( 45^\\circ \\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 45\u00b0."
