Gloves can be used if they are sterile, but they should not be used on their own to clean the mouth as they may introduce bacteria into the mouth. Forceps may also be used to remove food particles from between teeth, but they should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Foam sticks may be used to clean the tongue, but they should not be used to clean the mouth as they can cause irritation."
