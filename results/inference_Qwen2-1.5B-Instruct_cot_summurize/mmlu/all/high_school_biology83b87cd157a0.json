Genetic drift\n\nGenetic drift refers to the random fluctuations in allele frequencies within a population due to chance events, such as migration or natural disasters like hurricanes that move populations around. In this scenario, the hurricane moving the birds around could lead to different genetic combinations being exposed more frequently, leading to changes in the gene pool over time. This process does not involve directed mutations or disruptive selection but can result in adaptive radiation if certain genes confer survival advantages on the bird species."
