Soft determinism, also known as soft realism or soft functionalism, suggests that while humans have some degree of freedom and autonomy, they are still subject to certain constraints and limitations imposed by their environment and biological nature. This does not mean that people can choose their desires or that there are no restraints on human behavior, but rather that these factors play a role in shaping individuals' actions and decisions. Therefore, option A (we are free to choose our desires) is incorrect. Option B (there are no restraints on human behavior) is also incorrect because even within soft determinism, there are often limits to what humans can do. Option C (the thesis of determinism is false) is incorrect because it goes against the core tenet of determinism, which states that all events, including human behavior, are determined by prior causes."
