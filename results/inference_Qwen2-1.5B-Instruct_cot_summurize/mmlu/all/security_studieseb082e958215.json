NGOs can help to raise awareness about the potential negative impacts of weapons sales and encourage governments to adopt more responsible policies and practices. They can also provide technical assistance and expertise to support arms control efforts, such as through research and advocacy work. While there may be challenges in engaging with certain stakeholders, NGOs can still make valuable contributions to the debate around arms control and disarmament."
