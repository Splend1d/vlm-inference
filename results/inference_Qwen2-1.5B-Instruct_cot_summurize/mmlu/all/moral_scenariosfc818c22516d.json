According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, burying an animal that has died naturally and peacefully is generally considered acceptable behavior. On the other hand, pouring vegetable oil into a cooker can be seen as harmful or dangerous if done recklessly or without proper safety precautions, and therefore may be considered morally wrong. However, both actions can also be seen as unintentional and accidental, so they may not necessarily meet the criteria for being truly morally wrong."
