All four statements are true.\n\nStatement i) is true because separate applications of OLS to each equation can provide valid estimators for the parameters of the individual equations.\nStatement ii) is also true because the independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in other equations, even if the errors themselves are uncorrelated.\nStatement iii) is true because an application of 2SLS would lead to unbiased but inefficient parameter estimates. This is because the 2SLS estimator is not BLUE (best linear unbiased estimator) and it is inefficient due to its dependence on the correlation between the error terms.\nStatement iv) is true because the independent variables may be correlated with the error terms in the equations in which they appear as independent variables. In this case, the error terms will have a higher variance than in the original model, leading to biased but efficient parameter estimates."
