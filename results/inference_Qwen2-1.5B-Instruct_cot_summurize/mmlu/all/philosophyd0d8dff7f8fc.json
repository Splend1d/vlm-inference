Simply doing whatever everyone else does without thinking about why we should do what we do can hardly be thought of as worthwhile, noble, or admirable.\n\nThis quote from Socrates suggests that there is value in critically examining one's own life and actions, rather than simply accepting them as given. It implies that a meaningful life involves more than just going through the motions and following others' lead. Rather, it requires self-reflection, critical thinking, and a willingness to question one's own beliefs and values. This idea aligns well with the concept of personal responsibility and individualism, which are values that have been emphasized throughout Western history."
