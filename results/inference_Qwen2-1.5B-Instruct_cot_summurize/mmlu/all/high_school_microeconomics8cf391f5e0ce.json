A decrease in the average number of children per household\n\nThis is because an increase in the average number of children per household would lead to more demand for kindergarten teachers as there would be more children needing education. On the other hand, a decrease in the average number of children per household would suggest that fewer children are being educated, which would lead to less demand for kindergarten teachers. \n\nAn increase in funding for education and subsidies given to college students who major in elementary education may also increase the demand for kindergarten teachers, but they are not directly related to the decrease in the average number of children per household. Similarly, increased immigration of foreign citizens and their families may also increase the demand for kindergarten teachers if there are enough positions available. However, this is not a direct effect of the decrease in the average number of children per household."
