Do students majoring in computer science tend to have higher grade point averages than students majoring in other subjects? \n\nThis question can be answered by analyzing only the data set because it asks for a comparison between two groups of students (students majoring in computer science and students majoring in other subjects) based on their grades. By looking at the data, we can determine whether the average GPA of computer science majors is higher or lower than the average GPA of other subject majors.\n\nOption B is not possible because it asks for a count, but the data set does not provide this information.\n\nOption C is also not possible because it asks for a percentage, but the data set does not provide this information either.\n\nOption D is not possible because it asks for a specific college, but the data set does not contain information on the number of students attending each college."
