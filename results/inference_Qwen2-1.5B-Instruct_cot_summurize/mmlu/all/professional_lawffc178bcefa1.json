At the college student's trial for assault, the prosecution called one of the college student's classmates to testify. The classmate was not at the bar during the fight. The classmate offered to testify that the next day at class, he approached the college student and said, \"It was wrong of you to start a fight with the man over a game of pool,\" at which point, the college student bowed his head and walked away.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, statements made by a person other than a party to the lawsuit cannot be used against them in court unless they fall under one of the exceptions listed in Rule 803 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. In this case, the classmate's statement would only be admissible if it falls under one of the exceptions such as a statement against interest or a statement made under belief of impending death. However, since the classmate did not witness the incident and was not present at the bar where the fight occurred, their testimony cannot be used to prove what happened. Therefore, the answer is C. inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception."
