It occurs when there is a decrease in muscle mass and strength due to loss of muscle fibers and muscle atrophy. This can lead to weakness, fatigue, and difficulty performing daily activities. In this patient's case, she has Parkinson disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, which are both associated with sarcopenia. Therefore, further evaluation for sarcopenia may be indicated."
