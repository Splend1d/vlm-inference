                    "text": "The collision between the two carts is an elastic collision, which means that there is no loss of kinetic energy during the collision.\n\nLet's denote the velocities of the small cart before and after the collision as $u$ and $v$, respectively. Since the collision is elastic, the total momentum before and after the collision is conserved:\n\n$$\n\\text{Initial momentum} = \\text{Final momentum}\n$$\n\nFor the small cart:\n$$\nm u + m v = (m + 4m) v'\n$$\n\nSimplifying this equation gives us:\n$$\nu + v = 5v'\n$$\n\nNow let's consider the final state of the system. After the collision, the large cart gains some kinetic energy from the small cart, and the small cart loses all its kinetic energy to the large cart. Let's denote the final velocity of the small cart as $v'$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\nm u = (m + 4m)v'\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $u + v$ from above into this equation gives us:\n$$\nm u = (5m)v'\n$$\n\nRearranging terms gives us:\n$$\nv' = \\frac{u}{5}\n$$\n\nSince the initial velocity of the small cart was $u$, it follows that the final velocity of the small cart is $\\frac{u}{5}$ or $0.2u$. However, since we're asked to find the final velocity of the small cart in terms of $v$, we can't simply use this result directly. Instead, we need to recognize that the problem asks for the velocity of the small cart after the collision, not just the ratio of their velocities.\n\nFrom the conservation of momentum, we know that the small cart's velocity after the collision should be equal to the larger cart's final velocity divided by 5. Thus, the final velocity of the small cart is:\n$$\nv' = \\frac{v}{5}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 2v**."
