This is because the law allows defendants to bring claims for contribution and indemnity, which means that if one defendant is found to be partially or wholly responsible for the plaintiff's damages, they may be required to pay a portion of those damages to the other defendant who is not at fault. However, if the furniture store was fully insured against such losses, then it would have no recourse against its employee for any potential losses."
