However, it is not exactly 0.13 since we have rounded it up for simplicity in our calculation.\n\nRounding 0.133 up to the nearest whole number gives us 0.13. Rounding 0.13 down to the nearest whole number gives us 0.13. Therefore, the correct answer is either 0.13 or 0.13, depending on whether you prefer rounding up or down. In this case, I'll round it down to the nearest whole number for consistency with the problem statement.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 0.95."
