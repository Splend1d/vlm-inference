We have:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[(1 + e^{-x})^{-1}\\right] = -1 \\cdot \\left[(1 + e^{-x})^{-2}\\right] \\cdot (-e^{-x}) = \\frac{e^{-x}}{(1 + e^{-x})^2}.$$\nNow, let $B \\sim \\text{Bern}(\\sigma(x))$, where $\\sigma(x) = (1 + e^{-x})^{-1}$. Then,\n$$P(B=1) = P(X \\leq 0) = F(0) = \\int_0^0 (1 + e^{-t})^{-1} dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-t} dt = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-0}} = \\frac{1}{2},$$\nand\n$$P(B=-1) = P(X \\geq 0) = 1 - F(0) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}.$$ \nTherefore, the expected value of $B$ is $E[B] = P(B=1)P(B=1) + P(B=-1)P(B=-1) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which matches our previous calculation for the mean of the Bernoulli distribution.\nHowever, statement 2 is false. Setting the bias parameters in each layer of a neural network to 0 does not change the bias-variance trade-off. In fact, setting the bias parameters to zero would result in a fully connected network, which has no bias terms at all. This would lead to an underfitting problem as there would be no way to learn any non-linear relationships between the input features and the output. Instead, increasing the number of hidden layers or neurons per layer can help reduce overfitting by adding more flexibility to the model."
