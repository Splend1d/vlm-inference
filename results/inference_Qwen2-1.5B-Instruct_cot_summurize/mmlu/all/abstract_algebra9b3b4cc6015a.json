In this case, we have $\\mathbb{Z}_7 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, which means that the elements of the field are the integers from 0 to 6, inclusive.\n\nTo find the generator for $\\mathbb{Z}_7$, we need to find an element in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$ whose order divides $|G(\\mathbb{Z}_7)|$, which is the number of elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$. The order of an element $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_7$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $a^k \\equiv 1 \\mod p$, where $p$ is the characteristic of the field.\n\nIn our case, since $p=7$ (the characteristic of $\\mathbb{Z}_7$), we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p$. This implies that the order of any element in $\\mathbb{Z}_7$ must be a divisor of $6$ (since there are only 6 possible remainders when dividing by 7).\n\nWe can check each option:\n\n- Option A: $1$ has order $6$ because $1^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$.\n- Option B: $2$ does not divide $6$ because $2^3 \\not\\equiv 1 \\mod 7$.\n- Option C: $3$ has order $2$ because $3^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$.\n- Option D: $4$ has order $3$ because $4^3 \\equiv 1 \\mod 7$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 3**."
