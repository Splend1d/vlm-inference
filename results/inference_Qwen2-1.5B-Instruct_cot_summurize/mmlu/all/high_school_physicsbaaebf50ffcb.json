                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The satellite's new orbit will be an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth.\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhen a meteor collides with the satellite and increases its speed by 1%, it means that the change in momentum (which is equal to the mass times the change in velocity) caused by the collision is 1% of the initial momentum of the satellite. Since the satellite was initially moving in a circular orbit around Earth, we can assume that its initial velocity was along the radial line from the center of Earth to the satellite. Therefore, the change in velocity during the collision is perpendicular to this radial line.\n\nLet's denote the original radius of the satellite's orbit as \\(r_0\\) and its initial speed as \\(v_0\\). After the collision, the satellite has gained some additional speed, say \\(\\Delta v = 0.01v_0\\), which is perpendicular to the radial line connecting the satellite to Earth.\n\nNow, let's consider the change in the angle between the satellite's velocity vector and the direction towards Earth after the collision. This angle is given by the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, since the dot product of these vectors is zero (since they are perpendicular):\n\n\\[\n\\cos(\\theta_{new}) = \\frac{|\\text{velocity}_\\text{new}|}{|\\text{radius}_{new} \\times \\text{speed}_\\text{new}|}\n\\]\n\nAfter the collision, the velocity vector points slightly away from Earth, so the denominator of the fraction becomes negative. However, we need to find the magnitude of the velocity vector to determine the new radius. We know that the change in velocity is due to the increase in speed and the change in direction. Since the change in speed is 1% of the initial speed, the change in velocity is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta v = 0.01v_0 = \\frac{v_0}{100}\n\\]\n\nThis change in velocity is also perpendicular to the direction towards Earth, so it does not affect the magnitude of the velocity vector itself. Instead, it affects the direction of the velocity vector relative to Earth. Therefore, the new velocity vector will have a component directed away from Earth, while the other component remains parallel to Earth's surface. The distance from Earth's surface to the satellite's new position will therefore be less than the original radius of the orbit, resulting in a smaller semi-major axis for the ellipse.\n\nThus, the satellite's new orbit will be an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth. The correct option is B."
