Neurons firing more intensely - This is incorrect because it would require an increase in neural activity and this is unlikely since there was no change in intensity of the original sound.\nB. Increased secretions by the pituitary gland - This is also incorrect as this is related to body temperature regulation, which is unrelated to the sound being heard.\nC. Changing frequency of sound waves - This is incorrect as the driver's actions did not cause any changes in the frequency of sound waves being heard.\nD. More neurons firing more frequently - This is correct because when the driver increases the volume of her radio, it amplifies the sound being heard. Since the number of neurons firing (and therefore their frequency) is proportional to the amplitude of the signal, this causes an increase in perceived sound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. More neurons firing more frequently."
