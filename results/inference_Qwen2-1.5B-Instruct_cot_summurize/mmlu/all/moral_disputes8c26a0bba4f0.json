All of the above.\n\nLukianoff and Haidt believe that American colleges and universities have become more focused on promoting emotional intelligence and critical thinking skills, which they argue can lead to better decision-making in society. They suggest that this shift has led to a greater emphasis on emotional reasoning rather than logical or rational reasoning, as well as a decreased focus on traditional forms of critical thinking such as analyzing arguments critically and evaluating evidence thoroughly. Therefore, they argue that American colleges and universities should instead encourage reflective reasoning, which combines both emotional and critical thinking skills to make informed decisions."
