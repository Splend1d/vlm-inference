I, II, and III\n\nRaoult's Law states that the partial pressure of a component in a binary liquid mixture is directly proportional to its mole fraction (x) in the mixture. This means that:\n\nP1 = P2 = k(x1 + x2)\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are the partial pressures of the two components, and k is a constant of proportionality. Therefore, option I is true.\n\nThe volume of the mixture can be calculated using the ideal gas law or by assuming it behaves as an ideal gas under the same conditions as the individual components. Since Raoult's Law applies to all phases, including liquids, it does not matter whether we consider the mixture in a solid phase or a liquid phase. So, option II is also true.\n\nIntermolecular interactions in a mixture will be influenced by both the chemical properties of the components and their physical properties, such as temperature and pressure. However, since Raoult's Law focuses on the behavior of components in a liquid mixture, options III and IV do not necessarily apply here. Therefore, the correct answer is D. I, II, and III."
