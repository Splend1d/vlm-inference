Smaller DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do larger DNA fragments on gel electrophoresis.\n\nGel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate and analyze DNA or other biological molecules based on their size and charge. The migration speed of different DNA fragments depends on factors such as their size, charge, and the concentration of charged solutes (such as sodium dodecyl sulfate) used in the gel. Therefore, smaller DNA fragments will migrate faster than larger ones due to their increased mobility through the gel."
