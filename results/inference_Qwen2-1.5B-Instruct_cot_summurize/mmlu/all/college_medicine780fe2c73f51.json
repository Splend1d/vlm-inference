Intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, horizontal mobility, upward mobility.\n\nThis scenario describes an example of vertical (upward) mobility within the family, where the son's position in education and career progression has been influenced by his father's occupation and educational background. The son went from being a bricklayer's son to becoming a professor, which represents an upward social mobility. Additionally, the fact that he moved to another state for a new job demonstrates horizontal mobility because he was not moving up in his own home city or region but rather to a new location. Therefore, the answer is D."
