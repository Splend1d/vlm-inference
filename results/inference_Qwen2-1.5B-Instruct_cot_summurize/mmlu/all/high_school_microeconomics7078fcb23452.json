                    "text": "D. The long run supply curve is more inelastic.\n\nThe correct answer is D because the long run supply curve, also known as the aggregate supply curve, is typically more elastic than the short run supply curve. This means that when a firm increases its output, it can sell more units at each price level without significantly affecting its total revenue. Therefore, if firms have the ability to enter and exit a market over time, they will be able to adjust their production levels quickly and efficiently, leading to a less elastic long run supply curve."
