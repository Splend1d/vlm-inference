However, since there is no shipping cost for this special order, the net effect of the fixed licensing fee ($50,000) on the profit margin needs to be considered as well:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Fixed Licensing Fee}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\$200,000 - \\$50,000}{\\$200,000} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{\\$150,000}{\\$200,000} \\times 100\\% = 75\\% \\]\n\nWith a 75% net profit margin, the lowest price per unit that Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno to cover their losses while maintaining a positive net profit margin is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Price per Unit} = \\frac{\\text{Total Revenue}}{\\text{Number of Units Sold}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{\\$200,000}{5000} \\times 100\\% = \\$400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is not directly provided in your options but rather calculated correctly to be $400 per unit. The correct answer is D. $400."
