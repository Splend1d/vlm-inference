                    "text": "Late one evening, a police department received a telephone call from an unidentified woman who reported hearing loud shrieks and screams from a neighboring home. The caller furnished the police with the address where the disturbance was taking place. When the police arrived at the home, they discovered the homeowner, bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon was a blood-stained baseball bat found near the victim's body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the homeowner had recently been separated from her husband who had since moved to another city. After questioning several of the victim's friends and relatives, the police concluded that the husband was a prime suspect in the murder. Thus, two detectives went to question the husband about the killing. When they arrived at his apartment, the detectives persuaded the landlord to let them into his apartment. Finding no one inside, they searched the apartment. Before leaving, the detectives took a box of cereal, which they planned to use for a fingerprint comparison. The prints from the cereal box matched those found on the baseball bat. The police provided the grand jury investigating the murder with the fingerprint comparison. The husband is subsequently subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Before his scheduled appearance, the husband files a motion to suppress evidence of the fingerprint comparison, contending that the evidence was illegally obtained. His motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the warrantless search of the husband's apartment was unconstitutional.\nB. granted, because the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence.\nC. denied, because the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings.\nD. denied, because the landlord had the apparent authority to authorize the search of the husband's apartment.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B: granted, because the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence.\n\nUnder the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the government must obtain a warrant before it can search a person's home or vehicle. If a warrant is not issued, any evidence obtained as a result of the search may be suppressed (inadmissible) in court. In this case, the police conducted a warrantless search of the husband's apartment without obtaining a warrant. Therefore, the evidence obtained during the search may be considered illegally obtained by the grand jury and suppressed under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nHowever, there is a notable exception to this rule. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that \"No person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself self.\" This means that individuals have the right to refuse to testify if doing so would incriminate themselves. In this case, the husband's testimony could potentially incriminate him, but he has a constitutional right to refuse to testify.\n\nTherefore, while the husband's motion to suppress the fingerprint comparison may be granted based on the illegality of the search, the motion to exclude the evidence from being used against him in the grand jury proceeding will likely be denied, because the Fifth Amendment protects him from testifying against himself even if it would otherwise be admissible."
