For example, a study published in the Journal of Applied Psychology found that employees who worked five days per week had higher job satisfaction and lower turnover rates than those who worked six days per week. However, this study also found that after three months, employees who worked six days per week reported lower job satisfaction and increased turnover rates compared to those who worked five days per week.\n\nAdditionally, a study published in the Journal of Management found that companies that implemented a compressed workweek saw an increase in employee engagement and productivity for the first few weeks, but over time, they experienced a decline in both. This suggests that while there may be short-term benefits from implementing a compressed workweek, the long-term impacts on attitudes and productivity are likely to be negative.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct answer."
