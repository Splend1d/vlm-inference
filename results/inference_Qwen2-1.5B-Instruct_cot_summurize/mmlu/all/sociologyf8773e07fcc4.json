Marx believed that as the working class became more organized and productive, they would become a powerful force that could overthrow the capitalist system and establish a new society based on communism. He argued that this transformation would result in a new type of class, known as the \"ruling class,\" which would control the means of production and have complete power over society. Therefore, the development of factory-based production turned the working class into a ruling class."
