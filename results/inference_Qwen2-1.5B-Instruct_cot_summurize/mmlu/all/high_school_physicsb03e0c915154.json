This means that the voltage across each resistor remains constant, but the current through each resistor decreases proportionally to its resistance. Therefore, the total current in the circuit increases as more resistors are added in parallel. \n\nIn contrast, when resistors are arranged in series, the total resistance of the circuit decreases because each resistor adds to the overall resistance by shortening the path for current flow. This means that the voltage across each resistor remains constant, but the current through each resistor also increases proportionally to its resistance. Therefore, the total current in the circuit decreases as more resistors are added in series.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B."
