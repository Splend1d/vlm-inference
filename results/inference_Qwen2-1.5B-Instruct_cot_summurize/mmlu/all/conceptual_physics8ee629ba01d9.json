This reflection can occur both directly and indirectly, depending on the angle of incidence. In some cases, the light may be absorbed by the material, leading to the conversion of the incident light into heat or other forms of energy within the material. \n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer. Options B, C, and D do not accurately describe how light behaves when it interacts with an opaque surface. Option B suggests that most of the light is being reflected, which is incorrect. Option C suggests that most of the light is being refracted, which is also incorrect. Option D suggests that the light is being transmitted at a lower frequency, which is again incorrect."
