Radial cleavage occurs when cells divide in a direction perpendicular to their long axis, which results in cleavage planes that are parallel to the cell membrane and lie along the polar axis of the cell. This type of cleavage is characteristic of most eukaryotic cells, including those with cleavage planes that lie along the polar axis."
