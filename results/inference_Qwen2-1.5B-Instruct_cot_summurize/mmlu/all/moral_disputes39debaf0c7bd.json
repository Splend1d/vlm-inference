In his work, he argues that the harms associated with drug use can be justified by considering them as part of a broader social problem that requires intervention.\n\nIn this context, the question of whether or not state prohibition of drug use justifies it becomes less clear-cut than might first appear. On one hand, there is certainly evidence to suggest that drug use can have negative consequences for individuals who engage in it, including addiction, mental illness, and other health problems. These harms may justify some level of regulation or control over drug use.\n\nOn the other hand, however, it is also important to consider the potential benefits of drug use in certain contexts, such as medical research or cultural expression. It is possible that some forms of drug use could be seen as beneficial or necessary, even if they are harmful overall.\n\nUltimately, the justification for state prohibition of drug use will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific harms associated with drug use, the goals of policymakers and law enforcement agencies, and the broader social and political context in which these decisions are made."
