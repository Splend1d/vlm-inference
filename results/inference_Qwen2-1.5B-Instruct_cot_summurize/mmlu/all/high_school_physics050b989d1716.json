This is because the charged spheres are attracted to each other due to their opposite electrical charges. However, this attraction is stronger than the repulsive forces between the conductors, so the spheres do not experience a strong repulsive force from each other. Therefore, they will attract rather than repel. \n\nThis is known as the Van der Waals force."
