The buccal surfaces of the upper molars and lingual surfaces of the lower incisors.\n\nDental plaque is most likely to accumulate on these surfaces because they are exposed during eating and brushing, allowing bacteria to adhere to the teeth and form a biofilm that can lead to tooth decay and gum disease if not removed regularly. Additionally, the presence of food particles and saliva on these surfaces increases the likelihood of bacterial colonization and plaque accumulation."
