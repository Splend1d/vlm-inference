The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is also believed to have originated in bats. This suggests that bats may play a role in the emergence and spread of these highly pathogenic viruses. However, it's important to note that other animal species can also carry and transmit these viruses, so the specific source or reservoir of an outbreak cannot always be definitively determined."
