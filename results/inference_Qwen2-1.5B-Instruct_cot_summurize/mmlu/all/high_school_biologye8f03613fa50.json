Crossing-over occurs during prophase of meiosis I and results in the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, but it does not result in new genetic combinations being introduced into the gametes. Instead, crossing-over allows for the creation of recombinant DNA molecules, which can be used to create new genes through genetic engineering techniques such as PCR or CRISPR-Cas9."
