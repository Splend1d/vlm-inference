In order to rebut the presumption that the services rendered were gratuitous, since the nephew was a relative of his uncle, the nephew called his sister-in-law as a witness. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. The sister-in-law testified that she had lived in the nephew's house, knew his uncle, and that she was familiar with the uncle's handwriting. The nephew's attorney asked her to look at a letter and to tell the court whether it was written by the uncle. Upon objection by the attorney for the administrator of the estate, the trial judge would most likely\n\nA. sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law is not a handwriting expert.\nB. sustain the objection, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\nC. overrule the objection, because the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded, an exception to the hearsay rule.\nD. overrule the objection, because an authenticating witness need not be an expert if familiar with the handwriting of the person in question.\n"

Overrule the objection, because an authenticating witness need not be an expert if familiar with the handwriting of the person in question.\n\nThe Dead Man's Statute, also known as the Rule Against Perpetuities, applies only when there is no living witness who can testify to the authenticity of a document or signature. However, if an authenticating witness is familiar with the handwriting of the person in question, they may still testify about the document or signature without violating the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nIn this case, the sister-in-law is familiar with the handwriting of her brother-in-law (the nephew), so she could be used as an authenticating witness to authenticate the letter presented to the court. Therefore, the trial judge should overrule the objection and allow the sister-in-law to testify about the letter."
