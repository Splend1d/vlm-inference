Auscultation of the chest discloses clear lungs; cardiac examination discloses a systolic click. Neurologic examination shows decreased muscle tone. Serum electrolyte concentrations are normal. Complete blood count shows a leukocyte count of 18,000/mm3 with 23% band neutrophils. The patient's caregiver, who is also the patient's guardian, cannot be located and staff at the group home where the patient resides cannot be reached by telephone. The patient refuses lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid. Toxicologic screening of the urine is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA.

Obtain CT scan of the head\n\nThe patient exhibits symptoms consistent with encephalopathy, which can occur in individuals with Down syndrome due to underlying neurological disorders or metabolic issues. A CT scan can help diagnose specific causes such as hydrocephalus or brain tumors, which could have been missed during a previous evaluation. This would allow for early intervention and treatment options tailored to the patient's specific condition."
