Audit the service organization's controls, assess risk, and prepare the audit plan.\n\nWhen an audit client uses a service organization for several processes, it is important for the user auditor to conduct an audit of the service organization's controls to ensure they are effective in meeting the client's requirements. This will help the user auditor identify any potential issues or risks that may impact the client's operations and services provided by the service organization.\n\nAdditionally, the user auditor should assess the risk associated with the use of a service organization and develop an audit plan that addresses these risks. The audit plan should also consider the specific processes being performed by the service organization and the controls that need to be reviewed and tested.\n\nOverall, conducting an audit of the service organization's controls, assessing risk, and preparing an audit plan will provide the user auditor with the information needed to efficiently perform the audit while ensuring the effectiveness of the service organization's controls."
