The exchange rate between pesos and U.S. dollars is 0.1099 USD per peso, so the cost in U.S. dollars is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost in USD} = 116.50 \\times 0.1099 = 13.2685 \\]\n\nThe selling price in Euros is 20 EUR. The exchange rate between euros and U.S. dollars is 0.8928 USD per euro, so the selling price in U.S. dollars is:\n\\[ \\text{Selling Price in USD} = 20 \\times 0.8928 = 17.856 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit by subtracting the cost from the selling price:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Selling Price in USD} - \\text{Cost in USD} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 17.856 - 13.2685 = 4.588 \\]\n\nTherefore, the profit on the sale is approximately 4.588 U.S. dollars, which corresponds to choice B: $6.11."
