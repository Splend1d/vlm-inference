The woman became suspicious and told the man that she wanted to engage an accounting firm to audit the agency's books. In a panic to prevent the audit and avoid being discovered, the man decided to have the woman killed. He contacted a professional killer and hired him to kill the woman for $10,000. A short time later, the woman died in a car crash arranged by the killer. In addition to embezzlement, of what crime or crimes may the man properly be convicted?\n\nA. Conspiracy and murder.\nB.

Solicitation, conspiracy, and murder.\n\nThe man and the woman were partners in an automobile leasing agency, so they had a mutual interest in preventing the audit of their accounts. However, the man decided to hire a professional killer to eliminate the woman to prevent any potential discovery of his embezzlement. This shows that he was involved in both soliciting the killing and conspiring with the killer to carry it out. Additionally, the fact that the woman was killed in a car crash arranged by the killer suggests that there was a direct link between the two events and that the man intended to cause her death as part of his scheme to cover up his embezzlement. Therefore, the man can be charged with solicitation and conspiracy to commit murder, as well as murder itself."
