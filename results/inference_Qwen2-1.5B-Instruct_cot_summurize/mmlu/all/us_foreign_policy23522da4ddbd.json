The document emphasized the importance of promoting democracy and human rights around the world, which was seen as a counterbalance to the perceived threat posed by communism.\n\nThe NSC 68 guidelines were seen as a turning point in US Cold War foreign policy because they signaled a shift away from the traditional emphasis on economic containment and toward a more assertive and aggressive stance. This new approach was based on the belief that the United States had a moral obligation to promote freedom and democracy worldwide, rather than simply trying to contain the spread of communism through economic means.\n\nThe NSC 68 guidelines were a response to the perceived failure of previous policies, such as d\u00e9tente, to effectively prevent the spread of communism and achieve American interests. They argued that the United States needed to take a more active role in supporting democratic movements and resisting the influence of communist regimes abroad. This led to a series of actions taken by the administration, including the bombing of Libya in 1986, the invasion of Grenada in 1983, and the support for the mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s.\n\nIn summary, NSC 68 marked a significant shift in US Cold War foreign policy from an emphasis on economic containment to one that placed greater emphasis on promoting democracy and defending America's interests through military action and political support."
