Norm-referenced tests\n\nNorm-referenced testing is a type of standardized test in which the scores obtained by examinees are compared with those of a normative sample (a group of people who have been previously tested on the same topic). The norms used for comparison may be based on a population, a specific age group, gender, ethnicity, or other demographic factors.\n\nCriterion-referenced testing, on the other hand, compares an examinee's performance to a criterion (standard) that has already been established as correct or incorrect. Functional behavioral assessments and intellectual assessments are types of non-standardized testing that focus on measuring specific skills or abilities rather than comparing them to a standard.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Norm-referenced tests."
