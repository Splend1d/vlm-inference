The force input and speed of the input piston determine the amount of force that can be applied to the output piston. However, increasing the force or speed of the input piston will not necessarily increase the output piston's movement or force beyond its limits. Instead, it may cause wear on the components or damage to the system. Therefore, the output piston cannot produce increased energy."
