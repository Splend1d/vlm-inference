Securing the sustainable development of the state was dependent on societal security as an independent interest that was not secondary or dependent on the other sectors, including the military.\nB. The end of the Cold War allowed security studies to move beyond the confines of the dominant realist and neorealist perspectives, with an emerging interest in other, non-military, conceptions of security. Those who wished to broaden the scope of security studies advocated the inclusion of resource, environment, and other referent points for analysis.\nC. Societal security referred to the sustainable development of traditional patterns of military capabilities. Military threats could be subdivided to include the infrastructural strength, the technology, personnel, the economic base and the political base of the military security sector.\nD. Contemporary processes of globalization and societal conflict required the development of new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object. Security was dependent on factors beyond geographically conceived survival: survival of the state was superseded by survival of the nation (ethnic) state.\n"

However, in today's world, states are increasingly vulnerable to external threats from non-state actors such as terrorism, cyber attacks, and climate change. These threats do not necessarily come from foreign enemies, but rather from within society itself.\n\nTherefore, Buzan advocates for the development of new concepts of security that take into account not just the physical safety of individuals, but also their psychological well-being, cultural identity, and access to resources. This requires a more holistic approach to security that includes issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.\n\nIn summary, while traditional understandings of security have focused on the protection of a state's borders, Buzan's concept of \"societal security\" emphasizes the need to protect the health, prosperity, and stability of entire societies, rather than just individual nations."
