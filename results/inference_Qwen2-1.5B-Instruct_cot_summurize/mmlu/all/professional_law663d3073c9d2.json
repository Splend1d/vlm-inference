They arranged a meeting to purchase the secrets from an unscrupulous employee of the pharmaceutical company in the company's New York office. The person selling the \"secrets\" was an undercover FBI agent. The envelope that he held, with the word \"Confidential\" typed on the outside of it, contained various recipes and gardening tips. When the defendants turned over the money, they were arrested on federal charges of conspiracy to steal trade secrets. The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that it was legally impossible to steal trade secrets when in fact there were no trade secrets in the envelope. Will the federal district court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, legal impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy.\nB. Yes, factual impossibility is a defense to criminal conspiracy.\nC. No, legal impossibility is not a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\nD. No, the defendants were guilty of conspiracy as a matter of law.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C: No, legal impossibility is not a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\n\nIn order to be convicted of conspiracy to steal trade secrets, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspirators intended to commit the underlying offense (in this case, stealing trade secrets) and that they took steps to accomplish that goal. Legal impossibility is not a defense to the crime of conspiracy because it does not negate the mens rea or the intent required for conspiracy.\n\nFactual impossibility, on the other hand, refers to a situation where something is physically impossible due to a lack of resources, technology, or other factors. In this case, the defendants argued that there were no actual trade secrets in the envelope because they claimed that the ingredients in the envelope were not related to any specific trade secret. However, this argument does not address the issue of whether the conspirators had the intent to commit the underlying offense, which is what matters under conspiracy laws.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the facts presented, the federal district court is unlikely to grant the motion to dismiss the indictment. Instead, the court would likely find that the defendants' claim of factual impossibility was not sufficient to establish their defense of legal impossibility, and proceed to try them on the charge of conspiracy to steal trade secrets."
