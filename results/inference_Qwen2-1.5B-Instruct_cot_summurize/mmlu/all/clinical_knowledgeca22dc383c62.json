They are unable to pass air through their vocal cords.\n\nWhen a cuff is inflated, it creates pressure on the lungs, which can cause them to deflate and collapse. This can make it difficult for the patient to take deep breaths and speak clearly. The lack of oxygenated blood flowing to the brain can also cause confusion or dizziness."
