There is growing evidence of direct partnerships between terrorist groups and transnational criminal organization resulting from the end of the Cold War and the need to secure new forms of financial sponsorship. For most terrorist groups criminal activity has been amongst the most important sources of funds with the diffusion of terrorist networks globally operating in correlation to the diffusion of illicit market activities.\nB. The nexus between terrorist groups and criminal organizations are generally a temporary aberration. Differential long-term strategic goals meant that levels of cooperation were generally tactical temporary alliances that would have little pervasive effects.\nC. There is increasing evidence over the convergence of terrorism and transnational crime, but there is no consensus about whether this phenomenon is a long-term strategic alliance or episodic \"marriages of convenience\".\nD. All of these options.\n"

Some terrorist groups may focus primarily on political or ideological goals, while others may prioritize securing financial resources for operations.\n\nSimilarly, while there are cases where terrorist groups have formed partnerships with criminal organizations, such as through financing or logistical support, it is not always clear whether this is a long-term strategic alliance or simply a temporary partnership based on immediate needs.\n\nThere is also a lack of consensus among experts regarding the nature of this relationship. Some argue that it represents a long-term strategic alliance, while others see it more as an episodic marriage of convenience. Ultimately, the extent to which TNC (transnational criminal organizations) are linked with terrorism depends on a variety of factors, including the specific circumstances of each case."
