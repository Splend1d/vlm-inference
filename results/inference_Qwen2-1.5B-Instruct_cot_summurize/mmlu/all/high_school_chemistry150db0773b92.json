In this case, we can compare the ionization energies of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and hydrogen selenium (H2Se), as well as water (H2O). \n\n- Ionization energy: H2S has an ionization energy of 108.6 kJ/mol, while H2Se has an ionization energy of 75.3 kJ/mol. This means that H2Se will be more easily ionized than H2S.\n- Ionization energy: Water has an ionization energy of 439.4 kJ/mol. This is much lower than H2S or H2Se, indicating that water is more stable and less likely to undergo ionization compared to these other acids.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, H2S > H2Se > H2O is the most logical prediction for the strength of binary acids from strongest to weakest."
