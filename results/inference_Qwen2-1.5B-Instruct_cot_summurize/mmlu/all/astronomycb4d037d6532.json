These planets form from the accretion of gaseous matter around the star, which is denser at higher temperatures and lower densities at lower temperatures.\n\nAs these planets grow in size, they start to migrate towards the star due to the force of gravitational pull. This migration can cause them to become more compact and more tightly packed together, eventually leading to a more Earth-like planet structure.\n\nSo while the formation mechanism depends on the specific properties of the star and its environment, it's generally accepted that these planets form by accreting material from surrounding interstellar gas and dust, and then migrating inwards under the influence of the star's gravity."
