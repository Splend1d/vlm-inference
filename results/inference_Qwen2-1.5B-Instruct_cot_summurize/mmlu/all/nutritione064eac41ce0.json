Obesity occurs because gut hormone secretion becomes deranged and PYY secretion fails to give a satiety signal.\nB. The gut/brain signalling pathway controls energy intake to within 2% of requirements, even in people who are morbidly obese\nC. The problem is one of greed and gluttony, whereby people override strong satiety signals on a regular basis\nD. Flavour signals from tasty, processed food will override satiety signals even after a large meal\n"

This can lead to overeating, which can contribute to weight gain and obesity.\n\nProcessed foods often contain high levels of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, which can cause cravings and overconsumption. Additionally, the presence of certain flavors in these foods can override our natural satiety signals and make it more difficult for us to control our eating habits.\n\nTherefore, the gut-brain signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating appetite and energy intake. When this pathway is disrupted or malfunctioning, it can lead to overeating and obesity."
