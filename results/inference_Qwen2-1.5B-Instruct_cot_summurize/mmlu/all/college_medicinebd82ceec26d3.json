Substance abuse during adolescence can lead to changes in the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions such as planning, decision-making, and self-control. This can result in reduced behavioral impulse control and increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations. However, it does not necessarily cause an increase in auditory hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms."
