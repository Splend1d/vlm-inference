An application of the ethics of prima facie duty.\n\nSandel argues that there are certain duties we owe to others, even if they are not particularly virtuous or praiseworthy actions. These duties include respecting others' rights and freedoms, treating others with dignity and respect, and promoting justice and fairness. \n\nIn his book \"Moral Luck,\" Sandel outlines a framework for evaluating these duties in the context of moral engineering - the use of technology and other tools to improve individuals' lives. He argues that while some forms of moral engineering may be beneficial and have positive outcomes, it is important to consider whether they also promote virtuous behavior and ethical principles.\n\nTherefore, Sandel's argument can be seen as applying the ethics of prima facie duty, which suggests that one should prioritize duties that are morally obligatory and do not require further justification."
