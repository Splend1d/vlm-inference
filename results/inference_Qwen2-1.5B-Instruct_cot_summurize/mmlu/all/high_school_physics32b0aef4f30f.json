This means that if the small block is sliding off the original block, it would be doing work against the spring force, causing the block attached to the spring to accelerate. However, if there is enough friction between the blocks, the small block will not move even when the original block is at its maximum displacement.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer."
