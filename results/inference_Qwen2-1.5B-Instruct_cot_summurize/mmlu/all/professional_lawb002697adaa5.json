Delivery by April 1. \"On March 8, the company shipped 300 sheets of 1/2-inch refabricated aluminum siding, which were received by the builder on March 10. The following day, the builder sent the following fax to the company: \"Be advised that your shipment is rejected. Order stipulated 1/4-inch sheets. \" This fax was received by the company, but the builder did not ship the nonconforming aluminum sheets back to the company. Did the builder properly reject the shipment delivered on March 10?\n\nA. Yes, because the aluminum sheets were nonconforming goods.\nB. Yes, because the company did not notify the builder that the 1/2-inch sheets were for accommodation only.\nC. No, because the builder waived its right to reject the nonconforming goods by not returning them promptly to the company.\nD. No, because the company could accept the builder's offer by prompt shipment of either conforming or nonconforming goods.\n"

No, because the builder waived its right to reject the nonconforming goods by not returning them promptly to the company.\n\nWhen the builder sent the fax stating that the shipment was rejected due to the nonconformity with the specified dimensions (1/4-inch), this was an acceptance of the rejection of the nonconforming goods. Therefore, the builder did not have the right to reject the shipment based on the dimensions provided in the original order, as it had already accepted the rejection of the nonconforming goods in the fax.\n\nAdditionally, the company's response to the builder's fax indicates that they understood the terms of the order and agreed to ship either conforming or nonconforming goods, depending on the availability at the time. Since the company shipped the 1/2-inch sheets instead of the ordered 1/4-inch sheets, they fulfilled their obligation under the terms of the contract, even if the dimensions specified in the original order were not strictly adhered to.\n\nTherefore, the builder did not properly reject the shipment delivered on March 10, as it had already accepted the rejection of the nonconforming goods in the initial fax and did not return the nonconforming goods promptly to the company."
