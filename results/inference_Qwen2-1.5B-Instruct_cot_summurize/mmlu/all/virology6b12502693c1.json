Can cause infection of the central nervous system\n\nAstroviruses primarily infect the small intestine and can cause a variety of symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. In severe cases, they can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can be life-threatening.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that astrovirus infections are relatively rare compared to other viral illnesses, and most people who contract them will experience mild or no symptoms. Additionally, there is currently no cure for astrovirus infections, but treatment typically involves rest, hydration, and medications such as antidiarrheal agents."
