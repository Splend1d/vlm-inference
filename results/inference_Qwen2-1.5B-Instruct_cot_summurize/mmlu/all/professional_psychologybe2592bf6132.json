When they become aware of an ethical violation by a colleague, it is generally expected that they will take steps to address the issue in a manner consistent with their role as a member of the profession. This might include reporting the violation to appropriate authorities or attempting to resolve the issue informally through dialogue or mediation. However, there may be circumstances where a psychologist chooses not to take action, such as when they believe that the violation does not warrant further investigation or intervention. Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed depends on a range of factors including the severity of the violation, the specific context in which it occurred, and the individual's own values and priorities. It is important for psychologists to consider these factors carefully before making any decisions regarding ethical violations."
