The Ancestral Puebloans were a Native American culture that lived in what is now parts of New Mexico and Colorado from about 600 to 1300 AD. They had a complex social structure with distinct roles for men and women, and they built large stone structures such as pueblos and kivas. It's possible that some of their descendants may have been present during the Spanish exploration of the Americas. However, it's important to note that there is still much debate among historians about who exactly these ancestors were and where they came from."
