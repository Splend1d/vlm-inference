Alpha-thalassaemia is an inherited genetic disorder that affects the production of red blood cells, leading to severe anaemia and other complications. It is caused by mutations in the HBB gene, which encodes for beta-globin, a protein that makes up the hemoglobin in red blood cells. The condition can be treated with blood transfusions or bone marrow transplants."
