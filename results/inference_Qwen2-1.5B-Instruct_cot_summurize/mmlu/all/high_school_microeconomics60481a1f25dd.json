Expectations of lower future prices for orange juice\n\nWhen expectations of lower future prices for an item, such as orange juice, lead people to reduce their current consumption or save more money, it can cause a shift to the right on the demand curve. This is because consumers will buy less of the good now rather than wait and potentially pay more later when prices rise. In this case, the shift to the right on the demand curve would be due to the expectation of lower future prices for orange juice. \n\nOption A (a bumper crop of oranges in Florida) could also cause a shift to the right on the demand curve if there is a sudden increase in supply that outweighs any change in consumer preferences or income. However, if the expected supply shock is not significant enough to offset any potential changes in consumer preferences or income, then the effect may be limited.\n\nOption B (a decrease in the price of Tang) could also cause a shift to the right on the demand curve if Tang's popularity shifts away from orange juice, leading consumers to prefer other products instead. However, this scenario is less likely given that orange juice has traditionally been associated with higher-end beverages and is often seen as a premium product.\n\nOption D (expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers) could also cause a shift to the right on the demand curve if higher incomes lead consumers to consume more of orange juice in anticipation of its rising price in the future. However, this scenario is less likely given that orange juice is generally considered a staple food item and is consumed regularly by many people."
