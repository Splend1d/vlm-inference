Therefore, option A is not a widely articulated or valid criticism of constructivism. Option B is also not a widely articulated or valid criticism of constructivism because it is a common critique of constructivism. Option C is a widely articulated and valid criticism of constructivism because it highlights the importance of recognizing international actors beyond states and the role they play in shaping international relations. Option D is not a widely articulated or valid criticism of constructivism because it is an incorrect statement about constructivist theory. Constructivists do indeed reject causality, but they use ideas instead, which can be empirically tested and observed."
