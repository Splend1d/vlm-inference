This is because post-structuralism emphasizes the importance of power relations and the ways in which these influence how wars are fought and won. By examining the ways in which different groups use language and symbols to define themselves and their enemies, post-structuralists can challenge traditional narratives of war and help to create more nuanced understandings of the conflicts we face today."
