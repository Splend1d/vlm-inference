It can be seen as cruel and unnecessary to treat an innocent creature like this. The act of pulling a pet around on a rug for amusement or entertainment purposes can cause harm and stress to the animal, leading to physical and emotional distress. Therefore, option A (Wrong, Wrong) is the correct answer."
