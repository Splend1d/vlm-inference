He believed that the pursuit of knowledge should not be limited by what is considered \"true\" or \"false\", as this would hinder progress in understanding and learning. Instead, he advocated for a more open-minded approach to inquiry and debate, where different perspectives and ideas could be explored and evaluated without preconceived notions or biases. This idea of academic skepticism was developed in his work \"De Libero Arithmetice,\" which explores the nature of mathematical proof and how it relates to human reason."
