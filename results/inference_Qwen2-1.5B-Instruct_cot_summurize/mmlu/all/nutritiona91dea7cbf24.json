Cross-links between the -NH2 group of lysine and the COOH group of glutamate render the amino acid(s) unavailable for digestion.\n\nThis is because cross-linking can occur between specific residues, such as lysine and glutamine or lysine and glutamic acid, which can prevent the amino acid from being digested by enzymes like proteases. This type of cross-linking is known as disulfide bridge formation, and it is often used to stabilize proteins during their folding process."
