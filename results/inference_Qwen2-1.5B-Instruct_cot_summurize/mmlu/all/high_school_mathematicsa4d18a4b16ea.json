                    "text": "To find the greatest number of bricks that can be sold without any extra bricks left over, we need to calculate how many whole bricks fit into the rectangular patio area.\n\nFirst, convert all measurements to the same unit for consistency (e.g., feet). Let's use feet for this calculation.\n\nThe dimensions of the patio in feet are:\n- Length: 12 feet\n- Width: 10 feet\n\nThe dimensions of the brick in inches are:\n- Height: 4 inches\n- Depth: 6 inches\n\nSince the depth of the brick is less than half the width of the patio, it will not fully fit along the length or width of the patio without leaving any space. Therefore, we only consider the height of the brick when calculating the number of bricks needed.\n\\[ \\text{Number of bricks} = \\frac{\\text{Length of the patio}}{\\text{Height of the brick}} + \\frac{\\text{Width of the patio}}{\\text{Depth of the brick}} - 1 \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of bricks} = \\frac{12\\text{ ft}}{4\\text{ in}} + \\frac{10\\text{ ft}}{6\\text{ in}} - 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of bricks} = 3 + \\frac{5}{3} - 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of bricks} = 3 + \\frac{5}{3} - 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of bricks} = \\frac{9}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} - 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of bricks} = \\frac{14}{3} - 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of bricks} = \\frac{14}{3} - \\frac{3}{3} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of bricks} = \\frac{11}{3} \\]\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a brick, we round down to the nearest whole number because you can't sell a fraction of a brick.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of bricks the salesman could sell is \\(2\\) thousand \\(880\\) bricks (which is \\(2880\\) since we're rounding down).\n\nCorrect answer: B. 2,880"
