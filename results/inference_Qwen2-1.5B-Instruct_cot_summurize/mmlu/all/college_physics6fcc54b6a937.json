                    "text": "The angular momentum of an object is given by $L = I \\omega$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity.\n\nFor satellite A, its moment of inertia can be expressed as $I_A = mR^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the satellite and $R$ is its orbital radius. Since both satellites have the same mass, their moments of inertia will be equal, so $I_A = I_B$. The angular velocity of satellite A can be related to its orbital radius and period using Kepler's laws: $\\omega = (4\\pi^2n^3)/(GM)$, where $n$ is the number of revolutions per unit time and $G$ is the gravitational constant. However, we don't need this information to solve for the ratio of the angular momenta.\n\nFor satellite B, its moment of inertia is also $I_B = mR^2$. We know that the angular velocity of satellite B is half that of satellite A because the orbit of B is twice as far from the center of the Earth compared to A. Therefore, the angular velocity of satellite B is $(4\\pi^2n^3)/(2GM)$. \n\nThus, the ratio of the angular momenta of A to B is:\n$$\\frac{I_A}{I_B} = \\frac{mR^2}{mR^2} = 1.$$\n\nSo, the answer is D. 1/sqrt(2)."
