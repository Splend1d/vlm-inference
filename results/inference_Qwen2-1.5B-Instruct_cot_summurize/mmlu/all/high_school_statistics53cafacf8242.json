The first study was an observational study, while the second was a controlled experiment. \n\nIn an experimental design, there must be a comparison between the groups (in this case, those who watched 1 hour vs those who watched 5 hours). This makes it an experimental or controlled study. However, since no comparison was made between the two groups (those who watched 1 hour and those who watched 5 hours), the first study was not a true experiment with a control group. Instead, it could be considered an observational study because it observed the behavior of both groups without manipulating them. \n\nOn the other hand, the second study asked participants questions about their television usage and their class grades, which suggests that it was designed to observe how people's behavior relates to their grades. It did not manipulate any variables like the first study did, so it would also be considered an observational study."
