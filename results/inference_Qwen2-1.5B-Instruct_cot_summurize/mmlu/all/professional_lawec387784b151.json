He had served as a state trooper since 1978, and in 1998, he became fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. In 2006, the trooper retired and immediately started receiving monthly state pension checks. In 2009, the governor of the state signed into law a statute, which provided in part:\"Section 8. Any member of the state law enforcement staff. . . who is convicted of. . . briberyshall not be entitled to receive any retirement or other benefit or payment of any kind from the stateSuch conviction shall be considered a breach of the staff member's employment contractSection 12. The provisions of this Act shall be retroactive to December 31, 1975. Section 14. This Act shall take effect immediately. \"Following the enactment of the statute, the state trooper received a letter from the state which stated that pursuant to the statute, the state is immediately discontinuing pension benefit payments to you on account of your 2008 bribery conviction. \"The trooper contacted an attorney, who challenged the discontinuance of benefits on the grounds that the new law was unconstitutional. Assume that the state's highest court holds the statute constitutional. The trooper might still be able to eventually have his pension reinstated if\n\nA. he exercises his constitutional right to discretionary review in the U. S. Supreme Court.\nB. he receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense.\nC. he can show that he was convicted before the effective date of thestatute.\nD. he can show that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause.\n"

However, it is unclear whether any of the options listed (A, B, C, D) would necessarily result in the trooper's pension being reinstated.\n\nOption A (exercising constitutional right to discretionary review in the US Supreme Court) could potentially lead to a different outcome, depending on the specific facts of the case and the reasoning behind the decision by the US Supreme Court.\n\nOption B (receiving a presidential pardon) would require the trooper to first seek a pardon from the President of the United States, which is not guaranteed.\n\nOption C (showing that he was convicted before the effective date of the statute) would only affect the retroactivity of the statute, but does not directly address the issue of whether the trooper's pension should be reinstated.\n\nOption D (showing that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause) would also need to be proven before the court, and would likely depend on the specific language and implications of the statute.\n\nIn summary, while it is possible that the trooper could ultimately have his pension reinstated under certain circumstances, it is not clear what those circumstances would be without knowing the specifics of the statute and its application to the trooper's situation."
