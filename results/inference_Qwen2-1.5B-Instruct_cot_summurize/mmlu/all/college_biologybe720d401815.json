Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria; animals and fungi have only mitochondria.\n\nMitochondria and chloroplasts are both organelles found in cells, but they serve different functions. Mitochondria are responsible for producing energy through cellular respiration, while chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, which produces glucose and oxygen as byproducts. \n\nFungi do not have mitochondria, as they are eukaryotic organisms like plants and animals, and therefore must have their own internal mechanisms to generate energy. Fungi also lack chloroplasts because they do not perform photosynthesis, so they do not need these structures to produce their own food. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria; animals and fungi have only mitochondria."
