The arguments do not establish that capital punishment is inherently degrading or morally wrong. In fact, they may be premised on cultural beliefs that justify capital punishment as necessary for maintaining social order and justice.\n\n2. The arguments may lead to an overgeneralization. By appealing to African values and cultures, the arguments might imply that all forms of violence are wrong, which may not necessarily be true. For example, some forms of violence may be culturally justified as necessary for protecting honor, family, or community interests.\n\nTherefore, the arguments do not provide a strong basis for condemning capital punishment outright, but rather highlight the need for further ethical and legal consideration."
