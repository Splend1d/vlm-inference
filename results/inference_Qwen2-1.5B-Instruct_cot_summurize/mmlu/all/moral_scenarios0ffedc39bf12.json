This action goes against ordinary moral standards and can be harmful to both the environment and those who might come into contact with the oil. Therefore, option A is correct: the main character's actions in scenario 1 are wrong.\nIn scenario 2, the main character is not doing anything that goes against ordinary moral standards. Swearing about a monster in one's closet is a normal and acceptable behavior, and telling a child that there is a monster in their closet is not harmful or harmful to anyone else. Therefore, option B is also correct: the main character's actions in scenario 2 are not wrong."
