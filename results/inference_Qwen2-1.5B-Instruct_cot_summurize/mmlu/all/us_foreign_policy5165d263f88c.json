Roosevelt's initial \"isolationist\" stance was due to his belief that the United States needed to focus on domestic issues such as unemployment and poverty, rather than engaging in foreign conflicts or alliances. He believed that the country should concentrate on rebuilding its infrastructure and improving the lives of its citizens through social programs like the New Deal.\n\nFDR also saw Germany's rise to power as a potential threat to American interests, but he felt that the US should not engage in war with Germany until it had demonstrated its willingness to negotiate peace terms. This approach reflected his belief in the importance of internal reform over external conflict.\n\nTherefore, while Roosevelt may have been influenced by some aspects of the other options (such as his support for isolationism), the primary reason for his initial \"isolationist\" stance was his focus on domestic issues and his desire to avoid entanglement in European affairs."
