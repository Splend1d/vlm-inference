Over a year later, police detectives arrested a defendant after obtaining reliable information that the defendant was the robber who was responsible for killing the store's owner. Afterward, the defendant was taken to the station house where he was booked for the crime and then incarcerated. The next day, the prosecuting attorney made a decision to delay indictment until he could discover the identity of the defendant's accomplice. The defendant was then released from police custody. In this jurisdiction the statute of limitations for murder is five years. Five months later, the prosecuting attorney, after unsuccessfully attempting to secure information on the defendant's cohort, indicted the defendant, charging him with felony murder. Shortly before trial, the only eyewitness to the crime died. He would have testified that the defendant did not participate in the robbery. The defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because of the delay between the date of the crime and the date of the indictment will most probably be\n\nA. granted, because the prosecutor is constitutionally required to press charges, if at all, within a reasonable time after probable cause is established.\nB. granted, because the delay in prosecuting the defendant actually prejudiced him.\nC. denied, because pre-indictment delay does not violate the Constitution, as long as it does not exceed an applicable statute of limitations.\nD. denied, because the delay was not excessive and was for a permissible purpose.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is C: denied, because pre-indictment delay does not violate the Constitution, as long as it does not exceed an applicable statute of limitations.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\" This provision applies to cases involving the death penalty, which includes felony murder charges.\n\nIn order to file an indictment, the prosecution must establish probable cause beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime charged. If the prosecution cannot do so within a reasonable time after probable cause is established, the defendant may raise the statute of limitations defense.\n\nThe statute of limitations for murder is typically five years in jurisdictions like the United States. Therefore, if the prosecution fails to file an indictment within five years of the crime being committed, the defendant can argue that the delay exceeds the applicable statute of limitations and therefore violates the Fifth Amendment right against double jeopardy.\n\nHowever, there is a rebuttable presumption that the prosecution has sufficient evidence to support an indictment, even if it is delayed. In this case, the prosecuting attorney argues that the defendant was arrested over a year after the crime, and the defendant was released from police custody before the prosecution had enough evidence to file an indictment. They claim that this delay did not prejudice the defendant because the delay was necessary to allow them to gather more evidence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: denied, because pre-indictment delay does not violate the Constitution, as long as it does not exceed an applicable statute of limitations."
