It is generally not safe or responsible to leave a child unattended, especially if there are no adults present who can provide immediate assistance in case of an emergency.\n\nScenario 2 involves feeding a dog and placing a full bowl on its plate, which is not necessarily wrong but may be seen as neglectful or irresponsible if the dog is dependent on human intervention for food. However, this scenario is not as extreme as leaving a baby alone, so it would still be considered morally wrong under certain circumstances."
