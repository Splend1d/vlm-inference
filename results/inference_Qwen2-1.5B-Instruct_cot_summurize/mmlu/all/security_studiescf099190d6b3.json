Institutional constraints limit the amount of resources to be spent on some good and force actors to choose how to manage the limited wealth available to them.\nB. Institutions are the social norms and expectations that affect an actor's goals and ambitions.\nC. Institutional constraints refer to tools of the state such as schools, prisons, and hospitals; the provision of resources for these institutions makes demands on political leaders.\nD. Institutions are humanly devised constrains that structure human interaction, they are man-made rules that guide decision making and govern behaviour.\n"

A: Institutional constraints can limit the amount of resources that organizations or individuals have at their disposal, which can affect their ability to pursue certain goals or allocate resources effectively.\n2. B: Institutions can also shape individual aspirations and priorities by providing clear guidance on what is considered acceptable or desirable behavior.\n3. C: The existence of institutions can create demand for specific goods and services, which can influence economic decisions and market dynamics.\n4. D: In addition, institutions can provide a framework for organizing interactions between individuals and groups, which can influence how people interact with each other and make decisions.\n\nOverall, institutional constraints play a crucial role in shaping behavior and decision-making processes within societies."
