The RLN is responsible for controlling the muscles of the larynx (voice box), which can cause vocal cord dysfunction if damaged. \n\nIn the case of recurrent RLN damage, it's common for the vocal cords on the side of the injury to be more swollen or tense than the opposite side. This is because the paralysis of the involved RLN results in a lack of control over the voluntary muscles of the larynx, including the cricothyroid and interarytenoid muscles. The cricothyroid muscle remains functional but its strength is reduced due to the loss of neural stimulation. On the other hand, the interarytenoid muscles are weakened as they are not being innervated by the damaged RLN. As a result, the interarytenoid muscles become more active to compensate for the weakness of the cricothyroid muscle, leading to an intermediate position between adduction and abduction of the vocal cords.\n\nTherefore, the proper answer is D. cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed but the interarytenoids are weak."
