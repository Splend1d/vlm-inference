Therefore, they may have adaptations such as long loops of Henle in their kidneys to maximize water reabsorption and reduce waste products in the urine. However, if the goal is to minimize water loss, short loops of Henle may not be as effective in maximizing water reabsorption.\n\nOn the other hand, storage of water in fatty tissues or large ears to aid in heat dispersion could still be advantageous in a hot, arid environment, depending on the specific species and its needs. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: short loops of Henle to maximize water secretion."
