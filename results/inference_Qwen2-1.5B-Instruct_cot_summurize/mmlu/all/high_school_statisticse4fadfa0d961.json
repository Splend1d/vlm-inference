Each of the five managers will be asked to place the 200 time cards of their respective employees in a bag, shake them up, and randomly draw out six names. The six names from each plant will be put together to make up the sample. Will this method result in a simple random sample of the 1000 employees?\n\nA. Yes, because every employee has the same chance of being selected.\nB. Yes, because every plant is equally represented.\nC. Yes, because this is an example of stratified sampling, which is a special case of simple random sampling.\nD. No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n"

No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n\nIn a simple random sample, each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected. In this scenario, the managers have some control over who they choose to include in the sample. By placing the 200 time cards of each manager's employees into bags and shaking them up, the managers can ensure that all employees within each plant are equally likely to be included in the sample. However, the managers do not have complete control over whether or not a particular employee is included in the sample, as there may be some overlap between plants when choosing employees for the sample. Therefore, this method does not guarantee that each group of 30 employees has an equal chance of being selected, and thus it is not a simple random sample."
