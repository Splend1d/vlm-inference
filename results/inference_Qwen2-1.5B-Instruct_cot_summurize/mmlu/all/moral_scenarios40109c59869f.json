The action is also harmful to the animals that may be attracted by the water and could potentially harm them.\nIn contrast, the main character who used I/me/my in scenario 2 did nothing wrong since spending all night studying to pass the test is a positive and beneficial act for personal growth and achievement. This action aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, which prioritize the promotion of one's own well-being and success over the harm caused to others or the environment."
