When a company moves into a new building, it typically does not need to sell the old building until the lease expires or if there are other plans for it. Therefore, the old building would continue to be used and depreciated over time rather than being sold immediately after construction is completed. Additionally, since the building is being actively marketed for sale, it would likely have been reclassified as an asset held for sale by the end of the lease term or when the sale process is complete."
