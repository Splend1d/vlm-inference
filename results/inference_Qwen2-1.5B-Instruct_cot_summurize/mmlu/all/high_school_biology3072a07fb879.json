Physiology\n\nThe theory of evolution by natural selection explains the development of traits such as the prehensile tail in monkeys as a result of natural selection acting on individuals with different body shapes. In this case, the prehensile tail would have been favored if it allowed for better grasping of objects (a function of physiology), which would have increased survival and reproductive success over time due to better food acquisition opportunities. This process could explain why the tails evolved differently across species, including the differences between monkey tails found in South and Central America versus those found in Africa and Asia."
