Popsicles are typically purchased by people who want something sweet and cold to satisfy their desire for ice cream but do not have enough money to afford full-priced ice cream cones.\n\nOn the other hand, when Julia's income increases, she may be able to afford more expensive ice cream cones rather than just popsicles, making popsicles less desirable relative to other options like ice cream cones. Therefore, popsicles become an inferior good under this scenario."
