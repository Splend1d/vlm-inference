This is known as Hysteresis Law. The direction of the magnetization vector is also determined by the orientation of the external field with respect to the material's crystal structure. Therefore, the applied field is always greater than or equal to the saturation magnetization, which occurs when the applied field reaches a certain value. This behavior is due to the fact that ferromagnetic materials have a finite energy barrier at zero magnetization, which allows them to retain their magnetization even after the external field has been removed."
