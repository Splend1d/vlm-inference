Decrease taxes.\n\nWhen there is a recessionary gap, the government can use fiscal policy to stimulate economic growth by increasing tax cuts or other forms of government spending. This will increase demand in the economy and help to reduce the recessionary gap.\n\nIn terms of the expected impact on real GDP and unemployment:\n\n- If the government increases taxes as part of a contractionary fiscal policy, it will lead to lower income for individuals and businesses, which may result in reduced consumption and investment, leading to a further reduction in real GDP.\n- On the other hand, if the government decreases taxes as part of an expansionary fiscal policy, it will lead to increased disposable income for individuals and businesses, which may lead to higher consumption and investment, resulting in an increase in real GDP.\n\nOverall, decreasing taxes is likely to have a positive effect on both real GDP and employment levels during a recessionary period. However, this depends on the specifics of the economic situation and the effectiveness of the fiscal policy measures taken."
