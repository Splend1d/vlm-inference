Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected student is going to a 4-year college given that they do not attend a 2-year college is simply the percentage of students who attend a 4-year college among those who do not attend a 2-year college.\n\nThis calculation gives us:\n\\[ P(\\text{going to 4-year college} | \\text{not attending 2-year college}) = \\frac{34}{100} = 0.34 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, we get approximately \\(0.34\\) as our answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **(C) 0.630**."
