The volume of such a sphere is given by \\(V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius. Substituting the radius gives:\n\n\\[V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (0.6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot 0.216768... = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot 0.068958... \\approx 0.03684 \\, \\text{m}^3\\]\n\nThe volume of a sphere is also equal to \\(V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\), where \\(R\\) is the radius of the sphere. For this sphere, substituting the radius gives:\n\n\\[0.03684 \\, \\text{m}^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (0.6)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot 0.216768... \\approx 0.03684 \\, \\text{m}^3\\]\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation.\n\nNow, the solid angle can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[A_{solid} = V \\cdot \\sin(\\theta)\\]\n\nwhere \\(A_{solid}\\) is the solid angle, \\(V\\) is the volume of the sphere, and \\(\\theta\\) is the angle subtended by the area at the center of the sphere.\n\nSince the area is \\(0.24 \\, \\text{m}^2\\) and the volume of the sphere is approximately \\(0.03684 \\, \\text{m}^3\\), we have:\n\n\\[A_{solid} = 0.24 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\sin(\\theta)\\]\n\nSince \\(\\theta\\) is the angle subtended by the area at the center of the sphere, it equals the spherical angle subtended by the area. However, we're asked to find the solid angle subtended by the entire surface of the sphere, not just one point. Therefore, we need to find the angle subtended by the area and divide it by the total solid angle.\n\nLet's denote the total solid angle as \\(A_{total}\\) and the angle subtended by the area as \\(A_{area}\\).\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[A_{total} = A_{area} + 4 \\times A_{area} = 5 \\times A_{area}\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[A_{solid} = \\frac{A_{area}}{5} = \\frac{A_{area}}{5} \\cdot \\sin(\\theta)\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{A_{solid}}{A_{area}}\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we've calculated:\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{0.24}{0.03684} = \\frac{24}{368.4} = \\frac{24}{372} = \\frac{1}{1.7}\\]\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1.7}\\]\n\nUsing a calculator or trigonometric tables, we get:\n\n\\[\\theta \\approx 0.588^\\circ\\]\n\nFinally, converting degrees to radians:\n\n\\[\\theta \\approx 0.588^\\circ \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ} = \\frac{\\pi}{336}\\]\n\nThus, the solid angle subtended by the area is about \\(2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{336} = \\frac{2\\pi}{336} \\approx "
