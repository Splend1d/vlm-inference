This approach ensures that the artist can continue creating their artwork while minimizing the risk of harm to themselves or others. It also allows the artist to explore alternative materials or techniques if necessary, rather than being forced to abandon their project altogether due to safety concerns. Additionally, this approach promotes sustainability and reduces waste by avoiding the need for potentially harmful products in the first place."
