The difference between the consumer's value and the market price.\n\nConsumer surplus refers to the difference between what consumers actually pay for a good or service (the market price) and what they would be willing to pay if they could purchase it at that higher price (their willingness-to-pay). In other words, it is the additional benefit that consumers receive from purchasing the good or service above and beyond what they would have received in a perfectly competitive market with no barriers to entry."
