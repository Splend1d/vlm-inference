If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, it means that the new term improves the fit of the model. Therefore, the value of the information criterion will also decrease.\n3. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is based on minimizing the expected prediction error while the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC) is based on maximizing the likelihood function. Both AIC and SIC aim to select models with smaller values of the information criterion.\n4. Akaike's information criterion is consistent because it converges towards the minimum of the log-likelihood function under certain conditions, which are not necessarily satisfied for all models."
