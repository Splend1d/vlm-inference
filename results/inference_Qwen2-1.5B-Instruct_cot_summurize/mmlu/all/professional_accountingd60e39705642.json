Their payouts (i.e. dividends or coupons) are made before corporation tax has been deducted.\n\nEquity and bonds both represent ownership in a company, but they differ in their structure and how they pay out profits to shareholders. Equity refers to shares of ownership in a company, which can be bought and sold on the stock exchange. When a company pays out dividends, it does so from its retained earnings, which are profits that have been reinvested rather than distributed as cash dividends. This means that the payout is before any corporation tax has been deducted. Bonds, on the other hand, are debt securities issued by corporations, government agencies, or municipalities. They typically pay interest payments semi-annually or annually, with the principal amount repaid at maturity. The interest paid on a bond is usually based on the face value of the bond, and it is not subject to corporation tax until the date of redemption or maturity."
