The t-distributions are lower at the mean and higher at the tails, and so are more spread out than the normal distribution.\n\nWhile it's true that the t-distribution is less symmetrical than the normal distribution (which is also known as the Gaussian distribution), this does not necessarily mean that it is \"lower\" at the mean or \"higher\" at the tails. In fact, the t-distribution has its own unique properties that make it different from the normal distribution, such as having heavier tails and being skewed to the right. \n\nFurthermore, while the t-distribution can be used as an approximation to the normal distribution in some cases, it may not always give accurate results. For example, if the sample size is small, the t-distribution may not provide a good approximation to the normal distribution."
