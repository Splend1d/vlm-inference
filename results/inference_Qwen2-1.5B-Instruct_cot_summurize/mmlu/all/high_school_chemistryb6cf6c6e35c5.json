Metallic bonding involves the sharing of electrons between atoms to form an electrical conducting path through the lattice structure of the material. Other types of bonding, such as ionic or covalent networks, do not typically exhibit these properties. Non-polar covalent bonding is also possible but less common than metallic bonding for substances with high melting points and poor conductivity."
