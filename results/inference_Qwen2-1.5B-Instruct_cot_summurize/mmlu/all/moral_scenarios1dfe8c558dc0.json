Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nIn scenario 1, cooking an endangered bird is considered morally wrong because it involves killing and consuming a species that is already facing extinction due to human activities like hunting and habitat destruction. In scenario 2, giving money to a child is not inherently wrong, but if the child is not allowed to spend the money on their own or if they have no idea what they are buying with it, then it can be seen as morally wrong. However, simply giving the child money without any negative consequences is generally considered acceptable."
