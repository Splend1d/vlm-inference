During direct examination, the informer testified that he was unemployed but sometimes worked part-time as a substitute teacher. On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the informer if he had recently filed an application to become a police officer. The informer responded affirmatively. The defendant's attorney then asked the informer the following question:\"Isn't it true that you hope that by acting as an undercover agent, the police department will overlook the fact that you had two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana?\" The prosecuting attorney immediately objected. The trial judge should rule that the defendant's attorney's inquiry concerning the informer's hopes and misdemeanor convictions is\n\nA. improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness.\nB. improper, as relating to convictions of crimes not punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.\nC. proper, as tending to show the informer's bad character for truthfulness.\nD. proper, as relevant to the informer's possible bias.\n"

The information being sought does not pertain to the defendant's guilt or innocence. It instead seeks to undermine the credibility of the informer's testimony by suggesting that his motivation for cooperating with the prosecution may be self-serving. Therefore, the inquiry is considered improper under the rules of evidence."
