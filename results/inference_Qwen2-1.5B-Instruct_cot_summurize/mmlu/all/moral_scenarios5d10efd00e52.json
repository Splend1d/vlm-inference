This action could be seen as morally wrong because it involved intentionally putting someone else in danger or harm. In scenario 2, the main character made their baby a cocktail to drink. While this may not have been intended for harm, it still goes against the principles of child safety and parental responsibility. Therefore, both actions can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
