This relationship is given by the formula:\n\nW = mg / r\n\nwhere W is the weight in Newtons (N), m is the mass in kilograms (kg), g is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s^2 near the surface of Earth), and r is the distance from the center of the planet.\n\nAt sea level, the weight of the textbook is:\n\nW = 30 N\n\nOn a mountain peak located 6,000 m above sea level, the distance from the center of the planet is approximately 6,400 km + 6,000 m = 6,460 km.\n\nUsing the value for g as 9.81 m/s^2 and substituting the values into the equation, we get:\n\nW' = 30 N / (6,460 km / 6,400 km) = 30 N / 1 m = 30 N\n\nTherefore, the textbook's weight on a mountain peak would be closest to 30 N.\n\nAnswer: C. 30 N"
