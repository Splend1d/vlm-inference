It measures the total economic output of the country in terms of market prices that reflect the cost of producing these goods and services. The real GDP is used to track the growth of the economy over time and can be compared across different periods.\n\nOption A is correct because it directly relates to the concept of real GDP. Option B is incorrect because it is a common term used in economics but does not specifically refer to real GDP. Option C is incorrect because real GDP is indeed adjusted for price changes, but this adjustment is done separately from the calculation of nominal GDP (which is not adjusted). Option D is also incorrect because real GDP is calculated for the entire world, not just the United States."
