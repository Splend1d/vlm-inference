However, it is important to consider the consequences of one's actions and whether they align with ordinary moral standards.\n\nIn scenario 2, giving someone who is allergic to peanuts peanut butter can be seen as morally wrong because it puts their health at risk. It is important to consider the well-being of others when making decisions that may have negative consequences."
