Rigg and Urco qualify as an affiliated group and may join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return because they own more than 50% of each other's common stock.\n\nAffiliated groups are groups of corporations that are related or controlled by one another, either directly or through ownership interests. In this case, Rigg Steele and Urco both own more than 50% of each other's common stock, so they are considered to be part of an affiliated group. This allows them to file a consolidated federal income tax return together."
