Paying attention to one's phone while driving during a terrible storm can be seen as reckless and potentially dangerous behavior, but it is not inherently immoral or unethical.\nScenario 2, going grocery shopping in the evening, may be considered morally wrong if one goes alone without proper supervision or planning for safety. However, this scenario also depends on personal values and cultural norms. Some people may feel that going grocery shopping alone at night is acceptable, while others might view it as irresponsible or unsafe. Ultimately, whether an action is morally right or wrong is subjective and varies depending on individual beliefs and circumstances."
