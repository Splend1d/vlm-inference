While eating the chowder, the customer broke a tooth on a pebble in the soup, which a reasonable inspection would not have discovered. When the customer complained to the restaurant's owner, the owner admitted that the chowder was not, in fact, homemade, but that it had been poured from a can of chowder purchased from a wholesale distributor of food products. In a strict liability action by the customer against the restaurant, he will most likely\n\nA. recover, if a reasonable consumer would not expect the presence of such a pebble in the chowder.\nB. recover, but only if the restaurant had received prior notice of the defective condition of the soup.\nC. not recover, because a reasonable inspection of the soup would not have disclosed the existence of the pebble.\nD. not recover, because the soup would not constitute an unreasonably dangerous product when it was served to the customer.\n"

In this case, the restaurant is responsible for any harm caused by the pebble in the chowder, regardless of whether the restaurant knew about the defect or not. The restaurant cannot argue that the customer should have inspected the soup more closely before ordering it, as that would be unreasonable under the circumstances."
