If there is an overall increase in births compared to deaths, as is often the case when a population experiences a higher birth rate than death rate, then the population pyramid will tend to be wider at the top (representing older people) and narrower at the bottom (representing younger people). Therefore, the correct answer is A. Wider at the top than in the middle."
