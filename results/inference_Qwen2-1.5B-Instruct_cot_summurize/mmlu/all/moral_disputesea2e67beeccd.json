These agreements may be formal contracts or informal understandings that define the roles and responsibilities of members of a community. For example, in many societies, there is an implicit understanding that certain behaviors are considered morally wrong and should not be encouraged, even if they are not explicitly prohibited by law. This shared moral consensus can lead to the development of laws and regulations that reflect these moral norms."
