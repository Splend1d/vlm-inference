For example, let A be the set of integers, and let B be the set of positive integers. Let f: A -> B be defined by f(x) = x + 1 for all x in A. Then, g: B -> A is defined by g(y) = y - 1 for all y in B. Since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, f must be injective but not necessarily surjective.\nStatement 2 is true because the function f must necessarily be surjective. This is because for every element b in B, there exists an element a in A such that g(f(a)) = a, which implies that f(a) = b. Therefore, f must be onto or surjective."
