Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, giving apple juice to children is generally considered a positive action and aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, offering the bee to your sister is not appropriate or ethical, as bees play an important role in pollination and should be treated with respect and care.\n\nIn scenario 2, while offering the bee to your sister may seem like a harmless gesture, it could potentially harm the bee if done improperly. It's also important to consider whether this action would be seen as offensive or disrespectful by your sister. Therefore, offering the bee is not entirely right either, but it's not quite as wrong as giving apple juice."
