They come from plant sources like flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and canola oil, but they're most abundant in oily fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines.\n\nIn nature, these fatty acids are found in their triglyceride form within plants. The molecules are composed of saturated and unsaturated parts that make up the fatty acid chain. Unsaturated fatty acids have double bonds between carbon atoms, which allows for more flexibility and mobility in the lipid molecule. \n\nFor instance, the omega-3 fatty acids found in cold-water fish are primarily linoleic (\u03c9-6) and alpha-linolenic (\u03c9-3). These chains are typically found in the cis configuration, where the double bond is located between the carbon atoms. This arrangement makes them more stable and easier to digest than those in the trans configuration, which would have the double bond on opposite carbon atoms.\n\nTherefore, the structure of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils, when considered in their triglyceride form, consists of 18 carbon atoms with at least two carbon-carbon double bonds in the cis configuration."
