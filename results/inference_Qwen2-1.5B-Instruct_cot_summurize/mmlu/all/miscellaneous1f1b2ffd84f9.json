When a hurricane hits land, it can cause significant damage and loss of life due to the high winds and heavy rainfall it brings.\nHowever, if we assume that the hurricane has the same mass as Earth (which is about 5.97 x 10^24 kg) and that its radius is equal to the distance from the center of the earth to the surface of the ocean (about 3,963 km), then we can calculate the magnitude of its angular momentum using the formula:\nL = I * \u03c9,\nwhere L is the angular momentum, I is the moment of inertia, and \u03c9 is the angular velocity.\nFor an object with constant density, the moment of inertia is given by:\nI = 2/5 * M * R^2,\nwhere M is the mass and R is the radius.\nFor a sphere, this becomes:\nI = 2/5 * M * R^2 = 2/5 * (5.97 x 10^24 kg) * (3,963 km)^2 = 1.89 x 10^26 kg * m^2.\nUsing these values, we can calculate the angular momentum of the hurricane:\nL = I * \u03c9 = 1.89 x 10^26 kg * m^2 * \u03c9.\nWithout more information about the specific characteristics of Hurricane Florence, such as its speed and direction of movement, it is difficult to determine the exact value of its angular momentum. However, based on the above calculations, it is reasonable to estimate that the hurricane had a magnitude of angular momentum around 10^19 kg * m^2 / s. This would be significantly less than the value in option B, which is 10^16 kg * m^2 / s. It is important to note that this calculation is purely theoretical and does not take into account any factors that could affect the hurricane's impact on land."
