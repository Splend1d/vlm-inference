This means that people may attribute positive outcomes to themselves more than they actually deserve or to negative outcomes less than they deserve. For example, if someone enjoys a particular activity but receives a reward for it, they may believe that this was due to their inherent qualities rather than just because they were good at the activity.\n\nThis overestimation of self-concept can lead to negative consequences. For instance, a person who believes that they are deserving of a promotion based on their self-concept might feel entitled to receive it, even if they don't actually meet the qualifications. This could result in them becoming complacent and not putting in as much effort as necessary to maintain their position.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone receives a negative outcome instead of a reward, they may also believe that this was due to their inherent qualities rather than just because they failed at the task. This could lead to feelings of frustration and disappointment, which could affect their motivation and performance in future tasks.\n\nTherefore, option D (not rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest) is correct."
