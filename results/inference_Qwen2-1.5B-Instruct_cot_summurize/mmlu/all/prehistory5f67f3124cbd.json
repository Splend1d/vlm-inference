The native people of Rhode Island were primarily Native American tribes such as the Narragansett and the Pawtuxet.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that during the colonial period, the term \"Melanesian\" was used to describe various peoples across the Pacific Ocean, including the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands, which would include the Polynesian people who lived there at the time. It's possible that the term \"Melanesian\" may have been used by Europeans to refer to the native people of Rhode Island in the past, but this is not a correct interpretation of their appearance."
