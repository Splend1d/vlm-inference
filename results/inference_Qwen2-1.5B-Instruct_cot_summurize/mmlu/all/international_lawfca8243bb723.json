International legal personality means having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor.\n\nInternational legal personality refers to the ability of an organization, institution, or other entity to engage in international law, including treaty obligations, jurisdictional claims, and disputes resolution. This concept allows for the enforcement of international agreements and the protection of the rights of individuals who may be affected by those agreements.\n\nIt's worth noting that this definition does not apply to physical persons; rather, it pertains to organizations and entities that have been granted legal personality by their home countries or by international bodies."
