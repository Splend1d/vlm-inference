This can lead to a shift in the frequency of different alleles within the population, which can cause a drastic change in the relative frequencies of the two forms of the fish described in the question.\n\nGene flow refers to the movement of genes between populations, while natural selection refers to the process by which individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce compared to those without such traits. Stabilizing selection refers to the situation where the fitness of an individual does not change much from one generation to the next, but it does not necessarily mean that the population as a whole will evolve over time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Genetic drift."
