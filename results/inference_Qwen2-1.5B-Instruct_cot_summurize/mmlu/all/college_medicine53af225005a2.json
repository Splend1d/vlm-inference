When DFP binds to ACE, the ACE enzyme is rendered permanently inactive. This makes DFP a potent toxin, with lethal amounts at less than 100 mg. The interaction between DFP and ACE can best be characterized as:\n\nA. Competitive inhibition\nB. Noncompetitive inhibition\nC. Irreversible inhibition\nD. Partially competitive inhibition\n"

Irreversible inhibition.\n\nIrreversible inhibition occurs when a substance binds irreversibly to an enzyme's active site, preventing it from catalyzing any further reactions until the inhibitor is removed or the enzyme is denatured. In this case, DFP binds irreversibly to the active site of ACE, rendering the enzyme permanently inactive.\n\nCompetitive inhibition occurs when a substance binds to an enzyme's active site, blocking the binding of a substrate to the same site, thereby reducing the rate of reaction. Noncompetitive inhibition occurs when a substance binds to a different part of the enzyme's active site, causing a shift in the reaction equilibrium, resulting in an increase in product formation while decreasing the amount of substrate that reacts.\n\nPartial competition refers to a situation where a substance competes for the same site on an enzyme but does not completely block it, allowing some substrate to bind without affecting the activity of the enzyme."
