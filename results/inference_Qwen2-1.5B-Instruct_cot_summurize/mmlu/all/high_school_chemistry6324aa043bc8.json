The equilibrium concentration of H3O+ will be greater than the initial concentration because some H3O+ ions have been formed as a result of the acid's dissociation.\n\nThe value of [H3O+] is directly proportional to the ionization constant of the acid, which means Ka is inversely proportional to the concentration of H3O+. Therefore, if the concentration of H3O+ is \\(x\\) times the concentration of H3O+, then the concentration of H3O+ in the solution is also \\(x^2\\) times the initial concentration.\n\nGiven the concentration of H3O+ initially is 10^-2 mol/L and the final concentration after partial dissociation is 0.060 M, we can set up the following proportion:\n\\[ x^2 = 0.060 / 10^{-2} \\]\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{0.060 / 10^{-2}} \\]\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{0.060 * 1000} \\]\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{60} \\]\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the concentration of H3O+ after partial dissociation is 8 times the initial concentration, meaning Ka is 1/8 or approximately 0.125.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 5.0 \u00d7 10^-3."
