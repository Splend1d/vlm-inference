                    "text": "The answer is A, 9.8 m/s^2. When you throw a ball downward with no air resistance, the force acting on the ball is equal to its weight (mg), which is equal to mg = ma, where m is the mass of the ball, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and a is the acceleration of the ball. Since g = 9.8 m/s^2 for Earth's surface, the force acting on the ball is also 9.8 m/s^2. Therefore, the acceleration of the ball after being thrown downward is 9.8 m/s^2.\n\nHowever, if you throw the ball upward instead, the force acting on the ball would be equal to its weight (mg) in the opposite direction, but since we're dealing with motion down, the net force would be negative. The equation for the acceleration of an object moving under constant acceleration due to gravity would then be Fnet = ma, where Fnet is the net force acting on the object, and a is the acceleration of the object. In this case, the net force acting on the ball would be mg + ma = 0, which means that the ball would accelerate upwards at the same rate as it was falling downwards. So the acceleration of the ball after being thrown upward would be zero. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer depends on whether the ball is thrown upward or downward."
