Since there are an equal number of blue, pink, and green balls, we know that $x$ must be divisible by 3.\nThe total number of soccer balls is 30, so the number of non-white soccer balls is $30 - 9 = 21$.\nSince the number of blue, pink, and green soccer balls is equal, each color has $\\frac{21}{3} = 7$ soccer balls.\nTherefore, the number of green soccer balls is $x = \\boxed{7}$.\nThe answer is: A. 7"
