All of the above.\n\nLukianoff and Haidt believe that the disinvitation of certain speakers can be seen as an example of mental filtering, which refers to the tendency to filter out information or people who do not fit our preconceived notions or beliefs. They also argue that such actions may lead to a lack of diversity in ideas and perspectives, which could ultimately hinder progress and innovation. Additionally, they suggest that such actions may discourage students from engaging with diverse viewpoints and histories, leading them to disregard positive aspects of a person's history. Therefore, it is clear that both mental filtering and promoting intellectual homogeneity are potential consequences of disinvitations."
