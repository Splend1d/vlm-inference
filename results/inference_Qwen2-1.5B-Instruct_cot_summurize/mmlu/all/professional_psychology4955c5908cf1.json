This means that decision-makers tend to focus more on the costs associated with certain decisions than on other consequences of their decisions, which is why option A is correct.\n\nOption B is incorrect because decision-makers do not have complete information about all alternative options and their consequences before making decisions. Option C is also incorrect because it suggests that individuals are better than groups at making decisions, which is not necessarily true in practice. Finally, option D is partially correct but not entirely accurate. While some decision-makers may lack complete information, this does not mean that their knowledge about possible alternatives is always incomplete. In fact, many organizations and institutions have systems in place to gather and analyze data on various potential outcomes of decisions."
