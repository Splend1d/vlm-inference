This can be seen in situations where there is a decline in demand for certain goods or services due to economic downturns or changes in consumer behavior, but the cost of producing those goods or services remains relatively constant or increases at a slower rate than the price of the factors of production.\n\nFor example, if the price of labor (e.g., wages) decreases due to increased competition from foreign workers or automation, it may lead to a decrease in supply of labor while keeping the overall level of employment relatively stable. This would result in lower factor prices and an expansionary supply shock. On the other hand, rapid increasing wages would not qualify as an expansionary supply shock because it is already a positive supply shock that has already occurred. Similarly, declining labor productivity does not necessarily indicate an expansionary supply shock unless it is accompanied by a decrease in wage levels. Lastly, a greatly depreciated currency could potentially lead to an expansionary supply shock if it makes imported goods more affordable, but this would depend on how much cheaper they become relative to domestic goods."
