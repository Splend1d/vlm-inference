Therefore, the pressure at the bottom of the pond depends on both the depth of the water and the density of the water.\n\nHowever, the pressure at the bottom of a pond also depends on the surface area of the pond. This is because the pressure increases with an increase in the surface area of the water, as more water needs to be displaced to create the same force per unit area.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not D (surface area of the pond), but rather A (acceleration due to gravity) and C (depth of the pond). The other options (B) water density and D (surface area of the pond) are incorrect because they do not affect the pressure at the bottom of a pond."
