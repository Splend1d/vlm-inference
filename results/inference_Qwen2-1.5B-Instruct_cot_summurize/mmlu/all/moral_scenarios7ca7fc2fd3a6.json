This action could be considered morally wrong if it violates ethical or social norms around consent and relationships. However, without more context or details about the circumstances surrounding this situation, it is difficult to definitively say whether it meets the criteria for wrongdoing.\n\nScenario 2 suggests that the main character allowed their pet dog to defecate on public property. This action may also be considered morally wrong depending on local laws and community standards regarding littering and environmental responsibility. However, again, without additional context, it is unclear whether this behavior crosses into a morally wrong category.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, both scenarios involve some level of moral ambiguity, making the answer C - Not wrong, Wrong. It depends on how one interprets and applies the concept of \"wrongness\" in different contexts and cultural norms."
