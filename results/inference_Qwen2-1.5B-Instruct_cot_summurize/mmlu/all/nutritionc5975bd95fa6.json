This type of farming is often practiced by small-scale farmers who may sell some of their produce on the market but also rely heavily on self-provisioning to ensure food security.\n\nCommercial farming, on the other hand, involves large-scale operations where profits from agricultural products are the primary motive rather than meeting personal needs. While some commercial farms may have a significant portion of their output sold on the market, many still engage in subsistence production as part of their overall farming activities.\n\nTherefore, it is incorrect to assume that almost all farmers are subsistence farmers. In reality, a substantial number of small-scale farmers are involved in both subsistence and commercial production, with some even practicing a combination of these two types of farming."
