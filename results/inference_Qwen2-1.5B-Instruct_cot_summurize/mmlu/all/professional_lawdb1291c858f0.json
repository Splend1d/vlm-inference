As part of their agreement, a courier was hired to pick up the card from the dealer and transport it to the collector. The courier was then to get the purchase money from the collector and bring it back to the dealer. But rather than entrusting the genuine card to the courier, the dealer gave him a counterfeit replica that was valueless. After picking up the envelope containing the replica, the courier left the dealer's home and embarked on his trip. The police, however, received a tip concerning the scheme and intercepted the courier's car before he left the city limits. Thereafter, the dealer was arrested and charged with attempting to obtain property by false pretenses. If the dealer contends that the scheme had not progressed far enough to constitute an attempt, it will\n\nA. be to his advantage to claim that the courier was his accomplice and was participating in the scheme to receive a share of the proceeds.\nB. be to his advantage to claim that the courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the dealer to make the delivery.\nC. be to his advantage to claim that the courier knew nothing of the scheme but was simply hired by the collector to make the delivery.\nD. make no difference whether the courier was the dealer's accomplice or was an innocent agent.\n"

It could have been an accident or a misunderstanding on the part of the dealer. Therefore, the dealer cannot rely on the courier being an accomplice to the fraud.\n\nAdditionally, even if the courier did know about the scheme, he would still need to have acted on that knowledge to commit the crime. In this case, the courier picked up the replica and transported it without knowing that it was a counterfeit. Therefore, the courier cannot be held liable for the dealer's actions.\n\nTherefore, the dealer cannot argue that the courier was his accomplice or that he knew nothing of the scheme. The only defense available to the dealer is that the scheme had not progressed far enough to constitute an attempt. However, this defense may also fail depending on the specific facts of the case."
