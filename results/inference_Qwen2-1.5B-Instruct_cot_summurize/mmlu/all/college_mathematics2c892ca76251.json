We're given that there are 14 more subsets in \\(X\\) containing exactly 3 elements compared to those containing exactly 2 elements.\n\nThe formula for the number of subsets of a set \\(S\\) (where \\(n \\geq 0\\)) is \\(2^n\\), because each element can either be included or not, giving us two choices for every position in the subset.\n\nFor subsets with exactly 2 elements:\n- There are \\(2^{|X|-2}\\) such subsets.\n- Since we have 14 more subsets with exactly 3 elements than those with exactly 2, and considering both cases together, we can say there are \\(2^{|X|-2} + 14\\) subsets with exactly 2 elements.\n\nFor subsets with exactly 3 elements:\n- Each subset contains exactly 3 elements, so there are \\(2^{|X|-3}\\) such subsets.\n\nWe're asked how many subsets of \\(X\\) contain exactly 4 elements. This means we need to consider all possible combinations of 4 elements from the set \\(X\\).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we find the total number of subsets by adding the number of subsets with exactly 2 elements to the number of subsets with exactly 3 elements:\n\n\\[|X| = 2^{|X|-2} + 2^{|X|-3}.\\]\n\nSince we know \\(2^{|X|-2} + 14 = |X|\\), we can substitute this into our equation to solve for \\(|X|\\):\n\n\\[|X| = 2^{|X|-2} + 2^{|X|-3} - 14.\\]\n\nTo find the exact value of \\(|X|\\), we would typically calculate it directly using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but since we're looking for specific values rather than an algebraic expression, let's approach it through another method.\n\nGiven that \\(|X| = 2^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) represents the number of elements in \\(X\\), we want to find \\(k\\) such that \\(2^{k-2} + 2^{k-3} = 2^{|X|-2} + 14\\).\n\nThis simplifies to \\(2^{k-2} + 2^{k-3} - 14 = 2^{|X|-2}\\), which gives us \\(2^{k-3} = 2^{|X|-2}\\), implying \\(k-3 = |X|-2\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(k = |X|+1\\).\n\nNow, to find the number of subsets with exactly 4 elements, we simply plug \\(k=|X|+1\\) back into the formula for the number of subsets with exactly 4 elements:\n\n\\[|X| = 2^{(|X|+1)-2} + 2^{(|X|+1)-3}\\]\n\\[|X| = 2^{|X|} + 2^{|X|}\\]\n\\[|X| = 2*|X|\\]\n\\[|X| = 0,\\] which doesn't make sense since \\(X\\) must be non-empty.\n\nIt seems there was a misunderstanding in the question formulation, as the correct interpretation does not lead to a meaningful answer due to the nature of the problem statement. The provided information suggests a misinterpretation of the question or misunderstanding regarding the mathematical principles applied. Let me rephrase it:\n\nGiven \\(|X|\\) subsets of \\(X\\) that contain exactly 2 elements, there are 14 more subsets of \\(X\\) that contain exactly 3 elements. To find out how many subsets of \\(X\\) contain exactly 4 elements, we should first determine what \\(|X|\\) is based on the condition provided, then apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count subsets with exactly 4 elements.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the question might be asking for the number of subsets of \\(X\\) that contain exactly 4 elements, rather than how many subsets \\(X\\) has in total. In this case, we proceed similarly to before, substituting the known conditions and solving for \\(|X|\\), but then applying the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the actual number of subsets with exactly 4 elements.\n\nHowever, without further clarification, my previous explanation doesn't provide a clear path forward or an accurate solution. If you could clarify the intended question or context, I'd be happy to help further!"
