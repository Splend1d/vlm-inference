Hormonal factors such as loss of estrogen\n\nLoss of estrogen is one of the main causes of osteoporosis, which is a condition characterized by a decrease in bone density and strength. Other lifestyle factors that can contribute to bone loss include smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity. Genetic factors play a role in some cases, but they are less common than lifestyle factors. Cohort factors refer to differences among people who were born at different times, which may or may not be related to bone density loss."
