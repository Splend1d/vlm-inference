This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the individual's pain experience and helps in tailoring an effective treatment plan that considers all aspects of their well-being. Regular reassessment ensures that the plan remains up-to-date and can adapt to changes in the patient's condition or preferences over time. Limiting drug side effects is also important, but it should not be seen as the primary focus, especially if other aspects of the plan are compromised due to this consideration."
