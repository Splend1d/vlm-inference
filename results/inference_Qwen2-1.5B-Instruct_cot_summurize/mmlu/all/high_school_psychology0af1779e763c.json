Dissociation refers to the breakdown of the mind into distinct and independent parts that operate independently from one another. The hidden observer is an aspect of this theory that suggests that certain aspects of our behavior or mental states may be controlled by unconscious processes that are not directly observable.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. dissociation."
