                    "text": "The electric field strength due to a point charge at a distance r from its origin is given by:\n\nE = k * q / r^2\n\nwhere E is the electric field strength, k is Coulomb's constant (approximately 8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2), q is the magnitude of the charge, and r is the distance.\n\nFor a sphere of radius R, we can approximate the total charge Q by integrating the charge density \u03c1(r) over the entire surface of the sphere:\n\nQ = \u222b[0,R] \u03c1(r) dr\n\nSubstituting the expression for \u03c1(r) gives:\n\nQ = \u222b[0,R] ar dr = aR^2/2\n\nThus, the net charge on the sphere is Q = aR^2/2. The electric field at any point in space will be proportional to the net charge divided by the square of the distance from the center of the sphere. \n\nFor a spherical charge distribution varying with radius r according to \u03c1 = ar, the electric field at any point r away from the center will be:\n\nE = k * [aR^2/2] / r^2 = aR^4/(2r^2k)\n\nThis expression shows that the electric field strength increases non-linearly with r for r < R, because the denominator r^2 grows faster than the numerator aR^4. This behavior is typical for non-uniform charge distributions like those found in real-world scenarios. Therefore, the correct answer is D. It increases non-linearly for r < R."
