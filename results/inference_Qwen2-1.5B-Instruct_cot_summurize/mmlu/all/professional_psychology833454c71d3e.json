Conditioning\n\nResearch into conditioning has helped us understand paradoxical reward, which refers to the phenomenon where individuals experience negative outcomes after performing an action that was previously rewarding or enjoyable. This research has shown how learning and memory can be used to create conditions in which rewards become counterproductive, leading to unexpected negative consequences."
