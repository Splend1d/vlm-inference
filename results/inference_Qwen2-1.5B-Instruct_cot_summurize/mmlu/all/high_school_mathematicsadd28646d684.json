This means that every point on the graph of $f(x)$ is equidistant from the origin.\nNow consider the function $g(x)=f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)$.\nIf we shift $g(x)$ by $a$ units to the right, we get $g(x+a)=f\\left(\\frac{x+a}{5}\\right)$.\nFor this new function to be equal to $f\\left(\\frac{x}{5}\\right)$, we must have $\\frac{x+a}{5} = \\frac{x}{5}$,\nwhich implies $a=5$.\nTherefore, the smallest positive value of $a$ such that the new function is identical to the old one is $5$.
