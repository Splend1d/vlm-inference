So, if we rewrite the expression as \\(8 \\times (-7) \\times (-1)\\), it's equivalent to \\((-7) \\times 8 \\times (-1)\\). \n\nUsing the distributive property, which says that \\(a(b + c) = ab + ac\\), we can see that this simplifies to:\n\n\\[8 \\times (-7) \\times (-1) = -7 \\times (-7) + (-7) \\times 8\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate each part separately:\n\n- \\((-7) \\times (-7) = 49\\)\n- \\((-7) \\times 8 = -56\\)\n\nSo, combining these results gives us:\n\n\\[49 + (-56) = 49 - 56\\]\n\nTo subtract, we need a common denominator for the two numbers: 49 and -56.\n\n- Convert -56 into an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 49:\n\\[56 \\div 49 = \\frac{28}{9}\\]\n- Now subtract:\n\\[49 - \\frac{28}{9} = \\frac{401}{9}\\]\n\nSo, the simplified form is \\(\\frac{401}{9}\\), but since we're looking for an integer answer, we should express this as a mixed number or decimal, but the question asks for the simplest form of the expression before simplifying further. The closest choice to our result after simplification would be A. \u221263. However, without considering the original problem context, the correct interpretation might vary depending on how the question intends to be answered. If you meant to ask about simplifying the given expression, then B. 56 would indeed be the simplest form, not A. \u221263."
