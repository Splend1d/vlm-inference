To determine whether this is a minimum or maximum, we'll look at the sign of \\(y''(x)\\), which represents the second derivative of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\). However, since \\(y\\) is always positive for all real values of \\(x\\), the second derivative test does not apply directly here.\n\nInstead, we can analyze the behavior of \\(y\\) around \\(x = 1\\):\n\nAs \\(x\\) approaches \\(1^+\\), \\(y\\) increases without bound as \\(e^{-x}\\) grows exponentially while \\(x\\) remains constant. As \\(x\\) approaches \\(1^-\\), \\(y\\) decreases towards zero due to the negative exponent.\n\nThus, based on these observations, we conclude that the maximum occurs when \\(x = 1\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 1\\) back into the original function gives us:\n\\[f(1) = e(1)^{-1} = e\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. e**."
