The international recognition of human rights after World War II\n\nThe International Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in 1948, was one of the most significant events that led to the revival of natural law in the 20th century. It marked the beginning of an era where states were recognized as having obligations under international law towards individuals and groups. This recognition paved the way for the development of human rights conventions and international organizations such as the United Nations, which continue to promote and protect human rights around the world today."
