This is because it is located in the submandibular region of the neck, which is easily accessible through the oral cavity. The gland is also commonly felt when the tongue is moved towards the palate, as it is attached to the floor of the mouth. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to perform a thorough examination of the oral cavity and neck area to identify any signs of an enlarged submandibular salivary gland."
