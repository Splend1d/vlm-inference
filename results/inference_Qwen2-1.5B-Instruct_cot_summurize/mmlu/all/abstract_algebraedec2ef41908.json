This statement is false because in general, if a homomorphism f from G to H exists, then the kernel of f must be a subgroup of G. If there were no elements in the kernel, then it would mean that the codomain H has more elements than the domain G, which contradicts the fact that f is a well-defined homomorphism. Therefore, the kernel cannot be empty.\n\nStatement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group. This statement is also false. For example, the homomorphism \u03c6 : Z \u2192 Q (the integers Z under addition into the rational numbers Q) is a nontrivial homomorphism since it maps every integer n to a unique fraction with a nonzero numerator and denominator. Similarly, we can consider any other finite group G and map it onto any other infinite group H by finding a surjective homomorphism \u03c6 : G \u2192 H. So, both statements are false."
