However, based on current projections, it is estimated that if everyone drove an electric car, the US would need about 100 million electric vehicles.\nAssuming each vehicle consumes 4 kWh of electricity per day (which is typical for an electric vehicle), the total daily energy requirement would be 4 * 100 million = 400 billion kWh.\nMultiplying this by the number of days in a year (365) gives us approximately 1.4 trillion kWh of energy required per year.\nFinally, multiplying this by the number of years in a century (100) gives us a total of 14 quadrillion Joules of energy required.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 2*10^25 J."
