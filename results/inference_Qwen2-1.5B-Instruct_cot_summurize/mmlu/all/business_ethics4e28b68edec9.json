Corporate profit maximization may be considered as an ethical consideration in the context of business practices, but it does not necessarily align with the principles of other normative theories such as hedonistic utilitarianism or preference utilitarianism.

It is not specific to business ethics and does not prescribe any particular approach to maximizing profits."
