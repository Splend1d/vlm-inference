The good is inferior and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.\n\nWhen there is a decrease in price, consumers may be willing to buy more of a good due to the substitution effect (if they can substitute other goods for this one). However, if the good is considered inferior (i.e., it does not provide as much satisfaction as other goods), the income effect will dominate, leading to a decrease in quantity demanded and an upward-sloping demand curve. In this case, the good is also likely to be a luxury good or a necessity that has become less affordable due to inflation or economic changes."
