This does not contribute to lower voting rates among Americans in the 18-to-25 age bracket. \n\nOption A, college attendance in a state other than one's home state, can contribute to lower voting rates because individuals who have attended college may be more likely to be educated on political issues and have greater interest in participating in elections.\n\nOption B, frequent relocation of one's primary residence, can also contribute to lower voting rates among young people because they may not have the same level of familiarity with local politics as someone who has lived in the same area for their entire life.\n\nOption C, the remoteness of most political issues to the daily lives of young people, can contribute to lower voting rates among young people because they may not feel connected to or interested in the issues that affect their communities and the country as a whole.\n\nTherefore, none of these options directly contribute to lower voting rates among Americans in the 18-to-25 age bracket."
