They ordered him out of the car and saw a cellophane package protruding from under the seat. The package contained a white powdery substance, which the officers suspected to be cocaine. The officers placed the driver under arrest and put him in the rear of their patrol car. They then proceeded to search the rest of the driver's car. In the trunk they found an assault rifle that was later determined to be the weapon used in a liquor store robbery. Charged with that robbery, the driver moved to suppress the assault rifle as evidence on the grounds that the police did not have a warrant to search the trunk. The best theory that the prosecution can use in support of the admissibility of the assault rifle as evidence is that\n\nA. the police conducted an automobile search.\nB. the police conducted an inventory search.\nC. the search was incident to a lawful arrest.\nD. the search was made under exigent circumstances.\n"

An \"incident to a lawful arrest\" means that the search must occur during or immediately after the arrest, and the search must be related to the purpose of the arrest. In this case, the officers had probable cause to believe that the driver was involved in a drug trafficking operation and had just committed a crime (the liquor store robbery). Therefore, the search of the driver's car, including the search of the trunk, was reasonable and supported by the officer's belief that the items inside could be relevant to the investigation."
