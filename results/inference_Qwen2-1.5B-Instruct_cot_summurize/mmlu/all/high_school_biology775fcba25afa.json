                    "text": "The correct answer is D: Both A and C.\n\nIf an autosomal gene with a fixed dominant allele is mutated and introduces a new recessive allele, natural selection will cause stabilizing selection at this locus. This means that individuals who carry the recessive allele will be more likely to survive and reproduce compared to those who do not have it. Over time, this will lead to a decrease in the frequency of the dominant allele and an increase in the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nAs a result, the proportion of the population that is heterozygous at this locus (i.e., having both copies of the gene) will also decrease. However, it is possible for some individuals to become homozygous for the recessive allele (i.e., only carrying one copy), but they may still be able to pass on their recessive allele to their offspring through meiosis. Therefore, there may be some individuals in the population that are homozygous for the recessive allele, even though their genotype is heterozygous.\n\nOverall, the population's average heterozygosity should increase as a result of these changes, as more individuals are passing on the recessive allele to their offspring through meiosis."
