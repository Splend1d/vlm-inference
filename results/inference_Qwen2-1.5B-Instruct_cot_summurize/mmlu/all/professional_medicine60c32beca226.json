The man also has microcytic anemia, indicating he might carry a mutation as well. Together, these mutations could result in a two-gene deletion.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies that the two-gene deletion is in trans (i.e., it involves only one deletion on the maternal gene and one on the paternal gene), we should consider this scenario. In this case, the probability that a child inherits the two-gene deletion from each parent would be:\n\n1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n\nTherefore, if the two-gene deletion is in trans, the percentage of their offspring that will have the two-gene deletion is 25%. \n\nAnswer: B. 25%"
