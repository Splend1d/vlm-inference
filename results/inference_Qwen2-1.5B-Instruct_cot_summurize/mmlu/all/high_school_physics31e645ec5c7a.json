So,\n\nV = 18 + 3\n= 21 V\n\nSince the question asks for the potential difference between the origin and the point (3, 4), we subtract the potential at the origin from the potential at the point (3, 4):\n\nPotential Difference = V_(point) - V_(origin) = 21 - 18 = 6 V\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 64 V."
