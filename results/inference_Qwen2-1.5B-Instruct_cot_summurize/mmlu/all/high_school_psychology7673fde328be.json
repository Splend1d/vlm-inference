When challenged to commit a crime, people will most often refuse if they are not coerced, but will agree if an authority figure coerces them.\nC.

When an authority figure is present, people are more likely to obey orders than to question the wisdom of the orders.\n\nStanley Milgram's study of obedience found that when people are faced with a difficult decision, they tend to conform to the opinions of the majority rather than deviate from them. However, when challenged to commit a crime, people will usually refuse unless they are being coerced by an authority figure. In other words, people are more likely to comply with orders from an authority figure in situations where there is a high degree of uncertainty or ambiguity about what should be done.\n\nSimilarly, Milgram found that when people are asked to inflict pain on others, they are more likely to inflict mild amounts of pain without any moral qualms. This suggests that people may be less willing to cause harm to others if they are aware that they are being watched or monitored by an authority figure.\n\nOverall, Milgram's research suggests that people are more likely to comply with orders and conform to group norms in situations where there is a strong sense of authority and coercion."
