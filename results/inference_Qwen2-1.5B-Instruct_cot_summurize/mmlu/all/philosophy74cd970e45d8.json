He believes that morality should be based on the principles of autonomy, consent, and reason rather than on religious or divine authority. According to Gauthier, moral agents must be able to make free and informed choices about how they act towards others, and this requires a recognition of the autonomy and agency of each individual. Additionally, Gauthier emphasizes the importance of respect for autonomy and consent in moral decision-making. Therefore, his view on morality is closely related to the concept of autonomy and consent."
