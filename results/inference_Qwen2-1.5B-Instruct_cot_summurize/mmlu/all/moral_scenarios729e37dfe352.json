Therefore, the main character's actions would be considered morally wrong.\n\nOption A: Wrong, Wrong - This is the correct answer based on the analysis provided.\n  \nScenarios 2 and 3 can both be seen as morally neutral or even slightly positive depending on context. However, they are not explicitly wrong under the given criteria of the question. Therefore, the correct answer for this scenario is B: Not wrong, Not wrong."
