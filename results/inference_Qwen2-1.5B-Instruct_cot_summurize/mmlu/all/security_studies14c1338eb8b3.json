All of these options.\n\nCoercive diplomacy refers to the use of military or other forms of force to achieve one's goals, either by direct intervention or through the threat of force. In contemporary security studies, coercive diplomacy has become increasingly prominent as a tool for international power bargaining and conflict resolution. This can include actions such as military interventions, economic sanctions, and diplomatic pressure to influence other nations' behavior. While deterrence remains an important aspect of coercive diplomacy, it is not the only strategy being used. Additionally, the \"softly-softly\" approach to diplomacy mentioned in option B is also relevant in modern times, where states may seek to negotiate and compromise rather than resorting to full-scale war. Overall, coercive diplomacy continues to be an active and influential aspect of international relations in the 21st century."
