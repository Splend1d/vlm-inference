These duties arise from the natural and rational inclination of human beings towards certain moral principles.\n\nWhile it may be possible to determine which actions align with these principles (for example, helping others), it is not always clear what actions would be considered morally wrong without any explicit guidance. Therefore, we cannot prove or know our prima facie duties."
