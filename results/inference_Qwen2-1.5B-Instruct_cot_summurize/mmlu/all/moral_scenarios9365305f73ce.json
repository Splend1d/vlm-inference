Wrong, Not wrong\n\nScenario 1 involves the use of firearms by a parent with young children, which is generally considered morally wrong due to the potential harm it could cause to the children and society at large. However, this scenario specifically involves the use of firearms, which is already illegal for minors under certain circumstances, so there is no clear violation of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nScenario 2 involves taking money from a bank, which is generally considered a legal and ethical act. The only issue here is that the character did not report any suspicious activity or try to steal the money, but rather simply took it out of habit. This action is still considered morally acceptable in most situations where one has access to cash and does not intend to commit fraud."
