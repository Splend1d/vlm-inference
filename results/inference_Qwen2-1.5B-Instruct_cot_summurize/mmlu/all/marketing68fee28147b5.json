Stratified and convenience samples\n- D. Random and cluster samples\n\nNon-random samples can be classified into different categories based on their sampling techniques. The main types of non-random samples are:\n\n1. Convenience sample: This is a sample that is selected because it is readily available or easy to obtain, such as selecting participants from a particular group (e.g., students) for a survey.\n\n2. Quota sample: This is a sample that is selected according to certain criteria or quotas, such as selecting participants who have a specific characteristic (e.g., age, gender) for a survey.\n\n3. Cluster sample: This is a sample that is selected by grouping individuals into clusters based on common characteristics or attributes, such as selecting households in an area with similar income levels for a survey.\n\n4. Stratified sample: This is a sample that is selected by dividing the population into strata based on certain characteristics, such as age groups or gender, and then selecting random samples from each stratum to create the final sample.\n\n5. Random sample: This is a sample that is selected randomly from the entire population, without any bias or preference towards any individual or group. It is often used when the researcher has no control over the selection process and wants to ensure that all members of the population have an equal chance of being selected."
