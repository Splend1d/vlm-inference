Neighbor, who owns the adjacent property to the East, built a driveway whose western boundary is along the border of homeowner's property. The excavator dug the driveway five feet deep. The land began to subside along the line of excavation and about three feet of homeowner's land fell off into the driveway, making that part of her property useless. Homeowner demanded that neighbor fill in the property to buttress the erosion created. That was not done and the erosion continued to occur. Homeowner sued and asked for an injunction compelling the neighbor to build and maintain a retaining wall. Will the court rule for the plaintiff/homeowner?\n\nA. Yes, because excavation is an abnormally dangerous activity and neighbor is absolutely liable for any damages caused by the violation.\nB. Yes, because every landowner has a right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state.\nC. No, because the neighbor did not go onto the adjacent land and confined all excavation to his own land.\nD. No, the right to lateral support is a common law right that has been abrogated by statute in virtually all states so that the right no longer exists.\n"

                    "text": "The answer is C. No, because the neighbor did not go onto the adjacent land and confined all excavation to his own land. \n\nUnder the doctrine of abatement, the landowner has the right to have the soil or other materials supporting the property be maintained at its original depth. This means that if the neighbor excavated beyond the original depth of the soil, the landowner would have the right to require the neighbor to backfill the area.\n\nHowever, this does not apply if the excavation was done in a manner that could cause damage to the neighboring landowner's property without their consent. In such cases, the landowner may be able to sue for damages under a common law claim of nuisance or trespass.\n\nIn summary, while the neighbor had the right to excavate within the boundaries of his own property, they did not encroach upon the landowner's property and did not cause any harm to the landowner's property. Therefore, the landowner does not have the right to compel the neighbor to fill in the area.\n\nTherefore, option A (Yes) is incorrect as there is no evidence of any abnormally dangerous activity on the part of the neighbor. Option B (Yes) is also incorrect as the neighbor did not go onto the adjacent land and confine all excavation to their own land. Option D (No) is correct as the landowner does not have the right to compel the neighbor to fill in the area due to the neighbor's actions being outside the scope of the landowner's rights."
