Since each operation lasts for 60 seconds, the total time will be \\(60x\\).\n\nThe cost equation becomes:\n\\[3.25 = \\frac{60}{x} \\times 3.25\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\\[x = \\frac{60}{3.25} = 18.75\\]\n\nThis means Marcus needed to do 19 operations (since he cannot complete a fraction of an operation) to wash his car completely, but since he washed it once, the actual time taken was \\(60 \\times 19 = 540\\) seconds.\n\nConverting this to minutes:\n\\[540 \\text{ seconds} = 540 / 3600 = 0.15 \\text{ minutes}\\]\n\nSo, Marcus took approximately 0.15 minutes or 1 minute and 0.15 minutes to wash his car.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A. 10 minutes**."
