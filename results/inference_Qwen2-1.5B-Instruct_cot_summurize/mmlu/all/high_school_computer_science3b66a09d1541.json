The program can also be expressed as binary code, but will be more easily understood by humans when expressed in a higher-level programming language.\n\nWhen a program is written in a high-level programming language, it is easier for humans to understand and modify the code than when it is written directly in binary code. This is because high-level languages use simpler syntax and have built-in error checking mechanisms that help prevent errors from occurring during execution. Binary code, on the other hand, requires specialized hardware and software to interpret and execute the instructions. Therefore, while binary code may be useful for representing data, it is not a suitable way to express programs for human understanding or modification."
