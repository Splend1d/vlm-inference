The sympathetic nervous system.\n\nWhen there is a crisis or emergency, the adrenal glands in the body release \"emergency\" hormones to prepare the body for either fighting or fleeing from danger. This is done through the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for regulating the body's response to stress and emergencies. \n\nThe somatic nervous system controls the muscles and other physical functions, the sensorimotor nervous system coordinates movement and sensory perception, and the central nervous system controls higher-level cognitive processes such as thinking and planning. So while all these systems are involved in responding to stress, it is the sympathetic nervous system that is primarily responsible for the immediate physiological changes associated with the \"fight-or-flight\" response."
