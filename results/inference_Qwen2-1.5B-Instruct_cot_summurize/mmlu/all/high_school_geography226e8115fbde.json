Main disease related to age and lifestyle\n\nDeveloped countries typically have high levels of education, healthcare, and income equality compared to developing countries. This means that people tend to live longer, healthier lives with fewer chronic diseases associated with aging and lifestyle factors like smoking, obesity, and lack of physical activity. Developed countries also have more advanced healthcare systems that provide better access to medical care for their citizens.\n\nOn the other hand, developing countries often face higher birth and death rates due to poverty, inadequate healthcare, and poor living conditions. Agriculture remains an important sector in many developing countries, but it is not as dominant or as large a contributor to GDP as in developed countries.\n\nWomen's status in society is generally improved in developed countries compared to developing countries where they may be discriminated against or held in a subordinate position. However, this does not necessarily mean women are treated equally in every aspect of life.\n\nSo, the characteristic of a developed country that you should choose from the given options is C. Main disease related to age and lifestyle."
