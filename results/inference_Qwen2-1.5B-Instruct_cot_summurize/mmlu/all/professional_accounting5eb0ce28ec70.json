In this case, the useful life of the asset is 4 years (from May 1 to March 1).\n\nThe formula for calculating the depreciation expense for a fixed asset is:\n\nDepreciation Expense = Cost / Useful Life\n\nFor the current year, the useful life is 4 years, so we use the formula:\n\nDepreciation Expense = $10,000 / 4 = $2,500\n\nSince the asset was sold on March 1, the remaining useful life is 3 years.\n\nNow, let's calculate the depreciation expense for the next two years:\n\n- Second year: Depreciation Expense = $10,000 * 32% / 3 = $2,000\n- Third year: Depreciation Expense = $10,000 * 19.2% / 3 = $800\n\nAdding these amounts together gives us the total depreciation expense for the current year:\n\nTotal Depreciation Expense = $2,000 + $800 = $2,800\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $2,000."
