This gives us:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total seats} = (x + 2) + (x + 5) + 7 \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total seats} = 2x + 10 \\]\n\nWe know that the total number of seats is equal to the number of desks plus 1 (since it includes the empty desks), which equals 7 + 1 = 8 seats.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[ 2x + 10 = 8 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ 2x = 8 - 10 \\]\n\\[ 2x = -2 \\]\n\\[ x = -1 \\]\n\nThis result doesn't make sense because \\(x\\) cannot be negative in this context. It seems there might be an error in the interpretation or setup of the problem. However, based on the given information, if we assume the correct interpretation was meant (considering only the desks where someone is sitting and not including the empty desks), the question asks how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit, not directly related to the total number of seats or desks in the classroom. \n\nIf we were to calculate the exact position of Kim (assuming she is seated between two desks), assuming she starts at the first desk and moves clockwise, then Kim would be sitting \\(2 + 3 = 5\\) seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer considering the given interpretation is C. 5. If you intended to ask about the total number of seats, please clarify your question."
