For example:\n\n1. Heroin use was much higher among military personnel in Vietnam than it was among veterans who returned to the United States. This suggests that people may be more likely to use a drug if they have access to it.\n\n2. The percentage of physicians who use psychoactive drugs is much higher than the general population. This could indicate that some individuals may be taking these drugs even if they do not need them for medical purposes.\n\n3. Alcohol abuse declines when the law restricts the times it can be legally sold. This suggests that people may avoid using certain drugs because they know they cannot get them easily.\n\n4. All of the above. These examples show that there are many factors that contribute to increased drug use and that access to drugs can play a role in this increase."
