Determine the number of days worked in June (excluding weekends).\n   - There are 10 workdays from June 15 to June 30.\n   - Since the company pays salaries every other Friday, there will be 2 Fridays (June 16 & June 17) where no salary expense is recorded since they are not workdays.\n\n2. Calculate the total salary expense for the 10 workdays.\n   - The company pays salaries every other Friday, so we can divide the 10 workdays by 2 to get the number of pay periods.\n   - There are 10/2 = 5 pay periods.\n   - Each pay period includes one full week (Monday through Friday), which means each pay period has an average of 5 working days.\n   - Therefore, the total salary expense for the 10 workdays is $10,000 / 5 = $2000 per pay period.\n\n3. Add the total salary expense for the 10 workdays to the previous month's balance ($14,000).\n   - Total salary expense = $2000 * 10 = $20,000\n\nSo, Lind should report $20,000 as salaries expense in its income statement for the month ended June 30. \n\nThe correct answer is C. $20,000."
