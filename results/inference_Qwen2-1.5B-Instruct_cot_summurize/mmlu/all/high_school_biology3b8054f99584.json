                    "text": "The correct answer is B: Breast milk contains maternal antibodies that protect against gastrointestinal pathogens.\n\nThis is because breastfeeding provides an excellent source of nutrients and antibodies for infants, which helps to protect them from infections caused by harmful bacteria and viruses. The antibodies in breast milk help to strengthen the immune system of the baby, making it less susceptible to illnesses later on in life. Additionally, breast milk is rich in nutrients like protein, calcium, and iron, which are essential for the growth and development of the baby's body. Overall, breastfeeding is considered one of the most beneficial ways to provide nutrition and protection for newborns."
