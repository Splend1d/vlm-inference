The blood glucose level during moderate to intense exercise typically stays fairly constant, but it can fluctuate within the normal range. This is because the body's response to exercise involves both increasing glucose production and decreasing glucose utilization. It is important to note that this information may vary depending on individual factors such as age, gender, fitness level, and overall health. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program or altering your current one."
