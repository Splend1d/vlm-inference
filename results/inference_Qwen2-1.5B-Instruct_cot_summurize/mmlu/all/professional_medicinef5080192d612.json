Past medical history reveals cystic fibrosis. Examination of the knee reveals fluctuance on palpation of the joint but no increased warmth; mild restriction in range of motion due to the swelling is also noted. Numerous bruises are noted in various stages of resolution. Further history reveals easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month. The most likely explanation for these findings is\n\nA. acquired factor VIII deficiency\nB. diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection\nC. hypocomplementemia\nD. malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K\n"

                    "text": "The most likely explanation for these findings is:\n\nA. acquired factor VIII deficiency\n\nFactor VIII is a protein that helps blood clot properly. In Factor VIII deficiency, an individual does not have enough of this protein in their blood, which can lead to prolonged bleeding after minor injuries or surgery.\n\nAcquired factor VIII deficiency is more common in people with certain conditions like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, or hemophilia. It's possible that the patient's condition has contributed to his symptoms, including the sudden onset of swelling in his knee and the bruising he experienced.\n\nThe other options listed (diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection, hypocomplementemia, malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K) do not directly explain the symptoms described in the question. Diffuse intravascular coagulation usually results in extensive bleeding, while hypocomplementemia typically causes recurrent infections. Malabsorption of vitamins would be expected to cause symptoms related to deficiencies in those specific nutrients rather than the ones mentioned here."
