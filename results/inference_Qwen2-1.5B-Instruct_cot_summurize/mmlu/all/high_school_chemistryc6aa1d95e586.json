This process is called alpha (\u03b1) decay or beta (\u03b2) decay. In \u03b1 decay, the nucleus emits an alpha particle (a helium-4 nucleus) and loses one unit of mass. The atomic number of the element remains unchanged during this process.\n\nIn \u03b2 decay, the nucleus emits either a beta particle (electron) or a positron, which can be accompanied by the emission of a photon. During \u03b2 decay, the atomic number of the element decreases by one unit. After three half-lives, approximately 75% of the initial amount of the isotope has decayed. Therefore, 12.5% of the isotope remains.\n\nIt's important to note that the remaining percentage could vary depending on the specific isotope being discussed. For example, in carbon-14, which is used as a radiocarbon dating method, about 50% of the original sample will have decayed after one half-life, but only about 35% after two half-lives."
