Inflation\n\nInflation can be a significant threat to the macroeconomy during a peak in the business cycle because it can lead to higher prices for goods and services, which can reduce consumer purchasing power and increase pressure on businesses to raise prices further. This can ultimately lead to decreased economic growth and potentially even a recession if businesses are unable to pass along the increased costs to consumers."
