A promoter is a region of DNA that binds to transcription factors and initiates the process of gene expression by recruiting RNA polymerase to transcribe the gene into messenger RNA (mRNA). The presence or absence of a strong promoter can greatly affect the efficiency of transcription initiation for a given gene."
