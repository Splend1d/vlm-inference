A man took possession of the land in 1978 as an adverse possessor and remained on the land from 1978 to 1988; he then left the property to care for his sick mother for one year, returning the following year, 1990. Meanwhile, during the man's possession, the rancher devised the parcel to his son in 1994. The man remained on the property until2010. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. Upon the rancher's death in 2010, his son, as his sole heir, brings an ejectment suit to recover possession of the property from the man. In his action, the son will most probably\n\nA. lose, because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.\nB. win, because the statutory period for adverse possession does not run against a remainder- man until his interest becomes possessory.\nC. win, because the man left the property to take care of his mother for one year.\nD. win, because his title was perfected at the time of conveyance.\n"

If the party who seeks to establish the easement (the \"prevailing party\") acquires legal ownership of the property through adverse possession, they have established a valid easement even if the dominant tenement (the land over which the easement runs) is later conveyed to another person.\n\nIn this case, the rancher had a fee simple estate in the land. When he died in 2010, his son inherited the estate. Since the son had already taken possession of the land and maintained it for several years without any challenge, the son would have been considered the \"prevailing party\" under the law governing adverse possession. Therefore, the son would have successfully established an easement over the land and could bring an ejectment suit to recover possession from the man who had occupied the land since 1978."
