He assigned in writing 25 percent of any future royalties, when and if the screenplay was made into either a movie or a stage play, to his friend, who had subsidized him during his early years as a struggling writer. Shortly after the screenplay was completed, the author was killed in an auto accident. A movie studio then purchased the screenplay from the executors of the author's estate and filmed the movie Quiet Winter, which was a great success. In an action against the executors of the author's estate to recover her percentage of the movie royalties, the friend will most likely\n\nA. lose, because under the circumstances an assignment of future rights is unenforceable.\nB. lose, because the attempted gift of royalties failed for non-delivery.\nC. win, because she was an intended beneficiary.\nD. win, because the assignment of future rights is enforceable.\n"

However, it is important to note that the friend cannot collect on these royalties until after the author's death. This is known as a contingent interest and it can only be enforced if the author's estate is still alive at the time the royalty payments are due. \n\nTherefore, even though the friend may not have received any money from the author before their death, they do have a right to receive the remaining royalties once the author's estate is settled."
