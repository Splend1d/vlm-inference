One common symptom of hypothyroidism is weight gain, but this is not always present and can vary from person to person. Pre-tibial myxoedema is a more severe form of hypothyroidism that causes swelling of the legs and feet, but it is not typically associated with other symptoms like an increased TSH level or aversion to warm places."
