Dopamine and serotonin.\n\nPharmacological agents can alter the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, including dopamine and serotonin, which have been linked to fatigue. Dopamine plays a role in reward and pleasure, while serotonin regulates mood and sleep. Drugs that increase dopamine levels, such as amphetamines or cocaine, can lead to increased energy and alertness, but also come with potential side effects such as addiction. Similarly, drugs that increase serotonin levels, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can help improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression, but may not directly affect fatigue."
