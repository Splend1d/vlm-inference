The study enrolled shipyard workers who were diagnosed with mesothelioma and shipyard workers who were not diagnosed with mesothelioma. All subjects in the study had to have chest xrays. Which of the following is the best rationale for selecting a comparison group that had chest x-rays?\n\nA. Address confounding\nB. Demonstrate causality\nC. Minimize ascertainment bias\nD.
