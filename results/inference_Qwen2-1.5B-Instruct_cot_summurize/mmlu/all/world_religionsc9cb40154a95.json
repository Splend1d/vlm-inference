The Yin-Yang School of thought, also known as the Yin-Yang philosophy or the Taoist philosophy, emphasizes the balance between yin (\u9634) and yang (\u9633), which represents the complementary aspects of life. This school of thought was popular among naturalists who focused on natural elements and processes, such as philosophers like Confucius in China and Lao Tzu in ancient China. They believed that everything in nature follows this principle of balance and harmony, and that studying these principles could help humans understand and control their own lives more effectively."
