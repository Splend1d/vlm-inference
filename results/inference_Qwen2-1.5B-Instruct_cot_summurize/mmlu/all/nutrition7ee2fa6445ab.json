                    "text": "The statement that is correct regarding the replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is not necessarily true. While there is some evidence to suggest that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats can have benefits on cardiovascular health, including reducing triglyceride levels, this does not necessarily mean that all saturated fats are harmful.\nRegarding the other options:\n\n  * B: Replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated fats can actually increase LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) as these types of fats are more easily oxidized by the body into LDL particles.\n  * C: Consuming soluble dietary fiber and plant stanols/sterols has been shown to decrease LDL cholesterol and increase HDL (good cholesterol), but it's unclear if this effect is specific to these types of dietary components or if it also applies to other forms of dietary fiber.\n\nSo based on the information provided, the correct answer is D: \"Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations\". This statement suggests that replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates can lead to an increase in plasma triglycerides, which is consistent with previous research on the effects of high-carbohydrate diets on lipid profiles."
