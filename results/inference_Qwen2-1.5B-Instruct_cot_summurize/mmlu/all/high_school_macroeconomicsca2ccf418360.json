However, an increase in government spending or an increase in foreign income could cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left by reducing the quantity demanded of goods and services relative to their prices.\n\nAn expectation of surpluses of goods in the future, such as due to technological advancements that make production more efficient, could also cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left because it would reduce the quantity demanded of goods and services relative to their prices. This is known as the crowding out effect, where an increase in government spending reduces private sector investment and consumption, which in turn decreases aggregate demand. \n\nOverall, while expectations of surpluses of goods can be expected to have some impact on aggregate demand, they are unlikely to cause the curve to shift to the left without additional factors influencing both income levels and expectations of future surplus."
