                    "text": " First, we can rewrite the equation as:\n$$(\\frac{1}{25})^{x+2} = (5^2)^{-x}.$$\nUsing the property of exponents $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, we can simplify the right side to:\n$$(5^2)^{-x} = 5^{-2x}.$$\nSo our equation becomes:\n$$(\\frac{1}{25})^{x+2} = 5^{-2x}.$$\nNext, we can rewrite $\\frac{1}{25}$ as $5^{-2}$, so our equation becomes:\n$$(5^{-2})^{x+2} = 5^{-2x}.$$\nUsing the property of exponents again, we can simplify the left side to:\n$$(5^{-2(x+2)}) = 5^{-2x}.$$\nThis simplifies further to:\n$$5^{-2x-4} = 5^{-2x}.$$\nSince the bases are equal on both sides of the equation, the exponents must be equal:\n$$-2x - 4 = -2x.$$\nSubtracting $-2x$ from both sides gives:\n$$-4 = 0,$$\nwhich is not true.\nTherefore, there must have been an error in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.\n\nAfter re-examining the problem, we realize that we made a mistake when we simplified the right side of the equation. The correct way to simplify $(5^2)^{-x}$ is to use the power of a power rule, which states that $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$. So, we should have had:\n$$(5^2)^{-x} = 5^{-2x}.$$\nNow, let's try solving the equation again.\nWe start with the equation:\n$$(\\frac{1}{25})^{x+2} = 5^{-2x}.$$\nAgain, using the property of exponents, we can rewrite this as:\n$$\\left(5^{-2}\\right)^{x+2} = 5^{-2x}.$$\nApplying the power of a power rule, we get:\n$$5^{-2(x+2)} = 5^{-2x}.$$\nSimplifying the left side gives:\n$$5^{-2x-4} = 5^{-2x}.$$\nSince the bases are equal on both sides of the equation, the exponents must be equal:\n$$-2x - 4 = -2x.$$\nSubtracting $-2x$ from both sides gives:\n$$-4 = 0,$$\nwhich is still not true.\nLet's try another approach.\nNotice that if we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the original equation, we get:\n$$\\ln\\left((\\frac{1}{25})^{x+2}\\right) = \\ln(125^{-x}).$$\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\ln(a^b) = b\\ln(a)$, we can simplify the left side to:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right)^{x+2} = \\ln(125^{-x}).$$\nSimplifying the base of the first term gives:\n$$-\\ln(25)^{x+2} = -\\ln(125)^{-x}.$$\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\ln(a^b) = b\\ln(a)$ again, we can rewrite the left side as:\n$$-\\ln(25)^{x+2} = -\\ln(125)^{-x}.$$\nSimplifying the base of the second term gives:\n$$-\\ln(25)^{x+2} = -\\ln(125)^{-x}.$$\nSince the bases are equal on both sides of the equation, the exponents must be equal:\n$$x+2 = -x.$$\nAdding $x$ to both sides gives:\n$$2x+2 = 0.$$\nSubtracting $2$ from both sides gives:\n$$2x = -2.$$\nDividing both sides by $2$ gives:\n$$x = -1.$$\nHowever, this solution does not satisfy the original equation. Let's go back and check our work once more.\n\nUpon re-examining the problem carefully, we realize that we made a mistake when we applied the power of a power rule. When applying the power of a power rule, we should multiply the exponents instead of adding them. So, the correct step should be:\n$$(5^{-2})^{x+2} = 5^{-2x}.$$\nExpanding the left side gives:\n$$5^{-2(x+2)} = 5^{-2x}.$$\nSimplifying the"
