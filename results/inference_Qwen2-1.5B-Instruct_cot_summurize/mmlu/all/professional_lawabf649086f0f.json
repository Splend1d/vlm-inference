The officer gently grabbed the man's arm and said, \"Hey, I want to talk to you. \" The man responded, \"About what . . . I'm in a hurry to go home and watch the baseball game. \" The officer then remarked, \"Listen, what were you doing at the liquor store last week?\" The man stated, \"All right, man, I was there during the robbery. \" Whereupon, the officer placed the man under arrest and charged him with robbery. The man was taken to police headquarters where he was booked. For the first time, he was given his Miranda warnings. He then waived his rights and confessed to being an accessory during the liquor store robbery. Afterward, the court appointed an attorney to represent the man. The attorney moved to suppress both statements the man gave to the police. The trial court granted the motion with respect to the first statement as a violation of Miranda. The man's attorney now moves to suppress the secondstatement given at the police headquarters. This motion should be\n\nA. granted, because the second statement was the fruit of the first statement.\nB. granted, because the first statement was excluded, and the second statement is tainted.\nC. not granted, because the man had already confessed to the crime.\nD. not granted, because the second statement was volunteered after a knowing Miranda waiver.\n"

Arizona (1966), it is known as the Fruit of the Poison Tree doctrine. This doctrine holds that any evidence obtained from such a confession is inadmissible in court, unless the original statement can be shown to have been voluntary and freely made.\n\nIn this case, the first statement was obtained without the proper safeguards provided by Miranda, and therefore cannot be used against the defendant in court. The second statement, however, was voluntarily made after the first statement was excluded, making it admissible in court.\n\nTherefore, the court should grant the motion to suppress the second statement."
