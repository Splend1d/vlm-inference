Facial expressions\n\nFacial expressions are one of the most reliable indicators of emotions across all cultures because they are universal and can be easily observed by others. Other nonverbal cues, such as hand gestures, voice intonation, and body posture, may vary between different cultures or individuals, making them less reliable in cross-cultural comparisons.
