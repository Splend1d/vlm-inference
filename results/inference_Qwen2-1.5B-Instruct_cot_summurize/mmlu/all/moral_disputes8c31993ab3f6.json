A capacity for certain kinds of feelings or sentiments.\n\nMetz argues that dignity is based on the capacity for certain kinds of feelings or sentiments, such as empathy and compassion, which allow individuals to recognize and respect others' rights and capabilities. These emotions enable us to see ourselves and others as equal members of a community, rather than as objects to be used or exploited. Therefore, while other options may also contribute to our sense of dignity, empathy and compassion are central to understanding why we feel entitled to it."
