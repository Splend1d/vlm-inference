ORT involves using medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone to manage cravings for and reduce use of illicit opioids. By reducing the desire to use opioids, ORT helps individuals with HIV reduce their risk of transmitting the virus through shared injection paraphernalia and other means. Additionally, by reducing injection drug use, ORT can help prevent the spread of HIV among people who inject drugs."
