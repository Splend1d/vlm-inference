It sets a price below average variable cost to drive its competitors out of the market.\n\nIn a monopoly, the firm has complete control over the market and can set prices above marginal cost to maximize profits. To drive competitors out of the market, it may offer a price that is below the minimum average total cost (ATC) but above marginal cost. This creates a surplus where the firm can sell at a higher price without significantly reducing profit margins."
