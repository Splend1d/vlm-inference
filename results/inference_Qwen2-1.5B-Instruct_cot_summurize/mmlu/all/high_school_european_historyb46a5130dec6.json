Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .\nSuch are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.\n\u2014Galileo Galilei, 1610\nWhich of the following Polish thinkers was most likely the person whose ideas convinced Galileo to have written the statement above?\n\nA. Nicolaus Copernicus\nB. Johannes Kepler\nC. Galileo Galilei\nD. Josef Pilsudski\n"

The statement is about the four Medicean planets (Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter) that he had discovered and how they move around the Sun. The quote suggests that these planets also move around Jupiter and complete an annual cycle of twelve years.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Galileo Galilei."
