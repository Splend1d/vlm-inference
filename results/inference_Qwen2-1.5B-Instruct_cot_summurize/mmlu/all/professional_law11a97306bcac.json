The brothers took the wife hostage, pointed a gun at her head, and demanded that she drive them in her car to their hideout. As the wife was driving down the street, a woman pushing her baby in a stroller suddenly stopped in the middle of the intersection. In order to avoid hitting the woman and her child, the wife veered the car to the left, and intentionally struck a bystander, instantly killing him. If the wife is subsequently prosecuted for the murder of the bystander, she will most likely be found\n\nA. guilty, because she intentionally veered the car, striking the bystander.\nB. not guilty, by reason of necessity.\nC. not guilty, by reason of duress.\nD. not guilty, by reason of self-defense.\n"

Not guilty, by reason of necessity.\n\nIn this scenario, the wife acted under the belief that it was necessary to protect herself and her children from harm. She did not intend to cause harm to anyone else, and her actions were intended to prevent a greater harm. Therefore, she can be considered to have acted in self-defense, which means that she cannot be held criminally responsible for the death of the bystander."
