When lactate builds up in the muscles, it can lead to fatigue and performance decline. \n\nWhen the muscles begin to recover from intense exercise, they start to release lactate back into the bloodstream through a process called lactic acid fermentation. This lactate then travels to the kidneys where it is reconverted to glucose through a metabolic pathway known as the Cori cycle (also known as the Cori-Stephenson cycle). This process allows lactate to be removed from the body more efficiently than if it were simply excreted in urine or feces.\n\nTherefore, option C (excretion via the kidneys) is correct."
