The agreed upon price was $250,000, with construction to be completed within four months. Two weeks after the building contract was formed, the builder contacted a lumber yard to purchase wood necessary for the construction of the house. The builder and the owner of the lumber yard entered into a valid written agreement whereby the lumber yard was to supply the necessary lumber in exchange for $10,000, payable by the builder within 30 days. One week later, a fire destroyed a good portion of the lumber yard's supply of lumber. As a result, the lumber yard refused to supply lumber to the builder. The builder was unable to find another supplier of lumber and therefore notified the woman that he would be unable to complete her building on time. If the woman sues the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because by operation of law the woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract.\nB. Yes, but only if the builder's contract with the owner of the lumber yard was not discharged by the fire.\nC. No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.\nD. No, because the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Yes, because by operation of law the woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract.\n\nAn equitable assignee is someone who assumes the rights and obligations of another person under a contract or other legal relationship. In this case, the woman has assumed the rights and obligations of the builder under the original contract with the lumber yard. Therefore, if the builder is unable to complete the building due to the fire, the woman can sue the lumber yard for breach of contract as if it were the builder's claim.\n\nIt is important to note that the woman cannot sue the lumber yard directly for breach of contract since the original contract was with the builder, not the lumber yard. However, the woman can sue the lumber yard for damages resulting from the breach of contract, such as lost profits or additional costs incurred in finding alternative suppliers."
