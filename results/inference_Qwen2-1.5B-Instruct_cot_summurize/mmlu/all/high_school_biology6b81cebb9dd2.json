This is an example of positive feedback because the secretion of oxytocin increases the production of milk, which then stimulates more oxytocin production, creating a positive feedback loop.\n\nB. An enzyme is allosterically inhibited by the product of the reaction it catalyzes. This is not an example of positive feedback because it is a negative feedback mechanism, where the presence of the product decreases the activity of the enzyme and thus reduces the amount of product produced.\n\nC. When ATP is abundant, the rate of glycolysis decreases. This is not an example of positive feedback because it is a direct reduction in the rate of glycolysis, rather than an increase or decrease in the output of ATP.\n\nD. When blood sugar levels decrease to normal after a meal, insulin is no longer secreted. This is an example of negative feedback because the secretion of insulin decreases as blood sugar levels return to normal, which then leads to less glucose being released into the bloodstream and less insulin being required. This is not an example of positive feedback."
