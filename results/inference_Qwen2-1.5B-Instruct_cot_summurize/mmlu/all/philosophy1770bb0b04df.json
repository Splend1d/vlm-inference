He argued that these atoms are constantly moving and changing, but they do not have any inherent purpose or meaning. Therefore, he concluded that death is an illusion because it is simply a change in the state of our bodies.\n\nIn this view, the wise man would be someone who accepts the inevitability of death as a natural part of the process of existence, rather than trying to escape from it through philosophical arguments about its nature. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Realizes that death is an illusion."
