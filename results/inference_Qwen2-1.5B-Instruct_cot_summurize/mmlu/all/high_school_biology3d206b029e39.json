Water is split apart, providing hydrogen ions and electrons to NADP for temporary storage.\n\nDuring the light-dependent reactions, water molecules are split into oxygen gas and protons (hydrogen ions). These protons are then used as an energy source to drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH, two key compounds involved in the Calvin cycle. The electrons from water are captured by chlorophyll pigments and transferred through the electron transport chain, ultimately being used to pump protons out of the thylakoid space and generate ATP and NADPH. This process also produces hydrogen ions, which can be temporarily stored in NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) for later use in the Calvin cycle."
