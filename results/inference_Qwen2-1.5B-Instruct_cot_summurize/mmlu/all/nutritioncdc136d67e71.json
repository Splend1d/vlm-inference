It is also useful for identifying patients who may be at risk for developing malnutrition due to chronic diseases or medications.\n\nA 7-day food diary, the MUST tool, and demipan are not typically used as screening tools for malnutrition on admission to hospital. While these tests can provide additional information about a patient's diet and nutrient intake, they do not directly assess nutritional status."
