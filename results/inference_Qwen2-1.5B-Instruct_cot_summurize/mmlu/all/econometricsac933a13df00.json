Such an estimator will always be unbiased.\n\nAn estimator's bias refers to how far it is expected to be from the true parameter value in expectation. An unbiased estimator means that the expected value of the estimator equals the true parameter value. Therefore, if an estimator has minimum variance, it may still have high bias or low bias depending on the distribution of the data and the specific form of the estimator. So while it might minimize variance, it doesn't guarantee unbiasedness."
