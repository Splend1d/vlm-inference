Infectious mononucleosis\n\nInfectious mononucleosis, also known as generalized lymphadenopathy due to infectious mononucleosis (GM), is a self-limiting condition characterized by a sore throat, fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. It can be caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which typically occurs through close contact with an infected person or from contaminated surfaces.\n\nThe symptoms you described match those of infectious mononucleosis. The exudate seen on the pharynx could indicate a more severe case where there is inflammation of the tonsils and adenoids. However, it's important to note that this condition typically resolves without treatment within a few weeks to several months. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as lymphoma or chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nIt's crucial for the patient to receive proper medical care to manage his symptoms effectively and prevent any potential complications."
