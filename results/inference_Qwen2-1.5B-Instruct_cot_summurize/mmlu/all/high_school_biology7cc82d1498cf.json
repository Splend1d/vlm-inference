                    "text": "The correct answer is D: RNA processing will repair point mutations before mRNA leaves the nucleus.\n\nWhen a point mutation occurs in DNA, it typically results in a change in one or more nucleotides within the DNA sequence. This change can affect the way the DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and subsequently translated into proteins. However, some point mutations may be repaired by RNA editing during post-transcriptional modifications.\n\nIn this case, RNA processing refers to the process by which the RNA strand is modified or edited after transcription. It includes various mechanisms such as alternative splicing, 5' to 3' processing, and 3' to 5' processing. These processes can help to correct or remove mutations in the RNA transcript without altering its function.\n\nFor example, RNA editing can correct point mutations by introducing new bases or modifying existing ones, leading to functional proteins with altered amino acid sequences but retaining the overall structure and function of the original protein. In some cases, these modifications can even enhance the stability or activity of the protein.\n\nTherefore, option D is the best explanation among the given choices."
