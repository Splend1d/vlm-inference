Riles was a landmark Supreme Court case that addressed the issue of equal educational opportunities for children with disabilities. The case involved a school district's decision to exclude a student from extracurricular activities based on his disability. The court ruled that the district had violated the student's rights by denying him access to these activities, finding that the district had failed to provide an \"appropriate\" education for him.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. the provision of a free, appropriate public education for students with disabilities."
