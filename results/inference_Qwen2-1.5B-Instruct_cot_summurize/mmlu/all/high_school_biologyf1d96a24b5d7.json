By increasing genetic variation of the bacteria.\n\nViral transduction allows bacteria to exchange genetic material, which can lead to changes in their DNA and potentially increase genetic variation. This can make the bacteria more adaptable to changing environmental conditions or better equipped to survive and reproduce. Over time, this can result in the emergence of new strains or even entirely new species of bacteria that are adapted to specific environments."
