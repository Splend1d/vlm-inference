The DNA migrates only when the current is running.\n\nGel electrophoresis is a technique used in molecular biology to separate and analyze proteins or nucleic acids based on their size and shape. When a sample of DNA or other biomolecules is placed into a gel matrix, it is subjected to electric fields that cause them to move through the matrix. This movement is dependent on several factors such as the concentration of the sample, the type of gel matrix, and the strength of the applied electric field. \n\nWhile smaller DNA molecules tend to move faster due to their lower density and higher mobility, the migration speed of DNA does not depend solely on its charge or the direction of the current. The movement of DNA depends on various factors like concentration, size, and charge distribution within the sample, among others. Therefore, option C is incorrect."
