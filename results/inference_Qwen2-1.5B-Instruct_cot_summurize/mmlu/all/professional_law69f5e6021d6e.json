The motorist had a policy limit of only $15,000 for third party liability on his insurance policy. After furnishing the motorist's insurer with a full medical report, all medical bills, medical records, and other required proofs of damages, the injured claimant demanded the policy limits. The claimant gave notice that a bad faith claim would be filed if the policy limits were not paid immediately. The insurance company refused payment without explanation. A jury awarded the injured claimant $200,000. The injured claimant obtained a signed assignment from the negligent motorist giving to the claimant any rights that the motorist may have had against his insurer. Will the court likely compel the insurance company to pay the full amount of the jury verdict to injured person under these facts?\n\nA. The policy limit is $15,000 and that is all that can be collected by the injured person \u0080\u0093 there is no action for bad faith on an insurance contract.\nB. The insurance company breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implicit in every insurance contract and must pay the full amount of the judgment.\nC. Bad faith is personal to the insured party and his insurer \u0080\u0093 the assignment was invalid, and the injured person has no claim to compel the insurer to pay.\nD. The injured party must enforce his entire judgment against the motorist and may never pursue the insurer for that amount.\n"

The insurance company breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implicit in every insurance contract and must pay the full amount of the judgment.\n\nWhen a motorist causes an accident and is at fault, their insurance company will typically pay the claims of the injured party up to the policy limits set out in the insurance policy. In this case, the policy limit was $15,000. However, the injured party demanded the full policy limits, which is beyond what they were entitled to receive based on the policy limit.\n\nUnder these facts, the injured party could potentially file a bad faith claim against the insurance company. If the court finds that the insurance company failed to act reasonably or fairly in denying payment of the full policy limits, it may order the insurance company to pay the full amount of the judgment.\n\nIt is important to note that the assignment of rights given by the injured party to the claimant does not necessarily void the bad faith claim. The assignment merely transfers the right to sue the motorist to the claimant, but the claimant still has the right to pursue the bad faith claim against the insurance company.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The insurance company breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is implicit in every insurance contract and must pay the full amount of the judgment."
