Capitalizing all costs when incurred.\n\nThis method allows you to capitalize research and development costs, which are considered an investment in the company's future earnings potential rather than an immediate expense that must be recorded on the income statement. By capitalizing these costs, you will recognize them as assets on your balance sheet and depreciate or amortize them over time to reflect their true cost. This approach ensures that the full value of the research and development effort is recognized in the financial statements, helping investors and creditors understand the long-term viability of the company."
