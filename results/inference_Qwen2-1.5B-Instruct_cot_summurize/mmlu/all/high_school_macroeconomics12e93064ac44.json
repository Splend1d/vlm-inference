Savers\n\nThe supply of loanable funds comes from savers, who voluntarily give up their money to banks and other financial institutions in exchange for loans or savings accounts. This process allows individuals and businesses to borrow money to invest or purchase goods and services they cannot afford otherwise. The demand for loanable funds is determined by the overall economy, including factors such as interest rates, unemployment levels, and consumer confidence."
