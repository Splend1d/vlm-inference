The GDP reflects the market transactions of goods and services within an economy over a specific period of time. Therefore, if the computers were produced domestically in 2005 and not sold until 2006, their production would not affect the GDP in 2005 as they were not part of the domestic market at that point. They will only be included in the GDP in 2006 when they are sold and the GDP is revised to reflect the new economic activity. \n\nHowever, the question mentions \"retail value\" which could refer to the price at which the computers are sold in 2006. In this case, the retail value of the computers may have been higher than their wholesale value, but it's not relevant to the calculation of GDP. The key point is that the computers did not contribute to the GDP in 2005 due to being produced domestically but not yet sold."
