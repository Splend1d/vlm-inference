Information is not important to decision making in economic theory; rather, it is an actor's perceptions of situations that will inform their decision making process.\nB. Information has no special significance to economic decision making, which is guided more by external forces that coerce actors than their own rational choices.\nC. Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.\nD. Information has become an important resource in the 21st century and can be sold and traded as a market commodity.\n"

Information plays a significant role in decision making because, although theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, 'rational action' depends on the information available to them at the time.\n\nIn economics, information refers to the knowledge or data about the environment or circumstances relevant to a decision-making process. This includes both explicit (i.e., explicitly stated) information such as historical data or expert opinions, and implicit (i.e., tacitly understood) information such as intuition, reputation, and social norms. The availability and quality of information have a direct impact on the accuracy and reliability of economic decisions, as well as the incentives and pressures that shape individual behavior. For example, firms may use information about consumer preferences, costs, and competition to make strategic decisions about product development, pricing, and marketing strategies. Additionally, governments and regulatory bodies rely on information to assess risks, implement policies, and enforce compliance with laws and regulations. Overall, information is a critical input into economic decision making, shaping outcomes and influencing the course of events."
