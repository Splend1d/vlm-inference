(i) specify exactly what they mean by \"unnaturalness\" and (ii) explain why unnaturalness (so defined) matters morally.\nC. (i) establish that one's sexual orientation is a matter of choice and (ii) that people who choose homosexuality have an intrinsic desire for self-harm.\nD.

Option A focuses solely on explaining harms and intentions without addressing the moral significance of these actions; option C conflates sexual orientation with choice and harm; and option D attempts to argue against unnaturalness based on its inherent value, which does not directly address the question at hand regarding moral judgment."
