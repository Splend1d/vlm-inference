Some of the criteria that the commission imposed included:\n\n1. A commitment to human rights and democracy: This meant that each country would have to ensure that its citizens had access to basic human rights such as freedom of speech, assembly, and religion.\n\n2. An end to ethnic discrimination: The commission called for measures to prevent ethnic violence and discrimination against minorities in the newly independent states.\n\n3. A commitment to democratic governance: The commission recommended that each state should establish a system of representative government and respect the rule of law.\n\n4. A commitment to economic development: The commission called for measures to promote economic growth and stability, including investment in infrastructure and education.\n\n5. A commitment to cultural diversity: The commission encouraged the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity within each state, while also acknowledging the importance of preserving national identity.\n\nIt is worth noting that some of these criteria may not have been implemented fully or at all by the former Yugoslav republics."
