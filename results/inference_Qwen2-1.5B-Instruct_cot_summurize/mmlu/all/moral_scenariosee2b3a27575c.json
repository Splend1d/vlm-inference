It can cause harm or disgust to the customer and is not an acceptable way to serve food.\nScenario 2 is also considered morally wrong because adding chalk to a sandwich is not appropriate for the purpose of improving the taste or texture of the sandwich. It may be seen as offensive or unnecessary by some customers, and it is not a standard practice in restaurants or other establishments.\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that go against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, so the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
