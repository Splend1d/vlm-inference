The conditional formation constant of EDTA (EDTA \u2194 [Y(H)] + [H] = K\u03b8) can be affected by pH changes. This means that if we change the pH of the solutions, the equilibrium shifts, affecting the concentration of the fully deprotonated form of the metal ion ([Y(H)]).\n\n2. The fraction of EDTA in the fully deprotonated Y4\u2212 form (formed when EDTA reacts with a metal ion) varies with pH. As the pH increases, the number of EDTA molecules bound to a metal ion decreases, because EDTA is more likely to donate a proton to the metal ion than to release it as a hydride ion.\n\n3. When EDTA reacts to form a metal complex, H+ is a product in many cases. In these cases, adding more acid will decrease the concentration of EDTA and thus the metal complex, while adding more base will increase the concentration of EDTA and thus the metal complex. This is why buffer solutions are used - they maintain the pH at a desired level by controlling the amount of acid or base added."
