The neighbor was enraged and threatened to kill the child. The child ran inside his house and told his mother what had occurred.

Therefore, the neighbor is liable for any injuries caused by their actions, including emotional distress. The mother's emotional breakdown was a direct result of the neighbor's threat, so she may be able to recover damages from the neighbor for the emotional distress they caused."
