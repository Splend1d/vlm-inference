Mean absolute percentage error is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts.\n\nMean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used to evaluate how well an asset's return forecast compares to actual returns. It is calculated by taking the average absolute percentage difference between the forecasted and actual return values. MAPE is less sensitive to outliers in the data, making it a good measure for evaluating forecasts across different time periods or markets. It also has the advantage of being relatively easy to calculate and interpret. On the other hand, Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is the mean squared deviation from the mean, penalizes large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors, while Mean Absolute Error (MAE) does not."
