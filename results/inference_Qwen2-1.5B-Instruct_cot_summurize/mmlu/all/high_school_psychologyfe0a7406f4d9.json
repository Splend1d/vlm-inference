During this stage, the body is responding to an acute stressor and is mobilizing resources to cope with the threat. This can lead to symptoms such as increased heart rate, sweating, and muscle tension, which can increase the risk of illness or injury. Therefore, it is important to identify and respond to stressors early on in order to prevent these negative effects on health."
