Traditional subjects and methods.\n\nHoward Gardner and Robert Sternberg are both proponents of the idea that intelligence is not limited to just one type or set of abilities, but rather encompasses multiple domains such as linguistic, mathematical, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, and intrapersonal. They argue that schools should focus on teaching these diverse forms of intelligence instead of emphasizing only certain types of intelligence, which can be limiting.\n\nSternberg also believes that traditional subject matter has become outdated and does not reflect the complexity and fluidity of modern life, and therefore, schools need to adapt by incorporating more interdisciplinary approaches and real-world experiences into their curriculum. This would help students develop a broader understanding of how different areas of knowledge interact with each other and contribute to overall cognitive development. \n\nIn contrast, Gardner emphasizes that creativity is an essential component of human intelligence, and schools should encourage this through activities that challenge and stimulate the imagination, such as arts and music education. However, he still believes in the importance of traditional academic subjects for developing critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and communication abilities, which are necessary for success in many fields."
