While moderate amounts of alcohol can be beneficial for some people, it is not necessarily an essential factor for long life. Similarly, while genetics plays a role in determining one's risk for certain diseases, it does not guarantee a long life span on its own. Avoiding stress is also important for overall health, but it is not directly related to living longer."
