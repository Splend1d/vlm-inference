The majority held that the abortion law of Texas was unconstitutional because it violated a woman's right to privacy.\n\nThis decision, which was made in 1973, established a constitutional right to abortion for women in the United States. It was based on the idea that a woman has a fundamental right to control her own body and make decisions about her own reproductive health. The decision overturned previous state laws that had prohibited abortions during the first few months of pregnancy."
