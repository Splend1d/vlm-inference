Stan was married to Morgana and had two children, Andrew and Beverly. Walter's will provided in part:\"The net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for his life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income (from said trust) to the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares. \"Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001. Both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash in 2009. There is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction. Harriet, on behalf of Grace, brings an appropriate action against the Trend Trust Company and Walter's estate to allow the distribution of the income from said trust to be paid to Grace. Is Harriet likely to prevail in this action?\n\nA. No, because Grace was not a life-in-being at the time of Walter's death.\nB. No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\nC. Yes, because that was Walter's intent.\nD. Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.\n"

The provisions of the trust state that upon Stan's death, the income should be paid to Stan's widow, and if Stan's widow dies, the income should be paid to Grace. Since Stan and his wife died in 2009, Grace is still alive, so she should receive the income.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nC. Yes, because that was Walter's intent."
