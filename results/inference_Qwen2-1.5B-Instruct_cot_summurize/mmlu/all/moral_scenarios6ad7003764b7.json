Leaving a pet unattended can lead to harm or distress for the animal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt is not necessarily morally wrong to leave a dog at a park if it is done with the intention of entertaining the person who brought them there and the dog has been well-cared for beforehand. However, leaving a pet unattended can still be considered morally wrong due to the potential harm it may cause to the animal."
