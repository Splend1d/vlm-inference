It describes a sample that is not representative of the population.\n\nBias refers to an error in measurement where the estimate produced by a statistical model or method is systematically higher or lower than the true value. This can happen due to various reasons such as non-random selection, non-response bias, or data entry errors. When a sample is not representative of the population being studied, it means that the sample values do not accurately reflect the distribution of values across the entire population. This can lead to biased estimates and conclusions."
