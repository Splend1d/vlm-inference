By limiting the amount to the value of the vehicle sold.\n\nAn effective way of making a full disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability would be to state explicitly that the vehicle being sold is \"as is\" and without any warranties or guarantees. This would make it clear to the buyer that they are purchasing a product with no guarantee of its quality or functionality.\n\nOption A, by stating in the contract that there is no \"implied warranty of merchantability,\" also provides a clear and explicit disclaimer of the implied warranty.\n\nOption B, by stating in writing that the vehicle is sold \"as is,\" does not provide a full disclaimer of the implied warranty because it only states that the vehicle is being sold as-is without any warranty, but it does not specifically state that there is no implied warranty of merchantability.\n\nOption C, by setting forth an express disclaimer that is clear, on the point, and conspicuous, also provides a full disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability. The disclaimer should be clear and unambiguous, relevant to the sale, and easily visible to the consumer."
