                    "text": "The Chi-square test of independence is used when we want to determine whether two categorical variables are independent or not, i.e., if the probability of observing each cell in the contingency table is the same regardless of the values of the other cells.\n\nIn a 3x4 contingency table, there are 3 rows and 4 columns, which means that the total number of cells in the table is 3*4 = 12. However, since the two variables being tested (the categories in the table) are categorical themselves (i.e., they can only take on certain values), we need to count the number of possible combinations of these categories to ensure that our sample size is large enough for the Chi-square test to be valid.\n\nSince there are 3 rows and 4 columns, the total number of possible combinations of categories is \\(3! \\times 4!\\), where \"!\" denotes factorial. The factorial function gives the product of all positive integers up to that number (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120). So, the total number of possible combinations of categories is:\n\n\\[3! \\times 4! = 6 \\times 24 = 144\\]\n\nThis means that there are 144 possible combinations of categories. However, we also need to consider the fact that each category can only occur once in each row and column. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of ways to arrange the repeated categories from the total number of combinations:\n\n\\[144 - 3 \\times 4 = 144 - 12 = 132\\]\n\nSo, the total number of degrees of freedom for the Chi-square test of independence with a 3x4 contingency table is 132 - 12 = 128. \n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, the correct answer is actually 120, not 11. This is because the formula for calculating degrees of freedom assumes that the expected counts for each cell in the contingency table are known beforehand. In this case, we don't know what the expected counts should be, so we cannot use the formula directly. Instead, we need to calculate the degrees of freedom by hand using the following formula:\n\n\\[df = (R-1)(C-1)\\]\nwhere R is the number of rows and C is the number of columns in the contingency table.\n\nFor a 3x4 contingency table, R = 3 and C = 4, so the degrees of freedom would be:\n\n\\[df = (3-1)(4-1) = 2 \\times 3 = 6\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 8."
