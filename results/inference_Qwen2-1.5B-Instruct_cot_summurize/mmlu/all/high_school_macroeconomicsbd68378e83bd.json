It represents the fraction of the additional income that consumers save or invest rather than spending it.\n\nIn this case, if the MPC is 0.8, then for every additional dollar spent on consumption, only 0.2 dollars will be saved or invested.\n\nGiven $500 of new spending, let's calculate the maximum possible increase in GDP:\n\nLet x = amount of new spending\n\nTotal spending = Initial spending + New spending = $500 + x\n\nThe maximum increase in GDP occurs when all the new spending is used up and there is no remaining saving or investment. In this scenario, we have:\n\\[ \\text{New Spending} = x = \\$500 \\]\n\nSince the MPC is 0.8, only 0.2 of each dollar spent would be saved or invested. Therefore, the maximum increase in GDP would be:\n\\[ \\text{Max Increase in GDP} = (\\text{New Spending}) \\times (\\text{MPC}) = (\\$500) \\times (0.8) = \\$400 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. $400."
