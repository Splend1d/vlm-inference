A homomorphism is not necessarily one-to-one unless it is also an injective homomorphism, which means that for any two distinct elements in the domain, they map to distinct images under the homomorphism. In this case, the kernel would consist of all the elements that map to the identity element under the homomorphism, but it could still contain more than just the identity element.\nStatement 2 is true. The image of a group under a homomorphism can be any size depending on the group itself. For example, if we consider the cyclic group Z_3 (the integers modulo 3), then its subgroup of order 2 has 2 elements, while its subgroup of order 1 has 1 element. Therefore, the image of Z_3 under some homomorphism may have any number of elements from 0 to 3, inclusive."
