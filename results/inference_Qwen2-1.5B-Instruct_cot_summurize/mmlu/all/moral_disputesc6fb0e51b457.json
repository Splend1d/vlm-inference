However, it's worth noting that there are different definitions and interpretations of what constitutes misogyny.\n\nIn terms of Richardson-Self's work on sexism and gender inequality, she uses the concept of \"intra-divisonal sexism\" to describe the ways in which individuals within their own division of labor (e.g., men vs. women) can engage in discriminatory behavior towards others within that same division. This could include behaviors such as belittling, excluding, or discriminating against members of another division based on gender.\n\nTherefore, interdivisonal misogyny would refer to discriminatory behavior between divisions rather than among individuals within those divisions. For example, someone who discriminates against other women within their workplace might be considered an intra-divisional sexist, but not an interdivisional one.\n\nSo, without more specific information about the context of Richardson-Self's work, I'd say the most likely answer is:\n\nD. A and B only\n\nThis suggests that the distinction between intra- and interdivisionsal sexism is important for understanding how discrimination operates within organizations or societies. However, it doesn't necessarily imply that there aren't other types of sexism that also exist."
