The thyristors in the motor's control circuitry must be able to handle the changes in voltage that occur as the motor speeds up or slows down. If the voltage is too high or too low, this can cause damage to the thyristors and other components in the control circuitry.\n\nTo prevent this damage, the AC motor's control circuitry must include a feedback loop that measures the voltage drop across the thyristors and adjusts the supply voltage accordingly. This process is known as \"variable voltage regulation\" (VVLR) and is essential for ensuring that the AC motor operates reliably and efficiently."
