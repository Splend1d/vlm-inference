The virion RNA acting as mRNA\n\nPicornaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses that encode their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for synthesis of viral RNA from host messenger RNA (mRNA). This process occurs within the infected cell, where the viral RdRp synthesizes the viral genome from its own RNA template. This allows the picornaviruses to maintain high levels of genomic RNA during infection and to use this RNA as a template for transcription of their own mRNAs, which can then be translated into viral proteins.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe the replication mechanism of picornaviruses:\n\n- A. Virions carrying RNA transcriptase enzymes does not occur in picornaviruses.\n- B. The virion RNA being translated into a single large polyprotein is also incorrect; the picornaviral polyproteins are synthesized by the viral RdRp.\n- D. The virus exiting by apoptosis of the cell is an error, as picornaviruses typically exit cells through lysis or budding, rather than apoptosis. Apoptosis refers to programmed cell death due to damage or stress, while picornaviral infections result in cell lysis."
