Locus of control\n\nLocus of control refers to the belief that one has control over various aspects of their life, such as their health, relationships, or job performance. It is often associated with positive outcomes in life and has been found to be related to self-efficacy, optimism, and overall well-being. \n\nMoral imagination involves imagining oneself in different situations and considering how one would respond in those scenarios. Personal integrity refers to one's adherence to moral principles and values. Cognitive moral development refers to the process by which individuals learn about morality through observation and experience. Locus of control is not directly related to the extent to which an individual believes they can control their life."
