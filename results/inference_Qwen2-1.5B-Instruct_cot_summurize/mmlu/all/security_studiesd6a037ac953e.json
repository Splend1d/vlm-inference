A conveyed threat must be sufficient so as to make non-compliance unbearable.\n2. Threat must be credible.\n3. Adversary must be given sufficient time to comply with demand.\n4. Coercer must assure adversary that compliance will not lead to future demands.\n5. Conflict must not be perceived as a zero-sum game.\n\nTherefore, options A and C are incorrect because they do not address the sufficiency of the threat or the need for time for compliance. Option D is also incorrect because it does not mention the credibility of the threat or the need for time for compliance."
