Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.\u2026 Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.\u2026 It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries.\u2026 Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work for all Americans again.\u2026 The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.\n\u2014Geraldine Ferraro, Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address, July 19, 1984\nThe political ideas expressed by Ferraro in the passage above most directly reflect those of which of the following?\n\nA. Colonial opponents of British taxation in the 1760s and 1770s\nB. Abolitionists of the antebellum period\nC. Republicans of the 1920s\nD. New Dealers of the 1930s\n"

Republicans of the 1920s\n\nFerraro's speech is from 1984, during the Republican Party's dominance of U.S. politics, so she would be speaking as a member of the Republican Party.\n\nOf the options given:\n\n- A. Colonials were fighting for greater representation, not taxation reform.\n- B. Abolitionists opposed slavery rather than taxation.\n- D. New Dealers advocated for government spending to stimulate the economy rather than cutting taxes.\n- C. Republicans of the 1920s had a strong tradition of advocating for social programs like Social Security and Medicare, which could be seen as supporting equal opportunities for women.\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is C. Republicans of the 1920s."
