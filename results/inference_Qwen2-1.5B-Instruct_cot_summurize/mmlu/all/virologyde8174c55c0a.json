The coronavirus, which causes diseases like COVID-19, has a single-stranded RNA genome that encodes for its genetic material. It is about 30 nanometers in diameter and contains a protein coat called the envelope. The envelope surrounds the viral RNA and contains spike proteins that help the virus attach to host cells. These spike proteins form club-shaped structures that protrude from the surface of the virus."
