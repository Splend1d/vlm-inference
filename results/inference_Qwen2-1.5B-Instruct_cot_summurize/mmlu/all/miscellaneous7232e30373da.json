In this context, the teacher presents several examples of short stories and works with students to identify their defining characteristics, which can be seen as similar to the process of discussing and identifying key features in a text. This approach encourages critical thinking and analysis among students. \n\nOption B (Discipline-based Inquiry) focuses more on developing skills through problem-solving rather than analyzing texts. Option C (Self-Regulated Strategy Development) is about students independently developing strategies without guidance from the teacher, whereas option D (Introduction-Body-Conclusion strategy) does not relate directly to identifying characteristics of short stories."
