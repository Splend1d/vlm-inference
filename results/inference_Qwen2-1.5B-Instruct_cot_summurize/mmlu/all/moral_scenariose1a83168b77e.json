This is generally considered morally wrong and could lead to serious consequences if it results in the team winning unfairly.\n\nScenario 2 involves not driving safely due to being too sleepy. While this may be seen as a personal choice that some people might make, it is still a moral issue to consider the safety of others on the road. Driving while tired can increase the risk of accidents and injuries. Therefore, this scenario is also considered morally wrong."
