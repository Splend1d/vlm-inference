While it's true that the EU has made significant progress towards achieving a common European language, it's not considered a key milestone reached by the EU as such. \n\nA customs union and a single market are both important milestones for the EU, but they have been achieved over time through various policies and agreements between member states. However, a common currency was not introduced until 2002 when the euro was adopted as the sole currency of all EU member states.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. A common European language."
