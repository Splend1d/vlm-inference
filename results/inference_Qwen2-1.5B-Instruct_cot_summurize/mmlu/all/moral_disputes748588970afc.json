While it is true that economic motives can influence decisions about how resources are used, it is also important to consider the ecological and ethical implications of these decisions. For example, if a conservation effort relies solely on economic incentives, there may be little consideration given to the social, cultural, or spiritual values associated with certain species or ecosystems. Additionally, some argue that economic motives can lead to short-term gains at the expense of long-term sustainability. Therefore, a conservation system based purely on economic motives may not always be in line with the principles of sustainable development and biodiversity conservation."
