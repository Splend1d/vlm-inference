Research is ongoing to define patterns and levels of optimal weight gain during pregnancy, which can impact maternal and infant health outcomes. Excessive weight gain in pregnancy has been linked to obesity in the offspring, while inadequate weight gain may lead to undernutrition in the mother and her fetus. Therefore, it is important for pregnant women to maintain a healthy weight gain throughout their pregnancy."
