Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating is a similar technique that measures the amount of light emitted by minerals after being excited by an electric field.\n\nThe other options listed do not measure the amount of energy trapped in materials that have been heated at archaeological sites. Argon/argon dating uses the decay of radioactive isotopes to date rocks, while radiocarbon dating uses carbon-14 dating to date organic materials. X-ray fluorescence dating uses X-rays to measure the composition of materials, and paleomagnetic dating uses magnetism to date rocks and fossils."
