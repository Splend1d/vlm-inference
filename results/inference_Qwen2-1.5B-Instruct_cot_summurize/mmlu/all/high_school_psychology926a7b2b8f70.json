Longitudinal research involves studying the same subjects over an extended period of time to observe changes or developments in their behavior or performance. This type of research is often used in developmental psychology and education to track the growth and development of individuals or groups over time. Cross-sectional research involves comparing different groups at one point in time, while cross-cultural research involves comparing people from different cultural backgrounds. In-cohort sequential research refers to studies where participants are randomly assigned to two groups that change over time, rather than being followed longitudinally."
