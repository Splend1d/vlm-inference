Yes, article 103 of the UN Charter cannot trump jus cogens norms\n\nArticle 103 of the UN Charter states that \"The rights and freedoms set forth in this Charter shall be protected by the Security Council.\" This means that the Charter itself does not override other international law, including jus cogens norms.\n\nHowever, if a state violates an international norm that is considered to be beyond the reach of international law (i.e., it is a jus cogens norm), then the principle of complementarity may apply. In such cases, the International Criminal Court (ICC) or other relevant international bodies can prosecute individuals for violations of jus cogens norms, even without the consent of the state involved.\n\nTherefore, while article 103 of the UN Charter does not directly trump jus cogens norms, it is still subject to the principles of complementarity and state responsibility."
