Childhood stunting before 24 months of age affects long term cognitive performance\n\nStunting, or malnutrition, during childhood can have significant effects on brain development and cognitive function later in life. Stunted children may experience slower cognitive development, reduced educational attainment, and increased risk for mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Therefore, it's important to address stunting early in life to improve long-term cognitive outcomes."
