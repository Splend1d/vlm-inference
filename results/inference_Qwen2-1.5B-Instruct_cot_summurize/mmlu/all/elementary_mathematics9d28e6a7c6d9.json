Since you can't have half a pack, this is not possible.\n\nB. 26: If there were 26 batteries in packs of 4, then she would have \\( \\frac{26}{4} = 6.5 \\) packs. Again, this isn't possible since you can't have half a pack.\n\nC. 28: If there were 28 batteries in packs of 4, then she would have \\( \\frac{28}{4} = 7 \\) packs. This is a valid answer because it's within the range of numbers given (1-4).\n\nD. 30: If there were 30 batteries in packs of 4, then she would have \\( \\frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \\) packs. This isn't possible either because you can't have half a pack.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 28."
