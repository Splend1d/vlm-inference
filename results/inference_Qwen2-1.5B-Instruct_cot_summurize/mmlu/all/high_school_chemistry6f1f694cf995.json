[HNO2] > [NO2-]. \n\nWhen a weak acid dissociates into its conjugate base and hydronium ion (aq), the equilibrium expression for the reaction is as follows:\n\n[Acid] * Ka = [Conjugate Base] + [Hydronium Ion]\n\nIn this case, the weak acid is nitrous acid (HNO2) with a pKa of 3.3. The pH of the solution is 4.2, which means that the hydrogen ions ([H+]) are present at a higher concentration than the hydroxide ions ([OH-]). This indicates that the acid is predominantly in its conjugate base form.\n\nTherefore, the [NO2-] is greater than the [HNO2], because the overall reaction favors the formation of NO2- over HNO2 due to the lower activation energy required for the dissociation of nitrous acid.\n\nThus, option A is correct."
