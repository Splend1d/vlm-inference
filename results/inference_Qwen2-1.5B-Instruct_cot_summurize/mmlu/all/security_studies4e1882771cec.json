Securitization mobilizes popular support for policies in specific areas by calling them security relevant and encourages the allocation of more resources.\n\nSecuritization involves the transfer or packaging of assets, liabilities, or risks into securities. This process can be used to increase the perceived risk associated with certain activities or issues, which can lead to increased public concern and pressure on governments and institutions to address them. As a result, securitization can mobilize popular support for policies related to security, such as increased spending on defense, border control measures, or surveillance technologies. This can also lead to increased funding for research and development in areas like cybersecurity or counterterrorism."
