The downward pull of gravity and the upward normal force of the floor act on the same object, so they have equal magnitudes and form an action-reaction pair.\n\nGravity pulls down on the person with a force that is directed straight down, while the normal force of the floor pushes up on the person with a force that is perpendicular to the surface of the floor. These two forces are equal in magnitude because they both act on the same object (the person). They also act in opposite directions, which means that their vectors add up to zero when added together vertically. This is why the net force acting on the person is zero - the gravitational force balances out the normal force from the floor."
