Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:\"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. \"In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?\n\nA. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\nB. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.\nC. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.\nD. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n\nUnder common law, if a person sells an interest in real property and includes a restrictive covenant, such as a prohibition on the construction of a mobile home, the covenant runs with the land and can be enforced against subsequent purchasers. However, the buyer does not need to have actual knowledge of the covenant to be bound by it. The covenant will be binding on all subsequent grantees of the builder, even those who do not have direct knowledge of the covenant. Therefore, option A is incorrect because the covenant is still enforceable against the buyer.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the covenant can only be enforced by a subdivision lot owner, not by any other party.\n\nOption C is correct because the buyer did receive constructive notice of the covenant when he bought the lot from the builder, which means he knew about the covenant and agreed to its terms.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is C. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes."
