Therefore, the auditor may be more concerned about the risk of fraudulent financial reporting when there are significant year-end adjustments.\n\nFactors such as the audit committee's approval of the initial selection of accounting principles, lack of competition in the entity's industry, and management's disclosure of unresolved litigation and contingent liabilities do not necessarily indicate a higher risk of fraudulent financial reporting."
