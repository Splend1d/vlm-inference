The quantum yield (\u03a6_f), also known as the efficiency or conversion factor, is defined as the ratio of the number of excited state electrons to the total number of incident photons. It is calculated as:\n\n\u03a6_f = N_e / N_i\n\nwhere N_e is the number of excited state electrons and N_i is the number of incident photons.\n\nTherefore, option C is the best definition for the quantum yield in fluorescence spectroscopy."
