In response to the complaint, the plumber filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The court denied the motion. Thereafter, the plumber did not file an answer or any other response to the company's action. Sixty days after the court's order denying the motion to dismiss, the company asked the clerk to enter default, and the clerk did so. The company applied to the court for the entry of a default judgment and notified the plumber three days before the default judgment hearing. After an ex parte hearing in which the court received evidence on the damages amount, the court entered a default judgment for the full amount sought. Ten days later, the plumber filed a motion to set aside the default judgment. Is the court likely to grant the plumber's motion?\n\nA. No, because the court could fix the amount of damages even without hearing the plumber's evidence.\nB. No, because the plumber failed to plead or otherwise defend against the company's action.\nC. Yes, because the plumber was not given adequate notice of the hearing on the company's application for the entry of a default judgment.\nD. Yes, because the State A federal court lacked personal jurisdiction over the plumber as a State B citizen.\n"

As a result, the company was able to apply for a default judgment against the plumber, which the court entered. However, the plumber had no opportunity to present their defense in court until they filed a motion to set aside the default judgment.\n\nTherefore, the court would be unlikely to grant the plumber's motion to set aside the default judgment if it were aware of the plumber's failure to respond to the company's application for a default judgment. The court would need to ensure that the plumber was provided with proper notice of the hearing on the application for a default judgment and was afforded an opportunity to present their defense."
