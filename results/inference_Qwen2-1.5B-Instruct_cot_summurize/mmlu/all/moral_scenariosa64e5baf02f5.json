However, it may be seen as irresponsible or dangerous if you are not careful and could potentially harm your sister. \n\nIn scenario 2, taking a bowl from the ancient ruins without permission is generally considered morally wrong because it involves stealing. This action violates property rights and can lead to negative consequences such as legal issues and social disapproval."
