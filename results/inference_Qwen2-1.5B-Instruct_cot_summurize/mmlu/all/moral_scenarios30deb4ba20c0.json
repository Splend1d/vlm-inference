In scenario 1, the main character is engaging in harmful behavior by allowing their children to play with icicles, which could cause injury or harm if not handled properly. This action goes against common moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nIn scenario 2, the main character is taking an action that is generally considered acceptable - saving someone from drowning. Wading into a shallow pond to rescue a drowning child is a reasonable response under normal circumstances. However, the act of pulling the child out of the water without first ensuring they are safe and not experiencing any injuries can be seen as neglectful or careless."
