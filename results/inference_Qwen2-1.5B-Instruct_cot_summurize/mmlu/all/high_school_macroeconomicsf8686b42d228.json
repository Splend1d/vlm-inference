The government holds spending constant while increasing taxes.\n\nWhen the government holds spending constant and increases taxes, it means that less money is being spent on goods and services, which will result in a decrease in overall economic activity. This decrease in spending will lead to a decrease in real GDP.\n\nOption A would also result in a decrease in real GDP because both spending and taxation are decreasing.\n\nOption B would not necessarily decrease real GDP as long as there is an increase in tax revenue due to higher taxes paid by individuals and businesses.\n\nOption C would result in a decrease in real GDP if the decrease in spending does not offset the increase in taxes. However, this scenario is more difficult to predict without specific information about the nature of the spending and tax cuts or increases."
