This principle states that it is not possible to know with certainty what actions should be taken in any given situation, as there may be multiple correct answers. In other words, there is no single correct answer to every question, and therefore there can be no absolute moral laws.\n\nEpstein believes that Hume's Principle is important because it suggests that our understanding of justice and morality is inherently uncertain and subject to change over time. He argues that while we may have some objective standards for what is just or fair, these standards will always be open to interpretation and debate. Therefore, it is impossible to have an unchanging set of moral principles that apply universally across all situations.\n\nIn summary, Hume's Principle in Justice for Hedgehogs is understood as the belief that there is no single correct answer to every question, and therefore there can be no absolute moral laws. This idea suggests that our understanding of justice and morality is inherently uncertain and subject to change over time."
