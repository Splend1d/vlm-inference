As it turned out, the hospital had hired a 52-year-old man as the nurse\u00d5s replacement, a fact that rendered an age discrimination claim unavailable. The hospital responded tothe complaint by filing a motion for sanctions against thenurse\u00d5s attorney. Is the court likely to grant the hospital\u00d5s motion?\n\nA. No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.\nB. No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint in advance of filing the motion with the court.\nC. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s attorney failed to conduct areasonable pre-filing inquiry.\nD. Yes, because the nurse\u00d5s complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing lawbased on the facts in this case.\n"
