X-ray crystallographic analysis of the calculus showed calcium as the primary cation. Physical examination today shows no abnormalities. A 24-hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\n\nA. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\nB. Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nC. Na+ \u2013K + \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor\nD. Osmotic diuretic\n"

This can help to reduce the size and frequency of the kidney stone. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\n\nIt's important to note that this treatment should only be considered under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as it may have side effects or interact with other medications the patient may be taking."
