Oxaloacetate, as it is involved in the Krebs cycle and is used for energy production.\n\nOxaloacetate is converted into citrate during the Krebs cycle, which generates ATP and NADH. Once oxygen is no longer available, the Krebs cycle cannot continue, and the citrate cycle cannot produce enough ATP to sustain cellular processes. This leads to the accumulation of pyruvate, which can then be converted back into oxaloacetate and enter the Krebs cycle again, restarting the process. However, since oxygen availability has been lost, the citrate cycle cannot continue without oxygen, and this eventually leads to the depletion of ATP stores."
