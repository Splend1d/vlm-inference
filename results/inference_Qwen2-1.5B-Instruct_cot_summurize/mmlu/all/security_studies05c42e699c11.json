Most early work was carried out in North America and Scandinavia.\n\nPeace studies emerged from the work of social scientists, particularly those studying international relations, who began to explore issues related to conflict and cooperation between nations. While some early work did focus on specific regions or countries (such as the United States and Scandinavia), this was not the primary focus of peace studies. Instead, peace studies have traditionally focused on global issues such as war, violence, and human rights, and have sought to develop theories and strategies for resolving conflicts and promoting peace. Therefore, the statement about early work being primarily done in North America and Scandinavia does not accurately reflect the origins or development of peace studies."
