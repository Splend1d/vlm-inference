This is because endurance training improves oxygen delivery to muscles, enhances insulin sensitivity, and stimulates the production of ketone bodies when glucose levels drop, which can be used as an alternative source of energy in the absence of carbohydrates. Additionally, endurance training can improve muscle glycogen stores, which allows for more efficient use of carbohydrates during high-intensity workouts."
