                    "text": "The object that reaches the base of the incline first is the one that has the smallest coefficient of kinetic friction (k) between its surface and the incline.\n\n1. For the sphere:\n- Since it's a perfect sphere, its moment of inertia about an axis perpendicular to the incline and passing through its center of mass is \\(I = \\frac{2}{5}MR^2\\), where M is the mass of the sphere and R is its radius. This means k for the sphere would be \\(\\mu_k = \\frac{k_{sphere}}{\\mu_s}\\), where \\(\\mu_s\\) is the static friction coefficient on the surface of the incline. To find the maximum value of \\(\\mu_s\\), we need to consider the conditions under which the sphere slides without slipping: \\(Mg - f_{static} = 0\\). Thus, \\(f_{static} = Mg\\), and since \\(R = 1\\), \\(I = \\frac{2}{5}MR^2 = \\frac{2}{5}m(1)^2 = \\frac{2}{5}m\\).\n\nFor a sphere sliding down an incline without slipping, the force parallel to the incline is given by \\(f_{parallel} = N - mg = \\mu_s N\\), where \\(\\mu_s\\) is the static friction coefficient, N is the normal force, and m is the mass of the sphere. The normal force is provided by the weight of the sphere, so \\(N = mg = Mg\\). Thus, \\(\\mu_s N = \\mu_s Mg\\), and since \\(N = Mg\\), we get \\(\\mu_s Mg = Mg\\), leading to \\(\\mu_s = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the sphere will slide down the incline without slipping because it does not have any friction opposing its motion. Hence, the sphere reaches the bottom of the incline first.\n\n2. For the cube:\n- Its moment of inertia around an axis perpendicular to the incline and passing through its center of mass is \\(I = \\frac{3}{4}Ml^2\\), where l is the length of the cube. Thus, \\(k_{cube} = \\frac{k_{cube}}{\\mu_c}\\), where \\(\\mu_c\\) is the coefficient of kinetic friction. To find the maximum value of \\(\\mu_c\\), we again need to consider the conditions under which the cube slides without slipping: \\(Mg - f_{static} = 0\\). Thus, \\(f_{static} = Mg\\), and since \\(l = 1\\), \\(I = \\frac{3}{4}Ml^2 = \\frac{3}{4}ml^2 = \\frac{3}{4}m\\).\n\nFor a cube sliding down an incline without slipping, the force parallel to the incline is given by \\(f_{parallel} = N - mg = \\mu_c N\\), where \\(\\mu_c\\) is the coefficient of kinetic friction, N is the normal force, and m is the mass of the cube. The normal force is provided by the weight of the cube, so \\(N = Mg\\). Thus, \\(\\mu_c N = \\mu_c Mg\\), and since \\(N = Mg\\), we get \\(\\mu_c Mg = Mg\\), leading to \\(\\mu_c = 1\\).\n\nThus, the cube will slide down the incline without slipping because it does not have any friction opposing its motion. Hence, the cube reaches the bottom of the incline first.\n\n3. For the cylinder:\n- Its moment of inertia around an axis perpendicular to the incline and passing through its center of mass is \\(I = \\frac{2}{3}Mr^2\\), where r is the radius of the cylinder. Thus, \\(k_{cylinder} = \\frac{k_{cylinder}}{\\mu_c}\\), where \\(\\mu_c\\) is the coefficient of kinetic friction. To find the maximum value of \\(\\mu_c\\), we again need to consider the conditions under which the cylinder slides without slipping: \\(Mg - f_{static} = 0\\). Thus, \\(f_{static} = Mg\\), and since \\(r = 1\\), \\(I = \\frac{2}{3}Mr^2 = \\frac{2}{3}mr^2 = \\frac{2}{3}m\\).\n\nFor a cylinder sliding down an incline without slipping, the force parallel to the incline is given by \\(f_{parallel} = N - mg = \\mu_c N\\), where \\(\\mu_c\\) is the coefficient of kinetic friction, N is the normal force, and m is the mass of the cylinder.
