This was largely due to the fact that the U.S. government believed that it needed to maintain a strong military force to protect its interests abroad and to deter potential adversaries from attacking it domestically. However, this also meant that there were periods of high defense spending when the country was engaged in conflicts such as World War II and Vietnam, and periods of lower spending when the country was at peace, such as during the Cold War and the post-Cold War era."
