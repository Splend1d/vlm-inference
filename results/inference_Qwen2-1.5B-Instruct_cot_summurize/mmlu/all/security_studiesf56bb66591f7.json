Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon.\nB. Construction of the means to transmit biological weapons in warfare has focused on the use of vectors, for example lice, fleas, or mosquitoes, as a mode of transmission as a military weapon. These are favoured because the target would find it difficult to contain the source of the outbreak, placing the infrastructure of the target country under strain.\nC. Biological agents comprise bacteria, viral, and toxin agents. However, not every disease provides the basis for an effective biological weapon. An agent's storage, delivery, mode of transmission and its very resilience can shape its effects on a target population.\nD. Inoculation programs against naturally occurring disease have eradicated the potential for viral agents to cause a global pandemic. Vaccination capabilities have undermined calls for the weaponization of viral agents made by some military strategists as most public health authorities have in place programs to deal with a possible outbreak.\n"

                    "text": "The statement \"Biological agents were never weaponized\" is false. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) states that any state may declare war, including using biological weapons, if it decides to do so. Therefore, it is entirely possible that biological weapons have been used throughout history.\n\nHowever, the statement A is partially correct. It is true that biological agents can be stabilized enough to be used as a weapon, but only if they are specifically designed for that purpose. For example, bioweapons such as anthrax or botulism spores require specific conditions to survive and replicate, which makes them difficult to control once released into the environment. Additionally, there are legal restrictions on the development and deployment of biological weapons, and many countries have strict regulations governing their manufacture and use.\n\nAs for option B, while construction of biological weapons has focused on vector-based transmission methods, this does not necessarily mean that biological weapons have ever been successfully deployed in warfare. The concept of biological weapons has been discussed since ancient times, but they have never been widely adopted by any modern nation-state. Today, the majority of nations agree that the use of biological weapons is illegal under international law.\n\nOption C is also partially correct. Not all diseases provide the basis for an effective biological weapon. Some diseases, such as smallpox, have been eradicated through vaccination efforts, while others, such as cholera, can spread rapidly without a vaccine. The resilience of a biological agent depends on various factors, including its stability, infectivity, and ability to evade the immune system.\n\nOption D is also partially correct. While vaccination programs have helped to prevent the spread of certain infectious diseases, they have not eliminated the risk of biological weapons. There is always a possibility that a new bioweapon could emerge and pose a threat to human populations. Additionally, some countries have developed advanced technologies and tactics to counteract biological weapons, such as biocontainment facilities and enhanced surveillance systems."
