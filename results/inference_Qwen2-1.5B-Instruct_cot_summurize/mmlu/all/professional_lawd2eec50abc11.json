The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the landowner and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the landowner and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the landowner's death, his estate is required to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The deed for the remaining 250-acre parcel contained the identical restrictions as the deeds to the other three parcels. The investor, ignoring these restrictions, was able to use his political influence to persuade the county zoning board to rezone the said parcel for commercial use. The residents of phase I seek to enjoin the construction of the shopping center. The residents will have\n\nA. little chance of preventing the projected commercial development.\nB. no standing to enjoin the construction of the shopping center.\nC. no chance of succeeding, because the zoning ordinance takes precedence over the covenant running with the land.\nD. success in their cause of action in accordance with the common development scheme.\n"

                    "text": "The residents of phase I will likely have little chance of preventing the proposed commercial development.\n\nThe reason for this conclusion is that the original deed restrictions specifically prohibit further subdivisions by anyone subsequent to the grantee (i.e., the developer). These restrictions are part of the covenant running with the land, which runs with the land even after the original owner dies or sells the land. Therefore, if the resident homeowners wish to prevent the construction of the shopping center, they would need to challenge the zoning ordinance, rather than attempting to stop the construction directly.\n\nIt is unlikely that the zoning ordinance would take precedence over the covenant running with the land, as the covenant is intended to protect the interests of future generations of owners, not just those currently living on the land. Additionally, the county zoning board's decision to rezone the parcel for commercial use may not be challenged by the residents, since they lack standing to do so under the law.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nA. little chance of preventing the projected commercial development."
