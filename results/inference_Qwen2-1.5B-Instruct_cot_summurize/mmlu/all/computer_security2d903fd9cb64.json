A direct leak comes via the software system's intended interaction mechanism, where as a side channel leak comes from measurements of other system features, like timing, power usage, or space usage.\n\nA direct leak is an intentional security vulnerability in which a program intentionally leaks information that could be used for malicious purposes. For example, if a program is designed to read the contents of a file without permission, this would be considered a direct leak because it was done with the intention of accessing sensitive data.\n\nOn the other hand, a side channel attack is a type of attack in which attackers use information about the underlying hardware or operating system to perform operations that can reveal sensitive information. This can include measuring the time taken by certain functions, observing changes in the power consumption of the system, or using other forms of analysis to determine the state of the system. These attacks do not require the program to have access to any specific information, but rather rely on the properties of the system itself.\n\nIn summary, a direct leak is an intentional vulnerability in the software system's intended interaction mechanism, while a side channel leak is a method of obtaining information through measurements of other system features."
