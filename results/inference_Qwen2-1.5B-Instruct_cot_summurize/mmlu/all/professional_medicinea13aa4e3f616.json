Rabbit antithymocyte globulin is an immunosuppressive agent that blocks the binding of antibodies to T-cell receptors, leading to immunodeficiency and potential autoimmunity. When given in large doses, it can lead to a state of immune suppression, which may result in cytokine secretion by natural killer cells and eosinophil degranulation, but it does not directly cause the symptoms listed (A, B, D) or polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation (D)."
