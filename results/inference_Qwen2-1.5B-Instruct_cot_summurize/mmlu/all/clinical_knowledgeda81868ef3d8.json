The most common places where it is palpable include the carotid artery in the neck, the radial artery in the arm, and the femoral artery in the leg. \n\nWhen the left ventricle contracts during systole, which occurs when the heart is filling with blood from the veins, it compresses the blood in the arteries, causing them to dilate and create a pulse. This is why the pulse can sometimes be felt on the wrist or ankle when the hand or foot is raised above the level of the heart."
