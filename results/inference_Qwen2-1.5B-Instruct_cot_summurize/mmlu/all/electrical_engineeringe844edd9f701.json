                    "text": "The correct answer is B. Perpendicular to the circumference of the wire.\n\nWhen a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it generates its own magnetic field due to Faraday's law of induction. This induced electric field opposes the original magnetic field and creates a counter-acting force on the moving charges within the wire. As a result, the wire becomes twisted or bent into a circular shape.\n\nSince the direction of the induced electric field is opposite to that of the original magnetic field (which points radially outward from the center), the resulting magnetic field at any point inside the wire will be perpendicular to both the original magnetic field and the direction of the induced electric field. Therefore, the magnetic field around each portion of the wire will be perpendicular to the circumference of the wire."
