Not wrong, not wrong. \n\nIn Scenario 1, blowing up the cousin's balloon was a harmless action that did not cause any harm or inconvenience to anyone else. It also did not involve any wrongdoing towards the cousin or others. In fact, it could be seen as a fun and playful gesture.\n\nIn Scenario 2, missing school due to having a cold is generally considered acceptable behavior since it is a common reason for students to miss school. However, if the absence from school caused significant disruption or inconvenience to other students or teachers, then it may be seen as morally wrong depending on the circumstances."
