The distance between the Earth and the Sun does not affect the length of the year, which is determined by the gravitational force between the two bodies. If the Earth were to move closer to the Sun, its orbit would become more elliptical, but the average distance between the Earth and the Sun would remain constant. Therefore, the length of the year would remain the same regardless of the new orbit of the Earth. \n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD. The length of the year wouldn't change because the Earth's mass stays the same."
