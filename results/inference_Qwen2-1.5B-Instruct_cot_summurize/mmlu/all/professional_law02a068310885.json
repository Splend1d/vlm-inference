The written contract entered included a \"payment clause,\" which provided that the videographer would be \"paid $10,000 for the filming and editing of a 60-minute video of the wedding and the reception. \" The man included in the contract a stipulation that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment. The contract made no other reference to compensation. Thereafter, the videographer filmed and edited the 60-minute video, using high definition equipment, and presented it to the man. The videographer then submitted to the man an invoice statement in the amount of $15,000. Besides the $10,000 contract figure, the bill included a $5,000 charge for the use of the high definition equipment. Denying any additional liability, the man sent the videographer a check for $10,000. The videographer then brought suit against the man to recover the additional $5,000. Which of the following arguments would be most persuasive to support the videographer's contention that when the written contract was executed, the man agreed to pay the videographer $5,000 for use of the high definition equipment in addition to the $10,000 fee?\n\nA. According to the customary trade practice of the video industry, a $10,000 fee for filming and editing means $10,000 in addition to a supplemental charge if high definition equipment is used.\nB. An oral agreement to that effect, if provable, would only supplement, not contradict, the \"payment clause\" as written.\nC. Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms \"would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document. \"\nD. Assuming arguendo that the written \"payment clause\" was fully integrated and neither patently nor latently ambiguous, equitable considerations require admission of extrinsic evidence, if available, of the parties' intent, since the videographer would stand to lose $5,000 on the contract.\n"

Assuming arguendo that the written \"payment clause\" was fully integrated and neither patently nor latently ambiguous, equitable considerations require admission of extrinsic evidence, if available, of the parties' intent, since the videographer would stand to lose $5,000 on the contract.\n\nThis argument suggests that the videographer should be compensated for the use of high-definition equipment even though there was no explicit mention of it in the original contract. The videographer may argue that the parties intended to include the cost of high-definition equipment in the total payment, but this can only be proven through extrinsic evidence, such as a contemporaneous agreement or testimony from witnesses who were present during negotiations. If the videographer can prove that the man agreed to pay an additional $5,000 for the use of high-definition equipment, the court may find that the contract was breached and award the videographer the additional money."
