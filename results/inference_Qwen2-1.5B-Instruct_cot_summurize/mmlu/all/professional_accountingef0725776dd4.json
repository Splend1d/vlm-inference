The total amount of these costs is $10,000 + $15,000 + $44,000 = $69,000. However, only the costs incurred before establishing technological feasibility ($10,000) can be considered as software development costs. Therefore, the capitalized software cost in the December 31 year 2 balance sheet would be $10,000. \n\nOther costs such as maintenance, support, and updates are not included in this calculation."
