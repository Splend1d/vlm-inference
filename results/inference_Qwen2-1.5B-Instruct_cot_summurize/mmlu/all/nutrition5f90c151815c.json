It plays an important role in digestion, absorption, and immune function. The presence of certain bacteria can influence the symptoms of various conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Probiotic supplements have been shown to help alleviate some symptoms of IBS and IBD, but their effects on other health conditions are still being studied. Oligosaccharides are types of dietary fiber that can affect the composition of the colonic microbiome. They are commonly found in foods like bananas, apples, and oats. However, more research is needed to fully understand how they impact the colonic microbiome."
