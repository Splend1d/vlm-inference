In other words, the argument assumes that one action or practice will inevitably lead to a series of negative consequences, but then proceeds to argue that this inevitable chain of events must happen, without providing any evidence for such a prediction. \n\nIf the imagined outcomes do not turn out as expected (condition A), then the argument may still be fallacious because it relies on an unsupported assumption about what could happen in the future, rather than presenting evidence for such a possibility. Similarly, if the argument's central claim turns out not to be plausible (condition B), then the argument may also be fallacious because it does not provide sufficient justification for its assumptions or conclusions.\n\nTherefore, either condition A or B can make the argument fallacious."
