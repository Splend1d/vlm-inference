One afternoon, the woman was in the kitchen of her home preparing a snack when she glanced out the window and saw a horrible crime being committed. The woman watched in horror as a local gang member pulled out a handgun and used it to shoot the victim, a member of a rival gang. The gang member did not know anyone was witnessing his act of shooting the victim. The woman watched as the victim collapsed and fell dead on her neighbor's front lawn. As a result of her shock from viewing this horrible incident, the woman suffered a miscarriage. If the woman asserts a claim against the local gang member who shot the victim, the woman will\n\nA. recover, because she suffered a physical injury, rather than just emotional harm.\nB. recover, because the gang member acted intentionally in shooting the victim.\nC. not recover, because the woman was not within the zone of danger.\nD. not recover, because the gang member was unaware that the woman was watching.\n"

In this case, the gang member had no intention of harming the victim and instead acted recklessly by using a gun to shoot him. Therefore, the woman can recover damages from the gang member for the loss of her unborn child.\n\nOption A is incorrect because emotional harm is not a legal basis for recovery in tort law. Emotional distress is considered compensable only if it can be shown to have been caused by the defendant's conduct.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the woman was within the zone of danger at the time of the incident. The woman was in the kitchen of her home, which is typically considered part of the \"zone of danger\" for victims of violent crimes.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because the woman was aware of the situation and could have taken steps to protect herself, such as calling 911 or attempting to intervene. However, even without taking action, the woman can still recover damages for the loss of her unborn child under the doctrine of respondeat superior."
