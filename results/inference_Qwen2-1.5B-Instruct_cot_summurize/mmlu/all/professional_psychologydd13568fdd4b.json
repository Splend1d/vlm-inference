Sensitive or critical periods\n\nThe idea that individuals may have different possible developmental trajectories, given the timing of an environmental experience or lack thereof, is the concept of sensitive or critical periods. This refers to the time in development when exposure to certain stimuli or experiences can lead to lasting changes in behavior, personality, or cognitive abilities. These periods are often considered as windows of opportunity for learning and development, during which early intervention can be particularly effective."
