Raise real output and raise the price level.\n\nWhen taxes are cut, it means there is less money being taken out of the economy for government use, which can lead to higher disposable income for individuals and businesses. This increase in disposable income can lead to higher consumption and investment, which can boost economic growth and real output over time.\n\nIn addition, when taxes are cut, it also increases demand for goods and services, leading to higher prices. As more people have more disposable income, they may be willing to pay more for goods and services, driving up prices. This can also lead to higher inflation if supply cannot keep up with demand.\n\nTherefore, the combination of increased disposable income and higher prices due to increased demand leads to both higher real output (output per worker) and higher price levels. Over the long term, this can help stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment."
