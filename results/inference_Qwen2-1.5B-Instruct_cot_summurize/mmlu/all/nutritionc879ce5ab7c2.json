May lead to intestinal obstruction\n\nCrohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the digestive tract, usually affecting the small intestine and sometimes the large intestine (colon). It can cause inflammation and damage to the lining of the intestines, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, fatigue, and malnutrition.\n\nWhile Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, it most commonly affects the small intestine. It can also lead to complications such as intestinal obstruction if the affected area becomes inflamed enough to block the passage of food and liquids through the intestines.\n\nIt is not necessary for patients with Crohn's disease to follow a gluten-free diet. Gluten is found in certain grains like wheat, barley, and rye, but not all people with Crohn's disease experience digestive issues due to gluten consumption. However, some people may have difficulty digesting gluten and may benefit from avoiding it altogether or reducing their intake.\n\nIn summary, while Crohn's disease can cause significant symptoms and complications, it is not always necessary to follow a strict gluten-free diet. However, dietary changes can be beneficial for some individuals depending on their personal experiences with the condition. If you have concerns about your health, it's important to speak with a healthcare professional."
