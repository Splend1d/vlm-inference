Good cause - A reason may constitute sufficient good cause or excusable neglect to enable a litigant to file a late notice of appeal if there is evidence that the delay was due to circumstances beyond the control of the party seeking to appeal (e.g., death of a spouse, illness, unexpected events). \n\n2. Excuseable neglect - This occurs when a party fails to act within their legal duty because they acted reasonably under all the circumstances, including lack of knowledge or misunderstanding of the law, inability to comply with the law due to unforeseen circumstances, or other legitimate reasons.\n\nIn this case, option C states that the litigant ran a red light causing a car crash just before the judgment was rendered, and was in the hospital for two months recovering. This meets the criteria for sufficient good cause or excusable neglect."
