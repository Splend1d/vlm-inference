The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line may have opposite signs.\n\nThe correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, while the slope of the regression line represents the change in one variable for every unit change in the other variable. These two measurements can sometimes be misleadingly interpreted as being equivalent, but they do not necessarily have the same sign or magnitude. For example, if r = 0.5 and y increases by 2 units when x increases by 1 unit, then the slope of the regression line would be 2/1 = 2, which is positive. However, this does not imply that there is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between x and y, only that there is a positive linear relationship. Therefore, statement A is true."
