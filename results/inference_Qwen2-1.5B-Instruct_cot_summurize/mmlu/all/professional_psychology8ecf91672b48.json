Health are accurate predictors of job satisfaction.\n\nJob satisfaction refers to the level of happiness, fulfillment, or contentment that one feels at work. It can be influenced by factors such as job security, compensation, opportunities for growth and development, relationships with colleagues and supervisors, and overall job environment.\n\nHealth is also closely linked to job satisfaction. Research has shown that high levels of job satisfaction are associated with better physical and mental health outcomes, including lower rates of stress, burnout, and depression.\n\nTherefore, both job performance and health are important predictors of job satisfaction."
