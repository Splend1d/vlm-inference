The closest option is likely B, 3.6 ounces of oil. However, since the question asks for the amount of oil in ounces, we cannot simply multiply 3.6 by 5. We need to convert 3.6 ounces of oil into ounces of vinegar. Since the ratio of vinegar to oil is 2:5, we can set up the proportion $\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{x}{3.6}$, where $x$ is the number of ounces of vinegar needed. Cross-multiplying gives us $5x = 2 \\times 3.6$, so $5x = 6.4$. Dividing both sides by 5 gives us $x = \\frac{6.4}{5} = 1.28$. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get $x = 2$. So, the correct answer is actually B, 3.6 ounces of oil."
