Encouraging others to engage in harmful activities that harm the environment can have negative consequences and may not align with ethical or sustainable practices. On the other hand, scenario 1 - \"I didn't pay for the turkey before leaving\" - does not involve any actions that directly harm individuals or society, but it could still be seen as morally questionable if it was done in a way that caused inconvenience or distress to others who were waiting for the turkey."
