                    "text": "The charge stored on each capacitor will be proportional to its capacitance and voltage across it. Since the original capacitor has a capacitance of 2 \u03bcF and is fully charged to 600 \u03bcC, we can find the voltage across it using Ohm's Law: V = Q/C. Here, V is the voltage, Q is the charge, and C is the capacitance.\n\nV = 600 \u03bcC / 2 \u03bcF = 300 V\n\nWhen the capacitors are replaced by three 18 \u03bcF capacitors in series, their equivalent capacitance is:\n\n(1/2) * (18 \u03bcF + 18 \u03bcF + 18 \u03bcF) = 54 \u03bcF\n\nSince the total voltage across all capacitors remains constant, we can use Ohm's Law again to find the charge on each capacitor:\n\nQ = V * C_total = 300 V * 54 \u03bcF = 16200 \u03bcC\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among your options. The charge stored on each capacitor would be approximately 16200 \u03bcC. However, none of the given options match this result, so there seems to have been a misunderstanding or an oversight in the question. If you meant to ask about the voltage across each capacitor after replacing them, then the voltage would indeed be 300 V for each capacitor. But without specifying which option was intended, I cannot definitively choose between A, B, C, or D."
