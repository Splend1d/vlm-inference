In this context, world food banks could potentially become a \"commons\" where the collective effort and contributions from all nations are needed to ensure the sustainability of the program. However, without proper governance and coordination mechanisms, the system could easily become overused, depleted, or mismanaged, leading to inefficiencies and potential negative impacts on society. Therefore, establishing a world food bank requires careful planning and management to avoid such consequences."
