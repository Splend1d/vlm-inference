However, if we were considering rounding up or down based on specific rules or constraints in the scenario, then the actual number could be any runner count within this range that meets those criteria. For example:\n\n- If rounding up means adding one extra runner to make it 400, then the actual number of runners could be 399.\n- If rounding down means subtracting one runner to make it 399, then the actual number of runners could be 401.\n\nSo without additional information about rounding rules or constraints, there's no single correct answer; the actual number of runners could fall anywhere between 390 and 400, inclusive, depending on how rounding is defined."
