The dimension of this intersection is at most the smaller of the dimensions of $V$ and $W$, but can be less.\n\nIn the case where $V$ and $W$ are both one-dimensional subspaces (i.e., they each consist of a single vector), their intersection will also have dimension one. This is because any linear combination of vectors from $V$ and $W$ that results in a vector in $V \\cap W$ must itself lie in $V$ or $W$.\n\nHowever, if either $V$ or $W$ has more than one element, then their intersection cannot be one-dimensional. For example, consider $V = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : x + y = 0\\}$ and $W = \\{(x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : x + z = 0\\}$. Then $V \\cap W = \\{(0,0,z) : z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$, which is a plane in three-dimensional space.\n\nTherefore, the possible dimensions for the intersection of $V$ and $W$ are 0, 1, and 2. So the correct answer is D: 0, 1, and 2 only."
