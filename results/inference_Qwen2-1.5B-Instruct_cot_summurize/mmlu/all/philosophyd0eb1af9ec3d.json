Justice and virtue are universal goals of all human beings, even if people do not always agree on how to achieve those ends.\n\nAccording to Plato's theory of Forms, justice and virtue are ideals that exist independently of any particular situation or example. These ideals are eternal and unchanging, and they provide a standard against which we can measure our own actions and the actions of others. By studying these ideal forms, we can gain insight into what constitutes true justice and virtue, and use this knowledge to guide our behavior in real-world situations.\n\nTherefore, it is not sufficient to simply memorize examples of justice or virtue; we must also understand the underlying principles that make them just or virtuous. Only by understanding the essence of justice and virtue can we truly live a worthwhile life, regardless of whether we have encountered specific examples of them."
