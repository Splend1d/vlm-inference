This approach emphasizes the protection of individuals from harm and their basic freedoms, such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. \n\nOn the other hand, human security is an expanded concept that includes not only the physical safety but also the well-being of individuals, including economic stability, social inclusion, and access to education and healthcare. It recognizes that security can no longer be limited to the state's borders and requires a holistic approach that addresses the multiple dimensions of human well-being.\n\nTherefore, option A (All of these options) correctly identifies that both traditional concepts of national security and human security include aspects beyond just the physical security of individuals, such as economic stability and social inclusion. However, it does not accurately characterize the traditional concept in relation to human security as stated in option C, which suggests that traditional interpretations of security and threats are important boundaries that define human security.\n\nOption D incorrectly states that the concept of national security is too narrow to be useful when analyzing current threats. While the traditional concept may not encompass all current threats, it still provides a framework for understanding and addressing potential risks to human life, human rights, and human dignity. Human security goes beyond this and seeks to protect individuals across all aspects of their lives, making it more comprehensive than the traditional approach."
