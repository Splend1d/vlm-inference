                    "text": "The correct answer is C. Potatoes contain starch and other nutrients that are not soluble in water, so when they are submerged in water, they will absorb water and swell up due to osmotic pressure. This process is called plasmolysis, which occurs because the cell membrane becomes more permeable to water molecules, allowing them to flow out of the cell and into the surrounding solution.\n\nAs for option D, solutes do not move into the potato; rather, they remain inside the cell and are dissolved in the water around it. So this option is incorrect.\n\nOption A is also incorrect as there is no movement of water from the potato into the surrounding water. The potato is absorbing water from the water, causing it to swell up.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is C."
