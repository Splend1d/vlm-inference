This association refers to the migration patterns from Europe during the 18th century, not the 19th century as stated in option B. The migration patterns for the 19th century were predominantly from Asia and Africa, with less emphasis on the Americas or Africa. Option C is also incorrect because it suggests that there was no significant migration of Eastern and Southern Europeans to the United States until after 1870, which is not true given the large influx of immigrants from these regions during this time period. Therefore, the correct answer is D."
