Secondary succession would begin to occur.\n\nWhen a forest is destroyed by fire, it typically starts with the growth of pioneer plants such as wildflowers and mosses that can survive in the disturbed soil. Over time, these plants provide habitat for smaller animals like insects and fungi. As the forest begins to regenerate, it will eventually become dominated by trees again, leading to secondary succession. This process involves the return of many of the original tree species, but also introduces new ones from other areas due to the disturbance caused by the fire. Therefore, while some animal life may not survive the initial aftermath of the fire, they should recover over time through secondary succession."
