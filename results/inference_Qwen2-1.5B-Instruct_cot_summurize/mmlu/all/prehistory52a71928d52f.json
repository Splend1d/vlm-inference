A picnic site may contain some secondary refuse like wrappers and cans, but it is not designed to be a landfill for primary refuse. A trash dump is a place where garbage is disposed of in an unsanitary manner, often illegally, which includes primary refuse. Recycling areas are places where people can dispose of their recyclable materials safely, so they do not contain primary refuse."
