It rejects the Kantian concern with individual rights, equality, and justice.\n\nPostmodernism is an intellectual movement that emerged in the mid-20th century as a response to the prevailing ideas of modernity. Postmodernists rejected the idea that there was a single objective truth or reality that could be known through reason alone. Instead, they argued that knowledge was always subjective and culturally specific, and that it was impossible to arrive at any universal truths or principles.\n\nOne of the key tenets of postmodernism is the rejection of the Enlightenment ideals of reason, progress, and individual freedom. Postmodernists argue that these ideals were ultimately flawed because they privileged Western European culture over other cultures and did not take into account the experiences of marginalized groups. They also reject the notion of individual rights and equality, arguing that these concepts are inherently oppressive and do not reflect the complexity of human experience.\n\nOverall, the postmodernist project is characterized by a skepticism towards established knowledge systems and a focus on cultural difference and subjectivity."
