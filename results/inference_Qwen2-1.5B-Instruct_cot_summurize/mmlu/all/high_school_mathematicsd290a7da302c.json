Since each half-life results in losing half of the remaining substance, we have:\n\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^n = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[ n = 1 \\] because \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^1 = \\frac{1}{3} = 0.333...\\)\n\nThus, it takes 1 half-life for one-third of the substance to decay. To find the total time taken, we multiply by the half-life itself:\n\n\\[ T_{total} = t \\times n = 8 \\times 1 = 8 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **8 years**."
