In Pompe disease, there is a deficiency of this enzyme, leading to accumulation of glycogen in the liver cells.\n\nThe accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes is likely due to defects in the enzyme activity or its delivery to the lysosome. This can lead to the buildup of glycogen in the lysosomes, causing symptoms such as heart failure and neurological problems."
