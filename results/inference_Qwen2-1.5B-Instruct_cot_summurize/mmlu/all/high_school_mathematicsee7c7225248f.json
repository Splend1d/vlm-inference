Since 4 daps = 7 yaps, we can say that 1 dap = (7/4) yaps.\n\nNext, let's find out how many yaps are equivalent to one bap. Since 5 yaps = 3 baps, we can say that 1 yap = (3/5) baps.\n\nNow, let's find out how many daps are equivalent to one bap. Since 1 dap = (7/4) yaps, and 1 yap = (3/5) baps, we can say that 1 dap = ((7/4) * (3/5)) baps = (21/20) baps.\n\nFinally, let's find out how many daps are equivalent to one bap. Since 1 dap = (21/20) baps, we can say that 1 dap = (20/21) baps.\n\nSo, if we want to find out how many daps are equivalent to 42 baps, we need to divide 42 by (20/21). This gives us:\n\\[ \\frac{42}{(20/21)} = \\frac{42*21}{20} = \\frac{922}{20} = 46.1. \\]\nSince the number of daps must be an integer, this means that there is no whole number solution for this problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$ (30)."
