Vegan diets that do not include fortified plant-based milk or other sources of vitamin B12 can lead to a deficiency of this nutrient. \n\nA. Vitamin B1: This vitamin is found in many foods, including whole grains, leafy greens, and legumes, so it is unlikely to be a major concern for vegans.\n\nB. Folate: While folate is important for pregnant women, it is also present in many foods and can be obtained through a balanced vegan diet.\n\nD. Vitamin A: While vitamin A is necessary for vision and overall health, it is typically found in animal products such as meat, fish, and dairy. Vegans who consume a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may have adequate intake of vitamin A from their diet."
