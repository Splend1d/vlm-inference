                    "text": "The correct answer is C. A greater distribution of reactant molecules will have high velocities.\n\nWhen the temperature is increased, the kinetic energy of the molecules increases. This results in an increase in the average velocity of the molecules, which leads to an increase in the reaction rate. Therefore, increasing the temperature of the system increases the rate of reaction, but it does not directly affect the distribution of reactant molecules' velocities. Instead, it affects their kinetic energy and therefore their speed."
