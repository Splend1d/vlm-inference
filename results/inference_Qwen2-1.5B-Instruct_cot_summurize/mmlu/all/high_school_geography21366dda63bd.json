The government has implemented policies to promote the use of Russian in official documents and has even banned the use of foreign languages in some areas of education. Additionally, there have been efforts to create new Russian words that do not contain foreign influences.\n\nItaly and Japan also have policies in place to preserve their native languages from contamination by English and other languages. However, it is unclear whether they are as successful in doing so as Russia.\n\nBrazil does not have specific policies aimed at preserving its native language from contamination by English or other languages. While the country has a diverse population with different linguistic backgrounds, the majority of Brazilians speak Portuguese, which is the official language of Brazil."
