Whether or not the manufacturer had been a party to the former proceeding. \n\nThe hearsay exception for former testimony allows for the admission of evidence that is older than one year and was offered at the first instance of its use. This exception is based on the principle that the original declarant would not have known that the information was relevant until it was used at the second instance.\n\nIn the context of a negligence lawsuit, the expert's testimony about the safety of the car could be considered hearsay because it involves opinions about what happened in the past (the safety of the car). However, if the manufacturer had an opportunity to cross-examine the expert at the previous proceeding, then the court may allow the testimony under the hearsay exception for former testimony if the testimony was offered at the first instance of its use. If the manufacturer did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the expert, then the court may still admit the testimony if it meets the other exceptions for admitting hearsay evidence, such as relevance, authenticity, and necessity."
