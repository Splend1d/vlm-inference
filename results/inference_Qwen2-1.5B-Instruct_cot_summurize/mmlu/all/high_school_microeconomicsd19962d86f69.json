Demand for beef is price elastic if a 10% increase in price leads to a decrease of more than 10% in quantity demanded.\n\nGiven the change in price (10%) and change in quantity demanded (20%), we need to determine whether this qualifies as an elastic demand. The formula for elasticity is:\n\\[ \\text{Price Elasticity} = \\frac{\\%\\text{Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\\%\\text{Change in Price}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we get:\n\\[ \\text{Price Elasticity} = \\frac{-20\\%}{-10\\%} = 2 \\]\n\nThis means that the demand for beef is elastic at 20%. Therefore, the answer is A. Demand for beef is price elastic and consumer spending on beef is falling. \n\nB. Demand for beef is price elastic if a 10% increase in price leads to a decrease of more than 10% in quantity demanded.\n\nWe have already established that the demand for beef is indeed elastic under these conditions.\n\nC. Demand for beef is price inelastic if a 10% increase in price leads to a decrease of less than 10% in quantity demanded.\n\nThis does not match the given scenario since a 10% increase in price would result in a 20% decrease in quantity demanded, which is clearly not inelastic.\n\nD. Demand for beef is price inelastic if a 10% increase in price leads to a decrease of less than 10% in quantity demanded.\n\nAgain, our analysis shows that the demand for beef is actually elastic with a 20% decrease in quantity demanded for every 10% increase in price.\n\nTherefore, none of the options provided directly match the scenario described in the question, so the correct answer cannot be determined from the information provided. However, based on the analysis above, the most likely answer is **A**, because it correctly identifies the relationship between price changes and quantity demanded when considering both the rise in price and the fall in quantity demanded."
