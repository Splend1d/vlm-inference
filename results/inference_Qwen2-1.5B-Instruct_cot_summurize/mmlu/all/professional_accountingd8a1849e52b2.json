Cost of equity will likely decrease.\n\nWhen there is an increase in the inflation rate, it means that investors require more money to purchase an equivalent amount of goods and services. This leads to a decrease in the value of future cash flows, which is reflected in a lower stock price.\n\nIn this scenario, the dividend payout ratio (the ratio of dividends paid out as a percentage of net income) is fixed at 50%, so the cost of equity can be calculated using the Gordon Growth Model. Under this model, the cost of equity is typically assumed to be equal to the required return on equity plus the risk-free rate minus the dividend discount rate. In this case, the required return on equity would be 12% (6% - 5%), and the risk-free rate would be 4% (5% - 1%).\n\nHowever, with a higher inflation rate, the inflation premium (the additional yield required to offset the loss in purchasing power due to inflation) decreases. Therefore, the cost of equity should also decrease. This decrease in the cost of equity will likely lead to an increase in the stock price.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Cost of equity will likely decrease."
