The balanced equation is:\n\n\\[C_2H_4 + 3O_2 \\rightarrow 2CO_2 + 2H_2O\\]\n\nFrom this balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of ethane reacts with 3 moles of oxygen to produce 2 moles of carbon dioxide.\n\nGiven that you have 84 g of ethane, which is equivalent to \\(0.84\\) moles of ethane, the calculation for the amount of carbon dioxide produced is:\n\n\\[0.84 \\text{ moles} \\times 2 = 1.68 \\text{ moles}\\]\n\nSince there are 16 amu in one mole of carbon, the mass of carbon dioxide produced in grams is:\n\n\\[1.68 \\text{ moles} \\times 16 \\text{ amu/mole} = 26.08 \\text{ grams}\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. 264g**."
