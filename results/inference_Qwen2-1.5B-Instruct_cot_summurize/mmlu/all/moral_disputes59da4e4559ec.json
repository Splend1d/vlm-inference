However, this does not necessarily mean that the primary goal is to minimize the suffering of all sentient creatures or to maximize human welfare at any cost. It is possible for humans to prioritize other values such as environmental sustainability or social justice over maximizing human welfare in certain situations. Therefore, option D is the most comprehensive answer that encompasses both the environmental concerns and the potential benefits to society."
