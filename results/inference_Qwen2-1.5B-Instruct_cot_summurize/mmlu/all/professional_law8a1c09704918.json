In its case-in-chief, the government wants to introduce a copy of the defendant's transcript from a technical college to show his certificate as gunsmith. The college is no longer in existence, though, and the whereabouts of the previous officials and employees are unknown. However, the transcript bears a seal above the registrar's signature, and the court has taken judicial notice of the existence of the college and has found that it is normal for a college to compile a transcript. Finally, the information about the defendant on the transcript has been corroborated by a government witness. Assume the prosecution provided the defendants with a copy of the transcript before trial and informed them of its intent to introduce it as evidence. The transcript will be admitted\n\nA. as a business record, because the custodian can testifS' as to how the records of the college were kept.\nB. under the general hearsay exception, as the transcript in these circumstances has sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\nC. only if the registrar's signature can be authenticated by an expert witness.\nD. only if the defendant waives his right to object to its admission.\n"

Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption A is also incorrect because the transcript is not a business record created or maintained by the person creating it (the college), so it cannot be admitted as a business record under Rule 803(6)(a). Option B is also incorrect because the transcript is a business record created and maintained by the college, but the hearsay exception does not apply to business records unless they meet certain criteria. Option D is incorrect because the defendant did not waive his right to object to the admission of the transcript. Instead, the defendant had the opportunity to present evidence at trial that the transcript was fabricated or tampered with, which would have allowed him to challenge the admission of the transcript. If the defendant failed to do so, the transcript would still be admissible under Rule 803(6)(a)."
