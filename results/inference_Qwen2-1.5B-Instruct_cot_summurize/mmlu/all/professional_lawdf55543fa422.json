The contract signed by the woman was to last for one year and called upon the woman to pay $2,000 in quarterly payments of $500. The contract also specified that all fees were non-refundable. Upon signing the contract, the woman made her first payment of $500 and started classes the next day. The woman attended classes on a regular basis for the next three months. At the end of the three-month period, the woman was involved in an automobile accident. Although she was not seriously injured, her doctor advised the woman that she needed complete rest. Her doctor told her to avoid strenuous activity and advised her to discontinue her pre-natal exercise classes. One week later, the woman received a billing notice from the gymnasium, indicating that her second installment payment of $500 was past due. She immediately telephoned the manager of the gymnasium and informed him that she would not be attending any further classes because of her accident. Also, the woman said she did not feel obligated to make any additional payments. Which of the following most accurately describes the woman's duty to pay the gymnasium the second installment fee of $500?\n\nA. It would be excused, because of impossibility of performance.\nB. It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.\nC. It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.\nD. It would be not excused, because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is D. It would be not excused, because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent.\n\nUnder common law principles, a condition precedent is a term used in contracts where the fulfillment of one party's obligation depends on the fulfillment of another party's promise or condition. In this case, the woman's duty to pay the second installment fee of $500 is a condition precedent, meaning it must be fulfilled before the other party can perform their obligations under the contract.\n\nTherefore, even if the woman had an accident and could not attend classes, she still owes the gymnasium the second installment fee of $500 as a condition precedent to performing her contractual obligations. This means the gymnasium has a legal right to collect the fee regardless of whether the woman chooses to fulfill her obligation."
