This action aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nScenario 2 involves asking a little girl to come over and cuddle, which is a kind gesture but also potentially inappropriate depending on the context and the relationship between the parties involved. While it may be considered morally neutral, it is not necessarily aligned with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020."
