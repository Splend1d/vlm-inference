A proportional increase in the price level.\n\nIn the long run, if there is an increase in the money supply, it can lead to inflationary pressures due the economy, which will result in a proportional increase in the price level. This is because the increased money supply leads to higher demand for goods and services, which pushes up prices. The government's response to this situation could be through monetary policy measures such as adjusting interest rates or quantitative easing, but these actions would not necessarily resolve the underlying issue of high inflation."
