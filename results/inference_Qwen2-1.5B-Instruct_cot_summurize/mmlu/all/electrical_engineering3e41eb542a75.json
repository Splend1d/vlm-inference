The amount of energy an electron can gain or lose is limited and depends on its position relative to the nucleus.\n\nOption A (moving faster or slower in an allowed orbit) describes how electrons move around the nucleus. However, this does not explain how energy is gained or lost; it simply refers to changes in velocity.\n\nOption B (jumping from one allowed orbit to another) correctly represents how electrons transition between different atomic shells when they absorb or emit light. This process is known as spectral lines in spectroscopy.\n\nOption C (being completely removed from an atom) is incorrect because atoms do not have complete empty states; they always contain some unoccupied electrons.\n\nOption D (jumping from one atom to another atom) is also incorrect for the same reason: atoms are not able to exchange electrons freely with other atoms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. jumping from one allowed orbit to another."
