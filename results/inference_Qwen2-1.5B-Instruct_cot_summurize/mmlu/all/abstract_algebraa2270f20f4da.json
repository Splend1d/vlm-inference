For example, if we have two cyclic groups \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), where \\(|G|=m\\) and \\(|H|=n\\), then their external direct product \\(G \\times H\\) will be cyclic with order \\(mn\\).\n\nStatement 2: \"The external direct product of \\(D_3\\) and \\(D_4\\) is isomorphic to \\(D_{12}\\).\"\nLet's examine this statement more closely.\n- \\(D_n\\) represents the dihedral group of order \\(2n\\).\n- \\(D_3\\) has order \\(3\\) and can be represented by rotations around an axis that forms a triangle.\n- \\(D_4\\) has order \\(4\\) and can be represented by rotations around axes forming a square.\n- Since \\(D_3\\) and \\(D_4\\) share the same order, they can form a subgroup of \\(D_{12}\\) under some operation. However, it is not guaranteed that this subgroup is isomorphic to \\(D_{12}\\).\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis above, the correct answer would be:\n\nB. False, False"
