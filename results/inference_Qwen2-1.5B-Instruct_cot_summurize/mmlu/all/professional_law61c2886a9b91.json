At trial, the widow offered the testimony of a coworker of the husband. The coworker testified that he had seen the rail car on which the husband was riding slow down and the cars behind it gain speed. The coworker also stated that he later heard a loud crash, but did not turn around to look because loud noises were common in the yard. Three other railroad employees testified that no collision had occurred. At the close of the evidence, the railroad moved for judgment as a matter of law, which was denied, and the case was submitted to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the widow. The railroad has made a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. What standard should the court apply to determine how to rule on the motion?\n\nA. Whether the evidence revealed a genuine dispute of material fact supporting the widow's claim.\nB. Whether the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.\nC. Whether the widow presented a scintilla of evidence to support the verdict.\nD. Whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the verdict, resolving all disputed issues in the widow's favor.\n"

Whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the verdict, resolving all disputed issues in the widow's favor.\n\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), a party may move for judgment as a matter of law at any time before or during trial. The court must grant the motion if the moving party shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the non-moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. This means that the court will not consider any evidence or arguments from either side about the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Instead, the court will decide the case based solely on the evidence presented by the parties.\n\nIn this case, the widow presented testimony from a coworker who saw the train slow down and the cars behind it gain speed, followed by a loud crash. However, three other railroad employees testified that no collision had occurred. The railroad moved for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that the evidence did not show that the train collided with another train. The court should grant the railroad's motion for judgment as a matter of law because there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the train collided with another train. Therefore, the court should resolve all disputed issues in the widow's favor and enter judgment in favor of the railroad."
