Following the killings, the police issued an \"all-points-bulletin\" for the arrest of a 40-year-old Caucasian male (height, 6 feet; weight, 150-155 pounds), who had been seen near the location of the bank robbery. On Friday, a security guard at a local department store was walking down Main Street when he noticed a tall, African American man who fit the bank robbery suspect's description in age, height, and weight. The security guard approached the person (and believing him to be the bank robbery suspect), pulled a gun and arrested him. The security guard held the man in custody until the police arrived a short time later. The police officer informed the security guard that he had arrested the wrong person. The man had told the security guard that he was not the man who had committed the bank robbery and shot the police officers. The man was humiliated by the false arrest. If the man asserts a claim for assault against the security guard, he will\n\nA. succeed, if the man saw the security guard pointing the gun at him.\nB. succeed, if the security guard's mistaken belief was unreasonable.\nC. not succeed, because the security guard did not intend to injure the man.\nD. not succeed, because the man did not suffer any injury from the security guard's act.\n"

In this case, the security guard mistakenly believed that the man he arrested was the bank robbery suspect based on his appearance. However, it is not clear whether the security guard intended to cause harm to the man or simply believed he was doing so. \n\nIf the security guard's mistake was reasonable and based on objective evidence, then the man would not have a viable claim for assault. Objective evidence includes eyewitness testimony, fingerprints, DNA evidence, and other observable characteristics that could lead someone to believe they are dealing with a known criminal. \n\nHowever, if the security guard's mistake was unreasonable and based on subjective belief, such as assuming the man was the suspect based solely on his race or perceived demeanor, then the man may have a viable claim for assault. This type of assault involves intentional harm caused by someone's mistaken belief that they are dealing with a dangerous individual. \n\nIn this scenario, the security guard's mistake was based on his subjective belief that the man was the bank robbery suspect, which is not objectively supported by any observable evidence. Therefore, the man may have a viable claim for assault based on this mistaken belief."
