Although often missing from the traditional literature on war and security, women frequently serve the purposes of nationalise causes, with nationalism often presented in highly gendered and female terms, where women are symbols of statehood.\nB. A sense of national identity can be developed through a variety of shared experiences, including war. The glorification of iconic national figures such as political leaders is not noticeably gendered and men and women generally perform the same types of roles within the public realm.\nC. Measures of national pride and success are biased towards the glorification of female attributes such as the ability to bear children. The restriction of women to the domestic sphere creates a sense of national identity that is founded on a celebration of home life, feminine strength, and maternal characteristics.\nD. When thinking about national identity, violence, physical strength, aggression, and the ability to use force are attributed as feminine characteristics.

When thinking about national identity, violence, physical strength, aggression, and the ability to use force are attributed as feminine characteristics. The male identity is imagined as being one of domesticity, nurturing, care, and child rearing.\n\nGender shapes the conceptualization of nationhood and conflict in several ways. Firstly, the concept of \"nationalism\" is often presented in highly gendered and female terms, where women are seen as symbols of statehood. This implies that women's contributions to national cause are valued over men's, which reinforces gender stereotypes. Secondly, measures of national pride and success are often biased towards the glorification of female attributes such as the ability to bear children. This perpetuates the idea that women are more capable than men in certain areas, such as child-rearing and caregiving. Lastly, the portrayal of masculinity as being associated with domesticity, nurturing, care, and child rearing reinforces traditional gender roles and norms, which may lead to conflicts between different genders when trying to achieve a common goal or identity."
