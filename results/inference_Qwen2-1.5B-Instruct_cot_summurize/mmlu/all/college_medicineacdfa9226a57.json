This occurs because the nerve signal triggers a series of events in the muscle cell, including the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the contraction of myofilaments to shorten the muscle fiber. When the nerve signal is no longer present, these processes cease, and the muscle fibers return to their relaxed state."
