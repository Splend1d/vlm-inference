This is typically defined by a context-free grammar, as it involves specifying the order in which operators should be evaluated based on their position within an expression.\n\nIdentifier length and maximum level of nesting are related to syntax rules that define how identifiers (names) can be used in a program, while type compatibility is related to the way in which different types of data are represented in memory or storage. These characteristics are typically specified using regular grammars rather than context-free grammars."
