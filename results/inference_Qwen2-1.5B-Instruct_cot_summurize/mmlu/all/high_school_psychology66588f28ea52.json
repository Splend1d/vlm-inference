Ethical guidelines for research involving human participants require that any risks to the participant's safety or well-being must be minimized and that informed consent is obtained from the participant before any research is conducted. In this case, conditioning a baby to fear a rat and other small animals would involve exposing the baby to the fear response of the rat, which could cause harm if not done properly. Therefore, it is unethical to conduct such a study without obtaining informed consent from the parents and ensuring that there are minimal risks involved."
