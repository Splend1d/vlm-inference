The government named the investigating FBI agent as its designated representative. Upon learning that the agent would be giving testimony during the trial, the defendant moved that the agent also be excluded from the courtroom. Should the defendant\u00d5s motion be granted?\n\nA. No, provided that the government can show that the agent\u00d5s presence is essential to the presentation of its case.\nB. No, because the government has a right to have its designated representative remain in the courtroom through-out the trial.\nC. Yes, because the agent\u00d5s testimony might be influenced by the testimony of other witnesses.\nD. Yes, because the defendant has a right to exclude all persons who may be called as government witnesses.\n"

No, provided that the government can show that the agent\u00d5s presence is essential to the presentation of its case.\n\nThe defendant's motion should not be granted if the government can prove that the agent's presence is necessary to effectively present its case. In this situation, it is likely that the government will argue that the agent's testimony is crucial for establishing the defendant's guilt or innocence, particularly given the nature of the charges (mail fraud). Without this evidence, excluding the agent would undermine the integrity of the trial process and potentially prejudice the jury. Therefore, granting the defendant's motion would violate due process rights and the principle of judicial independence."
