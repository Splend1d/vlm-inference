The original air-dried spinal cord of infected rabbits was a killed vaccine.\n\nThe rabies vaccine was developed by Louis Pasteur in the late 19th century and it is still used today. It consists of a weakened form of the virus that causes rabies, which can be injected into humans to prevent infection. The vaccine is typically administered as a series of injections over several weeks or months, depending on the individual's age and health status. The most common route of administration is through the intramuscular (into the muscle) or subcutaneous (under the skin) routes. The vaccine is considered safe and effective for preventing rabies, but it does have some side effects such as pain at the injection site, fever, and soreness or redness around the injection site."
