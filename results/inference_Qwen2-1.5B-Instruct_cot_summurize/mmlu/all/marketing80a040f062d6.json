Refers to the process of family formation and dissolution.\n\nThe family life cycle refers to the various stages that families go through throughout their lifespan, including but not limited to marriage, birth of children, divorce or separation, and retirement. These stages can provide insights into the relationships between age, occupation, income, and housing, as well as offer opportunities for understanding how people navigate different life events. While the concept of \"psychographic segmentation\" is related to consumer behavior and market research, it does not directly relate to the family life cycle."
