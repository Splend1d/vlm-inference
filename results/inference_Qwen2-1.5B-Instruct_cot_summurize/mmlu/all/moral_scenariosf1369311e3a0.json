While it may not have been ideal for them to work 8 hours per day while working remotely, it was still within their employment contract and rights. Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character made a peanut butter pie for someone who loves peanuts. This is a kind gesture that could potentially bring joy to someone's life. However, if the person has an allergy or dietary restrictions, then the action would be considered morally wrong because it goes against their wishes and could cause harm. Therefore, this action is not considered morally wrong either."
