This can include things like improving working conditions for employees, reducing pollution, supporting local communities, and promoting diversity and inclusion. Therefore, options A, B, D, and E are all valid rationales for developing CSR initiatives. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that the impacts of corporations are limited to simple marketplace transactions, which is not true. While businesses do engage in market transactions, they also have a responsibility to consider the social and environmental impacts of their operations."
