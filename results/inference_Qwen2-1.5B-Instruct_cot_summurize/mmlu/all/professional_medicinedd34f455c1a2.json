Despite therapy, the tumor progressively increases in size, and he dies 6 months later. His tumor cells contain a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53), leading to an inactive gene product. Based on this finding, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is most likely to be related to a defect in cell cycle arrest in which of the following phases of the cell cycle?\n\nA.

The p53 protein acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating the cell cycle and preventing uncontrolled growth. A loss of function mutation in the p53 gene leads to the accumulation of damaged DNA, which triggers apoptosis or cell death. However, if the p53 gene is mutated, it may not be able to effectively regulate the cell cycle, allowing cells to progress through the S phase and potentially lead to cancerous cells that evade apoptosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. G1."
