Selenium is incorporated into proteins through the process of selenation, where selenocysteine is added to the amino acid sequence of a protein. This results in the formation of seleno-XXX, where XXX represents any amino acid. In this case, the seleno-X is selenocysteine, and the X can be any amino acid except proline or methionine (which cannot contain a sulfur atom). Therefore, when a protein contains selenocysteine, it indicates that selenium has been incorporated into the protein via selenation."
