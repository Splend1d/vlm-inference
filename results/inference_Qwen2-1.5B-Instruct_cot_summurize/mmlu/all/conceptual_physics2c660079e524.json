In fission, an atomic nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. This process results in the creation of new atoms with fewer nucleons (protons and neutrons) than the original one.\n\nOn the other hand, fusion occurs when two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a significant amount of energy. Fusion typically involves hydrogen-3 nuclei combining to form deuterium (a heavier version of hydrogen), resulting in the formation of helium-4, which has three more nucleons than hydrogen-3.\n\nIn both cases, energy is released, but the mass of the system is not conserved. In fission, the mass of the original nucleus is reduced by half, but in fusion, the mass of the final product (helium-4) is greater than that of the reactants (hydrogen-3). Therefore, the total mass of the system is not conserved during these processes."
