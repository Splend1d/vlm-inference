The speed of light depends on the properties of the material through which it is traveling, such as its density and temperature. As the light travels from one medium to another with different properties, its speed may change. Similarly, the wavelength of light also changes as it refracts because the speed of light is dependent on the frequency or energy of the photon that makes up the wave.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: both speed and wavelength."
