Subsistence economies typically rely on barter systems or exchange goods and services directly rather than using money as a medium of exchange. The lack of a currency makes it difficult for these economies to engage in transactions, which can hinder their ability to invest in capital goods and technologies that could lead to economic growth. Additionally, a currency provides a standard measure of value and helps to facilitate trade and commerce within an economy."
