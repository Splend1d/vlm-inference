Thus,\n\nExpected Return = (1/3) * 7% + (1/3) * 5%\n\nNow calculate:\n\n= (1/3) * 0.07 + (1/3) * 0.15\n\n= 0.023 + 0.05\n\n= 0.073\n\nExpected return = 7.3%\n\nSo, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided. The closest option to 7.3% would be B. 8.50%. However, since the question asks for the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio, which means the total weight of the portfolio should add up to 1, it's clear that the actual answer cannot be 8.50%.\n\nThe closest answer that fits this criteria would be C. 6%. This is calculated by taking the sum of the expected returns of securities A and C divided by 2, as both are equally weighted.\n\nThus, the expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio composed of securities A and C is approximately 6%."
