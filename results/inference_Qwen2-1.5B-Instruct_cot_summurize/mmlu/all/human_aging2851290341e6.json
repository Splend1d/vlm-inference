Interpreting the answers you get from people.\n\nWhen designing an open-ended question, it's important to be clear about what you're asking and how you plan to interpret the responses. If you don't have a clear plan for interpreting the answers, it can be difficult to know whether or not the respondents have given meaningful or accurate responses.\n\nFor example, if you ask a respondent \"What do you think about our company's products?\", they may respond with a list of pros and cons that doesn't necessarily reflect their overall opinion of the product. Without a clear plan for interpretation, it's possible that the response will be interpreted as either positive or negative, rather than accurately reflecting the respondent's feelings towards the product.\n\nTo avoid this problem, it's important to carefully consider how you'll interpret the responses before asking the question. This might involve conducting research or consulting experts in the field before asking the open-ended question, or using other methods such as focus groups or surveys to gather more detailed information about the respondent's opinions. By doing so, you can increase the likelihood that the responses will be accurate and meaningful, which will help you to effectively analyze the data collected through the survey."
