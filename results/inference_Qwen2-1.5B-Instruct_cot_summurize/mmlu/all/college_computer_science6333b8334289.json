                    "text": "The question asks about the time complexity of computing the product of three matrices \\(N_1N_2N_3\\). The given conditions for each matrix imply that:\n\n- For \\(N_1\\) with \\(w\\) rows and \\(x\\) columns,\n- For \\(N_2\\) with \\(x\\) rows and \\(y\\) columns,\n- For \\(N_3\\) with \\(y\\) rows and \\(z\\) columns.\n\nWhen we perform \\((N_1N_2)N_3\\), the time taken can be expressed in terms of the sizes of the matrices involved. We need to find out when this operation takes less time compared to multiplying \\(N_1\\) directly followed by \\(N_2\\) and then \\(N_3\\).\n\nLet's analyze the time complexities of these operations:\n\n1. Computing \\(N_1N_2N_3\\):\n   - Time complexity = \\(wxy + wxz + wyz\\)\n   \n2. Computing \\(N_1(N_2N_3)\\):\n   - Time complexity = \\(wx(y + z) + wy(x + z) + wz(x + y)\\)\n\nWe want to compare the time complexities: \\(wxy + wxz + wyz\\) vs. \\(wx(y + z) + wy(x + z) + wz(x + y)\\).\n\nNotice that both expressions involve \\(wx\\), which represents the number of times the element at position \\((i,j)\\) of \\(N_1\\) is multiplied with an element from \\(N_2\\) or \\(N_3\\). However, there is one additional term involving \\(wy\\) and \\(wz\\), which means the time complexity of \\(N_1(N_2N_3)\\) involves more multiplications than \\(N_1N_2N_3\\).\n\nTherefore, under certain conditions, multiplying \\(N_1N_2\\) first would indeed take less time than multiplying \\(N_1\\) directly followed by \\(N_2\\) and then \\(N_3\\), because the extra factor of \\(wy\\) and \\(wz\\) in \\(N_1(N_2N_3)\\) outweighs the benefit of \\(wx\\) from \\(N_1N_2N_3\\).\n\nLooking at the options provided, option D correctly states that the condition for \\(N_1N_2\\) taking less time than \\(N_1(N_2N_3)\\) is \\(1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z\\), assuming all variables are positive. This inequality holds true if the time taken by multiplying \\(N_1N_2\\) first is less than the time taken by multiplying \\(N_1\\) directly followed by \\(N_2\\) and then \\(N_3\\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z."
