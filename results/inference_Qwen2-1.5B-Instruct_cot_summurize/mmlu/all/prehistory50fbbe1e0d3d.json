For example, some Neandertal genes have been shown to contribute to the development of certain immune system disorders, while others may have contributed to physical traits like height or hair color.\n\nIt is also possible that some Neandertal genes may have been lost during the transition to modern humans, which could explain why we do not see many of them in our genomes today. However, this does not necessarily mean that all Neandertal genes were lost, only those that were no longer relevant for human survival.\n\nIn summary, the evidence from the modern human genome suggests that genes inherited from Neandertals can be either beneficial or harmful, and it is difficult to say whether any single gene was \"universal\" or \"beneficial\" for both Neandertals and modern humans. The complexity of human evolution means that there is likely to be more than one explanation for the presence or absence of Neandertal genes in our genomes."
