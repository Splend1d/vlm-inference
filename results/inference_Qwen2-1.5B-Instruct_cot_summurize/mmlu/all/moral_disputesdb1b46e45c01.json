The execution of innocent persons can be a serious and tragic consequence of the death penalty, but this does not necessarily mean that the death penalty is inherently flawed or ineffective in preventing crime.\nTherefore, the answer to the question is D (the execution of innocent persons) is not one of the potentially negative consequences of imposing the death penalty."
