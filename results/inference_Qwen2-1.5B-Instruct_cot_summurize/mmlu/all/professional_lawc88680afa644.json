The boss directly suggested that if the defendant did not go out on a date with him, she would be fired in one week. Every day during the remainder of the week, the boss approached the defendant with his demand, and the defendant refused to cooperate. At the end of the week, when the boss called the defendant into his office and again tried to pressure her to go out on a date with him, the defendant knocked him unconscious with a giant stapler and choked him to death. The defendant is tried for murder. In accordance with the following statute, the state relies at trial on the presumption of malice:\"When the act of killing another is proved, malice aforethought shall be presumed, and the burden shall rest upon the party who committed the killing to show that malice did not exist. \"If the defendant is convicted of first-degree murder and challenges her conviction on the grounds of the above statute, on appeal she will\n\nA. win, because the statute is unconstitutional.\nB. win, because the statute violates due process.\nC. lose, because she failed to overcome the presumption.\nD. lose, because the presumption may be rebutted.\n"

However, this presumption must be overcome by the defendant to prove that there was no intent to kill. If the defendant can successfully demonstrate that she acted in self-defense or in defense of others, for example, she could potentially overturn the presumption of malice and avoid being found guilty of murder.\n\nIn the case of the defendant in question, it seems that she engaged in a violent act (knocking the boss unconscious with a giant stapler) that was clearly intended to cause harm. While the statutory presumption of malice may have been established initially, it ultimately fell apart as the defendant successfully defended herself against the boss's demands. Therefore, the defendant would likely be able to overturn the presumption of malice and avoid a conviction for murder.\n\nIt's important to note that the application of this presumption depends on the specific facts of each case, so the outcome may vary depending on the circumstances of the situation."
