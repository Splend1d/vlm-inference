Yes, because of the rule in Shelly's case.\nB. No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.\nC. Yes, because the will is invalidated by the rule of sequential appointments, and the grandchild does not take at all.\nD. No, because the will as written violates the rule against perpetuities, and reconstructed, the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs.v\n"

No, because the will as written violates the rule against perpetuities, and reconstructed, the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs.\n\nThe rule against perpetuities prohibits the creation of trusts that have terms that would cause the property to revert to the grantor or his/her heirs within a fixed period of time. In this case, the trust creates an interest in the property for the grandchild's life and then to the children specified in the will. This violates the rule against perpetuities because it would cause the property to revert to the original owner or her heirs within 20 years (the term of the trust).\n\nTherefore, if the grandchild dies before reaching the age of majority, the property will revert to the original owner or her heirs. The creditors cannot attach the property to satisfy debts since they do not have a legal right to do so under the law of perpetuities."
