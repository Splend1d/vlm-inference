Financial accounting, Social accounting.\n\nSocial accounting is a type of financial accounting that focuses on issues related to social responsibility and sustainability, including environmental protection, corporate governance, and ethical business practices. It differs from traditional financial accounting in its emphasis on reporting on social impacts and outcomes rather than solely on financial performance metrics. On the other hand, financial accounting refers to the process of recording and analyzing financial transactions for the purpose of preparing financial statements. Annual reports or publications can be considered as part of either category depending on their content and scope."
