This would lead to a decrease in demand for those imports, including U.S. exports to Japan. As a result, there would be a decrease in the value of the dollar relative to the yen (USD/JPY), as well as a decrease in the quantity demanded of the dollar itself (i.e., an increase in its price).\n\nThis scenario illustrates how changes in domestic economic conditions can impact international trade flows and exchange rates."
