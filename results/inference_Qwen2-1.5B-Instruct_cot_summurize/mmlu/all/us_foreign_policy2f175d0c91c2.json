It implies that governments may engage in conflict to advance certain policies or interests, rather than simply seeking revenge or territorial expansion. This perspective is consistent with the idea that diplomacy and negotiation are more effective ways of resolving disputes between nations, and that military force should be reserved for situations where all other options have failed."
