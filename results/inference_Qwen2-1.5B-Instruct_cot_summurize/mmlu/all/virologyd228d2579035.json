Aerosols of urine from infected small mammals\n\nAvian and rodent reservoirs are responsible for the transmission of many avian influenza viruses, including H5N1, which is transmitted to humans through the consumption of poultry products contaminated with bird flu virus.\n\nIn contrast, canarypox virus and rabies virus are typically transmitted by direct contact between humans or other animals and infected animals. Canine distemper virus is primarily spread through contact with infected animals, such as dogs, while measles virus is usually transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission of most human pathogens occurs via direct contact (e.g., blood transfusion), sexual contact, or airborne droplets (e.g., tuberculosis). However, in some cases, such as with HIV, it can also occur via vertical transmission during pregnancy or childbirth.\n\nRegarding avarenaviruses, they are not typically transmitted directly between individuals; instead, they are transmitted by exposure to infected wildlife or their carcasses, especially in areas where wildlife populations are high, such as forests and grasslands. This route involves inhalation or ingestion of aerosolized particles containing the virus, leading to infection.\n  \nIt's important to note that this information is general and specific details regarding the spread of avarenaviruses should be confirmed by consulting medical professionals."
