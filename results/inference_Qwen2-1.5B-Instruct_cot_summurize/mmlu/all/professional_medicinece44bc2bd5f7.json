In this case, by informing the patient's wife, the physician aims to prevent potential harm to her from the patient's condition, such as transmission of the virus to their children or other family members. This approach aligns with the physician's duty to act in the patient's best interest, even if it goes against the patient's autonomy to keep the information confidential. Autonomy is important, but in this context, it is overridden by the greater good of protecting the patient's loved ones from harm."
