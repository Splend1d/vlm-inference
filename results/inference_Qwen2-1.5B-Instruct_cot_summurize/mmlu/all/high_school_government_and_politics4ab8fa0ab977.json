                    "text": "The correct answer is B. A congressional committee prevents the full chamber from voting on legislation by delaying its report. This is because the Elastic Clause in Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power \"to determine the Rules for their own Transtion.\" This means that Congress has the authority to set rules and procedures for its own business, including determining whether or not to bring legislation to the floor for a vote. If a committee decides to delay the consideration of a bill until after the end of the current session of Congress, it would be violating this constitutional provision."
