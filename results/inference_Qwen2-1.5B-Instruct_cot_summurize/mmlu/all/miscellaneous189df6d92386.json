Collecting rainwater in a rain gauge and comparing the amount of rainfall to a plant's growth rate is an effective way to introduce kindergartners to the concept of how plants transport water. This activity allows children to see the relationship between rainfall and plant growth firsthand, which can help them understand the importance of water conservation and sustainability. The other options may also be effective, but this activity provides a concrete example of how water is transported through the roots of plants."
