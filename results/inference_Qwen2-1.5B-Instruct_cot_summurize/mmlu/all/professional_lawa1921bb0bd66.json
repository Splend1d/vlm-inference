Therefore, any contract entered into by Thornton without Kendall's consent would be considered void and unenforceable.\n\nIn this case, the fact that Thornton also entered into a long-term service contract with Clark without knowing about the internal agreement between Kendall and Thornton would not affect the enforceability of the contract. However, it would still be necessary for Clark to confirm Thornton's authority before entering into the contract with the partnership."
