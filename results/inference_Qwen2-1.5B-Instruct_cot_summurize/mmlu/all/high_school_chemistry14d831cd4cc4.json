The change in internal energy can be calculated using the first law of thermodynamics:\n\n\u0394E = q - w\n\nwhere \u0394E is the change in internal energy, q is the heat added to the system, and w is the work done by the system. Since we know that the gas does not do any work on itself (since it's expanding isothermally), the only non-zero term will be the heat transfer:\n\nq = \u0394E\n\nSubstituting this into the equation gives us:\n\n\u0394E = q - w\n\nSince the gas does not do any work, w = 0. Substituting this back into the equation gives us:\n\n\u0394E = q\n\nAnd since q is positive when heat is added (and negative when heat is removed), the change in internal energy is always equal to the heat transferred to the system. Therefore, q = -w, where w is the work done by the system (which is zero for isothermal expansion).\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: q = -w."
