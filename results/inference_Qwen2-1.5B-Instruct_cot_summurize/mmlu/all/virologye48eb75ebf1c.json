Papilloma viruses are known for their ability to replicate using a single-stranded RNA genome that is transcribed into double-stranded RNA through a process called RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This allows them to rapidly mutate and adapt to changing environments, which is why they can cause so many different types of diseases in animals and humans."
