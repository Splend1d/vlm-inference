Prior to beginning they read a list of Miranda rights to him on a form that the suspect had in front of him. After the reading, he initialed each paragraph indicating he understood. At the bottom of the form was an express written waiver of the Miranda rights, which he signed. He had been interrogated in the past and was familiar with the procedure. During the four hours of interrogation he was given bathroom breaks, coffee, and a sandwich. At the end of the process, he made a logical and seemingly cogent confession to all of the burglaries in a taped statement. The defendant later moved to suppress the confession, arguing that he was coming down from drugs at the time and was intellectually unable to understand and comprehend the nature of the warnings or the waiver. What is the most likely decision of the court under the totality of the circumstances?\n\nA. The outward signs all indicate that the suspect understood the procedure and gave a voluntary confession despite his disabilities.\nB. There are too many questionable deficiencies in the suspect's ability to understand what was going on and the confession must be suppressed.\nC. He was too confused to understand what was going on and the confession was coerced by the persistence of the police.\nD. The signing of a written waiver of Miranda rights is always proof that the suspect gave a voluntary confession.\n"

While the suspect may have had intellectual disabilities, such as attention deficit disorder and dyslexia, and may not have been familiar with the procedures involved in questioning someone suspected of committing a crime, the fact that he signed a written waiver of his rights indicates that he understood the implications of his actions and voluntarily chose to speak to the police. Additionally, the fact that the suspect was given bathroom breaks, coffee, and a sandwich during the four-hour interrogation suggests that the police were attempting to make the interrogation more comfortable for the suspect, rather than coercing him into making a confession. Therefore, the most likely decision of the court would be A: The outward signs all indicate that the suspect understood the procedure and gave a voluntary confession despite his disabilities."
