The UK Constitution is not codified, meaning it is not written down in a single document or statute. Instead, it is made up of various laws, treaties, and other legal documents that have been passed by Parliament over time. These include the Magna Carta, which was signed in 1215 and established some basic principles of government, and the Bill of Rights, which was enacted in 1689 to limit the powers of the monarchy and Parliament. Other key parts of the UK Constitution include the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Supreme Court, all of which play important roles in interpreting and enforcing the law."
