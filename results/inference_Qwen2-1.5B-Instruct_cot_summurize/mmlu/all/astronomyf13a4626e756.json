To measure galactic distances.\n\nCepheid stars, also known as Cepheids or Cephs, are a type of variable star that undergoes regular changes in brightness due to their pulsations. These stars have been used by astronomers for centuries to determine the distance to nearby galaxies and clusters of galaxies. By measuring the luminosity of these stars at different wavelengths, astronomers can calculate the distance to the galaxy based on the redshift of light from those stars. This method is particularly useful for determining the distances to distant galaxies, which cannot be directly observed because they are too far away to be detected with visible light."
