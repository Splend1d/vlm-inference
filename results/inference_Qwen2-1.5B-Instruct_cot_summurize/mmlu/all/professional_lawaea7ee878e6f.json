The widgets had to have the buyer's logo imprinted on them. The manufacturer ordered the raw material and made a new widget mold that contained buyer's logo. The buyer wanted quick delivery of at least 10,000 right away. The manufacturer rushed the order and sent 10,000 conforming widgets two days later. The buyer paid for the widgets but rejected delivery on the remaining 90,000 widgets. The manufacturer filed suit and claimed damages for breach of contract. Defendant buyer filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the statute of frauds was violated in that it was a contract for over $500 that was unenforceable under state law. Will the court likely grant the motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, the statute of frauds must be enforced when it involves goods over $500.\nB. Yes, the manufacturer did not protect its interests by agreeing to an oral contract and it must pay for its bad business practices.\nC. No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\nD. No, the law will enforce the \"benefit of the bargain\" rule.\n"

No, because there is an exception for goods that are specially made for a buyer.\n\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), an oral contract for the sale of goods over $500 is void if the seller does not enter into an express writing within one year after the making or offering of the goods. However, the UCC also provides an exception for contracts for the sale of goods that are specially made for a particular buyer. In such cases, the buyer may still be bound by the oral agreement even though no written contract exists.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer agreed to make 100,000 widgets for $1,000,000, which falls within the UCC's coverage of goods over $500. Therefore, the statute of frauds would not apply, and the court is unlikely to grant the defendant's motion to dismiss based on the violation of the statute of frauds. Instead, the court may find that the oral agreement between the parties is valid and enforceable as a contract for the sale of goods specially made for a buyer."
