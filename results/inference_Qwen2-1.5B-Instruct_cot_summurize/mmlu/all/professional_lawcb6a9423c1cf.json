In an inseverable portion of that same law, the entire proceeds of the tax are appropriated on a continuing basis for direct payments to an education fund. The education fund is dedicated to educating people about the importance of mass transportation as an alternative to automobiles, which the fund considers a major source of pollution. As a matter of constitutional law, which of the following statements concerning the continuing federal appropriation to the education fund is most accurate?\n\nA. It is constitutional because Congress could reasonably believe that such a subsidy to this particular museum will benefit the cultural life of the nation as a whole.\nB. It is constitutional because Congress can demonstrate that such a subsidy is rationally related to a legitimate public interest.\nC. It is unconstitutional because it is not apportioned among the several states on an equitable basis.\nD. It is unconstitutional because it advances the welfare only of thosepersons who are interested in cleanair.\n"

                    "text": "The correct answer is B: it is constitutional because Congress can demonstrate that such a subsidy is rationally related to a legitimate public interest.\n\nUnder the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States. This clause gives Congress broad authority over economic matters, including taxation and regulation of interstate commerce. In this case, the act imposes a tax on the sale of automobiles, which is considered a major source of pollution. The funds raised from this tax would be used to educate people about the importance of mass transportation as an alternative to automobiles, which the fund considers a major source of pollution. \n\nIt is possible that the funding of this educational program may have some impact on the national economy or culture, but it does not necessarily follow that the funding is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. Instead, it must be shown that the funding is rationally related to a legitimate public interest, such as promoting cleaner air or reducing pollution. If Congress demonstrates that the funding is necessary to achieve these goals, then the funding may be deemed constitutional under the Commerce Clause.\n\nTherefore, option B is the most accurate statement regarding the constitutionality of the continuing federal appropriation to the education fund."
