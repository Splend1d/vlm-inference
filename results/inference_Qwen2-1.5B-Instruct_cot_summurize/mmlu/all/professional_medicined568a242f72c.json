On morning rounds you note that the delivery records report that she had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and sustained an estimated third-stage blood loss of 500 mL. Today blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg, she is afebrile, and deep tendon reflexes are normal. The uterine fundus is firm and at the level of the umbilicus, and her perineum is slightly edematous. Hematocrit is 33%. She is cuddling her infant and normal bonding seems to be occurring. Which of the following is the most important next step in management?\n\nA. Begin oral methyldopa\nB.

This includes teaching the parents about proper feeding practices, how to monitor their child's weight gain, and when to seek medical attention if there are any concerns. Additionally, it may be beneficial to schedule regular check-ups with their pediatrician to ensure the child is developing normally and to address any potential health issues that may arise. It is also important to continue monitoring the mother's blood pressure and ensure that she receives appropriate treatment for any complications that may arise."
