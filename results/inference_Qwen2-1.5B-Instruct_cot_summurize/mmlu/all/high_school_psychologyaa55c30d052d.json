The medical model of psychologically disordered behavior focuses on biological and chemical factors such as depression, anxiety disorders, and neurotransmitters, while neglecting the role of social circumstances in shaping psychological behavior. This approach may not fully account for the complex interplay between genetic predispositions, environmental factors, and personal experiences that contribute to the development of mental health issues. Therefore, it is more likely to be criticized for overlooking these important aspects."
