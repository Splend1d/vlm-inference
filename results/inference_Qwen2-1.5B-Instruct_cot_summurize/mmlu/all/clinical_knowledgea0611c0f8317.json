The activity of CK can be influenced by various factors such as intracellular ADP levels, muscle pH, and exercise intensity. Therefore, options A, B, and D are correct. However, it's important to note that CK activity can also be affected by other factors such as diet and genetic variations, so option C may not apply universally."
