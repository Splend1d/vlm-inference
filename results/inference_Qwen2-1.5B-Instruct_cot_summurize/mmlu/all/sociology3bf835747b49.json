This image was often associated with the punk movement, which emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a reaction against mainstream society's conformity and superficiality.\n\nIt is important to note that this characterization is not universally true for all individuals who identify as men in the 1980s or beyond, nor is it accurate for all men today. However, it can serve as a useful starting point for understanding how gender roles and expectations have evolved over time."
