Let's plug in the values from the options into this formula:\n\n- A. If Eli is 1 month old:\n\\[ \\text{Age} = \\frac{60}{70} - 5 = \\frac{6}{7} - 5 = 0.857 - 5 = -4.143 \\]\nSince ages cannot be negative, Eli cannot be 1 month.\n\n- B. If Eli is 3 months old:\n\\[ \\text{Age} = \\frac{60}{70} - 5 = \\frac{6}{7} - 5 = 0.857 - 5 = -4.143 \\]\nAgain, since ages cannot be negative, Eli cannot be 3 months.\n\n- C. If Eli is 6 months old:\n\\[ \\text{Age} = \\frac{60}{70} - 5 = \\frac{6}{7} - 5 = 0.857 - 5 = -4.143 \\]\nThis matches our previous result, confirming that Eli cannot be 6 months.\n\n- D. If Eli is 9 months old:\n\\[ \\text{Age} = \\frac{60}{70} - 5 = \\frac{6}{7} - 5 = 0.857 - 5 = -4.143 \\]\nThis also matches our previous result, confirming that Eli cannot be 9 months.\n\nThus, based on the provided information, there seems to be no clear answer among the given options. It might be best to look for additional context or clarification regarding Eli's development. Given the available data, the most reasonable interpretation would be that Eli could be anywhere between 1 month and 9 months old, as none of the provided answers directly match any possible age range."
