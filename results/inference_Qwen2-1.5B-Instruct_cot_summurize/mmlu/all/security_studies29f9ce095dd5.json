Investigations into the consequences of state security policies showed that women were subject to masculine dominated war policies as the likely victims as casualties of war or as post conflict targets. Women are increasingly subject to violence as a product of social circumstance.\nB. Gendered consequences of security issues have not challenged international relations theory. Constructivist theories of the state were mainstreamed without undermining the ideas of state as the centre of military power, or as the highest organization of human community.\nC. Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles.\nD. The literature that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s was primarily concerned with the ways in which women had served the purposes of nationalist campaigns, focusing on the biological characteristics of women as sexually reproductive beings, and with little focus on critical analysis.\n"

Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles.\n\nThis is true because feminist and critical security studies have highlighted how gender norms and stereotypes play a significant role in shaping both men's and women's experiences in war. For example, they have shown how traditional gender roles, such as militarization, sexualization, and objectification, contribute to the marginalization and oppression of women in conflicts. This has led to a deeper understanding of how gender intersects with other forms of inequality, such as race, class, and sexuality, and how these intersect to create complex dynamics within societies.\n\nMoreover, feminist and critical security scholars have also emphasized the importance of addressing the psychological and emotional impacts of war on both men and women, including trauma, PTSD, and the impact of war on mental health. They have argued for a more holistic approach to security that takes into account the psychological well-being of individuals and communities.\n\nOverall, feminist and critical security studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of gender security issues by providing a critical perspective that challenges dominant narratives and explores the complex interplay between gender, power, and conflict."
