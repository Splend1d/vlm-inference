The contract signed by the parties required the senior citizen to be at the crosswalk every weekday afternoon from 2 pm to 4 pm, and to escort children leaving the school across the street. The senior citizen was to be paid $250 per week for his efforts. The contract also stressed the importance of the safety of the children, and stated that if the senior citizen should fail to show up for work without giving notice in advance so a substitute can be located, the senior citizen would be subject to a $200 per incident penalty. The contract provision making the senior citizen liable for a $200 per incident penalty may best be described as a (an)\n\nA. liquidated damage clause.\nB. unliquidated damage clause.\nC. penalty and forfeiture clause.\nD. aleatory clause.\n"

An unliquidated damage clause does not specify an amount and is instead based on the discretion of the court or arbitrator.\n\nA penalty and forfeiture clause, like the one mentioned in the question, specifies a monetary amount that the party receiving payment must pay if they breach the contract, with the possibility of additional penalties being imposed if they do not pay within a certain time frame. In this case, the senior citizen could potentially face a $200 per incident penalty if they failed to show up for work without giving notice in advance. This means that the penalty and forfeiture clause is both a penalty and a forfeiture, as it is intended to punish the\u8fdd\u7ea6\u8005 and ensure compliance with the contract terms."
