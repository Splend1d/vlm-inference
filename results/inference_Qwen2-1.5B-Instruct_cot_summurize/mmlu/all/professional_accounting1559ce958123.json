The production budget shows that 30% of the next quarter's budgeted sales will be used as inventory at the beginning of the quarter. Therefore, 70% of the next quarter's budgeted sales will be used as actual production in that quarter.\n\nLet's denote the number of units to be produced in the first quarter as \\(X\\). According to the problem:\n\n\\[0.7 \\times X = 30\\%\\times \\text{Quarter} \\times \\text{First} + 9000\\]\n\nSince the production starts in the first quarter and ends in the second quarter, the total units produced from the first to the fourth quarters would be \\(X + (X+3000) + (X+6000) + (X+9000)\\).\n\nGiven this, we have:\n\n\\[0.7 \\times X = 0.3 \\times X + 9000\\]\n\nSolving for \\(X\\):\n\n\\[0.7 \\times X - 0.3 \\times X = 9000\\]\n\\[0.4 \\times X = 9000\\]\n\\[X = \\frac{9000}{0.4}\\]\n\\[X = 22500\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount the production budget should show for units to be produced during the first quarter is $22,500.\n\nThe correct answer is **(D) 12000**."
