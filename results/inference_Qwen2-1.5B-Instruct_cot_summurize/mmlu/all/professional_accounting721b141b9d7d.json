During the month of April 10000 units were started and 9000 completed units were transferred. The ending work-in-process inventory was complete as to materials and 50% complete as to conversion. The cost of direct materials was $114000 and the cost of direct labor amounted to $38000. Manufacturing overhead is assigned at the rate of 50% of direct materials. For the purpose of determining the cost of goods manufactured in April what is the cost per equivalent whole unit?\n\nA. $23.22\nB. $21.40\nC. $20.90\nD. 15.4\n"
