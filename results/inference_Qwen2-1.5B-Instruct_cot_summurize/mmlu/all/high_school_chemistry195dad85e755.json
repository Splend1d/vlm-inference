This means that the total volume of the solution after mixing remains constant at 50.0 mL regardless of the initial concentrations or volumes.\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting solution would remain unchanged from the original pH of 0.0025 M HBr and 0.0023 M KOH, which is approximately 1. \n\nThus, the correct answer is **A. 1**."
