According to Socrates, attempting to break out of prison would be just if it was done in accordance with justice and morality, without any ulterior motives or personal gain. Breaking out of prison would not be justified if it was done for revenge or self-interest, even if it was considered advantageous by one's enemies or friends. Therefore, the decision to attempt to break out of prison would need to be based on whether it was justifiable according to moral principles."
