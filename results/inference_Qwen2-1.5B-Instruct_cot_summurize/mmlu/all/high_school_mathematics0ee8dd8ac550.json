This means we need to consider two cases: exactly one girl and exactly two girls. \n\nCase 1: Exactly one girl.\nIn this case, we have $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways to choose which one will be a girl, and then there are $2^4=16$ ways to assign boys to the remaining four children. So there are $5 \\cdot 16 = 80$ outcomes in this case.\n\nCase 2: Exactly two girls.\nIn this case, we first choose which two out of the five children will be girls in $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways. Then, we assign boys to the remaining three children in $2^3=8$ ways. So there are $\\binom{5}{2} \\cdot 8 = 40$ outcomes in this case.\n\nTherefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is $80 + 40 = 120$.\n\nSo the probability that at least half of them are girls is $\\frac{120}{32} = \\frac{15}{4}$. However, this fraction cannot be simplified further because both numerator and denominator are divisible by 4.\n\nThe correct answer is B. \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)."
