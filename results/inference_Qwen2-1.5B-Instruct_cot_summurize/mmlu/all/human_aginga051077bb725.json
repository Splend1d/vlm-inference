Receive more opportunities than older workers.\n\nJob training programs for younger workers often offer more flexibility and personalized attention than those designed for older workers who may already be well-versed in certain skills or have extensive work experience. Additionally, younger workers tend to have higher motivation levels and are generally more eager to learn new skills and adapt to changing job requirements. Therefore, they may receive more opportunities for job training compared to older workers. However, it's important to note that there can be exceptions to this rule depending on the specific situation and industry."
