The electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the charge.\n\nThis is because the electric field due to a point charge at a given position is proportional to the inverse square of the distance from that point charge. However, when considering an infinite plane of charge, it can be approximated as if all charges were concentrated at one point in space (the center of the plane), which means the electric field will decrease as the inverse square of the distance from this central point rather than the inverse square of the distance from each individual charge.\n\nThe other options:\n\n- A. The electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod does not depend on the distance from the source.\n- B. The electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder also depends on the distance from the source, but the dependence is linear and not inversely proportional.\n- D. The magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire is directly proportional to the distance from the wire, so it increases with distance."
