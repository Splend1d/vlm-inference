All of the above.\n\nDeadweight loss occurs in all types of market structures, including monopolistic competition and oligopoly markets where price (P) exceeds marginal cost (MC). In these markets, firms may engage in anti-competitive behavior to maximize profits at the expense of consumers, leading to lower overall economic welfare. The excess profit generated by firms can be captured by government regulations or taxes that redistribute wealth more evenly across society."
