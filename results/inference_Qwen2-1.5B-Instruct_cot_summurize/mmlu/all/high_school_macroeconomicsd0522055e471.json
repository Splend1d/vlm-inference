Supply and demand determine the price of goods and services as they reflect the quantity of each good that people are willing to buy at different prices. This system has been successful in promoting economic growth and innovation by allowing individuals and businesses to make choices based on their own interests and preferences. While there may be issues with inequality or concentration of wealth, these are not inherent characteristics of capitalism itself but rather consequences of specific market structures and policies."
