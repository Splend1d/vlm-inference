This is because the ice crystals have a higher specific gravity (the ratio of their weight to that of water at the same temperature) than water does. As a result, when the ice crystals form and settle out of the liquid, they leave behind a denser layer of liquid above them. This can create a \"slush\" or frothy texture in the liquid, which is why you might describe it as having \"microscopic slush.\"\n\nIt's important to note that while this effect may make the water appear thicker or more viscous, it does not necessarily affect its overall density. In fact, the increased viscosity may actually help to keep the water from freezing too quickly, since the ice crystals will take longer to form and melt. However, the exact effects of microscopic ice crystals on water density depend on various factors such as the size and shape of the ice crystals, the ambient temperature, and other environmental conditions."
