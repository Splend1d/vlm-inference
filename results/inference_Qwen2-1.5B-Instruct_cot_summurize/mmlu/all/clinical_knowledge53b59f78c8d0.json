Bladder infection (urinary tract infection or UTI)\n2. Urethral blockage (such as prostate enlargement or other conditions affecting the urethra)\n3. Bladder stones (renal calculi)\n4. Inflammation of the bladder wall (bladder inflammation or prostatitis)\n\nDrinking alcohol in large amounts can lead to dehydration and may exacerbate existing conditions that contribute to urinary retention. However, it is not the most likely cause for acute urinary retention."
