If you are subpoenaed to testify about a former client's information, it is important that you follow the rules of evidence and the law regarding confidentiality and privilege. It is not appropriate or ethical to provide confidential information without a court order, as this could be considered contempt of court. Additionally, providing confidential information may also violate the client's rights and create a conflict of interest. Therefore, it is best to decline to provide the information until there is a court order or other legal authority to do so."
