Post-structuralism challenges the notion that power is fixed or inherent, but rather emerges from social relations and practices. It also questions the idea that security is solely about military defense, as it acknowledges the importance of non-military forms of protection such as law enforcement and social stability.\n\nTherefore, all of the options you provided (A, B, and D) are correct. A post-structuralist critique enables us to better understand the complex ways in which power is constructed and maintained, beyond just military means. It allows for a more nuanced understanding of how security policies and practices are shaped by societal structures and cultural norms."
