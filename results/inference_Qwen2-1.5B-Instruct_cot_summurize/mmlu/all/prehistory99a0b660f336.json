The Mousterian tool culture is also part of the Neanderthal evolutionary lineage, which diverged from Homo sapiens during the last glacial maximum approximately 40,000 years ago.\n\nThe correct answer would be D. Both B and C. This is because the development of tools by Homo sapiens can be traced back through several different tool cultures, including both Acheulean and Aurignacian techniques. However, for the question specifically asking about the tools technology that corresponds to AMH, it is more accurate to say \"both\" rather than just one or the other."
