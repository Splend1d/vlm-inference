Adler. \n\nPerls, Berne, Rogers, and Adler each have distinct philosophies about the nature of human psychology and the different stages of development in individuals' lives. However, the idea that there are three major life tasks - friendship, occupation, and love - is most closely associated with Adler's concept of \"the Three Tasks\" of human existence.\n\nAdler believed that humans are driven by a need for security, belonging, and personal growth, which he referred to as the \"Three Tasks.\" These tasks are seen as necessary for an individual to achieve a sense of purpose and fulfillment in their life.\n\nIn his theory, Adler argues that people are motivated to fulfill these tasks through various means, including work, relationships, and self-actualization. He suggests that fulfilling one or more of these tasks can lead to a sense of happiness and well-being, while failing to do so can result in feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction.\n\nTherefore, the notion that there are three major life tasks is most consistent with Adler's philosophy."
