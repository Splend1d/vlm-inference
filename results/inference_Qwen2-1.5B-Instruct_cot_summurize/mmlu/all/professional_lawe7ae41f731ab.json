One year later, the buyer cleared a path from her home across the seller's retained land to a road that abuts the western boundary of the seller's land. The seller stood by and watched the buyer clear the path, but made no objection. This path is very convenient to the buyer's use of her land, and the buyer used it daily for several months. The path is readily apparent to anyone. Recently, the seller put a barrier across the path. The buyer now has brought an action to have the barrier removed. The theory giving the buyer her best chance of success would be that\n\nA. the buyer has an easement by necessity. This would depend on the strength of the court's feeling about the use of the laid.\nB. the buyer has an easement by implication. This would depend on whether the convenience was sufficiently strong to amount to \"reasonably necessary. \"\nC. the buyer has an easement by prescription. This would depend on the length of time she used the path prior to the erection of the barrier.\nD. the buyer has an express easement.\n"

In this case, the buyer used the path on her land for several months before erecting the barrier, which establishes a prescriptive easement.\n\nOption A (easement by necessity) requires that the use of the property must be absolutely necessary for the purpose of the owner or user, whereas option B (easement by implication) requires that the use of the property be reasonably necessary for the purpose of the user. Neither of these options apply here because the use of the path was not absolutely necessary for the purpose of the owner or user.\n\nOption D (express easement) refers to an easement that is granted explicitly by the grantor. There is no evidence of an express easement being granted in this situation.\n\nTherefore, the buyer has an easement by prescription, which gives her the strongest right to keep the path intact."
