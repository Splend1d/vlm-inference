Following the acquittal, the victim's estate sued the defendant in a wrongful death action. During the civil trial, the victim's estate called a witness to testify. The witness, who worked with both men at the shipyard, testified that two weeks before the shooting, the victim came to work with a broken nose and said that the defendant had caused it. The attorney for the victim's estate then asked the witness the following question, \"Was the defendant present during your conversation with the victim, and if so, did he say anything about the victim's broken nose?\" The witness replied, \"Yes, the defendant was present, and after the victim told me that the defendant broke his nose, the defendant said, \u0080\u0098And that's only the beginning. \"Upon objection by the defendant's attorney, the witness's testimony is\n\nA. admissible, because it reports a declaration against interest.\nB. admissible, because it reports the defendant's adoptive admission of the victim's assertion.\nC. inadmissible, because of the principle of collateral estoppel.\nD. inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n"

Inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nHearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, certain types of statements are considered hearsay exceptions and can be admitted into evidence without the declarant being present or testifying. These exceptions include:\n\n1. Statements made under oath (e.g., police statements)\n2. Statements made during the course of legal proceedings (e.g., court records, depositions)\n3. Present sense impression (e.g., a person's testimony regarding their own thoughts or feelings at the time of the incident)\n4. Statement made by a party-opponent (e.g., a witness' testimony about what the other side would have said)\n5. A prior inconsistent statement (e.g., a previous version of a story)\n\nIn this case, the witness's testimony is not covered by any of these exceptions. Therefore, it cannot be admitted into evidence without violating the rule of hearsay.\n\nAdditionally, even if the witness's testimony were admissible, it would still not be relevant to the case. The reason given by the witness (\"And that's only the beginning\") does not provide any information about the circumstances surrounding the shooting or the motive behind it. It could potentially be used to impeach the witness's credibility, but it does not directly relate to the cause of the shooting itself. As such, it would not be relevant to the wrongful death claim."
