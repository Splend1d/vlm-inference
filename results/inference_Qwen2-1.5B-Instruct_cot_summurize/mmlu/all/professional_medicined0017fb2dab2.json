She is sexually active and does not use any contraception. Her last menstrual period ended 6 days ago. Temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101.0\u00b0F). Physical examination discloses abdominal tenderness in the lower quadrants bilaterally with rebound and guarding. Pelvic examination discloses leukorrhea at the cervical os and tenderness of the uterus to palpation. The adnexal areas are tender but no masses are palpable. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic study?\n\nA. Cervical culture\nB. Culdocentesis\nC. Laparoscopy\nD. Serum \u03b2-hCG concentration\n"

Cervical culture and serum \u03b2-hCG concentration are non-invasive tests that can be performed on the same day, but they do not provide direct information about the cause of the symptoms. Culdocentesis involves inserting a needle into the ear canal to measure the fluid level, which may be useful if the patient also has a history of ear infections."
