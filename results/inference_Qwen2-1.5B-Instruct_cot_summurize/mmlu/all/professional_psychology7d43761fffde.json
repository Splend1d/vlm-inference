This type of item tends to differentiate examinees by providing feedback that can be used to improve their performance in future assessments.\n\nOn the other hand, if an item has a difficulty level of 1.5 or higher, then it may be too difficult for some examinees and may not provide enough differentiation between high- and low-performing groups. A difficulty level of 0 may also lead to over-differentiation, as all examinees may have difficulty with the item.\n\nTherefore, option B is the best choice among the given options."
