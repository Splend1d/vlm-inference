This type of theory suggests that people have different drives or needs that they pursue, such as money or material possessions, which can motivate them to act in certain ways. In this case, the mother's actions may be seen as providing incentives for her son to perform well academically, which aligns with the concept of an incentive. Therefore, option D (incentive) would be the correct answer."
