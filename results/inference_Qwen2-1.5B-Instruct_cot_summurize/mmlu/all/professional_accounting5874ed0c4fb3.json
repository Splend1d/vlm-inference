The AQR partnership agreement specifies that each partner will share equally in the partnership\u2019s profits and losses. During its first year of operation, AQR sold the land to an unrelated third party for $160,000. What is the proper tax treatment of the sale?\n\nA. Each partner reports a capital gain of $33,333.\nB. The entire gain of $100,000 must be specifically allocated to Acre.\nC. The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by the other two partners.\nD. The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by all the partners in the partnership.\n"

The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by the other two partners.\n\nThis is because the partnership agreement specifies that each partner will share equally in the partnership's profits and losses. Therefore, when the land is sold, the gain from the sale should be shared equally among the partners. \n\nIn this case, Acre received 1/3 (or 1/3) of the $160,000 gain, which is $40,000. This means that the remaining $20,000 ($60,000 - $40,000) should be divided equally between the other two partners, who are not named in the question but can be assumed to be B and C."
