However, `W` cannot be true because it implies `U`, which contradicts our assumption that `T` and `U` are both true.\n\nNext, let's construct the truth table for the second proposition:\n```\n  T  U   X   T \u2283 ~X\nT  |  |  |  |\nF  F  F  T   F\nF  F  T  T   F\nF  T  F  T   F\nF  T  T  T   F\nT  F  F  T   F\nT  F  T  T   F\nT  T  F  T   T\nT  T  T  T   T\n```\n\nAgain, both `T` and `U` must be true in order for `(T \u2283 U)` to be true. But now, `X` cannot be true because it implies `T` and `U` are both true, contradicting our assumption that `T` and `U` are both true.\n\nMoving on to the third proposition, we have:\n```\n  T  U   W   T \u2283 ~X\nT  |  |  |  |\nF  F  F  T   F\nF  F  T  T   F\nF  T  F  T   F\nF  T  T  T   F\nT  F  F  T   F\nT  F  T  T   F\nT  T  F  T   T\nT  T  T  T   T\n```\n\nAs before, both `T` and `U` must be true in order for `(T \u2283 U)` to be true. And again, `W` cannot be true because it implies `U`, which contradicts our assumption that `T` and `U` are both true.\n\nThus, all three propositions are inconsistent, as they do not allow any consistent valuations where at least one of them is true. The correct answer is:\n\n**Inconsistent**\n\nThis means that there is no consistent valuation that satisfies all three propositions simultaneously."
