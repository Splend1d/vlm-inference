P(A \u2229 B) = 0 implies events A and B are mutually exclusive.\n\nThis means that if the probability of both events A and B occurring is zero, then they must be mutually exclusive (i.e., one event cannot occur without the other). This is because the intersection of two disjoint sets has probability zero, which is equivalent to saying that the union of those two sets also has probability zero."
