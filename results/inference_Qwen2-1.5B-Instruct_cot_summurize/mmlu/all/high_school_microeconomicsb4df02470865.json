Inexperienced, low-income, younger workers at the backward bending portion.\n\nThis refers to the part of the supply curve where firms hire less skilled and/or lower paid workers than they would if there were no barriers to entry. This is often referred to as \"backward bending\" because it is the region in the supply curve that lies below the perfectly competitive supply curve. It is characterized by an increase in the demand for labor as wages rise, but a decrease in the amount of labor supplied due to concerns about worker productivity and skills development."
