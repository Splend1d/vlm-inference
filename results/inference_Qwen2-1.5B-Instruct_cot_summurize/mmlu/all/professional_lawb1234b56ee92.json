Five years ago the man conveyed a right-of-way easement over his land to the woman because it provided a more direct route between her house and the highway. The easement was evidenced by a clearly marked path. The document granting the easement was promptly recorded. Three years ago, the woman conveyed her house to the man. The man never took actual possession of the house. Two years ago, the man conveyed the house to a purchaser by a warranty deed. Two months after the purchaser moved into the house, a neighbor informed him about the easement. He then began using the path that had been marked on the man's land. When the man noticed the purchaser using the path, he erected a barricade on his land that effectively prevented the purchaser from using the path. The purchaser has sued the man, claiming that he has an easement over the man's land. Who is likely to prevail?\n\nA. The man, because the easement was extinguished.\nB. The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.\nC. The purchaser, because he purchased the house by warranty deed.\nD. The purchaser, because the easement was of public record when he acquired the house.\n"

The man, because the purchaser did not have actual notice of the easement at the time of acquisition.\n\nWhen the man conveyed the house to the purchaser by warranty deed, the deed conveyed the property, but not any rights or interests that were attached to the property, such as an easement. Therefore, the purchaser does not have any legal interest in the easement, and cannot assert it against the man.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the easement was marked on the man's land and evidenced by a clear and visible path means that the man had notice of the easement before he conveyed the property to the purchaser. This means that the man can still assert the easement against the purchaser if they use the path without permission.\n\nTherefore, the man is likely to prevail in this case."
