According to John Scott, the managerial revolution has led to the separation of ownership and management, where the latter is no longer responsible for day-to-day operations but instead focuses on strategic planning and decision-making. The techniques of scientific management, which he criticized as overly bureaucratic and inefficient, have also been replaced by more flexible and individualistic approaches to management."
