The compiler or interpreter checks each line of the code to ensure it meets certain rules and syntax requirements. If any part of the code does not meet these requirements, the compiler or interpreter will issue an error message indicating where the problem occurs.\nFor example, in C++ programming language, the code is enforced using the C++ Standard Library, which defines various data types, control structures (such as if-else statements), and functions for performing operations on data. The compiler then uses this standard library to compile the code into executable code that can be run on a computer.\nIn other programming languages, such as Java, Python, or JavaScript, the code is enforced using the language's own compiler or interpreter. These compilers or interpreters use the language's own syntax and semantics to check the code for errors and generate machine-readable code that can be executed on the computer.\nOverall, the code is enforced by the compiler or interpreter to ensure that it meets the specified rules and syntax requirements. Any errors detected during compilation or execution are reported to the programmer so they can identify and fix them before the program runs."
