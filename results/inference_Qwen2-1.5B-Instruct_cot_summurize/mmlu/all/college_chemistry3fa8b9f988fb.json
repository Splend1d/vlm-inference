Therefore, the ratio of their equilibrium polarizations is simply the ratio of their currents divided by the permeability of free space.\n\nGiven that the permeability of free space is approximately 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 H/m, the ratio of the equilibrium polarizations would be:\n\n|Pe/PH| = 1/(4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7)\n|Pe/PH| = 8.961 \u00d7 10^16\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 329."
