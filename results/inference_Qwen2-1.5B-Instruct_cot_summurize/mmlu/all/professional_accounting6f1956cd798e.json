Impossibility of performance.\n\nImpossibility of performance is generally considered a circumstance that will cause a discharge of contractual duties by operation of law, as it means that one party cannot fulfill their obligations due to an unforeseeable event beyond their control. This can occur in various scenarios such as natural disasters, economic downturns, or other uncontrollable events that make performance impossible. Accord and satisfaction, novation, and anticipatory repudiation do not necessarily result in a discharge of contractual duties by operation of law, while they may be considered exceptions to the rule if they involve parties agreeing to modify or replace the original contract terms."
