It also violates the concept of justice, as it allows individuals to act in ways that benefit themselves at the expense of others. Additionally, it undermines the idea of individual freedom, as it suggests that one's beliefs and values are absolute and cannot be questioned or challenged.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C provide more nuanced approaches to moral decision-making, acknowledging the importance of considering the consequences of actions on both oneself and others. However, they still require some level of judgment and consideration, which can sometimes lead to difficult ethical choices."
