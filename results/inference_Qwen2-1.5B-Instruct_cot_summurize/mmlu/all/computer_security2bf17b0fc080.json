This means that the value of the variable is stored in the stack frame for as long as the function is executing. When the function returns or the program reaches the end of the file, the stack frame is destroyed and the memory occupied by the local variable is released.\nTherefore, the compiler does not need to know the absolute address of a local variable because it is automatically managed by the runtime environment."
