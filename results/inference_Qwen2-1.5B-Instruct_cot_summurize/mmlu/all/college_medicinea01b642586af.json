The percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle would be higher.\n\nThis is because the VSD allows blood from the right side of the heart (the right ventricle) to flow into the left side of the heart (the left atrium). As a result, more oxygenated blood flows through the VSD than the amount of deoxygenated blood that normally flows through it. This can lead to an increase in the concentration of oxygen in the right ventricle compared to the left atrium."
