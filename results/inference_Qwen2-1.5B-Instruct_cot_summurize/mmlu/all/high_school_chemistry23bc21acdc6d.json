                    "text": "To find the molar concentration of iodine vapor (I2) when 15 grams of HI gas is introduced into a 12.0-L flask and allowed to come to equilibrium, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the mass of HI from grams to moles.\n2. Calculate the amount of HI that dissociates completely in the given time frame.\n3. Calculate the number of moles of I2 produced by the reaction.\n4. Use the initial volume and the final volume to calculate the change in pressure due to the reaction.\n5. Use the equation PV = nRT to calculate the new volume of the gas mixture after the reaction has occurred.\n\nGiven values:\nMass of HI: 15 g\nInitial volume: 12.0 L\nEquilibrium constant: 21\n\nStep 1: Convert mass of HI to moles\nMass of HI = 15 g * (1 mole / 126.1 g) = 0.117 moles\n\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of HI that dissociates completely\nSince the equilibrium constant is less than 1, some HI remains unreacted. To find out how much of HI dissociates, we can use the following relation between the equilibrium constant and the stoichiometry of the reaction:\nK_eq = [HI]^2 / ([I_2] + [HI])\nwhere [HI]^2 represents the amount of HI that dissociated completely.\n\nWe know K_eq = 21 and [HI] = 0.117 moles, so:\n21 = [HI]^2 / ([I_2] + [HI]) \n=> [I_2] + [HI] = 21/0.117^2\n= 0.017476 moles\n\nSo, 0.017476 moles of HI dissociates completely.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of moles of I2 produced\nUsing the stoichiometry of the reaction (1 mole of HI -> 1 mole of I2), the number of moles of I2 produced is:\nn(I_2) = 0.017476 moles\n\nStep 4: Use the initial volume and the final volume to calculate the change in pressure\nP_i = P_f = P_initial + \u0394P\n\u0394P = nRT/V = (0.017476 moles * 0.08206 L*atm/mol*K * 298 K) / (12.0 L)\n= 0.00297 atm\n\nStep 5: Use the equation PV = nRT to calculate the new volume of the gas mixture after the reaction has occurred\nV_new = V_initial / (PV_initial/PF) = 12.0 L / (0.00297 atm * 12.0 L / 0.00297 atm)\n= 12.0 L / (0.00297 atm * 12.0 L)\n= 12.0 L / 0.003479 atm\n= 3419.9 L\n\nTherefore, the new volume of the gas mixture after the reaction has occurred is approximately 3420 L or 3.42 liters. \n\nNow, let's calculate the molar concentration of I2 using the formula n(I_2)/V_new:\nn(I_2) = 0.017476 moles\nV_new = 3.42 liters\n\nMolarity (M) = n/I_2 = 0.017476 moles / 3.42 liters \u2248 0.00499 M\n\nHowever, the answer choices provided do not match our calculated result. It seems there might have been an error in calculating the molar concentration based on the information provided in the question. Let me re-evaluate this step-by-step:\n\nUpon reviewing the calculations again, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the calculation of the change in pressure due to the reaction. The correct approach would be to use the ideal gas law (PV=nRT) instead of the equation PV=nRT, where R is the gas constant. Using the ideal gas law, the change in volume of the gas mixture should be directly proportional to the increase in pressure.\n\nLet's recalculate with the correct approach:\n\nStep 1: Convert mass of HI to moles\nMass of HI = 15 g * (1 mole / 126.1 g) = 0.117 moles\n\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of HI that dissociates completely\nUsing the same relation as before but now using the ideal gas law:\nPV = nRT\n(Pi + Pf)RT = n"
