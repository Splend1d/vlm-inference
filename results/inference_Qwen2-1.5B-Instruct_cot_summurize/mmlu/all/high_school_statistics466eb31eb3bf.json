In this case, we have two variables: the number of hours students studied for the first exam and the number of hours they studied for the second exam.\n\nGiven that the mean (average) number of hours students studied for the first exam was 4 hours, and the standard deviation was 1 hour, it means that most students studied somewhere around these values, but there might be some variation within the group. When they were asked to study more for the second exam, almost everyone followed suit by studying 10 hours each time.\n\nSince the standard deviation remains constant across both exams, the change from studying 4 hours to 10 hours does not affect the strength or direction of the relationship between the number of hours studied on each exam.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. 1**. The correlation between the numbers of hours students studied for each exam remains unchanged because the standard deviation remains constant."
