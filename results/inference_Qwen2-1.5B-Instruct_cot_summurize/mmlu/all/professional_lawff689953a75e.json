Similarly, option C (that the police lacked a search warrant) is unlikely to be relevant since the question focuses on whether the owner's defense would be successful based on the materials themselves rather than their acquisition method.\n\nOption D (that 85% of the citizens believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior) is also less likely to be helpful, as this statistic does not directly address the issue of whether the sale of the materials would be considered obscene under the state's obscenity statute."
