He says he has tried repeatedly to abstain from cocaine use but lives in a part of town where there are heavy drug sales. He did not like his hospital outpatient group but liked his single session at Cocaine Anonymous. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 125/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a thin man with good muscle strength and no focal neurologic deficits. The patient is using insurance coverage through his wife but does not wish for his diagnosis to be disclosed to anyone. He is on probation after a conviction for aggravated robbery 3 years ago. There is also a warrant for his arrest for assault and battery. After listening to his requests and weighing your obligations, you should disclose this patient's diagnosis only to which of the following?\n\nA. His Cocaine Anonymous sponsor\nB. His probation officer\nC. His wife\nD. Insurance company\n"
