Epictetus believed that a person's virtue was not diminished by the death of loved ones, as long as they continued to live virtuously. He taught that one should focus on living in accordance with reason and character rather than on emotional responses such as grief or anger. Therefore, it would be appropriate for an upright person to remain calm and composed when faced with the loss of loved ones."
