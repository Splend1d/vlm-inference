Under low power, there is less evidence against the null hypothesis, which means that it is more likely for a significant result to be due to random chance than a nonsignificant result to be due to random chance.\n\nTherefore, in terms of informativeness, statistical significance under low power indicates that the results are not very informative because they are more likely to be due to random chance than to reflect a real effect. On the other hand, statistical nonsignificance under low power suggests that the results may have some real effect but still be due to random chance. Therefore, statistical significance under low power is less informative than statistical nonsignificance under low power."
