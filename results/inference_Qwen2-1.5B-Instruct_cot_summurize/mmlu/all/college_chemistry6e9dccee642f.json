                    "text": "The hyperfine splitting in the EPR spectrum of a molecule is determined by the interaction between the nuclear magnetic moment of the nucleus and the external electromagnetic field. The hyperfine coupling constant, also known as the hyperfine splitting, is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta_{\\text{H}} = g_B B \\sin^2(\\theta) \\]\n\nwhere \\(g_B\\) is the gyromagnetic ratio of the central atom (in this case, carbon), \\(B\\) is the magnetic field strength, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the axis of the magnetization vector and the magnetic field, and \\(g_B\\) depends on the nuclear spin quantum number \\(I\\) of the central atom.\n\nFor benzene, with one unpaired electron per carbon atom, the gyromagnetic ratio is approximately \\(g_B = 9.14 \\times 10^{-26}\\) mT/Angstrom. Assuming the carbon atoms are all in their ground state (i.e., no hyperfine splitting due to their nuclear spin states), we can simplify the formula to:\n\n\\[ \\Delta_{\\text{H}} = 9.14 \\times 10^{-26} \\times B \\sin^2(\\theta) \\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the hyperfine value for a fully deuterated benzene radical anion C6D6\u2022-, which means that each carbon has two protons instead of one. In this case, the gyromagnetic ratio \\(g_B\\) would be twice as large, since there's only one proton per carbon atom:\n\n\\[ g_B = 2 \\times 9.14 \\times 10^{-26} = 1.828 \\times 10^{-26}\\] \n\nSince the question specifies the fully deuterated form of benzene, the angle \\(\\theta\\) should be zero because the carbon atoms have equal spins (both up or both down). However, without additional information about the exact geometry of the benzene ring and the orientation of the protons relative to the magnetic field, it's not possible to accurately calculate the hyperfine splitting. Therefore, based on the given information alone, the answer cannot be determined."
