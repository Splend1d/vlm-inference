Divide nominal GDP by the GDP deflator.\n\nWhen deflating nominal GDP, it means adjusting for inflation so that the value of the GDP reflects its true purchasing power in today's terms. This is typically done by using an appropriate GDP deflator, which measures the relationship between nominal and real GDP. By dividing nominal GDP by the GDP deflator, we can isolate the impact of inflation on nominal GDP, allowing us to see how much of the increase in GDP was due to actual economic growth rather than simply reflecting higher prices."
