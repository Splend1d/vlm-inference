Development of hyperosmolality in the muscles. \n\nHyperosmolarity refers to an increase in the osmotic pressure within the cells, which can lead to cell swelling and damage. In the case of multiple sprint activities, the body may experience rapid changes in blood glucose levels, leading to an increase in osmolarity in the muscles. This can cause the muscles to become fatigued more quickly due to their inability to maintain proper cell volume and function."
