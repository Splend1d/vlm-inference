They have also built up their armies to a state of great efficiency and are possessed of war implements of great power and precision, in short have license to be formidable powers. If, therefore, we persistently cling to our antiquated systems, heaven only knows what a mighty calamity may befall our Empire.\n\u2014Adapted from a letter written by Lord Ii to Lord Tokugawa, 1847\nWhich event or period in Japan's history best reflects Lord Ii's concerns?\n\nA.

Perry had demanded that Japan open its ports to trade with Western nations, which would have been a major blow to Japan's isolationist policies. Lord Ii believed that if Japan continued to cling to its outdated ways, it could face a \"mighty calamity\" as a result of such an open society. Therefore, D is the correct answer."
