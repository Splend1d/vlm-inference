For example, skeletal muscle cells convert pyruvate into lactic acid when no oxygen is present. Yeast cells can produce alcohol and carbon dioxide under the same circumstances. However, regardless of the specific reactions, the purpose of glycolysis is an important one. Which statement best describes the importance of glycolysis?\n\nA. It produces large amounts of ATP by substrate level phosphorylation.\nB. It reoxidizes NADH so that glycolysis can continue.\nC. It produces pyruvate, which is the raw material for oxidative phosphorylation.\nD. It occurs in the cytoplasm.\n"

Glycolysis is a series of biochemical reactions that take place in the cytoplasm of cells to produce glucose-6-phosphate from pyruvate. This process is essential for energy production in all living organisms, including humans. The ATP produced during glycolysis is then used to power various cellular processes such as muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and protein synthesis."
