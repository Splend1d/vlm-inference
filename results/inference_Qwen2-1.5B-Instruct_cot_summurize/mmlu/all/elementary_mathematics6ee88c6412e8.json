There are 8 groups of marbles with 7 marbles in each group.\n\nThis is because when Tayshawn divides 56 marbles into equal groups, and there are no marbles left over, it means that the total number of marbles (56) can be divided evenly by the number of groups she has. In this case, dividing 56 by 8 gives us 7, which means that 56 marbles can be equally divided into 8 groups with 7 marbles in each group.\n\nTherefore, option C is the only possible correct answer based on the given information."
