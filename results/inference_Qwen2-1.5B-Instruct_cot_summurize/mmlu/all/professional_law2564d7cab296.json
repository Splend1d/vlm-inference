                    "text": "The correct answer is A. Claim preclusion (res judicata) bars the motorcyclist's action against the company.\n\nRes judicata refers to the doctrine that prevents a party from relitigating an issue that has already been decided by a final judgment in a prior proceeding. In this scenario, the state-court judgment would be considered a \"prior proceeding\" because it determined the truck driver's liability and awarded damages. Therefore, res judicata would prevent the motorcyclist from bringing another lawsuit against the company, as they have already litigated the issue in the state court.\n\nOption B is incorrect because issue preclusion does not necessarily apply when there is a collateral estoppel or claim preclusion issue at play. Collateral estoppel applies only when the issue raised in one case is the same as an issue that was previously resolved in a prior case, whereas claim preclusion applies if the outcome of a previous lawsuit had already determined a material fact that is essential to the plaintiff's case.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the doctrine of election of remedies does not relate to res judicata or other principles related to preventing multiple lawsuits on the same issues. An election of remedies occurs when a party decides which legal remedy to pursue rather than choosing between multiple potential remedies, but it does not prevent future litigation over the same issue.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the state-court judgment is not the \"law of the case,\" which refers to the principle that once a question of law is determined in a prior judicial proceeding, it must be applied in any subsequent proceedings on the same cause of action. In this case, the state-court judgment did not resolve the issue of whether the truck driver was negligent, so it would not be considered the \"law of the case.\""
