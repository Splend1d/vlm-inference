Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear.\n2. Homoscedasticity: The variance of errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables.\n3. Independence: Errors are uncorrelated with each other.\n\nHowever, assuming that the errors have zero mean and unit variances (which is equivalent to saying they follow a normal distribution with mean zero and variance one) does not directly imply that the OLS estimator is efficient or unbiased. Efficiency can only be guaranteed if the errors have zero mean and constant variance. Therefore, option D is correct."
