The corona is made up mostly of charged particles which aren't luminous.\n\nDuring a total solar eclipse, the Earth blocks all of the sun's light and only the corona is visible because it is directly in front of the sun. The corona is made up mostly of charged particles called ions, which are not luminous and do not produce any visible light. This is why we cannot see the Sun's corona except during total solar eclipses. During other times, such as when the Moon is blocking some of the sun's light, we may still be able to see the Sun's surface but not its corona."
