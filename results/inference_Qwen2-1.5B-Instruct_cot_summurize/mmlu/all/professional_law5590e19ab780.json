The professor was recently involved in a highly visible political protest against the government. The police eventually shut down the protest because they felt that it was becoming unruly. A television crew covered the entire rally. On the six o'clock news that evening, the film of the protest rally was shown during the broadcast. A news anchorman then made the following commentary: \"It's a shame that public funds are spent to pay the salaries of such university professors, who are not grateful for what this country has done for them. In my opinion, these people like the professor should be deported. \"If the professor asserts a claim based on invasion of privacy against the television station and the anchorman for his television commentary, the most likely result is that the professor will\n\nA. not prevail, because the criticism was not directed at the professor personally.\nB. not prevail, because the broadcast was privileged as being in the public interest.\nC. prevail, because the professor, as a private individual, was placed in a false light.\nD. prevail, because the comments were made with actual malice.\n"

If the professor's criticisms were made with actual malice, meaning that the professor intended to harm someone through the statements, then they could potentially sue the television station and the anchorman for libel.\n\nHowever, the professor would need to prove that the anchorman had knowledge of the professor's identity or that the anchorman acted with reckless disregard for the truth when making the statement. It's important to note that the professor would also need to show that the comment caused emotional distress or financial loss.\n\nSo, the answer is D. prevail, because the comments were made with actual malice."
