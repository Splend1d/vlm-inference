Normativity, Relativism. \n\nNormativity refers to the idea that certain actions or behaviors are morally right or wrong based on established rules or principles. This approach to ethics is often associated with moral absolutism, which holds that certain moral truths are universally applicable and must be followed regardless of cultural or personal beliefs.\n\nRelativism, on the other hand, suggests that what is considered morally right or wrong varies depending on cultural or individual values and norms. This perspective emphasizes the importance of respecting different perspectives and beliefs, but does not necessarily lead to a universal set of moral principles.\n\nTherefore, in this context, normativity is an approach that allows for rational determination of ethical principles, while relativism is an approach that is context-dependent and subjective."
