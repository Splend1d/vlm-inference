Small businesses often have a more informal organizational structure and rely heavily on owner and family members for decision-making and leadership. They may also have limited financial resources and may struggle to compete with larger organizations in terms of organizational complexity. These factors can lead to a lack of formalized policies and procedures, which can make it difficult for the organization to effectively engage with business-related issues."
