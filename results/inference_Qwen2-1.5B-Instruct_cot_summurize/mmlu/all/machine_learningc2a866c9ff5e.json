It uses eigendecomposition on covariance matrices to achieve this transformation. On the other hand, Spectral clustering is an unsupervised machine learning method used for clustering problems where the clusters have similar Euclidean distances but different densities. It's also based on eigendecomposition, but it does not use the entire matrix for this purpose.\n\nRegarding the second statement: \"Since classification is a special case of regression, logistic regression is a special case of linear regression.\" This statement is false because:\n\n- Classification and regression are fundamentally different tasks.\n- Logistic regression is indeed a special case of linear regression, but it differs significantly from linear regression due to its sigmoid activation function which maps the output range to [0,1] instead of [\u2212\u221e, \u221e]. In contrast, linear regression typically has outputs within [-\u221e, \u221e].\n\nSo, the correct answer would be B. False, False."
