HM rejects Buzan et al.'s theory of sectoral security analysis, on the grounds that securitization is a product of a state-centric approach.\nC. HM rejects the assertion by Buzan et al. that there are distinct and separate sectors of security, instead adopting a holistic view of security within which national and transnational class is an important factor.\nD. HM favours the sectoral approach to security analysis, in particular prioritising the state as a referent object and drawing much of its theoretical foundations from the realist principles that underpin the sectoral approach.\n"

HM agrees with the idea that security can be viewed using a sectoral framework, and recognises the depth of analysis that is enabled by such an approach.\n\nThis option reflects HM's perspective that security can indeed be analyzed at different levels (e.g., at the level of individual states or regions), and that this segmentation can provide insights into the complex interplay between domestic and international factors that influence security outcomes. The other options either directly contradict HM's views or do not accurately capture their core ideas about the nature and utility of sectoral approaches to security analysis."
