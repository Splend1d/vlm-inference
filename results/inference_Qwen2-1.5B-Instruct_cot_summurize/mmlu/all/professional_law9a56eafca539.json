Just before the parties signed the one-page written contract, the homeowner called to the contractor's attention the fact that the contract did not specify a time of completion. The parties orally agreed but did not specify in the contract that the contractor would complete the work in 60 days, and then they both signed the contract. The contract did not contain a merger clause. The contractor failed to finish the work in 60 days. The homeowner has sued the contractor for breach of contract. Is the court likely to admit evidence concerning the parties' oral agreement that the work would be completed in 60 days?\n\nA. No, because the court must ascertain the meaning of the agreement from the terms of the written contract.\nB. No, because the oral agreement was merely part of the parties' negotiations.\nC. Yes, because the contract is ambiguous.\nD. Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.\n"

Yes, because the time limit is an additional term that does not contradict the partially integrated written contract.\n\nIn this scenario, the contractor and the homeowner had a written contract that specified a time limit of 60 days for completing the garage renovation. However, the contractor failed to meet this deadline. In order to determine whether the court should admit evidence regarding the oral agreement that the work would be completed in 60 days, it is important to consider whether this oral agreement contradicts or supplements the written contract.\n\nIf the oral agreement states that the work would be completed in 60 days without contradicting the time limit set out in the written contract, then the court may be willing to admit evidence of the oral agreement as it pertains to the completion date. This is because the oral agreement is considered an additional term that can coexist with the written contract, rather than being part of the negotiations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Yes, the court is likely to admit evidence of the oral agreement if it does not contradict the partially integrated written contract."
