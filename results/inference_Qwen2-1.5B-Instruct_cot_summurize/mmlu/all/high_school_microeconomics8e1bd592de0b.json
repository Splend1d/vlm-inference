A price floor will be located below the equilibrium price.\n\nA price floor is a regulatory measure that sets a minimum price for certain goods or services, preventing prices from falling below this level. When the market price falls below the price floor, consumers may choose not to purchase the good or service at all, leading to shortages and higher prices in the future. This can lead to an artificial increase in the price of the good or service, as the shortage creates demand for it at a higher price. Therefore, a price floor tends to be located below the equilibrium price, rather than above it."
