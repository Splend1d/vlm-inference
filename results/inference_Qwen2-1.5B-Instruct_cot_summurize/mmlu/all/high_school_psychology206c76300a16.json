Perception refers to the process of organizing and interpreting sensory input received through the senses, such as sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. This allows us to understand our surroundings and make sense of the world around us. The other options listed may be part of the perception process, but they do not capture the full range of what happens during perception."
