This statement is true.\n\nIn general, when defining a ring homomorphism between two rings $R$ and $S$, it's important to note that for any element $x \\in R$, there exists at most one element $y \\in S$ such that $f(x) = y$. This means that every element of $R$ has exactly one image under the homomorphism $f$. \n\nThe condition that the kernel of the homomorphism consists solely of the identity element ($e$), which is defined as $ker(f) = \\{0\\}$, ensures that this property holds true. The kernel is indeed empty (consisting only of the zero element) when $f$ is injective (one-to-one). Thus, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: Q is an ideal in R. This statement is false.\n\nAn ideal in a ring $R$ is a subset $I$ of $R$ with three properties:\n1. $0 \\in I$\n2. If $a, b \\in I$, then $a + b \\in I$\n3. If $a \\in I$ and $r \\in R$, then $ra \\in I$\n\nFor $Q$, the set of rational numbers, we have:\n- $0 \\in Q$\n- Since all rational numbers can be expressed as fractions of integers, their sum will also be a fraction of integers, thus preserving the property of being a subset of $R$.\n- However, not every integer can be written as a fraction of integers; hence, it does not satisfy the third property of being closed under multiplication by non-zero elements of $R$.\n\nTherefore, Q is not an ideal in R, making Statement 2 false. The correct answer is B. False, False."
