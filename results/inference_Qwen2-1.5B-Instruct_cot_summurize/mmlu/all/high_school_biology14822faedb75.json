The flu virus, which changes its envelope proteins\n\nAntigenic variation refers to the changes in the surface proteins (antigens) of viruses or bacteria that allow them to evade the immune response. This variation allows these pathogens to adapt to their hosts' immune systems over time. \n\nHIV remains integrated into the host's genome for many years because it has evolved to evade the body's immune system's ability to detect and destroy it.\n\nThe flu virus changes its envelope proteins regularly to maintain its ability to infect different species. This helps it to evade the immune system and spread from person to person.\n\nMultiple sclerosis attacks the cells of the nervous system, but it does not change the surface proteins of any specific virus or pathogen to evade the immune system.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct."
