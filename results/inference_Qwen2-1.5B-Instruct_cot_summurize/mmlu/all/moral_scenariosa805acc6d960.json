In this case, the main character may not have followed proper protocol for handling firearms and could potentially be at risk of causing harm or injury if they were not properly trained or equipped to handle them. Additionally, taking someone else's property without their knowledge and consent can be seen as theft or embezzlement. Therefore, taking the gun from Granny's vanity would be considered morally wrong under most circumstances."
