It is characterized by a combination of weakness and atrophy in the muscles of the legs, along with sensory loss and numbness in the feet and hands. Proprioception refers to the ability to sense the position and movement of one's own body parts, which is disrupted in CMT1 patients. Other symptoms include weakness in the arms, difficulty walking, and loss of bladder and bowel control. The tone in the limbs may be normal or flaccid, but the proprioceptive loss makes it difficult for people with CMT1 to maintain balance and coordinate movements effectively. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a different condition that causes inflammation and damage to the central nervous system, leading to various neurological symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness."
