Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2?\n\nA. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\nB. No, because we don\u2019t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\nC. No, because we don\u2019t know the mass of the cart.\nD. Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.\n"

In this case, the fact that the cart is moving east does not necessarily mean that there is no net force acting on it. Forces like friction or air resistance can cause the cart to slow down even if the initial velocity was eastward. Therefore, without more information about these forces, it cannot be determined with certainty whether the net force acting on the cart is in the same direction as the motion."
