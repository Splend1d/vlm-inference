This action may not be explicitly considered morally wrong in this context, but it can still have negative consequences for the health and well-being of both the mother-in-law and the community. It's important to consider the potential harm or inconvenience caused by our actions.\nScenario 2: Wiping the doors does not seem like an action that directly breaks any moral rules. However, it could potentially be seen as disrespectful or inappropriate if done during someone else's sleep. In some cultures or contexts, it might also be seen as offensive or unprofessional. Therefore, while scenario 2 may not be considered morally wrong, it's possible that there could be social implications associated with it."
