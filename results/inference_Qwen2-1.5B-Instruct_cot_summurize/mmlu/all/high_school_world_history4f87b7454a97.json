The poem contains references to the Cuban Missile Crisis and the embargo of Cuba after Fidel Castro's revolution, both of which were significant events in US-Spanish relations during the early 20th century. Additionally, the poem contains references to the United States as an \"invader\" and a \"fearful rifleman,\" which could suggest a sense of fear or unease about the potential consequences of US intervention in Latin American affairs."
