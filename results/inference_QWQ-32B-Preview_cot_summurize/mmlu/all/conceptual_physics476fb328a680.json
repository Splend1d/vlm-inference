                    "text": "Let's think about this. I know that when things get hotter, they usually expand. Like, if you have a metal rod and you heat it up, it gets a little longer. So, for a strip of iron, which is basically a flat piece of metal, I would expect the same thing to happen.\n\nOption A says \"also increases.\" That sounds right based on what I just thought. But let me consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B says \"actually decreases.\" Hmm, that seems opposite to what I know about thermal expansion. Maybe there's something special about iron that makes it contract when heated, but I don't think that's the case. Iron should expand like most metals.\n\nOption C says \"may increase and may decrease.\" This seems vague. Is there a situation where heating iron could make it both expand and contract? I don't think so. Thermal expansion is a pretty consistent property for metals.\n\nOption D says \"decreases in width as it gets longer.\" Wait, that doesn't make sense to me. If a metal expands when heated, I would expect it to expand in all directions, not just get longer while getting narrower. That doesn't sound right.\n\nSo, based on my understanding of thermal expansion, I think the correct answer is A: the length of the iron strip also increases when its temperature is increased.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up the coefficient of thermal expansion for iron to confirm. According to my knowledge, most metals have a positive coefficient of thermal expansion, meaning they expand when heated. Iron is no exception.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that materials can sometimes behave differently under certain conditions, like if there are stresses in the material or if it's constrained in some way. But the question doesn't mention any constraints; it's just a strip of iron being heated.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that metals can have different expansion rates in different directions if they're not isotropic, but for a standard iron strip, I don't think that's a factor here.\n\nSo, overall, I'm confident that the answer is A: the length also increases when the temperature is increased.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
