Cheating on a partner, especially when it involves the spouse of a friend, is generally considered morally wrong. Loyalty and trust are important values in friendships and marriages, and kissing someone's spouse without their consent breaches that trust. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character keeps boxes of candy in their van to draw in kids. This scenario raises red flags immediately. Luring children with candy can be seen as predatory behavior, especially in a context where stranger danger is a significant concern. This action could be interpreted as attempting to gain the trust of children for potentially harmful purposes. Therefore, this action is also morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
