                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. So, we have a point (x, y) chosen uniformly at random within the region defined by 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 in R\u00b2. We need to find the probability that 2(x + y) > 1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the region where the point (x, y) is chosen. The inequality 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 describes a diamond shape centered at the origin, excluding the origin itself and the boundary where |x| + |y| = 1. This is because |x| + |y| = 1 is a diamond with vertices at (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), and (0,-1).\n\nSince the distribution is uniform, the probability of the point lying in a certain subset of this region is proportional to the area of that subset.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that 2(x + y) > 1, which simplifies to x + y > 1/2.\n\nSo, we need to find the area within the region 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 where x + y > 1/2, and then divide that by the total area of the region 0 < |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nLet's first find the total area of the region 0 < |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nThe area where |x| + |y| < 1 is a diamond with area 2 (since the area of a diamond with diagonals of length 2 is 2). However, since we exclude the origin, the total area is still 2.\n\nWait, actually, the area of the region |x| + |y| < 1 is 2, but since 0 < |x| + |y| < 1, we exclude the origin, which has zero area, so the total area remains 2.\n\nNext, we need to find the area where x + y > 1/2 within this region.\n\nTo visualize this, let's plot the lines x + y = 1/2 and |x| + |y| = 1.\n\nThe line x + y = 1/2 is a straight line that intersects the x-axis at (1/2, 0) and the y-axis at (0, 1/2).\n\nWe need to find the area within the diamond where x + y > 1/2.\n\nGiven the symmetry of the region, it might be easier to consider one quadrant and then multiply by 4.\n\nLet's consider the first quadrant, where x > 0 and y > 0. In this quadrant, |x| + |y| = x + y.\n\nSo, in the first quadrant, the region is 0 < x + y < 1.\n\nWe need to find the area where x + y > 1/2 within this triangle.\n\nThis is the area between x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1 in the first quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, in the other quadrants, we have corresponding regions.\n\nBut wait, in the other quadrants, the signs of x and y change, so we need to be careful.\n\nActually, in the second quadrant, x < 0 and y > 0, so |x| + |y| = -x + y.\n\nSimilarly, in the third quadrant, x < 0 and y < 0, so |x| + |y| = -x - y.\n\nIn the fourth quadrant, x > 0 and y < 0, so |x| + |y| = x - y.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the region is symmetric across both axes, and the condition x + y > 1/2 is not symmetric in the same way, perhaps we can find the area in one quadrant and then adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to consider the entire region at once.\n\nLet's consider the inequality x + y > 1/2 within the region 0 < |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection points of x + y = 1/2 and |x| + |y| = 1.\n\nIn the first quadrant, x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1. These don't intersect since x + y = 1/2 is inside x + y = 1.\n\nIn the second quadrant, x < 0, y > 0.\n\nHere, |x| + |y| = -x + y = 1.\n\nWe set -x + y = 1 and x + y = 1/2.\n\nSolving these two equations:\n\nFrom -x + y = 1 and x + y = 1/2.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: (x + y) - (-x + y) = 1/2 - 1 => 2x = -1/2 => x = -1/4.\n\nThen, from x + y = 1/2: -1/4 + y = 1/2 => y = 3/4.\n\nSo, one intersection point is (-1/4, 3/4).\n\nSimilarly, in the fourth quadrant, x > 0, y < 0.\n\nHere, |x| + |y| = x - y = 1.\n\nSet x - y = 1 and x + y = 1/2.\n\nSolving: add the two equations: 2x = 1.5 => x = 3/4.\n\nThen, from x + y = 1/2: 3/4 + y = 1/2 => y = -1/4.\n\nSo, another intersection point is (3/4, -1/4).\n\nIn the third quadrant, x < 0, y < 0.\n\nHere, |x| + |y| = -x - y = 1.\n\nSet -x - y = 1 and x + y = 1/2.\n\nThis implies that -(x + y) = 1 and x + y = 1/2, which is impossible since -1/2 \u2260 1.\n\nTherefore, no intersection in the third quadrant.\n\nSimilarly, in the second quadrant, we already have one intersection point.\n\nSo, the region where x + y > 1/2 within 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 is bounded by the lines x + y = 1/2 and |x| + |y| = 1, with intersection points at (-1/4, 3/4) and (3/4, -1/4).\n\nNow, to find the area where x + y > 1/2 within the diamond, we can find the area of the region between x + y = 1/2 and |x| + |y| = 1.\n\nGiven the symmetry, it might be easier to compute this area by integrating or by geometric considerations.\n\nAlternatively, since the region is symmetric, perhaps we can find the area in one quadrant and multiply by the number of quadrants where the condition holds.\n\nBut let's consider the geometry.\n\nThe total area of the diamond is 2, as previously determined.\n\nNow, the area where x + y > 1/2 intersects the diamond in a certain way.\n\nLet's consider the area where x + y > 1/2 within the diamond.\n\nThis area consists of four triangular regions, but considering the intersections we found.\n\nWait, actually, it's probably two triangular regions, in the second and fourth quadrants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the area where x + y > 1/2 and subtract it from the total area.\n\nWait, no. We need to find the area where x + y > 1/2 within the region 0 < |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to switch to variables that simplify the region.\n\nLet's consider switching to variables u and v where u = x + y and v = x - y.\n\nThen, |x| + |y| can be expressed in terms of u and v.\n\nWait, actually, in terms of u and v, the region |x| + |y| < 1 becomes |u| + |v| < 1, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, let's find the transformation.\n\nLet u = x + y and v = x - y.\n\nThen, x = (u + v)/2 and y = (u - v)/2.\n\nNow, |x| + |y| < 1 becomes |(u + v)/2| + |(u - v)/2| < 1.\n\nThis simplifies to (|u + v| + |u - v|)/2 < 1.\n\nI recall that |u + v| + |u - v| is equal to 2 max(|u|, |v|).\n\nTherefore, (2 max(|u|, |v|))/2 = max(|u|, |v|) < 1.\n\nSo, the region in the uv-plane is max(|u|, |v|) < 1, which is a square centered at the origin with side length 2.\n\nSimilarly, the condition x + y > 1/2 translates to u > 1/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the area within the square max(|u|, |v|) < 1 where u > 1/2.\n\nThis is a rectangular region in the uv-plane.\n\nThe square max(|u|, |v|) < 1 corresponds to -1 < u < 1 and -1 < v < 1.\n\nThe area where u > 1/2 is a rectangle from u = 1/2 to u = 1 and -1 < v < 1.\n\nThe area of this rectangle is (1 - 1/2) * 2 = 1/2 * 2 = 1.\n\nThe total area of the square is 4 (since it's from -1 to 1 in both u and v), but wait, no.\n\nWait, max(|u|, |v|) < 1 corresponds to a square with side length 2, so area 4.\n\nBut in the xy-plane, the area was 2, but perhaps I made a mistake in the transformation.\n\nWait, in the xy-plane, the area of |x| + |y| < 1 is 2, not 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the Jacobian of the transformation.\n\nThe Jacobian determinant for the transformation u = x + y, v = x - y is |du/dx dv/dy - du/dy dv/dx| = |1*1 - 1*(-1)| = |1 + 1| = 2.\n\nTherefore, the area in the uv-plane is scaled by the Jacobian, which is 2.\n\nSo, the area in the xy-plane is half the area in the uv-plane.\n\nGiven that, the area in the uv-plane is 4, so in the xy-plane it's 2, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, in the uv-plane, the area where u > 1/2 is a rectangle from u = 1/2 to u = 1 and v from -1 to 1, with area (1 - 1/2)*2 = 1.\n\nBut since the area in the xy-plane is half of that in the uv-plane, the corresponding area in the xy-plane is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability is (1/2)/2 = 1/4.\n\nWait, but is this correct?\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nTotal area in xy-plane: 2.\n\nArea where x + y > 1/2 within 0 < |x| + |y| < 1: 1/2.\n\nTherefore, probability is (1/2)/2 = 1/4.\n\nBut let me confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the area directly in the xy-plane.\n\nIn the first quadrant, where x > 0 and y > 0, |x| + |y| = x + y.\n\nSo, 0 < x + y < 1.\n\nThe condition x + y > 1/2 is the area between x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1.\n\nThis is a triangle with area (1/2)*(1 - 1/2)*1 = 1/8.\n\nSimilarly, in the second quadrant, x < 0, y > 0.\n\nHere, |x| + |y| = -x + y.\n\nThe condition x + y > 1/2.\n\nWe can solve for the area.\n\nSimilarly, in the fourth quadrant, x > 0, y < 0.\n\nHere, |x| + |y| = x - y.\n\nAgain, solve for x + y > 1/2.\n\nThe third quadrant has x < 0 and y < 0, but in this quadrant, x + y > 1/2 is unlikely since both x and y are negative.\n\nWait, no, it's possible if both are positive, but in the third quadrant, both are negative, so x + y would be negative, which cannot be greater than 1/2.\n\nTherefore, no area in the third quadrant satisfies x + y > 1/2.\n\nSo, only first, second, and fourth quadrants contribute.\n\nWait, but in the first quadrant, x + y > 1/2 and x + y < 1 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, in the second and fourth quadrants.\n\nLet's compute the areas in each quadrant.\n\nFirst quadrant:\n\nArea between x + y = 1/2 and x + y = 1.\n\nThis is a triangle with base and height both 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nArea = (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8.\n\nSecond quadrant:\n\nHere, x < 0, y > 0.\n\nWe have |x| + |y| = -x + y.\n\nThe condition x + y > 1/2.\n\nWe can express y > 1/2 - x.\n\nBut since x is negative, 1/2 - x is greater than 1/2.\n\nWe need to find the area where -x + y < 1 (from |x| + |y| < 1) and y > 1/2 - x.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to stick with the uv-transformation.\n\nGiven that, and considering the Jacobian, the area in the uv-plane is 1, and in the xy-plane it's 1/2.\n\nTherefore, probability is (1/2)/2 = 1/4.\n\nGiven this, and considering the multiple steps involved in calculating the areas in each quadrant, it seems reasonable to conclude that the probability is 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 1/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
