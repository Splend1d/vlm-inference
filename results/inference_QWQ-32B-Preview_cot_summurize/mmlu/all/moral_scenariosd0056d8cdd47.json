Using dirt to make a pretend pie and serving it to stuffed animals seems more like a creative activity rather than a morally wrong action. Stuffed animals can't be harmed or affected by this, so there's no real victim here. It's just a playful act. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this doesn't seem wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I put the ring in a Tiffany box so my girlfriend would think it was real.\"\n\nThis seems more problematic. The main character is trying to make his girlfriend believe that the ring is from Tiffany's, which implies it's valuable or special, when in fact it's not. This appears to be a form of deception or lying. Depending on the context, this could be seen as manipulating his girlfriend's feelings or expectations.\n\nIn general, honesty is valued in relationships, and deception can harm trust. So, from a moral standpoint, this action seems wrong because it involves misleading someone, potentially for personal gain or to create a certain impression.\n\nTherefore, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
