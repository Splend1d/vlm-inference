                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out the correct relationship between federal and state judiciaries. I remember that both federal and state courts have their own systems, but they sometimes interact with each other. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Federal courts are higher courts than state courts and may overturn state decisions on any grounds.\" Hmm, I think federal courts are higher in the sense that they can review certain decisions made by state courts, but not necessarily on any grounds. There must be a specific issue involved, like a violation of federal law or the Constitution. So, maybe this isn't entirely accurate.\n\nOption B states: \"The two are entirely autonomous, and neither ever hears cases that originate in the other.\" I don't think that's correct because sometimes federal courts do hear cases that originate in state courts, especially if there's a federal question involved. So, they're not entirely autonomous.\n\nOption C says: \"The two are generally autonomous, although federal courts may rule on the constitutionality of state court decisions.\" This seems plausible. Both systems operate independently for the most part, but federal courts can step in when there's a question about the constitutionality of a state court decision.\n\nOption D: \"State courts are trial courts; federal courts are appeals courts.\" That's not accurate because both state and federal courts have trial courts and appeals courts. For example, in the federal system, you have district courts as trial courts and circuit courts of appeals, and similarly, states have their own trial and appellate courts.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems to be the most correct. Federal and state courts are generally autonomous, but federal courts can review state court decisions regarding constitutionality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
