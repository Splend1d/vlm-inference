                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking me to write \"1 and 1 over 11\" as a whole or mixed number in simplest form. The options are:\n\nA. 1.1 over 11\n\nB. 11 over 11\n\nC. 12 over 11\n\nD. 11 over 12\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"1 and 1 over 11\" means. I think it's a mixed number, like 1 plus 1/11. So, 1 and 1/11.\n\nNow, I need to convert this mixed number into an improper fraction or a whole number, whichever is appropriate, and make sure it's in its simplest form.\n\nLet me recall how to convert a mixed number to an improper fraction. I multiply the whole number part by the denominator of the fractional part, then add the numerator, and place that sum over the original denominator.\n\nSo, for 1 and 1/11:\n\n- The whole number is 1.\n\n- The denominator is 11.\n\n- The numerator is 1.\n\nFirst, multiply the whole number by the denominator: 1 * 11 = 11.\n\nThen, add the numerator: 11 + 1 = 12.\n\nFinally, place this over the original denominator: 12/11.\n\nSo, 1 and 1/11 is equal to 12/11.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is in its simplest form. To do that, I should see if 12 and 11 have any common factors other than 1.\n\n12 and 11 are both only divisible by 1, so their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. That means 12/11 is already in its simplest form.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1.1 over 11 \u2013 This seems odd because 1.1 is a decimal, and the question is about fractions.\n\nB. 11 over 11 \u2013 That's 11/11, which simplifies to 1. But 1 and 1/11 is greater than 1.\n\nC. 12 over 11 \u2013 That matches what I calculated.\n\nD. 11 over 12 \u2013 This is less than 1, but 1 and 1/11 is greater than 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 12 over 11.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I misread the question. It says \"1 and 1 over 11,\" which is clearly a mixed number, and I converted it to 12/11, which makes sense.\n\nOption A has \"1.1 over 11,\" which is 1.1/11. That's different from what I have. 1.1 divided by 11 is 0.1, which is not what we're looking for.\n\nOption B is 11/11, which is 1, but 1 and 1/11 is 1 + 1/11, which is more than 1.\n\nOption C is 12/11, which matches my calculation.\n\nOption D is 11/12, which is less than 1, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 12 over 11.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to interpret \"1 and 1 over 11.\" Maybe it means 1 + (1/11), which is what I did, or perhaps it's 1 AND 1/11, meaning both 1 and 1/11 separately, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's interpreted as 1 & 1/11, but in mathematical terms, that's the same as 1 + 1/11.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with C as the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
