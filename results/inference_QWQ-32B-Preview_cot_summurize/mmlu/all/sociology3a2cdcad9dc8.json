                    "text": "I think the answer is A. Functionalism. Functionalism sees society as a complex system with interconnected parts that work together to maintain stability and harmony. Each part has a function that contributes to the overall system.\n\nLet me think about this. Conflict theory, option B, focuses more on inequality and conflicts between different groups in society. It's not so much about parts working together.\n\nSymbolic interactionism, option C, is more about how people interact with each other and how they interpret symbols and meanings in their daily interactions. That doesn't really fit the description of society as a system of interdependent parts.\n\nRole theory, option D, is about the roles people play in society and how these roles shape behavior. While it does involve parts of society, it's more focused on individual roles rather than the system as a whole.\n\nSo, functionalism seems to be the best fit here because it emphasizes the way different parts of society are coordinated and dependent on each other to keep the whole system functioning smoothly.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should look back at what each perspective emphasizes.\n\nFunctionalism looks at society like an organism, where each part has a role to play to keep the organism alive and healthy. For example, the economy provides goods and services, the political system provides governance, and the family provides a place for reproduction and socialization.\n\nConflict theory, on the other hand, sees society as a struggle for resources and power between different groups. So, it's more about competition and conflict rather than cooperation and coordination.\n\nSymbolic interactionism is more micro-level, focusing on how individuals interact and make sense of their social world through symbols and language.\n\nRole theory is about the expectations and behaviors associated with specific positions in society, like teacher, student, parent, etc.\n\nSo, again, functionalism seems to be the perspective that views society as a system of interdependent and coordinated parts.\n\nMaybe I should consider if any other perspective incorporates ideas of interdependence.\n\nWell, conflict theory does recognize that different parts of society are connected, but it's more about how they compete or conflict with each other rather than coordinate.\n\nSymbolic interactionism is more about individual interactions, so it doesn't really look at society as a whole system.\n\nRole theory does show how different roles are interconnected, but again, it's more about the individual positions and less about the overall system.\n\nTherefore, functionalism is the most appropriate answer here.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
