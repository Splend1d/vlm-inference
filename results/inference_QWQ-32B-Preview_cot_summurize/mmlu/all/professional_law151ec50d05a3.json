                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a brother and a sister who bought land together as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The sister paid $10,000 and the brother paid $40,000 of the $50,000 purchase price. Then, the sister mortgaged her interest, the brother died and left his estate to their cousin, the sister paid off her mortgage, and now we need to figure out who owns the land.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what joint tenancy with right of survivorship means. In common law, joint tenancy is a type of co-ownership where two or more people own a property equally, and when one owner dies, their interest automatically passes to the surviving joint tenants. This is different from tenancy in common, where each owner can own a different share and can leave their share to someone else in their will.\n\nIn this case, since they purchased the land as joint tenants with right of survivorship and there are no statutes modifying this in the jurisdiction, the general rules of joint tenancy should apply.\n\nNow, the purchase prices were split unevenly: sister paid $10,000 and brother paid $40,000. But in joint tenancy, the interests are equal, regardless of the contribution amounts. So, even though the brother paid more, both owned equal shares of the property.\n\nNext, the sister mortgaged her interest. I need to think about what that means in the context of joint tenancy. In some jurisdictions, mortgaging one joint tenant's interest can break the joint tenancy, converting it into a tenancy in common. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nThen, the brother died and left his entire estate to their cousin. Since it's a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, his interest should pass to the surviving joint tenant, which is the sister. But wait, there's a mortgage involved.\n\nAfter the brother's death, the sister paid off her mortgage, and it was released. So now, the mortgage is no longer a factor.\n\nGiven all this, who owns the land now?\n\nOption A says the answer depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien theory or the title theory of mortgages. I'm not sure what that means, but perhaps it's relevant.\n\nOption B says title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\n\nOption C says title is in the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common.\n\nOption D says title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and the cousin having an 80% interest.\n\nLet me try to work through this.\n\nFirst, the brother and sister are joint tenants. The brother dies and leaves his estate to the cousin. But in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, his interest should pass to the surviving joint tenant, which is the sister. So, the cousin shouldn't inherit anything from the brother's interest in the land, right?\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to consider if the mortgage affects this.\n\nThe sister mortgaged her interest. Did that break the joint tenancy? In some jurisdictions, mortgaging one joint tenant's interest can sever the joint tenancy, converting it into a tenancy in common.\n\nIf that's the case here, then after the mortgage, they would be tenants in common, each with their own divisible interests.\n\nIf the joint tenancy was severed, then upon the brother's death, his interest would pass according to his will, which is to the cousin.\n\nSo, if the mortgage severed the joint tenancy, then the brother's interest would go to the cousin, and the sister retains her interest.\n\nBut I need to know if mortgaging one joint tenant's interest severs the joint tenancy in this jurisdiction.\n\nSince the problem states that common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute, I can assume that the common law rules apply.\n\nUnder common law, mortgaging one joint tenant's interest typically does not sever the joint tenancy. The mortgage is treated as a lien on the joint tenancy, and the right of survivorship remains.\n\nTherefore, even if the sister mortgaged her interest, the joint tenancy wasn't severed, and the right of survivorship still applies.\n\nThus, when the brother died, his interest passed to the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\n\nSo, the sister should now own the entire property.\n\nBut option B says \"title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\"\n\nThat seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, option A says the answer depends on whether the jurisdiction follows the lien theory or the title theory of mortgages.\n\nI need to consider if that's relevant here.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, mortgages are handled differently. In lien theory states, the mortgage creates a lien on the property, but the title remains with the mortgagor. In title theory states, the mortgagee temporarily holds title until the mortgage is paid off.\n\nBut in this case, the sister paid off her mortgage, and it was released. So, regardless of whether it's a lien theory or title theory state, the mortgage should no longer affect the title.\n\nTherefore, the answer shouldn't depend on the type of mortgage theory the jurisdiction follows.\n\nSo, option A is probably incorrect.\n\nOption C says title is in the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common.\n\nBut if the joint tenancy with right of survivorship allows the sister to inherit the brother's interest, then the cousin shouldn't have any interest in the land.\n\nOption D says title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 20% interest and the cousin having an 80% interest.\n\nAgain, this seems inconsistent with the right of survivorship in joint tenancy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: title is entirely in the sister as the surviving joint tenant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
