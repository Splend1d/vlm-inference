So, I need to think about who Scott is and what he meant by 'power elite.'\n\nOption A mentions the ruling class and bourgeoisie exploiting the proletariat. That sounds like Marxism, but I don't think Scott is a Marxist theorist. Maybe I'm confusing him with someone else.\n\nOption B talks about a capitalist class dependent on property ownership and advantaged life chances. Again, this seems similar to Marxist concepts, but I'm not sure if Scott fits into that category.\n\nOption C is about an alignment of classes with shared interests but no state power. Hmm, that could be possible, but I need to recall if Scott specifically defined it this way.\n\nOption D says a state elite whose members are drawn overwhelmingly from a power bloc. This sounds more like what I remember about the power elite\u2014people in positions of power within the state, mostly from a certain group or bloc.\n\nWait, maybe I should look back at some of the readings or notes I have. Oh, right, Scott (1991) introduced the term 'power elite' to describe a state elite whose members are drawn overwhelmingly from a power bloc. That seems familiar.\n\nAlso, thinking about it, the power elite is often associated with people in high positions of government, military, and big business who have significant influence over society. So, it makes sense that they would be drawn from a specific power bloc.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\nA. Ruling class, bourgeoisie exploiting proletariat\u2014this is more Marxist class struggle, not sure if Scott fits here.\n\nB. Capitalist class dependent on property ownership\u2014again, Marxist influence, maybe not Scott's perspective.\n\nC. Alignment of classes with shared interests but no state power\u2014this seems inconsistent with the idea of an elite having power.\n\nD. State elite drawn from a power bloc\u2014this aligns with the concept of the power elite having significant state power and being from a particular group.\n\nI think D is the correct answer. Scott introduced the term 'power elite' to describe a state elite whose members are drawn overwhelmingly from a power bloc.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
