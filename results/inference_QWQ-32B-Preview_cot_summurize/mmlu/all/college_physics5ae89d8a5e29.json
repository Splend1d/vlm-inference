                    "text": "So I've got this problem about a heat pump. It's supposed to take heat from outside, where it's 7\u00b0C, and heat the inside to 27\u00b0C. For every 15,000 Joules of heat it delivers indoors, I need to find out the smallest amount of work that has to be supplied to the heat pump. The options are A. 500 J, B. 1,000 J, C. 1,100 J, and D. 2,000 J.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how heat pumps work. Heat pumps move heat from a cooler place to a warmer place, which normally wouldn't happen on its own because heat naturally flows from hot to cold. So, to make this happen, the heat pump has to do work.\n\nThere's probably some efficiency associated with this process, and I think the most efficient heat pump would be a reversible one, following the Carnot cycle. So, maybe I should look into the Carnot efficiency for heat pumps.\n\nI remember that for heat engines, the Carnot efficiency is 1 - (T_cold / T_hot), but for heat pumps, it's different. Wait, actually, heat pumps can be thought of as reversed heat engines, so their coefficient of performance (COP) is related to the Carnot efficiency.\n\nThe COP for a heat pump is defined as the heat delivered divided by the work input. So, COP = Q_hot / W, where Q_hot is the heat delivered indoors, and W is the work supplied.\n\nFor a reversible heat pump, the COP is maximized and is given by COP_reversible = Q_hot / W = T_hot / (T_hot - T_cold).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about this formula. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the COP for a heat pump can also be expressed as COP = Q_hot / W = (T_hot) / (T_hot - T_cold).\n\nYes, that seems right. So, in this case, T_hot is the indoor temperature, which is 27\u00b0C, and T_cold is the outdoor temperature, which is 7\u00b0C.\n\nBut I need to remember that temperatures in thermodynamic equations must be in Kelvin, not Celsius. So, I'll convert these temperatures:\n\nT_hot = 27\u00b0C + 273.15 = 300.15 K\n\nT_cold = 7\u00b0C + 273.15 = 280.15 K\n\nNow, plugging these into the COP formula:\n\nCOP_reversible = 300.15 / (300.15 - 280.15) = 300.15 / 20.00 = 15.0075\n\nSo, the maximum possible COP is approximately 15.\n\nNow, the problem states that the heat pump delivers 15,000 J of heat indoors. So, Q_hot = 15,000 J.\n\nUsing the COP formula:\n\nCOP = Q_hot / W\n\nSo, W = Q_hot / COP\n\nTo find the smallest amount of work required, I should use the maximum COP, which is the reversible case.\n\nTherefore, W_min = Q_hot / COP_reversible = 15,000 J / 15.0075 \u2248 999.7 J\n\nThat's approximately 1,000 J.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 1,000 J seems to be the closest.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, temperature conversion:\n\n27\u00b0C + 273.15 = 300.15 K \u2192 correct\n\n7\u00b0C + 273.15 = 280.15 K \u2192 correct\n\nThen, COP_reversible = T_hot / (T_hot - T_cold) = 300.15 / (300.15 - 280.15) = 300.15 / 20.00 = 15.0075 \u2192 correct\n\nThen, W_min = Q_hot / COP = 15,000 J / 15.0075 \u2248 999.7 J \u2192 which is approximately 1,000 J.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nBut option C is 1,100 J, which is close to 1,000 J, so maybe there's a slight miscalculation or perhaps a different formula is needed.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the heat pump cycle and the first law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn a heat pump, the work input is used to move heat from the cold reservoir to the hot reservoir.\n\nSo, Q_hot = Q_cold + W\n\nTherefore, W = Q_hot - Q_cold\n\nBut I don't know Q_cold directly.\n\nAlternatively, the COP can also be expressed as COP = Q_hot / W = (Q_hot) / (Q_hot - Q_cold)\n\nBut I still need another equation to relate Q_hot and Q_cold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the concept of the coefficient of performance for a heat pump.\n\nWait, I think I'm just going in circles.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the original approach, as it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula for the COP of a heat pump.\n\nLet me look it up in my notes.\n\nOkay, I found that the COP for a heat pump is COP = Q_hot / W = (T_hot) / (T_hot - T_cold)\n\nYes, that's the same formula I used earlier.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the smallest amount of work required is approximately 1,000 J.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 1,000 J.\n\nBut wait, option C is 1,100 J, which is slightly higher.\n\nMaybe there's a rounding error or something.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nT_hot = 300.15 K\n\nT_cold = 280.15 K\n\nCOP = 300.15 / (300.15 - 280.15) = 300.15 / 20.00 = 15.0075\n\nQ_hot = 15,000 J\n\nW = Q_hot / COP = 15,000 / 15.0075 \u2248 999.7 J\n\nYes, that's approximately 1,000 J.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the COP to be calculated without decimal places.\n\nIf I approximate T_hot as 300 K and T_cold as 280 K,\n\nThen COP = 300 / (300 - 280) = 300 / 20 = 15\n\nThen, W = 15,000 / 15 = 1,000 J exactly.\n\nSo, that matches option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different formula for the minimal work required.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the second law of thermodynamics or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal work is when the process is reversible, which is what I already calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula involving entropies or something.\n\nBut I think sticking with the COP formula is the simplest and most direct approach.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. 1,000 J.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
