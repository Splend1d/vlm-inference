They are known to cause a variety of diseases, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Let's consider each option to determine which disease polyomaviruses predominantly cause.\n\nOption A: Tumors\n\nSome polyomaviruses are associated with tumor formation, especially in animals used in laboratory settings. For example, SV40 (Simian Virus 40) is a polyomavirus that has been implicated in tumor development in rodents and monkeys. In humans, there is some evidence suggesting that certain polyomaviruses might be associated with tumors, but this connection is not as firmly established as in animal models. Therefore, while tumors can be a result of polyomavirus infection, it may not be the predominant disease they cause in humans.\n\nOption B: Brain pathology\n\nPolyomaviruses can affect the central nervous system, leading to brain pathologies. One notable example is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is caused by the JC polyomavirus. PML is a rare and often fatal disease that primarily affects individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with AIDS or undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. The virus causes damage to the white matter of the brain, leading to various neurological symptoms. Therefore, brain pathology is a significant consequence of polyomavirus infection, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nOption C: No disease at all\n\nMany polyomavirus infections in healthy individuals are asymptomatic, meaning they do not cause any disease. These viruses can establish persistent infections without causing overt illness. However, in immunocompromised individuals, these viruses can reactivate and cause serious diseases, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, while polyomaviruses may not cause disease in all infected individuals, it is not accurate to say they cause no disease at all.\n\nOption D: Kidney infections\n\nPolyomaviruses are not primarily known for causing kidney infections. However, some studies have suggested associations between certain polyomaviruses and renal diseases, particularly in transplant recipients. For example, BK polyomavirus can cause nephropathy in kidney transplant patients, leading to graft dysfunction. Nevertheless, this is not the predominant disease associated with polyomaviruses.\n\nConsidering the above points, the disease that polyomaviruses predominantly cause is brain pathology, specifically progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to the JC polyomavirus, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
