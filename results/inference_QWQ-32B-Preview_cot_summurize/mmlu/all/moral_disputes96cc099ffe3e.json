Let me recall what I know about the different ethical theories first.\n\nSo, consequentialism is about the outcomes or consequences of actions determining their moral value. Utilitarianism is a type of consequentialism that aims for the greatest happiness or utility.\n\nThen there's Kantian theory, which is deontological, focusing on duties and rules, and the idea that morality is about following maxims that can be universalized.\n\nVirtue ethics, on the other hand, emphasizes the character and virtues of the moral agent rather than specific actions or consequences.\n\nAnd the ethics of prima facie duty\u2014now, that sounds familiar. I think it's related to W.D. Ross, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, W.D. Ross was a British philosopher who wrote about ethics, and he did propose a theory about prima facie duties. Prima facie means 'at first glance' or 'on the surface,' and in ethics, it refers to duties that appear obligatory at first but might be overridden by more pressing duties in certain situations.\n\nSo, if Ross's moral theory is about prima facie duties, then the answer would be B. The ethics of prima facie duty.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe Ross's theory fits into one of the other categories.\n\nIs Ross's theory a version of consequentialism? Well, consequentialism is about the consequences of actions, whereas prima facie duties are about duties or obligations that seem binding initially, but can be overridden. So, they seem different.\n\nWhat about Kantian theory? Kantian ethics is about duties and universal maxims, but Ross's theory introduces the idea of prima facie duties, which allows for more flexibility in moral decision-making by considering multiple duties that may conflict.\n\nVirtue ethics focuses on the character of the moral agent, which doesn't seem directly related to prima facie duties.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that Ross's moral theory is a version of the ethics of prima facie duty.\n\nI think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
