This represents significant progress from previous decades, but it also means that around 10% of the global population still lacked access to electricity at that time. The effort to provide universal access to affordable and clean energy is a key goal in global development strategies.\n\n**Reference:**\n- International Energy Agency.

Available at: https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-access-outlook-2019 [Accessed on: 10/07/2021]\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe increase in electricity access is due to various factors including economic growth, rural electrification programs, and advancements in renewable energy technologies that make electricity more accessible and affordable in remote areas. However, challenges remain, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of Asia, where electricity access is still limited.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030.\n- Electrification has significant impacts on education, health, and economic opportunities, making it a critical component of development efforts.\n\n**Note:**\nData on electricity access can vary slightly depending on the source and the definition of \"access.\" Some sources may consider access as having a connection to the electricity grid, while others may include off-grid solutions like solar home systems.\n\n**Suggested Further Reading:**\n- World Bank.
