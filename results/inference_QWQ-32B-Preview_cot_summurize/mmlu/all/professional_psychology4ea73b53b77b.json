This loss of dopamine leads to the motor symptoms characteristic of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowed movement).\n\nTo provide a bit more context:\n\n- **Substantia nigra**: This is the correct answer. It's divided into two parts: the pars compacta and the pars reticulata. The dopamine-producing neurons that are affected in Parkinson's are mainly in the pars compacta.\n\n- **Suprachiasmatic nucleus**: This is part of the hypothalamus and is responsible for regulating the circadian rhythm, or the body's internal clock. It's not directly related to Parkinson's disease.\n\n- **Insular cortex**: This is a region of the cerebral cortex that plays a role in consciousness and homeostasis. It's involved in functions such as perception, motor control, self-awareness, cognitive functioning, and interpersonal experience. It's not primarily associated with Parkinson's disease.\n\n- **Entorhinal cortex**: This is part of the cerebral cortex and is important for memory and navigation. It's one of the first areas of the brain to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, but not typically in Parkinson's disease.\n\nSo, the substantia nigra is the correct choice here."
