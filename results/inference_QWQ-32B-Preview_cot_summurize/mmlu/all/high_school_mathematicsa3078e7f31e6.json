                    "text": "So I have this problem here about finding the center and radius of a circle from its equation, and then calculating a specific value based on those. The equation given is \\( x^2 + 12y + 57 = -y^2 - 10x \\). Hmm, that doesn't look like the standard form of a circle equation, which I know is \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\nFirst, I need to rearrange the given equation into the standard form. Let me start by moving all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero.\n\nSo, \\( x^2 + 12y + 57 + y^2 + 10x = 0 \\).\n\nCombining like terms, that's \\( x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 12y + 57 = 0 \\).\n\nOkay, now I need to complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms to get it into the standard form.\n\nLet's handle the \\(x\\) terms first: \\(x^2 + 10x\\).\n\nTo complete the square, I take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is 10, half of that is 5, and then square it to get 25.\n\nSo, \\(x^2 + 10x\\) becomes \\((x + 5)^2 - 25\\).\n\nNow, the \\(y\\) terms: \\(y^2 + 12y\\).\n\nHalf of 12 is 6, squared is 36.\n\nSo, \\(y^2 + 12y\\) becomes \\((y + 6)^2 - 36\\).\n\nNow, substituting these back into the equation:\n\n\\((x + 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 6)^2 - 36 + 57 = 0\\).\n\nLet's simplify this:\n\n\\((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 - 25 - 36 + 57 = 0\\).\n\nCalculating \\(-25 - 36 + 57\\):\n\n-25 - 36 is -61, plus 57 is -4.\n\nSo, \\((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 - 4 = 0\\).\n\nAdding 4 to both sides to get the standard form:\n\n\\((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 4\\).\n\nAlright, now this looks like the standard form of a circle's equation, where the center is at \\((-5, -6)\\) and the radius squared is 4, so the radius is 2.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of \\(a + b + r\\), where \\((a, b)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\nSo, \\(a = -5\\), \\(b = -6\\), and \\(r = 2\\).\n\nAdding them up: \\(-5 + (-6) + 2 = -9\\).\n\nLooking back at the options, A is -9, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I rearranged the equation to \\(x^2 + y^2 + 10x + 12y + 57 = 0\\).\n\nThen, completed the square for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\n\\(x^2 + 10x\\) becomes \\((x + 5)^2 - 25\\),\n\n\\(y^2 + 12y\\) becomes \\((y + 6)^2 - 36\\).\n\nSubstituting back: \\((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 - 25 - 36 + 57 = 0\\).\n\nSimplifying: \\((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 - 4 = 0\\), so \\((x + 5)^2 + (y + 6)^2 = 4\\).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the center is at \\((-5, -6)\\) and the radius is \\(\\sqrt{4} = 2\\).\n\nSo, \\(a + b + r = -5 + (-6) + 2 = -9\\).\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-9} \\]"
