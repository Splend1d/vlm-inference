                    "text": "Let's think about this scenario involving Dr. Harry Holliday, the clinical psychologist, who is planning a three-week cruise. He needs to manage his clinical practice during his absence, and we have four options to consider. I need to determine the best course of action for him.\n\nFirst, option A suggests that Dr. Holliday should discuss his vacation plans with his current clients ahead of time so that they know he\u2019ll be unavailable during that period. This seems like a responsible step because it sets clear expectations for his clients. It allows them to prepare for his absence and perhaps make arrangements for their care during that time. However, simply informing them about his unavailability might not be sufficient; clients might have concerns or needs that require more planning.\n\nOption B proposes that Dr. Holliday should give his clients a phone number where he can be reached. This could be seen as reassuring for clients, knowing they can contact him if needed. But, considering he's on a cruise, being reachable might not be practical or professional. Psychologists have ethical obligations to ensure continuity of care, and being reachable on vacation could compromise his rest and well-being, potentially affecting his ability to provide quality care upon his return.\n\nOption C suggests giving clients the phone number of a colleague who has agreed to accept phone calls in emergencies. This seems like a balanced approach. It provides a safety net for clients in case of emergencies while allowing Dr. Holliday to disconnect and recharge during his vacation. The colleague can handle urgent matters and provide temporary support, ensuring that clients don't feel abandoned.\n\nOption D recommends hiring a colleague to take over his appointments while he is on vacation. This could be the most comprehensive solution, as it ensures that clients continue to receive regular care without interruption. However, it might not be feasible for all practitioners due to scheduling constraints or the availability of colleagues willing to take on additional clients temporarily.\n\nConsidering these options, I believe that a combination of A and C would be the best approach. Dr. Holliday should definitely inform his clients about his upcoming vacation well in advance, allowing them to adjust their expectations and possibly make arrangements for their care. Additionally, providing them with the contact information of a colleague who can handle emergencies ensures that there is support available in case of urgent needs.\n\nOption D, hiring a colleague to take over appointments, might be ideal but could be logistically challenging. Moreover, some clients might prefer to take a break from therapy during the psychologist's absence or arrange alternative arrangements with other providers.\n\nIn summary, communicating clearly with clients about his absence and providing a point of contact for emergencies seems to be the most appropriate and ethical course of action for Dr. Holliday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
