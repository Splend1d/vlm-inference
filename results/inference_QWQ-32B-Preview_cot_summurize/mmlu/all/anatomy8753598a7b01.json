Electrolytes are minerals that carry an electric charge in the body and play crucial roles in various physiological functions, including fluid balance, nerve signaling, and muscle function.\n\n- **Calcium** is essential for bone health, muscle function, and nerve transmission.\n\n- **Potassium** helps regulate fluid balance and is important for heart function and muscle contractions.\n\n- **Sodium** is vital for maintaining fluid balance and is involved in nerve signaling and muscle contractions.\n\nThe other options listed are different types of substances:\n\n- **Androgens** are male sex hormones, such as testosterone.\n\n- **Catecholamines** are hormones and neurotransmitters, including epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine, and dopamine.\n\n- **Estrogens** are female sex hormones, such as estradiol.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Electrolytes."
