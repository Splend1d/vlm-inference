Hunting is legal in many places in the US, and hunters often keep parts of the animals they hunt as trophies or souvenirs. Mounting animal heads is a common practice among hunters and is generally accepted as long as the hunting was done legally and ethically. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character writes a prescription for a sick child. Prescribing medication is a standard practice for medical professionals, and providing medical care to sick children is generally considered morally acceptable and often obligatory. However, if the person writing the prescription is not a licensed medical professional, this could be considered unethical and illegal. But assuming that the main character is a licensed physician or healthcare provider, writing a prescription for a sick child is part of their professional duty and is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
