Over the course of time, the land-development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern tract and a western tract, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that \"the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single-family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. \"After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land-development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:\"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern tract and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern tract. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, the land-development company, its successors and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. \"At the time of this conveyance, the land- development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Thereafter, the land-development company developed an exclusive shopping center on 25 acres of the retained land. In February 2001, the land-development company sold the remaining eight residential lots in the eastern tract and the western tract. The next month, the land-development company executed the following instrument to the country club:\"The land-development company, for itself, its successors, and assigns, does hereby release,surrender and quitclaim all rights, title, or other property interest in that certain acres owned by the country club. \"At the time this instrument was executed, the country club had built a club house, golf course, and tennis courts on a portion of its land, and it had 25 acres of vacant land remaining. The country club wishes to commence construction of a new high- rise complex (containing a hotel, shopping mall, apartments, etc. ) on the 25 acres of vacant land it possesses.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this real estate law problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a land-development company that owns a 400-acre tract in the Southwest. They developed two subdivisions: eastern and western, each with 150 acres. These subdivisions were created with separate plats that don't reference each other, but their restrictions are substantially identical. The plats and deeds say that the land is restricted to single-family dwellings only, and this covenant runs with the land, binding every lot owner, their heirs, and assigns.\n\nSo, each subdivision has 150 acres, and they're both restricted to single-family homes. The company sold all but four lots in each subdivision, so they have eight lots left: four in eastern and four in western.\n\nThen, the company sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres to a country club. The deed to the country club has specific restrictions:\n\n1. The property can be used as a country club with golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other appropriate improvements.\n\n2. The property can also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern tract, and the residential part shall be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that conform with those in the eastern tract.\n\n3. The restrictions are covenants running with the land, and for breach, the land-development company can re-enter and terminate the estate.\n\nSo, the country club gets 50 acres with specific uses allowed, including potentially turning part of it into a residential subdivision with similar restrictions to the eastern tract.\n\nThe company retains the remaining 50 acres of the original 400-acre tract. They develop an exclusive shopping center on 25 acres and keep 25 acres.\n\nLater, in February 2001, the company sells the remaining eight residential lots in both the eastern and western tracts.\n\nThen, in March 2001, the land-development company executes an instrument to the country club:\n\n\"The land-development company, for itself, its successors, and assigns, does hereby release, surrender, and quitclaim all rights, title, or other property interest in that certain acres owned by the country club.\"\n\nAt this point, the country club has built a club house, golf course, and tennis courts on part of its land and has 25 acres vacant.\n\nNow, the country club wants to build a new high-rise complex containing a hotel, shopping mall, apartments, etc., on the 25 acres of vacant land.\n\nA homeowner in the western tract sues to enjoin this construction. We need to determine which of the options is most likely to be correct.\n\nOption A: The homeowner will succeed because they can re-enter the land upon breach of a condition subsequent.\n\nOption B: The homeowner will succeed because there's a common development scheme for the entire 400-acre tract, and the country club's proposed complex would be a non-conforming use.\n\nOption C: The homeowner will not succeed because the land-development company's March 2001 instrument abrogated the deed restrictions on the country club's use of its property.\n\nOption D: The homeowner will not succeed because only a homeowner in the eastern tract would have standing to challenge the country club's proposed construction plan.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\nOption A: For this to be correct, there needs to be a condition subsequent in the country club's deed that, if breached, allows re-entry. The deed does have a condition that allows the land-development company to re-enter and terminate the estate upon breach. However, the homeowner is not the original grantor; they are a subsequent purchaser. Typically, only the original grantor or their successors have the right to enforce conditions subsequent. So, it's unlikely that the homeowner has this right. Therefore, Option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: This option suggests that there's a common development scheme for the entire 400-acre tract, and the country club's proposed use is non-conforming. To assess this, we need to see if the entire tract was intended to be developed under a unified plan. The plats for the eastern and western tracts are separate and don't reference each other, but their restrictions are substantially identical. The country club's deed allows specific uses different from the residential subdivisions. It's possible that the entire tract had a master plan, but the problem doesn't explicitly state that. However, the country club's deed allows for residential development similar to the eastern tract, suggesting some consistency. Nonetheless, the country club already has non-residential uses (golf course, club house, etc.), so introducing a high-rise complex might be seen as altering the character of the area. This option seems plausible, but let's consider the others.\n\nOption C: This option claims that the homeowner won't succeed because the March 2001 instrument abrogated the deed restrictions. The instrument is a release, surrender, and quitclaim of all rights, title, or other property interest in the acres owned by the country club. This might be interpreted as the land-development company giving up any interests it had in the country club's property, including the right to enforce restrictions. If the company no longer has any interest or right to enforce restrictions, then the restrictions may be considered abandoned. However, the restrictions are covenants running with the land, which bind subsequent owners. The question is whether the land-development company's act of quitting its interest also abrogates the restrictions. This is a complex issue, but generally, quitting interest doesn't necessarily abrogate the restrictions unless specifically stated. Moreover, other parties, like the homeowners, may have standing to enforce the restrictions. Therefore, Option C might not be correct.\n\nOption D: This option suggests that only a homeowner in the eastern tract would have standing to challenge the country club's proposed construction. The reasoning here is that the country club's deed allows development similar to the eastern tract, so only homeowners in the eastern tract would be affected. However, both the eastern and western tracts are similar in their restrictions, and both are part of the original 400-acre tract. It's possible that homeowners in both tracts have an interest in maintaining the character established by the restrictions. Therefore, Option D seems incorrect.\n\nGiven this analysis, Option B appears to be the most likely correct answer. The homeowner in the western tract can argue that there's a common development scheme for the entire 400-acre tract, and the country club's proposed high-rise complex is a non-conforming use that would detract from the residential character of the subdivisions.\n\nHowever, to ensure completeness, let's consider the relationships and legal principles more deeply.\n\nFirst, the covenants in the plats and deeds for the eastern and western tracts are substantially identical, restricting use to single-family dwellings. The country club's deed allows specific non-residential uses but also permits residential development similar to the eastern tract.\n\nThe question is whether the country club's proposed high-rise complex, which includes a hotel, shopping mall, and apartments, conforms to the permitted uses in their deed.\n\nLooking back at the country club's deed:\n\n1. It can be used as a country club with specific facilities.\n\n2. It can be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern tract, with residential restrictions conforming to those in the eastern tract.\n\n3. Restrictions are covenants running with the land, enforceable by the land-development company.\n\nNow, the high-rise complex includes uses that are neither country club facilities nor single-family residences. Therefore, it doesn't fit within the permitted uses outlined in the deed to the country club.\n\nThe homeowner in the western tract would likely have standing to enforce the restrictions, as they are similarly situated to homeowners in the eastern tract and are bound by similar covenants.\n\nTherefore, the homeowner could argue that the proposed high-rise complex violates the restrictions in the country club's deed and seeks an injunction to prevent its construction.\n\nOption A is less likely because homeowners are not the original grantors and may not have the right to enforce the condition subsequent.\n\nOption C is questionable because quitting interest may not necessarily abrogate the covenants running with the land, which can be enforced by beneficiaries like the homeowners.\n\nOption D is incorrect because both eastern and western tract homeowners are similarly situated and may have standing to enforce the restrictions.\n\nThus, Option B is the most plausible: the homeowner will likely succeed because a common development scheme was established for the entire 400-acre tract, and the country club's proposed complex constitutes a non-conforming use.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
