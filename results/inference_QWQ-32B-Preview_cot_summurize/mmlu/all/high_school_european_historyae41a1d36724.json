                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about John Calvin's writings and see which justification for Protestant reform is being alluded to in these excerpts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each excerpt is saying.\n\nIn the first excerpt, Calvin is talking about sin and its manifestations, like adultery, theft, hatred, and so on. He says these are fruits of sin and that we are deservedly condemned by God for such corruption because God only accepts righteousness, innocence, and purity. This seems to be about the state of human nature and how it falls short of God's standards.\n\nThe second excerpt is a bit more complex. It discusses the covenant of life not being preached equally to all and how there's a diversity in how it's received, which Calvin attributes to God's eternal election and predestination. He mentions that salvation is offered spontaneously to some but not to others, and this raises difficult questions that are only explicable with the right understanding of election and predestination. It seems to be about God's\u9009\u62e9 and how not everyone has access to salvation in the same way.\n\nNow, the question is asking which justification used by Protestant reformers like Calvin is being alluded to in these excerpts. The options are:\n\nA. They believed that their church should not be subordinate to the state.\n\nB. The corruption of the Roman Catholic Church and its leaders meant that reform was needed.\n\nC. Religion was used to challenge the authority of earthly monarchs.\n\nD. The concept that salvation comes from faith alone rather than through good works is supported.\n\nLooking back at the excerpts, none of them directly mention the relationship between church and state or challenging the authority of monarchs. So options A and C seem less likely.\n\nOption B talks about the corruption of the Roman Catholic Church leading to the need for reform. While Calvin was indeed a reformer who critiqued the Catholic Church, the excerpts provided don't directly address church corruption or call for reform based on that. The first excerpt discusses sin and human corruption in general, not specifically church corruption.\n\nOption D mentions salvation by faith alone, which is a key Protestant doctrine known as \"sola fide.\" Let's see if that connects to the excerpts.\n\nIn the first excerpt, Calvin lists various sins and says that we are condemned by God for such corruption, as God only accepts righteousness, innocence, and purity. This could imply that human efforts to be righteous are insufficient, which aligns with the Protestant idea that salvation is by faith alone, not through good works.\n\nIn the second excerpt, Calvin discusses the covenant of life and God's selective offering of salvation, which relates to predestination. Predestination is closely linked to the doctrine of salvation by faith alone, as it emphasizes that salvation is entirely dependent on God's grace and choice, not on human merit or works.\n\nSo, while neither excerpt explicitly states \"salvation by faith alone,\" the themes of human corruption, God's condemnation of sin, and the sovereign choice of God in granting salvation all support the idea that salvation isn't achieved through human works but through God's grace and faith.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: The concept that salvation comes from faith alone rather than through good works is supported.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider why the other options aren't as fitting.\n\nOption A is about the church's independence from the state. While Calvin had views on church governance, this isn't addressed in the provided excerpts.\n\nOption B is about reform due to the corruption of the Catholic Church. Although Calvin was a reformer who criticized the Catholic Church, the excerpts don't specifically mention church corruption; they discuss sin and predestination more generally.\n\nOption C is about using religion to challenge monarchs' authority. Again, this isn't directly addressed in the excerpts, which focus on sin and predestination.\n\nHence, option D seems to be the most appropriate choice based on the content of the excerpts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
