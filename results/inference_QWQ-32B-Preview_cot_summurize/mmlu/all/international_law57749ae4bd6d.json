These acts are considered immune from legal jurisdiction in foreign courts due to the principle of sovereign immunity. This immunity is based on the idea that one sovereign should not interfere with the functions of another.\n\nOption B is correct: An act is jure imperii when undertaken in an official State capacity. This means that when a state acts in its sovereign capacity, performing duties and functions that are inherently governmental, such as declaring war, entering into treaties, or exercising diplomatic functions, these are considered acts jure imperii and are generally immune from foreign legal jurisdiction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while international organizations can perform functions similar to states, the term \"jure imperii\" specifically refers to acts of sovereign states, not international organizations.\n\nOption C is too broad. Not all acts undertaken by state officials are acts jure imperii. State officials can also engage in acts jure gestionis, which are acts performed in a private or commercial capacity, similar to those of private individuals or corporations. These acts may not enjoy sovereign immunity.\n\nOption D is incorrect because acts undertaken by state corporations are generally considered acts jure gestionis, unless the corporation is acting on behalf of the state in a sovereign capacity, which is less common.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: An act is jure imperii when undertaken in an official State capacity."
