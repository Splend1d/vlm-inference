I remember something about segregation in schools.\n\nOption A is Gideon v. Wainwright. I think that was about the right to counsel in criminal cases. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption B is Marbury v. Madison. That's a really old case about the judiciary and judicial review. Doesn't seem related to segregation in education.\n\nOption C is Engel v. Vitale, which was about prayer in public schools. Again, not directly about segregation.\n\nOption D is Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. That rings a bell. I think that's the famous case that overturned Plessy v. Ferguson and declared that segregation in schools was unconstitutional.\n\nLet me think about Plessy v. Ferguson. That was the case that established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, right? And then Brown v. Board came along and said that in education, separate facilities are inherently unequal.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, Brown v. Board of Education was about challenging racial segregation in public schools, and the Supreme Court ruled that segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe quote says, \"Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,\" which matches what I remember about the Brown v. Board decision.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nGideon v. Wainwright is about the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Engel v. Vitale is about the Establishment Clause and school prayer. Marbury v. Madison is about judicial review and the court's power to interpret the Constitution.\n\nNone of those seem to fit with the quote about separate educational facilities.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
