                    "text": "So I'm looking at these two statements and I need to determine if they're true or false. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** If G, H, and K are groups of order 4, at least two of them are isomorphic.\n\nOkay, so I know that there are only a few possible group structures for groups of order 4. Let's think about what groups of order 4 look like.\n\nFirst, there's the cyclic group of order 4, which is Z_4. That's one possibility.\n\nThen, there's the Klein four-group, which is Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2. That's another one.\n\nAre there any other groups of order 4 up to isomorphism? I don't think so. In general, for groups of order p^2 where p is prime, they are either cyclic or isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nSo, for order 4, which is 2^2, the possible groups are Z_4 and Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2.\n\nTherefore, if I have three groups of order 4, G, H, and K, they can only be isomorphic to either Z_4 or Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2.\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle, if I have three groups and only two possible isomorphism classes, at least two of them must be isomorphic.\n\nSo, Statement 1 seems true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n.\n\nHmm, this one is a bit trickier.\n\nFirst, Z_r + Z_s denotes the direct sum of cyclic groups of orders r and s, right? Similarly, Z_m + Z_n is the direct sum of cyclic groups of orders m and n.\n\nSo, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n, what does that imply about the relationships between r, s, m, and n?\n\nI need to recall some properties of subgroups of direct products of cyclic groups.\n\nLet's consider the orders. The order of Z_r + Z_s is r*s, and the order of Z_m + Z_n is m*n.\n\nIf Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n, then the order of Z_r + Z_s must divide the order of Z_m + Z_n, right? So, r*s must divide m*n.\n\nBut the statement says that r divides m and s divides n.\n\nIs that necessarily true?\n\nWell, consider an example. Let's say r=2, s=2, so Z_2 + Z_2.\n\nLet m=4, n=2, so Z_4 + Z_2.\n\nThe order of Z_2 + Z_2 is 4, and the order of Z_4 + Z_2 is 8, which is divisible by 4, so that checks out.\n\nNow, does r=2 divide m=4? Yes.\n\nDoes s=2 divide n=2? Yes.\n\nSo in this case, the statement holds.\n\nBut let's try another example to see if it always holds.\n\nLet r=2, s=2, so Z_2 + Z_2 again.\n\nLet m=2, n=4, so Z_2 + Z_4.\n\nThe order of Z_2 + Z_4 is 8, which is divisible by 4.\n\nDoes r=2 divide m=2? Yes.\n\nDoes s=2 divide n=4? Yes.\n\nAnother example: r=2, s=2; m=4, n=4.\n\nAgain, r divides m and s divides n.\n\nWait, but maybe I need a counterexample where r doesn't divide m or s doesn't divide n, but Z_r + Z_s is still isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n.\n\nLet me try r=2, s=2; m=2, n=2.\n\nThen Z_2 + Z_2 is isomorphic to Z_m + Z_n, and r divides m and s divides n.\n\nStill holds.\n\nWhat if r=2, s=2; m=6, n=6.\n\nThe order of Z_2 + Z_2 is 4, and the order of Z_6 + Z_6 is 36, which is divisible by 4.\n\nDoes r=2 divide m=6? Yes.\n\nDoes s=2 divide n=6? Yes.\n\nStill holds.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat if r=2, s=2; m=4, n=6.\n\nOrder of Z_r + Z_s is 4, order of Z_m + Z_n is 24, which is divisible by 4.\n\nDoes r=2 divide m=4? Yes.\n\nDoes s=2 divide n=6? Yes.\n\nStill holds.\n\nWait, what if r=2, s=2; m=3, n=4.\n\nOrder of Z_r + Z_s is 4, order of Z_m + Z_n is 12, which is divisible by 4.\n\nDoes r=2 divide m=3? No, because 3 is not divisible by 2.\n\nBut s=2 divides n=4.\n\nSo in this case, r=2 does not divide m=3, but s=2 divides n=4.\n\nBut according to the statement, it says \"r divides m and s divides n.\"\n\nBut in this case, r doesn't divide m.\n\nHowever, is Z_2 + Z_2 isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_3 + Z_4?\n\nLet's see what Z_3 + Z_4 looks like.\n\nZ_3 + Z_4 has elements of orders 3 and 4.\n\nBut Z_2 + Z_2 has elements of order 2 only.\n\nSo, can Z_2 + Z_2 be isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_3 + Z_4?\n\nWait, Z_3 + Z_4 is isomorphic to Z_12, since 3 and 4 are coprime.\n\nWait, no, Z_3 + Z_4 is not necessarily isomorphic to Z_12.\n\nActually, Z_m + Z_n is isomorphic to Z_{lcm(m,n)} \u00d7 Z_{gcd(m,n)}.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nActually, Z_m + Z_n is just the direct sum, so its structure depends on m and n.\n\nIn this case, m=3 and n=4, which are coprime, so Z_3 + Z_4 is isomorphic to Z_{12}.\n\nBut Z_{12} has a subgroup of order 4, which is Z_4.\n\nBut Z_4 is cyclic,\u800c Z_2 + Z_2 is not cyclic.\n\nSo, does Z_2 + Z_2 isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_{12}?\n\nWell, Z_{12} has a subgroup Z_4, which is cyclic, but Z_2 + Z_2 is not cyclic.\n\nDoes Z_{12} have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 + Z_2?\n\nLet's see, Z_{12} has elements of order 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nThe subgroup of order 4 is <3>, which is Z_4.\n\nBut Z_4 has an element of order 4, whereas Z_2 + Z_2 does not.\n\nSo, Z_{12} does not have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 + Z_2.\n\nTherefore, in this case, even though r=2 does not divide m=3, and s=2 divides n=4, but Z_2 + Z_2 is not isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_3 + Z_4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that Z_3 + Z_4 is isomorphic to Z_{12}, which doesn't have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 + Z_2.\n\nTherefore, in this case, Z_r + Z_s is not isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n, even though r doesn't divide m.\n\nBut according to the statement, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n.\n\nIn this case, since Z_r + Z_s is not isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n when r doesn't divide m, the statement holds.\n\nWait, but this is confusing.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe the statement is true because if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n, then the orders must divide appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are cases where r doesn't divide m, but s divides n, and Z_r + Z_s is still isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n.\n\nI need to find such a counterexample.\n\nLet's try r=2, s=4; m=4, n=2.\n\nSo, Z_2 + Z_4 has order 8, and Z_4 + Z_2 also has order 8.\n\nSo, Z_2 + Z_4 is isomorphic to Z_4 + Z_2.\n\nTherefore, Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to Z_m + Z_n.\n\nNow, does r=2 divide m=4? Yes.\n\nDoes s=4 divide n=2? No, because 2 does not divide 4.\n\nWait, 4 does not divide 2.\n\nBut in this case, Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to Z_m + Z_n, which means r divides m and s divides n must both hold.\n\nBut in this case, s=4 does not divide n=2, which contradicts the statement.\n\nWait, but according to the statement, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n.\n\nIn this case, Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to Z_m + Z_n, which is a subgroup of itself, so it should satisfy the condition.\n\nBut s=4 does not divide n=2, which would mean the statement is false.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is only considering specific types of subgroups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is false.\n\nLet me check another example.\n\nLet r=2, s=4; m=4, n=4.\n\nThen Z_r + Z_s is Z_2 + Z_4, order 8.\n\nZ_m + Z_n is Z_4 + Z_4, order 16.\n\nDoes Z_2 + Z_4 isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_4 + Z_4?\n\nYes, for example, the subgroup generated by (1,0) and (0,2), which would be isomorphic to Z_4 + Z_2.\n\nWait, but Z_2 + Z_4 is isomorphic to Z_4 + Z_2.\n\nWait, no, Z_2 + Z_4 is isomorphic to Z_4 + Z_2, since direct sum is commutative.\n\nSo, in this case, r=2 divides m=4, and s=4 divides n=4.\n\nSo, both conditions hold.\n\nNo issue here.\n\nAnother example: r=2, s=4; m=4, n=6.\n\nZ_r + Z_s is Z_2 + Z_4, order 8.\n\nZ_m + Z_n is Z_4 + Z_6, order 24.\n\nDoes Z_2 + Z_4 isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_4 + Z_6?\n\nWell, Z_4 + Z_6 is isomorphic to Z_{12} + Z_2, since gcd(4,6)=2.\n\nWait, no, Z_4 + Z_6 is just Z_4 + Z_6.\n\nDoes it have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 + Z_4?\n\nProbably yes, for example, the subgroup generated by (2,0) and (0,3), which would have orders 2 and 4, respectively.\n\nSo, in this case, r=2 divides m=4, and s=4 divides n=6? Wait, 4 does not divide 6.\n\nWait, 4 does not divide 6, but in this subgroup, it seems like Z_2 + Z_4 is a subgroup of Z_4 + Z_6.\n\nSo, in this case, s=4 does not divide n=6, but Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n.\n\nThis contradicts the statement, meaning the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nStatement 1: True\n\nStatement 2: False\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
