                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which sporting event is held annually on Memorial Day weekend. Let me look at the options:\n\nA. Iditarod\n\nB. Kentucky Derby\n\nC. Indianapolis 500\n\nD. Super Bowl\n\nFirst, I should know when Memorial Day is. I think it's the last Monday in May, right? Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, I need to find out which of these events is held on that weekend.\n\nLet me start with the Iditarod. I know that's a sled dog race in Alaska. I'm not sure about the date, but I think it's in March or something. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nNext, the Kentucky Derby. That's a horse race, right? I think it's held in May, but is it on Memorial Day weekend? I'm not sure. Maybe.\n\nThen there's the Indianapolis 500. That's a car race. I believe it's held on Memorial Day weekend, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAnd finally, the Super Bowl. That's the big football game, but I know it's in February, so that can't be it.\n\nWait a minute, the Super Bowl is in February, so option D is definitely not correct.\n\nNow, between Iditarod, Kentucky Derby, and Indianapolis 500, I need to figure out which one is held on Memorial Day weekend.\n\nLet me think about the Iditarod again. I recall that it's a long-distance sled dog race in Alaska, and it's usually in March to take advantage of the snow and ice conditions. So, that doesn't align with Memorial Day in May.\n\nSo, option A is probably not the answer.\n\nNow, the Kentucky Derby. That's the first leg of the Triple Crown in horse racing. I think it's held on the first Saturday in May. Memorial Day is the last Monday in May, so they're not the same weekend. Therefore, option B doesn't seem to fit.\n\nThat leaves the Indianapolis 500. This is a famous automobile race held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. I believe it's traditionally held on Memorial Day or on the Sunday before or after Memorial Day. In fact, I think it's specifically on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.\n\nLet me confirm that. Memorial Day is the last Monday in May, so the weekend surrounding it would include that Sunday. And the Indianapolis 500 is typically held on that Sunday.\n\nSo, option C, the Indianapolis 500, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me quickly recall when some other major sporting events are held.\n\nThe Super Bowl is in February, as I already know.\n\nThe World Series in baseball is in October.\n\nThe NBA Finals are in June.\n\nThe College Football National Championship is in January.\n\nSo, none of those match Memorial Day weekend.\n\nAdditionally, the Tour de France is in cycling, usually in July.\n\nThe Wimbledon tennis championships are in June.\n\nSo, really, among the options given, the Indianapolis 500 is the one that's held on Memorial Day weekend.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
