                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out when Mohenjo-daro developed into a complex urban center. There are four options here, and I need to choose the correct one based on the time periods given. Let's see:\n\nOption A says during the Early Shang Dynasty, from 1,000 to 400 B.P. Hmm, B.P. probably stands for \"Before Present,\" but I think it's more common to see B.C. or B.C.E. for dates before the common era. Anyway, 1,000 to 400 B.P. would be around 1,000 to 400 years ago. But the Shang Dynasty was much earlier than that. I think there might be a mistake here.\n\nOption B mentions the Qin Dynasty, from 3,500 to 3,000 B.P. The Qin Dynasty was around 221 to 206 B.C., which would be roughly 2,200 to 2,000 years ago. So 3,500 to 3,000 B.P. doesn't match that. Maybe B.P. is not in years but in decades or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nOption C is during the Mature Harappan period, from 4,500 to 4,000 B.P. The Harappan civilization, also known as the Indus Valley Civilization, had a Mature period around 2600 to 1900 B.C. So, 4,500 to 4,000 B.P. might correspond to that if B.P. is in years.\n\nOption D is during the Early Harappan period, from 8,500 to 6,000 B.P. The Early Harappan period, or the Early Harappan phase, was around 7000 to 5000 B.C., so 8,500 to 6,000 B.P. could be plausible if B.P. is in years.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused about what B.P. stands for here. Normally, B.P. does stand for \"Before Present,\" but in scientific contexts, \"present\" is often taken as A.D. 1950. So, for example, 1,000 B.P. would be approximately 1,000 years before 1950, which is around A.D. 950. But that doesn't make sense with the options provided.\n\nWait a minute, maybe B.P. here stands for centuries before present. So, 1,000 B.P. would be 100,000 years ago, which is not possible. That can't be it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B.P. is a typo, and it should be B.C. or B.C.E. But then the numbers don't align with standard historical timelines.\n\nLet me look up Mohenjo-daro to get a better sense of when it developed into a complex urban center.\n\nMohenjo-daro is one of the earliest urban settlements in the world, part of the Indus Valley Civilization. It reached its peak around 2600-1900 B.C., which is the Mature Harappan period.\n\nSo, if option C says 4,500 to 4,000 B.P., and assuming B.P. is years before present, with present being 1950, then 4,500 B.P. would be around 2550 B.C., and 4,000 B.P. would be around 2050 B.C. That seems to align pretty well with the Mature Harappan period.\n\nOption D, 8,500 to 6,000 B.P., would correspond to around 6550 B.C. to 4050 B.C., which is the Early Harappan period, also known as the Early Food Producing phase, but that's before Mohenjo-daro developed into an urban center.\n\nOption A and B don't make sense in this context, given the timelines provided don't match the known histories of the Shang and Qin Dynasties.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: during the Mature Harappan period, from 4,500 to 4,000 B.P.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
