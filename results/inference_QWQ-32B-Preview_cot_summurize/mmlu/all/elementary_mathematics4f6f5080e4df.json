                    "text": "So Pat bounces a basketball 25 times in 30 seconds. I need to find out how many times Pat will bounce the ball in 150 seconds. The options are A. 120, B. 125, C. 144, and D. 145. I think I should start by figuring out the rate at which Pat is bouncing the ball.\n\nFirst, I'll find out how many times Pat bounces the ball per second. If Pat bounces 25 times in 30 seconds, then the rate is 25 bounces divided by 30 seconds. So, 25 divided by 30 is... let's see, 25 divided by 30 is the same as 25/30, which simplifies to 5/6. So, Pat bounces the ball at a rate of 5/6 bounces per second.\n\nNow, to find out how many times Pat will bounce the ball in 150 seconds, I need to multiply the rate by the time. So, that's 5/6 bounces per second times 150 seconds. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 5/6 times 150. I can write 150 as 150/1, so it's (5/6) * (150/1) = (5*150)/(6*1) = 750/6. Now, 750 divided by 6 is 125. So, Pat will bounce the ball 125 times in 150 seconds.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 125 is one of them. But wait, the question says \"approximately,\" and there are options like 144 and 145, which are higher. Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me try another approach. If Pat bounces 25 times in 30 seconds, I can find out how many 30-second intervals there are in 150 seconds. So, 150 divided by 30 is 5. That means there are 5 intervals of 30 seconds in 150 seconds.\n\nSince Pat bounces 25 times in each 30-second interval, in 5 intervals, Pat would bounce 25 times multiplied by 5, which is 125 times. Again, I get 125.\n\nHmm, but the options include 144 and 145, which are higher than 125. Maybe I need to consider that Pat might bounce the ball faster over time, but the problem says \"at that rate,\" meaning the rate remains constant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the rate per minute. Since 30 seconds is half a minute, and 150 seconds is 2.5 minutes. But I think that would complicate things unnecessarily, as I already have a consistent rate per second.\n\nLet me check the calculations again. 25 bounces in 30 seconds is 25/30 = 5/6 bounces per second. Then, 5/6 bounces per second times 150 seconds is (5/6)*150 = 750/6 = 125.\n\nIt seems consistent. Maybe the options are misleading, or perhaps there's a trick in the question that I'm missing. But based on the information given and the straightforward calculation, 125 appears to be the correct answer.\n\nI think the answer is B. 125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
