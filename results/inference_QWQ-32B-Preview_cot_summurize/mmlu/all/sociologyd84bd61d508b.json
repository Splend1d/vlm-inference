The options are social stratification, social control, social conflict, and social solidarity. I think it might be social stratification, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I know that social stratification has to do with how society is arranged into different layers or classes based on things like wealth, power, and status. So, if sociologists are studying the structure of these layers, that sounds like social stratification. But the question also mentions people's movement between these layers. Is that part of social stratification too?\n\nI recall that social stratification isn't just about the static arrangement of layers; it also involves social mobility, which is the movement of individuals or groups between these layers. There's upward mobility, where people move to a higher layer, and downward mobility, where they move down. So, that seems to fit.\n\nNow, let's consider the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nSocial control is about how society enforces rules and norms. It's more about maintaining order and compliance with laws and expectations. That doesn't seem directly related to the study of layers and movement between them.\n\nSocial conflict refers to struggles between different groups in society, often over resources or power. While social conflict can affect social stratification and mobility, it's not the same as studying the layers and movement between them.\n\nSocial solidarity is about the bonds and cohesion that hold society together. It's about shared values and cooperation among members of society. Again, while important, it doesn't directly relate to the study of social layers and mobility.\n\nSo, comparing all these, social stratification seems to be the most appropriate answer. It encompasses both the structure of social layers and the movement between them.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check. Is there any other sociological concept that specifically deals with layers and movement between them?\n\nI don't think so. Social stratification is the primary area that looks at social hierarchy and social mobility. Other concepts might intersect with it, but the core study of layers and movement is stratification.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is A. social stratification.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
