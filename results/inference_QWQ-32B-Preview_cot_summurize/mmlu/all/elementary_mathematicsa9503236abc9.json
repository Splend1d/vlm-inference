                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: 48 over 88 equals some number over 11. I need to find that number. The options are 6, 11, 8, and 5. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that \"over\" means division, so 48 over 88 is like 48 divided by 88, and similarly, the unknown number over 11 is that number divided by 11. So, I can write this as an equation:\n\n48 / 88 = ? / 11\n\nI need to find the value of \"?\". To do this, I can cross-multiply. Cross-multiplication is a way to solve proportions, and since this looks like a proportion, it should work.\n\nSo, cross-multiplying means I multiply 48 by 11 and set that equal to 88 times the unknown number.\n\nThat gives me:\n\n48 * 11 = 88 * ?\n\nNow, let's calculate 48 times 11. 48 * 11 is 528.\n\nSo, 528 = 88 * ?\n\nNow, to find \"?\", I need to divide both sides of the equation by 88.\n\n? = 528 / 88\n\nLet's do that division. 88 times 6 is 528, so 528 divided by 88 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the unknown number is 6.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If I plug 6 back into the original proportion:\n\n48 / 88 = 6 / 11\n\nLet's see if these two fractions are equal. I can simplify 48/88 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 8.\n\n48 \u00f7 8 = 6\n\n88 \u00f7 8 = 11\n\nSo, 48/88 simplifies to 6/11, which matches the right side of the equation.\n\nSo, yes, 6 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see what happens if I choose another option, say 8.\n\nIf ? = 8, then 48 / 88 = 8 / 11\n\nSimplifying 48/88 again gives 6/11, which is not equal to 8/11. So, that's not correct.\n\nSimilarly, if ? = 5, then 48 / 88 = 5 / 11\n\nBut 6/11 \u2260 5/11, so that's not right either.\n\nAnd if ? = 11, then 48 / 88 = 11 / 11\n\nWhich simplifies to 6/11 = 1, which is not true because 6/11 is not equal to 1.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought about this in terms of equivalent fractions. I have 48/88 = ?/11, and I know that 88 divided by 11 is 8, so to get from 88 to 11, I divide the denominator by 8. Therefore, I should also divide the numerator by 8 to keep the fractions equal.\n\n48 \u00f7 8 = 6\n\nSo, again, ? = 6.\n\nThat's another way to see it, and it confirms my answer.\n\nSo, the answer is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
