                    "text": "So I've got this question here about distribution strategies, and it's talking about giving exclusive rights to market a good or service within a defined territory, using a very limited number of intermediaries. The options are A. Exclusive, B. Intensive, C. Selective, and D. Direct. I need to pick the one that best fits this description.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these terms means in the context of distribution.\n\nA. Exclusive distribution: This is when a manufacturer selects only one intermediary to handle their products in a particular geographic area. It's all about limiting the number of sellers to maintain control over the market and often to preserve the perceived exclusivity of the product.\n\nB. Intensive distribution: This strategy aims to get the product available everywhere possible, using as many outlets as possible. The goal is maximum accessibility for the consumer.\n\nC. Selective distribution: Here, the manufacturer chooses a select number of dealers in a region, more than exclusive but fewer than intensive. It's a balance between broad market coverage and maintaining some control over how the product is sold.\n\nD. Direct distribution: This involves selling directly to the consumer without any intermediaries, like through the manufacturer's own stores or online platforms.\n\nNow, going back to the question, it mentions \"exclusive rights to market the good or service within a defined 'territory'\", and it specifies \"a very limited number of intermediaries.\" This sounds a lot like exclusive distribution because it's limiting the number of sellers in a specific area.\n\nIntensive distribution would contradict this because it's about having as many intermediaries as possible. Selective distribution allows for a limited number but more than exclusive. Direct distribution doesn't use intermediaries at all.\n\nSo, based on this, option A, Exclusive, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about why the other options don't fit.\n\nIntensive distribution isn't about limiting intermediaries; it's the opposite. Selective distribution does limit the number but not to a single intermediary like exclusive distribution does. Direct distribution removes intermediaries entirely, which isn't the case here since the question mentions \"intermediaries.\"\n\nTherefore, exclusive distribution is the most appropriate choice for a strategy that grants exclusive rights to a limited number of intermediaries in a defined territory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
