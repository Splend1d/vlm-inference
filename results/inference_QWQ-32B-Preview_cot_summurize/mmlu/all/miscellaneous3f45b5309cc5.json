Mini-Me.\n\nHere's a bit more context: Dr. Evil creates Mini-Me as his own miniature version, standing at 6 inches tall. Mini-Me is essentially a younger, smaller replica of Dr. Evil, dressed in a tiny tuxedo and acting as his loyal henchman. The character is known for his comical and often exaggerated mannerisms, which mirror those of Dr. Evil but on a smaller scale."
