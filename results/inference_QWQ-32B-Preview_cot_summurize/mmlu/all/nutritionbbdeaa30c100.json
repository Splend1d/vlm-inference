All of the above\n\nIn the context of food safety, it is essential to ensure that any substance introduced into food or that may come into contact with food does not pose a health risk to consumers. This includes pesticide chemicals, substances migrating from food packaging, and color additives.\n\n1. **Pesticide Chemicals:** Pesticides are used to protect crops from pests, diseases, and weeds. However, residues of these chemicals can remain on or in the food after harvesting. It is crucial to demonstrate that these residues are within safe limits to prevent potential harm to human health. Regulatory agencies set maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides in food to ensure safety.\n\n2. **Substances Migrating from Food Packaging:** Food packaging materials can contain various chemicals, such as plastics, inks, adhesives, and coatings. These materials can potentially migrate into the food, especially under certain conditions like heat, moisture, or long storage times. It is necessary to evaluate and demonstrate that any migrating substances do not pose a risk to consumers. Packaging materials are often regulated to ensure they are \"food safe,\" meaning they do not transfer harmful levels of chemicals to the food.\n\n3. **Color Additives:** Color additives are used in foods to enhance their appearance. These can be synthetic dyes or natural colorants derived from plants or minerals. Before being approved for use in food, color additives must undergo safety evaluations to ensure they do not cause adverse health effects, including allergies, hyperactivity, or carcinogenicity. Regulatory bodies require thorough testing to demonstrate the safety of these additives.\n\nTherefore, the safety of all these substances\u2014pesticide chemicals, substances migrating from food packaging, and color additives\u2014must be demonstrated prior to their introduction into food to\u4fdd\u969c\u98df\u54c1\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5065\u5eb7\u3002"
