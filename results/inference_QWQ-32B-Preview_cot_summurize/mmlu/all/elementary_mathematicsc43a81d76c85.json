That means he has some muffins left, and he wants to put those remaining muffins into boxes, with each box holding 6 muffins. We need to find out how many boxes he will need.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many muffins are left after sending 190 to the hotel. So, I subtract 190 from 232:\n\n232 - 190 = 42 muffins left.\n\nNow, each box holds 6 muffins, so to find out how many boxes are needed, I should divide the remaining muffins by 6:\n\n42 / 6 = 7 boxes.\n\nSo, the equation should represent this process: subtract 190 from 232 and then divide by 6 to find the number of boxes, which is b.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (232 - 190)/6 = b\n\nThat matches what I just did. Subtract 190 from 232 and divide by 6 to get b.\n\nB. (232 + 190) x 6 = b\n\nThis adds 232 and 190, which doesn't make sense in this context, and then multiplies by 6. That's not what we need.\n\nC. (232 - 190) x 6 = b\n\nThis subtracts 190 from 232 and then multiplies by 6, which would give the total number of muffins, not the number of boxes.\n\nD. (232 + 190)/6 = b\n\nThis adds 232 and 190 and then divides by 6, which again doesn't make sense for finding the number of boxes for the remaining muffins.\n\nSo, the correct equation is option A: (232 - 190)/6 = b.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
