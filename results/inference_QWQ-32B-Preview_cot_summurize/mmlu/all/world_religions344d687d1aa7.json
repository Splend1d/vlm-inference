Patanjali.\n\nTo provide some context, Patanjali is an ancient Indian sage who is credited with compiling the Yoga Sutras, a foundational text of classical yoga. This text is a collection of 196 sutras (concise aphorisms) that provide a framework for the practice of yoga, particularly focusing on the path of mental and emotional discipline to achieve spiritual liberation.\n\nThe other options are notable figures in their own rights but are not associated with the Yoga Sutras:\n\n- Madhva: He was a philosopher and the founder of Dvaita Vedanta, a sub-school of Vedanta.\n\n- Ramanuja: He was a philosopher and the key proponent of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, another sub-school of Vedanta.\n\n- Aryabhatta: He was a renowned mathematician and astronomer who lived during the Gupta period in India.\n\nSo, in summary, Patanjali is the author of the Yoga Sutras, making option B the correct choice."
