                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The expression we have is \\((x\\sqrt{x^3})^4\\), and we need to simplify it to find the exponent of \\(x\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's inside the parentheses: \\(x\\sqrt{x^3}\\). I know that \\(\\sqrt{x^3}\\) can be rewritten using exponents. Since the square root is the same as raising to the power of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), I can write \\(\\sqrt{x^3} = x^{3 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = x^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\).\n\nSo, the expression inside the parentheses becomes \\(x \\times x^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\). When multiplying powers with the same base, I add the exponents. Therefore, \\(x^1 \\times x^{\\frac{3}{2}} = x^{1 + \\frac{3}{2}} = x^{\\frac{5}{2}}\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((x^{\\frac{5}{2}})^4\\). When raising a power to another power, I multiply the exponents. So, \\(x^{\\frac{5}{2} \\times 4} = x^{10}\\).\n\nTherefore, the exponent of \\(x\\) is 10.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the original expression \\((x\\sqrt{x^3})^4\\). Let's try to simplify inside the parentheses differently.\n\nI know that \\(x^3\\) can be written as \\(x^2 \\times x\\), so \\(\\sqrt{x^3} = \\sqrt{x^2 \\times x} = \\sqrt{x^2} \\times \\sqrt{x} = x \\times x^{\\frac{1}{2}} = x^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\). So, again, \\(x \\times x^{\\frac{3}{2}} = x^{\\frac{5}{2}}\\), and raising to the 4th power gives \\(x^{10}\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of exponents from the beginning.\n\nStarting with \\(x\\sqrt{x^3}\\), I can write this as \\(x \\times (x^3)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\). Simplifying the exponent inside the parentheses first: \\((x^3)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = x^{3 \\times \\frac{1}{2}} = x^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\). Then, multiplying by \\(x\\): \\(x^1 \\times x^{\\frac{3}{2}} = x^{1 + \\frac{3}{2}} = x^{\\frac{5}{2}}\\). Raising to the 4th power: \\((x^{\\frac{5}{2}})^4 = x^{\\frac{5}{2} \\times 4} = x^{10}\\).\n\nAnother way: maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\(x^4 \\times (\\sqrt{x^3})^4\\).\n\nFirst, \\(x^4\\) is straightforward. Now, \\((\\sqrt{x^3})^4\\). Since \\(\\sqrt{x^3} = x^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\), then \\((x^{\\frac{3}{2}})^4 = x^{\\frac{3}{2} \\times 4} = x^6\\).\n\nSo, the expression becomes \\(x^4 \\times x^6 = x^{4+6} = x^{10}\\).\n\nYet another confirmation. No matter which way I approach this, I end up with \\(x^{10}\\).\n\nI think it's clear now that the exponent of \\(x\\) is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
