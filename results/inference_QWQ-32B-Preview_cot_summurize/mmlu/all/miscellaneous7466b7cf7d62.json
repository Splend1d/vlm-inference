Saturn.\n\nTo provide some additional information, Saturn has a large number of moons, with 82 known moons as of now. Out of these, 53 are named. Some of the most well-known moons of Saturn include Titan, which is the largest and the only moon with a substantial atmosphere, and Enceladus, which has geysers erupting from its south pole.\n\nPhoebe is an irregular moon of Saturn, meaning its orbit is not aligned with Saturn's equatorial plane. It's also retrograde, meaning it orbits in the opposite direction to Saturn's rotation. Dione is one of Saturn's larger moons and has a dense, icy surface. Helene is a small moon that shares an orbit with another moon called Dione; it's located at one of Dione's Lagrangian points.\n\nSo, all these moons are part of Saturn's fascinating system of natural satellites.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
