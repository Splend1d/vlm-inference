So, the options are:\n\nA. is harmful to many clients\n\nB. allows the therapist to control the client\u2019s behavior\n\nC. can be terminated by the client\n\nD. works better with less intelligent clients\n\nFirst, I need to understand what hypnotic induction is. From what I know, hypnosis is a trance state where a person is highly suggestible. Induction is the process that leads someone into that trance.\n\nOption A says it's harmful to many clients. I've heard mixed things about hypnosis. Some people think it's dangerous, but in reality, when performed by a trained professional, hypnosis is generally considered safe. In fact, it's often used therapeutically to help with issues like anxiety, pain management, and habit control. So, I don't think A is the most accurate statement.\n\nOption B says it allows the therapist to control the client\u2019s behavior. That's a common misconception about hypnosis. In reality, the person undergoing hypnosis is always in control. They can't be made to do something against their will or ethics. The therapist guides the process, but the client is actively participating. So, B seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says it can be terminated by the client. That makes sense because, as I recall, one of the principles of hypnosis is that the participant can come out of the trance at any time if they choose to. So, this seems like a plausible answer.\n\nOption D says it works better with less intelligent clients. That's completely untrue and offensive. Hypnotic inductions can work with people of all intelligence levels. In fact, some research suggests that people who are more open to imagination and suggestion might be more easily hypnotized, but that has nothing to do with intelligence.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems to be the most accurate statement about hypnotic induction. It emphasizes the client's autonomy and control over their own hypnosis experience.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
