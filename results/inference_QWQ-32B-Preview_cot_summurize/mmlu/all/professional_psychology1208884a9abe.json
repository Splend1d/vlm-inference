The options are:\n\nA. adults with visual impairments.\n\nB. children under the age of two.\n\nC. children with hearing impairments.\n\nD. adults who are mentally retarded.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Leiter International Performance Scale is. I recall that it's a nonverbal intelligence test, which means it doesn't rely on spoken or written language. That makes it useful for assessing people who may have difficulties with speech, hearing, or other communication issues.\n\nOption A is about adults with visual impairments. Since the Leiter scale is nonverbal, it might still be usable, but I need to consider if it has components that require visual skills. I think it primarily uses visual-spatial tasks, so visual impairments could be a barrier.\n\nOption B is children under the age of two. That seems young; I wonder if the Leiter scale is designed for such young children. I think most intelligence tests are geared towards older children and adults.\n\nOption C is children with hearing impairments. Given that the Leiter scale is nonverbal, it shouldn't have a language bias, making it suitable for children who can't hear or have difficulties with spoken language.\n\nOption D is adults who are mentally retarded. I need to be careful with terminology here; \"mentally retarded\" is outdated and offensive. The more appropriate term is \"intellectually disabled.\" Anyway, since the Leiter scale is nonverbal, it might be useful for assessing intelligence in individuals who have difficulties with verbal communication due to their intellectual disability.\n\nNow, considering all options, I think the Leiter International Performance Scale would be most useful for measuring the intelligence of children with hearing impairments (Option C). It's designed to be nonverbal, which aligns well with the needs of children who have hearing impairments and may not develop typical language skills.\n\nBut let me double-check. For adults with visual impairments (Option A), the test might not be as effective if it relies heavily on visual stimuli. For children under two (Option B), I'm not sure if the Leiter scale is appropriate; maybe there are other developmental assessments better suited for that age group. And for adults with intellectual disabilities (Option D), while the Leiter scale could be useful, I think children with hearing impairments (Option C) would benefit the most from a nonverbal intelligence test.\n\nYes, I think C is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
