                    "text": "The times-interest-earned (TIE) ratio is a measure of a company's ability to meet its debt obligations. It is calculated by dividing earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by the interest expense. The higher the ratio, the more times a company can cover its interest expenses with its earnings.\n\nGiven the following information:\n\n- Income after tax: $5.4 million\n\n- Interest expense: $1 million\n\n- Depreciation expense: $1 million\n\n- Tax rate: 40%\n\nFirst, we need to find the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). To do this, we need to work backwards from the income after tax.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Income before tax (IBT) as the earnings before tax but after interest and depreciation.\n\n- EBIT as earnings before interest and taxes.\n\nWe know that income after tax (IAT) is calculated as:\n\n\\[ IAT = IBT - Tax \\]\n\nGiven that tax is 40% of IBT:\n\n\\[ Tax = 0.4 \\times IBT \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ IAT = IBT - 0.4 \\times IBT = 0.6 \\times IBT \\]\n\nGiven IAT is $5.4 million:\n\n\\[ 5.4 = 0.6 \\times IBT \\]\n\nSolving for IBT:\n\n\\[ IBT = \\frac{5.4}{0.6} = 9 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nNow, IBT is the earnings before tax but after interest and depreciation. So, to find EBIT, we need to add back the interest expense and depreciation expense to IBT.\n\n\\[ EBIT = IBT + \\text{Interest expense} + \\text{Depreciation expense} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ EBIT = 9 + 1 + 1 = 11 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nNow, the times-interest-earned ratio is:\n\n\\[ TIE = \\frac{EBIT}{\\text{Interest expense}} = \\frac{11}{1} = 11 \\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the provided options (5.4, 6.4, 7.4, 10). It seems there might be a mistake in the approach.\n\nLet me reconsider the calculation of EBIT.\n\nAlternatively, we can find EBIT by starting from income after tax and working upwards.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ IAT = 5.4 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nTax rate is 40%, so the tax paid is:\n\n\\[ Tax = IAT / (1 - \\text{tax rate}) - IAT \\]\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to find the earnings before tax (IBT).\n\nSince tax is 40% of IBT:\n\n\\[ Tax = 0.4 \\times IBT \\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[ IAT = IBT - Tax = IBT - 0.4 \\times IBT = 0.6 \\times IBT \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ IBT = \\frac{IAT}{0.6} = \\frac{5.4}{0.6} = 9 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nNow, IBT is earnings before tax but after interest and depreciation.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ IBT = EBIT - \\text{Interest expense} - \\text{Depreciation expense} \\]\n\nWait, no. Actually, EBIT is earnings before interest and taxes, so:\n\n\\[ EBIT = IBT + \\text{Interest expense} \\]\n\nBecause IBT is earnings before tax but after interest.\n\nDepreciation is already included in IBT, as it is an expense that reduces IBT.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall the exact relationships.\n\nLet's consider the income statement structure:\n\n1. Sales revenue\n\n2. minus Cost of goods sold = Gross profit\n\n3. minus Operating expenses (including depreciation) = Operating income (EBIT)\n\n4. minus Interest expense = Earnings before tax (IBT)\n\n5. minus Taxes = Net income (income after tax)\n\nSo, EBIT is operating income, before interest and taxes.\n\nGiven that, we have:\n\n\\[ IBT = EBIT - \\text{Interest expense} \\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[ \\text{Net income} = IBT - \\text{Taxes} \\]\n\nGiven net income is $5.4 million, interest expense is $1 million, depreciation is $1 million, and tax rate is 40%.\n\nLet me try to find EBIT step by step.\n\nFirst, find IBT.\n\nSince net income is after tax, and tax is 40% of IBT:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net income} = IBT - \\text{Taxes} = IBT - 0.4 \\times IBT = 0.6 \\times IBT \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ IBT = \\frac{\\text{Net income}}{0.6} = \\frac{5.4}{0.6} = 9 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nNow, IBT = EBIT - Interest expense\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ EBIT = IBT + \\text{Interest expense} = 9 + 1 = 10 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nTherefore, the TIE ratio is:\n\n\\[ TIE = \\frac{EBIT}{\\text{Interest expense}} = \\frac{10}{1} = 10 \\]\n\nLooking back at the options, 10 is option D.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 11, but that was incorrect.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Net income (after tax): $5.4 million\n\n- Interest expense: $1 million\n\n- Depreciation: $1 million\n\n- Tax rate: 40%\n\nFirst, find IBT:\n\n\\[ IBT = \\frac{\\text{Net income}}{1 - \\text{tax rate}} = \\frac{5.4}{0.6} = 9 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nThen, EBIT:\n\n\\[ EBIT = IBT + \\text{Interest expense} = 9 + 1 = 10 \\text{ million} \\]\n\nSo, TIE:\n\n\\[ TIE = \\frac{EBIT}{\\text{Interest expense}} = \\frac{10}{1} = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 10.\n\nHowever, the initial approach led to 11, which was incorrect. The mistake was in adding back depreciation to IBT when calculating EBIT, which is not necessary because depreciation is already included in IBT.\n\nHence, the correct TIE ratio is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
