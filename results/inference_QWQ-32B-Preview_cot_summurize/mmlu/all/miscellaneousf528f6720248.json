                    "text": "Let's see here. I'm trying to figure out which degrees can be awarded by the local chapter of the FFA. So, there are four degrees listed: Greenhand FFA Degree, Chapter FFA Degree, State FFA Degree, and American FFA Degree. And the options are A. I only, B. II only, C. I and II only, or D. all of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about the FFA degrees. I think the FFA has a degree program that recognizes members' achievements and their progression through the organization. I believe there are different levels of degrees that members can earn as they advance.\n\nStarting with the Greenhand FFA Degree, I think this is the first degree that new members earn after completing certain requirements. It's kind of like an\u5165\u95e8 degree, showing that they've met the basic criteria to be part of the FFA.\n\nNext is the Chapter FFA Degree. I think this is awarded to members who have progressed beyond the greenhand level and have completed more advanced activities and achievements at the chapter level.\n\nThen there's the State FFA Degree. From what I remember, this is a higher level of achievement, and it's awarded based on evaluations at the state level. Maybe members have to submit projects or demonstrate their skills at the state FFA convention or something like that.\n\nFinally, the American FFA Degree is, I believe, the highest degree that can be earned in the FFA. It's awarded to members who have shown outstanding achievement and leadership not only at the local and state levels but also nationally.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these degrees can be awarded by the local chapter of the FFA. So, I need to think about which degrees are awarded directly by the local chapter and which ones might require higher-level evaluations.\n\nI think the Greenhand and Chapter degrees are awarded at the local level. The local chapter would be responsible for evaluating whether a member has met the requirements for these degrees and then awarding them accordingly.\n\nOn the other hand, the State and American degrees probably involve evaluations beyond the local level. For the State degree, there might be a review process at the state FFA level, and for the American degree, it's likely that national FFA officials are involved in the evaluation and approval process.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I would say that only the Greenhand and Chapter degrees are awarded by the local chapter. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. I and II only.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the local chapter has some role in recommending or nominating members for the State and American degrees, but I don't think they have the authority to award those degrees directly.\n\nI recall that for higher degrees, there's a submission process where local chapters nominate their members, and then those nominations are reviewed at the state and national levels before the degrees are awarded.\n\nSo, yes, I think C. I and II only is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
