The options are St. Augustine, Florida; Plymouth, Massachusetts; Newport News, Virginia; and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nFirst, I know that Plymouth is where the Pilgrims landed in 1620, right? That's the story I learned in school about the Mayflower and the first Thanksgiving. So, that sounds pretty old.\n\nBut then there's St. Augustine, Florida. I've heard that before, that it's one of the oldest cities in the U.S. I think it was founded by the Spanish. When was that? I'm not exactly sure, but I think it was in the 1500s or something.\n\nNewport News, Virginia, hmm. I know that's in Virginia, and Virginia has a lot of history, like Jamestown, which I think was founded in 1607. Is Newport News older than Plymouth? I'm not sure.\n\nAnd Charlotte, North Carolina, that seems like a much newer city, probably not as old as the others.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up when each of these settlements was founded.\n\nSt. Augustine: According to my research, St. Augustine was founded in 1565 by the Spanish. That would make it older than Plymouth, which was founded in 1620.\n\nJamestown, Virginia, was founded in 1607, which is earlier than Plymouth but later than St. Augustine.\n\nNewport News, Virginia, was established in the early 17th century, but I need to check the exact date.\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina, was founded in 1768, which is much later compared to the others.\n\nSo, St. Augustine is the oldest, founded in 1565, followed by Jamestown in 1607, and then Plymouth in 1620.\n\nBut let me make sure that St. Augustine is still considered a permanent settlement. I think it has been continuously inhabited since its founding, despite challenges like attacks and changes in colonial power.\n\nAlso, I should consider that although Jamestown was founded in 1607, which is earlier than Plymouth, St. Augustine is even older.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is St. Augustine, Florida.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's double-check the founding dates.\n\nSt. Augustine: 1565\n\nJamestown: 1607\n\nPlymouth: 1620\n\nNewport News: established in 1882, actually, which is much later.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I have the wrong year for Newport News. Let me check again.\n\nNewport News was incorporated in 1896, but the area was settled much earlier, in the 17th century. But even so, its official founding is much later than St. Augustine and Jamestown.\n\nSo, definitely, St. Augustine is the oldest permanent European settlement in the United States.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. St. Augustine, Florida.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
