                    "text": "Let's think about this problem step by step. We have an ideal gas that's expanding isothermally, and we need to figure out which statement is true among the options given.\n\nFirst, let's recall what an isothermal process is. Isothermal means \"constant temperature.\" So, in this process, the temperature of the gas remains constant.\n\nNow, we know from thermodynamics that for any process involving an ideal gas, the change in internal energy (\u0394E) is related to the heat added to the system (q) and the work done by the system (w) through the equation:\n\n\u0394E = q + w\n\nThis is just a statement of the first law of thermodynamics.\n\nSince the process is isothermal and we're dealing with an ideal gas, we also know that the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature. Because the temperature is constant in an isothermal process, the change in internal energy (\u0394E) should be zero.\n\nSo, \u0394E = 0\n\nThat means:\n\n0 = q + w\n\nFrom this, we can see that q = -w\n\nSo, the heat added to the system is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the work done by the system.\n\nLet's look at the options again:\n\nA. q = 0\n\nB. w = 0\n\nC. E = 0\n\nD. q = -w\n\nOption C says E = 0, but I think it should be \u0394E = 0. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant the change in internal energy is zero. In any case, \u0394E = 0 is true for an isothermal process for an ideal gas.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for which one of the following is true, and option D says q = -w, which we've derived from \u0394E = 0.\n\nLet's double-check if there's any other consideration.\n\nIn an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, the gas is expanding, so it's doing work on the surroundings. That means w is negative (since work is done by the system).\n\nTo maintain a constant temperature, heat must be added to the system to compensate for the work done. So, q is positive.\n\nTherefore, q = -w makes sense because the heat added is equal to the work done by the system.\n\nOption A says q = 0, which would imply that no heat is added or removed, but in an isothermal expansion, heat must be added to keep the temperature constant, so q \u2260 0.\n\nOption B says w = 0, but in an expansion, work is being done, so w \u2260 0.\n\nOption C, assuming it means \u0394E = 0, is true, but the question might be looking for the relationship between q and w.\n\nOption D says q = -w, which matches what we've derived.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. q = -w\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
