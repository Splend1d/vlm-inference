                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this question about Bandura's social learning theory, specifically regarding self-reinforcement. The question is:\n\n\"In Bandura's social learning theory, the concept of self-reinforcement is critical for explaining how, in the absence of external rewards, [options]\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. socially appropriate behavior can be learned in the absence of models\n\nB. rival responses are acquired\n\nC. learned behavior is maintained over time\n\nD. children can overcome the negative effects of poor models\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to recall what Bandura's social learning theory is all about. I remember that Albert Bandura proposed that people learn behaviors by observing others, which are called models. So, it's not just about trial and error or direct reinforcement; it's also about imitating what we see others do.\n\nNow, the key term here is \"self-reinforcement.\" That sounds like when someone reinforces their own behavior, maybe by giving themselves praise or some internal reward, even if there's no external reward.\n\nSo, the question is asking how self-reinforcement explains what happens when there are no external rewards. What persists or continues in the absence of external reinforcement?\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nOption A says: \"socially appropriate behavior can be learned in the absence of models.\"\n\nWait, but Bandura's theory emphasizes the importance of models for learning behavior. So, if there are no models, how would one learn socially appropriate behavior? That seems contradictory to his theory. Maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nOption B: \"rival responses are acquired.\"\n\nI'm not sure what \"rival responses\" means in this context. Maybe it's about competing behaviors, but that doesn't seem directly related to self-reinforcement.\n\nOption C: \"learned behavior is maintained over time.\"\n\nThis seems plausible. If there are no external rewards, but an individual still continues to perform a behavior because they reinforce themselves internally, that would maintain the behavior over time.\n\nOption D: \"children can overcome the negative effects of poor models.\"\n\nHmm, so if there are poor models, but children use self-reinforcement to avoid imitating those negative behaviors, that could be a possibility.\n\nWait, but the question is about the absence of external rewards, not the absence of models. So, options A and D seem a bit off because they talk about absence of models or overcoming poor models, whereas the question is specifically about the absence of external rewards.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is the best fit: learned behavior is maintained over time in the absence of external rewards due to self-reinforcement.\n\nLet me think about this some more. In Bandura's social learning theory, there's the concept of reinforcement, which can be external or internal. External reinforcement comes from the environment, like rewards or punishments, while self-reinforcement is internal; it's when an individual rewards themselves for their behavior.\n\nSo, if there are no external rewards, but an individual still continues to perform a behavior because they feel good about it or they give themselves praise, that would be self-reinforcement maintaining the behavior.\n\nOption A suggests that behavior can be learned without models, but Bandura's theory actually stresses the importance of models for learning. So, that doesn't align with his theory.\n\nOption B is unclear to me. I don't recall any specific concept in Bandura's theory about \"rival responses.\"\n\nOption D is about overcoming negative effects of poor models, which might relate more to the concept of selective attention or discrimination in modeling, but not directly to self-reinforcement.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the most logical choice: learned behavior is maintained over time in the absence of external rewards due to self-reinforcement.\n\nTo double-check, maybe I should look back at some key points of Bandura's social learning theory.\n\nBandura proposed that learning occurs through observation and imitation of models. He introduced the concept of vicarious reinforcement, where observing a model being reinforced can influence one's own behavior.\n\nAdditionally, he discussed self-efficacy, which is belief in one's ability to perform a behavior, and self-regulation, which involves self-set standards and self-reinforcement.\n\nSelf-reinforcement is indeed a part of self-regulation, where individuals monitor their own behavior and provide reinforcement to themselves based on their performance.\n\nSo, in the absence of external rewards, self-reinforcement can keep behaviors going, especially if those behaviors align with an individual's internal standards or goals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: learned behavior is maintained over time.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider whether option D could be correct.\n\nOption D says: \"children can overcome the negative effects of poor models.\"\n\nWell, if children have strong self-reinforcement mechanisms, they might be less likely to imitate poor models, but Bandura's theory also suggests that children can learn from poor models if those models are reinforced, even if the reinforcement is inappropriate.\n\nMoreover, the question is specifically about the absence of external rewards, not about the presence of poor models.\n\nSo, I think option C is indeed the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
