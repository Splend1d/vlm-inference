                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about Feinberg's view on moral education. The question is: \"According to Feinberg, a good moral education:\n\nA. will make no use of pleasure or pain as sanctions.\n\nB. will be based entirely on the use of pleasure and pain as sanctions.\n\nC. will produce someone who does the right thing out of deference to authority.\n\nD. will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Feinberg said about moral education. I think he discussed different approaches to moral education and their effectiveness in fostering genuine moral behavior.\n\nOption A suggests that a good moral education won't use pleasure or pain as sanctions. But I feel like Feinberg might not entirely dismiss the use of rewards and punishments in moral education. Maybe he thinks they have a role but aren't the whole story.\n\nOption B says it should be entirely based on pleasure and pain as sanctions. That sounds too simplistic. Moral education probably involves more than just doling out rewards and punishments.\n\nOption C mentions producing someone who does the right thing out of deference to authority. That seems like obedience rather than genuine moral reasoning. Maybe Feinberg would see that as insufficient for a good moral education.\n\nOption D is about producing someone who does the right thing simply because it is right. That sounds like acting from a sense of moral principle or understanding. I think this aligns with what Feinberg might consider a desirable outcome of moral education.\n\nLet me think back to what I've read about Feinberg. I remember he critiqued various theories of punishment and morality. In the context of moral education, he might prefer an approach that fosters internalized moral values rather than external compliance through rewards and punishments.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I'd go with option D: a good moral education will produce someone who does the right thing simply because it is right. This seems to emphasize intrinsic motivation and moral understanding over external sanctions or authority.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider each option again.\n\nOption A: no use of pleasure or pain as sanctions. That seems too extreme. Even if Feinberg thinks that over-reliance on sanctions is problematic, completely avoiding them might not be practical.\n\nOption B: entirely based on pleasure and pain as sanctions. That sounds like behaviorism, which might not capture the complexity of moral development.\n\nOption C: deference to authority. While respecting authority can be important, it's not the same as having one's own moral judgment.\n\nOption D: doing the right thing because it is right. This seems to align with acting from moral principle, which I think Feinberg would endorse.\n\nI think I'll stick with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
