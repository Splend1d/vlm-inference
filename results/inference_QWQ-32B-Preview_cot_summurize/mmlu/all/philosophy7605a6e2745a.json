The options are:\n\nA. will always consist of a single answer.\n\nB. might sometimes turn out to be a disjunction.\n\nC. is necessarily relative to a culture.\n\nD. can be settled in such a way as to be no longer revisable.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Nussbaum's perspective is on virtues. I know that Nussbaum is a philosopher who has written extensively on ethics, political philosophy, and feminism. She is known for her work on capabilities approach, which is a theoretical framework that evaluates the quality of life in terms of people's abilities to do and be what they have reason to value.\n\nIn the context of virtues, Nussbaum likely discusses what virtues are essential for a good life and a just society. She probably argues that certain virtues are universal, meaning they are valuable across different cultures and times, while also acknowledging that their specific manifestations might vary depending on cultural contexts.\n\nOption A says that the specification of particular virtues will always consist of a single answer. This seems too rigid for Nussbaum's approach. She likely recognizes that there can be multiple interpretations and expressions of virtues, so probably not A.\n\nOption B suggests that the specification might sometimes turn out to be a disjunction, meaning that there could be multiple acceptable options or variations. This seems more aligned with Nussbaum's emphasis on pluralism and the idea that different paths can lead to a good life.\n\nOption C states that the specification is necessarily relative to a culture. While Nussbaum acknowledges cultural differences, she also argues for certain universal human capabilities that should be upheld across cultures. So, while culture plays a role, it's not necessarily relative in the sense that anything goes within a culture.\n\nOption D suggests that virtues can be settled in a way that is no longer revisable, which seems contrary to Nussbaum's approach. She likely believes in the importance of ongoing reflection and revision of moral beliefs in light of new experiences and arguments.\n\nGiven this, option B seems the most fitting. Nussbaum might argue that the specification of particular virtues could sometimes be a disjunction, allowing for multiple acceptable forms or expressions of those virtues.\n\nBut to be sure, I should think about specific examples or references from Nussbaum's work. For instance, in her book \"Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach,\" she discusses central human capabilities that are universal but also acknowledges that their realization can take different forms in different societies.\n\nMoreover, Nussbaum is critical of ethical theories that provide only one model of the good life, arguing instead for a pluralistic approach that recognizes diverse ways to achieve a good life.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that she would claim that the specification of particular virtues might sometimes turn out to be a disjunction, allowing for multiple acceptable forms.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
