                    "text": "So I've got this property law question here, and I need to figure out who owns the vacant lot based on the conveyance that happened in 1960. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the shopkeeper owned the vacant lot in fee simple absolute, which means he had complete ownership over it. Then, in 1960, he conveyed the property by general warranty deed to his friend with a condition: \"but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25.\"\n\nOkay, so this sounds like a conditional conveyance. The friend gets the property unless it's used for church purposes, in which case it goes to the children of the shopkeeper's sister who reach age 25.\n\nNow, the sister was single at the time of the conveyance, but later she married and had two sons. Unfortunately, one of the sons died in an automobile accident. Then, three years after that son's death, the sister had a daughter.\n\nThe question is asking about the current ownership rights of the vacant lot, with all minors represented.\n\nLet's consider the possible answers:\n\nA. The friend only.\n\nB. The friend, the son, and the daughter.\n\nC. The friend, the son, the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born during her lifetime.\n\nD. The friend, the son, the daughter, and any additional children of the sister born within 21 years after the death of the deceased son.\n\nHmm.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the condition attached to the conveyance. The property goes to the children of the sister who reach age 25 if it's used for church purposes. Otherwise, it goes to the friend.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify whether the property has been used for church purposes or not. Hmm, that's interesting. Maybe it's assumed that the condition hasn't been triggered, so the friend still owns it.\n\nBut let's look at the options. Option A says the friend only. That could be possible if the condition hasn't been triggered.\n\nOption B says the friend, the son, and the daughter. Wait, why would the son and daughter be included if the condition hasn't been triggered?\n\nOption C includes any additional children born during the sister's lifetime.\n\nOption D includes any additional children born within 21 years after the death of the deceased son.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the possibility that the condition could be triggered in the future. So, even if it hasn't been triggered yet, the potential remainder interest might be held by the sister's children.\n\nLet me think about this in terms of future interests. The friend has a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and the sister's children have a contingent remainder that could vest if the condition is met.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a shifting executory interest to the sister's children if the property is used for church purposes.\n\nWait, in property law, an executory interest is a future interest that cuts short the preceding estate. So, if the property is used for church purposes, the friend's estate would terminate, and the interest would shift to the sister's children.\n\nAssuming the condition hasn't been triggered, the friend owns the property now. But the sister's children have a possibility of reverter or some future interest if the condition is met.\n\nBut the question is about current ownership rights, assuming all minors are represented.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the friend owns it now, but the sister's children have some future interest.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A says the friend only, which might be correct if the condition hasn't been triggered.\n\nBut options B, C, and D include the friend and the sister's children, which suggests that maybe they have some joint ownership or that their interests are being considered concurrently.\n\nWait, perhaps the conveyance created a life estate or some other type of estate for the friend, with a remainder to the sister's children.\n\nBut the language says \"to my friend, but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25.\"\n\nThis sounds more like a condition that, if met, transfers the property to the sister's children.\n\nSo, if the condition isn't met, the friend owns it. If the condition is met, then the sister's children who have reached age 25 get it.\n\nBut the question is about current ownership, assuming the condition hasn't been triggered.\n\nTherefore, the friend owns it now.\n\nBut the options also include the sister's children, which is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe there's a possibility that the sister's children have some future interest, even if the condition hasn't been triggered yet.\n\nLet me consider the status of the sister's children.\n\nThe sister had two sons and later a daughter after one son died.\n\nSo, currently, there is one son and one daughter, assuming the other son died without issue.\n\nBut the daughter is younger, as she was born three years after the deceased son's death.\n\nThe condition is that the property goes to the children of the sister who reach age 25.\n\nSo, the sister's children have a future interest that could vest if the condition is met.\n\nBut in terms of current ownership, it's the friend who owns the property, assuming the condition hasn't been triggered.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct: the friend only.\n\nBut let's consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption B includes the friend, the son, and the daughter. Maybe the son and daughter have some remainder interest, but given that the condition hasn't been triggered, perhaps they don't have any current ownership interest.\n\nOption C includes any additional children born during the sister's lifetime. But if the condition hasn't been triggered, why would future children have any interest now?\n\nOption D limits additional children to those born within 21 years of the deceased son's death. That seems arbitrary unless there's some rule in property law about the duration of executory interests.\n\nWait, in property law, there is the Rule against Perpetuities, which says that any interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years after some life in being at the time of creation of the interest.\n\nHere, the interest to the sister's children is contingent on them reaching age 25, and the condition of the property being used for church purposes.\n\nSo, applying the Rule against Perpetuities, the interest must vest within 21 years of someone alive in 1960.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps the interest to the sister's children is valid only if they are alive within 21 years of 1960.\n\nGiven that, any children born after a certain point might not have a valid interest.\n\nBut the question states that all minors are represented, which suggests that even if they are minors now, their interests are being considered.\n\nWait, the question doesn't specify whether the condition has been triggered or not. Maybe I should consider both possibilities.\n\nIf the condition hasn't been triggered, then the friend owns the property outright, and the sister's children have no current interest.\n\nIf the condition has been triggered, then the property goes to the sister's children who have reached age 25.\n\nBut the question is about current ownership rights, with all minors represented.\n\nPerhaps it's assuming that the condition could be triggered in the future, so it's considering both possibilities.\n\nBut I still think that, currently, the friend owns the property, and the sister's children have a future interest that may or may not vest depending on whether the condition is met.\n\nTherefore, the current ownership is in the friend only, which is option A.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because the other options include the sister's children.\n\nMaybe there's something I'm missing about the nature of their interest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conveyance to the friend is defeasible, meaning it can be defeated if the condition is met, and the sister's children have a contingent remainder that could become possessory if the condition is met.\n\nIn that case, the friend has a defeasible fee, and the sister's children have a contingent remainder.\n\nBut in terms of current ownership, it's still the friend who owns it, assuming the condition hasn't been triggered.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the sister's children have some future interest, perhaps their interests need to be considered in the current ownership rights.\n\nBut I think that would be too speculative, as their interest is contingent on the condition being met.\n\nMoreover, only those who reach age 25 would have an interest, which adds another layer of contingency.\n\nGiven all this, I think the safest answer is option A: the friend only.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the status of the sister's children.\n\nThe sister had two sons and later a daughter.\n\nOne son died, but his potential issue isn't mentioned.\n\nIf the deceased son had children, they might have inherited his interest, if any.\n\nBut according to the conveyance, it's to the children of the sister who reach age 25.\n\nSo, it's specifically the sister's children, not their issue.\n\nTherefore, the deceased son's children wouldn't have any interest, unless the conveyance specifies otherwise.\n\nBut it doesn't, so presumably, only the sister's direct children are entitled.\n\nTherefore, the sister's surviving son and daughter would have interests if the condition is met and they reach age 25.\n\nBut again, that's a future contingency.\n\nTherefore, in terms of current ownership, it's the friend only.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. the friend only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
