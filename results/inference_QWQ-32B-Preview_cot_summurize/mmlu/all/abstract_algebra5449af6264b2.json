The options are A. 0, B. 1, C. 0,1, D. 2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Z\u2082 is. Z\u2082 is the finite field with two elements, 0 and 1, under modulo 2 arithmetic. That means every operation is done modulo 2.\n\nSo, the polynomial is x\u00b2 + 1, and I need to find its zeros in Z\u2082. A zero of the polynomial is a value of x in Z\u2082 that makes the polynomial equal to zero.\n\nLet's test each element of Z\u2082 in the polynomial.\n\nFirst, x = 0:\n\nPlug x = 0 into the polynomial:\n\n0\u00b2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nIn Z\u2082, 1 is not equal to 0, so x = 0 is not a zero of the polynomial.\n\nNext, x = 1:\n\nPlug x = 1 into the polynomial:\n\n1\u00b2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nBut in Z\u2082, 2 modulo 2 is 0, so 2 \u2261 0 in Z\u2082.\n\nTherefore, x = 1 makes the polynomial equal to 0 in Z\u2082.\n\nSo, x = 1 is a zero of the polynomial.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 0 - We saw that x = 0 is not a zero.\n\nB. 1 - This is a zero.\n\nC. 0,1 - But only 1 is a zero.\n\nD. 2 - In Z\u2082, 2 is equivalent to 0, and we saw that x = 0 is not a zero.\n\nWait a minute, in Z\u2082, 2 is the same as 0 because 2 mod 2 is 0.\n\nSo option D is essentially the same as option A, which we already determined is not a zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 1.\n\nBut let me double-check if there are any other zeros in Z\u2082.\n\nWe've already tested all elements of Z\u2082: 0 and 1.\n\nOnly x = 1 is a zero of the polynomial x\u00b2 + 1 in Z\u2082.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\nB. 1"
