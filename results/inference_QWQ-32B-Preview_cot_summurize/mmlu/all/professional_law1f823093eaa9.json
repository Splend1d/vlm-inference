The wholesaler's attorney has asked the judge to strike the potential juror for cause. Should the judge strike the potential juror for cause?\n\nA. No, because the potential juror said that he could fairly consider the evidence in the case.\nB. No, because the wholesaler's attorney could use a peremptory challenge to strike the potential juror.\nC. Yes, because other potential jurors still remain available for the jury panel.\nD.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out whether the judge should strike this potential juror for cause in this breach of contract case between a wholesaler and a pharmaceutical company. The potential juror used to work for the company five years ago and still owns several hundred shares of its stock. He says he can be fair, but the wholesaler's attorney wants him removed.\n\nOption A says no, because the potential juror said he can be fair. That seems straightforward, but I wonder if his past employment and current stock ownership might still influence his judgment, even if he doesn't realize it.\n\nOption B says no, because the wholesaler's attorney can use a peremptory challenge instead. But peremptory challenges are limited, and it might be better to use them elsewhere if this juror is potentially biased.\n\nOption C says yes, because there are other potential jurors available. But should the judge remove him based on his background, or trust his assurance of fairness?\n\nOption D says yes, because the potential juror is presumed to be biased due to his relationship with the company.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the standards for striking a juror for cause. Generally, a juror can be struck for cause if they have a actual bias or if there's a reasonable impression of potential bias based on their relationships or interests.\n\nIn this case, the potential juror worked for the company five years ago and still owns stock in it. Owning stock in a company involved in the lawsuit could create a financial interest in the outcome, which might affect his impartiality. Even if he claims he can be fair, the judge might consider that his past employment and current stock ownership could subconsciously influence his decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, he's been away from the company for five years, which is a significant amount of time, and perhaps his connection to the company has weakened over time.\n\nBut in law, especially in federal courts, there's often a presumption of bias when a juror has a direct financial interest in one of the parties, like owning stock in the defendant company. So, option D seems plausible.\n\nAlso, federal judges are required to ensure that jurors are impartial. If there's any doubt about a juror's impartiality, it's better to err on the side of removing them for cause.\n\nMoreover, the judge might consider the amount of stock he owns. Several hundred shares could be significant, depending on the value of the stock and the juror's financial situation.\n\nBut the juror has assured the court that he can be fair, which is important. Maybe the judge could ask further questions to probe his impartiality, such as how he would feel about ruling in favor of the plaintiff, who is suing the company he used to work for and still has an investment in.\n\nAlternatively, the judge could ask if his ownership of stock would affect his decision in any way.\n\nIf after further questioning, the juror persists in assuring the court of his ability to be fair, the judge might accept his assurance, especially if there's no clear evidence of actual bias.\n\nHowever, given the potential for bias due to his stock ownership and past employment, and considering that there are other potential jurors available, it might be prudent to strike him for cause.\n\nOption C suggests that he should be struck because other jurors are available, but I think the primary reason should be the potential bias, not just the availability of alternatives.\n\nOption B suggests that the attorney can use a peremptory challenge, but peremptory challenges are limited and valuable, and it's better to use them strategically for other potential issues.\n\nOption A is tempting, but I'm not sure if a juror's mere assertion of fairness is enough when there are substantial connections to one of the parties.\n\nOption D seems the most appropriate because there is a presumption of bias based on his relationship to the company.\n\nIn federal courts, particularly in diversity cases, the standards for juror impartiality are high, and any relationship that could be seen as biasing the juror's decision should be carefully examined.\n\nTherefore, I think the judge should strike the potential juror for cause, primarily due to the presumption of bias from his stock ownership and past employment with the defendant company.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD."
