                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Epicurus and his views on wealth for a good life. So, Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher who founded Epicureanism, which is a school of thought that focuses on happiness and the absence of pain as the highest goods in life. Now, the question is asking about his perspective on the wealth needed for a good life.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Easily procured.\n\nB. Attainable for everyone, but only through great effort.\n\nC. Available only to the rich.\n\nD. Available only to the gods.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Epicurus actually said about wealth and its relation to a good life. I remember that Epicurus emphasized simplicity and moderation in one's desires as key components to achieving happiness and contentment. He believed that true happiness comes from within and that excessive wealth or material possessions aren't necessary for leading a good life.\n\nIn fact, Epicurus argued that the greatest blessings of life are easily obtained and that the highest pleasure is achieved through the absence of pain, both physical and mental. He\u63d0\u5021\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7684\u6b32\u671b\u548c\u5bf9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7684\u8ffd\u6c42\u53ea\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u7126\u8651\u548c\u4e0d\u6ee1\u3002\n\nGiven this, option A says \"easily procured.\" That seems plausible because Epicurus believed that the essentials for a good life are easily attainable without much trouble.\n\nOption B says \"attainable for everyone, but only through great effort.\" While Epicurus did believe that a good life is available to everyone, he also stressed that it doesn't require tremendous effort beyond satisfying one's natural and necessary desires.\n\nOption C, \"available only to the rich,\" directly contradicts Epicurus's teachings, as he advocated for a simple life and warned against the pursuit of wealth for its own sake.\n\nOption D, \"available only to the gods,\" isn't consistent with Epicurus's humanistic approach to philosophy, which focuses on earthly, human experiences and happiness.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option A seems to be the most accurate. Epicurus believed that the wealth required for a good life\u2014that is, the basic necessities like food, shelter, and clothing\u2014is easily procured and doesn't require excessive effort or wealth accumulation.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider whether Epicurus might have had a different view. Maybe he thought that some level of wealth is necessary, but not extreme riches. But from what I know, he was against the accumulation of wealth beyond one's natural needs.\n\nAdditionally, Epicurus founded his school in a garden in Athens, and his community lived a simple life, sharing resources and focusing on philosophical discourse and friendship. This suggests that he didn't believe in the need for great wealth to live well.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: easily procured.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
