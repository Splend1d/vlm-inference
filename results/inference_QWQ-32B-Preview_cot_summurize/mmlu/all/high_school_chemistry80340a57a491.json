                    "text": "Let's think about what happens when a liquid boils. Boiling is when a liquid turns into a gas, right? So, in this case, liquid NH3 is turning into gaseous NH3. Now, I need to figure out which of these options correctly describes what's happening during that process.\n\nOption A says that the N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules break apart. Hmm, that sounds like chemical bonding is changing. But boiling is a physical change, not a chemical one. So, I don't think the actual bonds within the molecules are breaking; otherwise, it would be a chemical reaction. Maybe I should look into that more.\n\nOption B says that the overall temperature of the solution rises as the NH3 molecules speed up. I know that usually, when a liquid boils, it absorbs heat, which increases the kinetic energy of the molecules, making them move faster. But, interestingly, during boiling, the temperature stays constant while the liquid is turning into gas. So, maybe the temperature isn't rising; it's staying the same as the molecules are gaining energy to change state.\n\nOption C says that the amount of energy within the system remains constant. That doesn't sound right because boiling requires energy input, usually in the form of heat. So, the system is gaining energy to change from liquid to gas.\n\nOption D says that the hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart. NH3, or ammonia, is known for forming hydrogen bonds between molecules. These bonds are what hold the molecules together in the liquid state. When boiling occurs, these intermolecular forces need to be overcome for the molecules to separate and become a gas.\n\nLet me recall: boiling is when the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the external pressure, usually atmospheric pressure. To change from liquid to gas, molecules need to overcome the intermolecular attractions. In the case of NH3, these are hydrogen bonds.\n\nSo, during boiling, energy is added to the system, which is used to break these hydrogen bonds, allowing molecules to escape into the gas phase. The temperature remains constant during this process because the added energy is going into breaking bonds rather than increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules.\n\nWait a minute, option A talks about N-H bonds breaking. But those are covalent bonds within the molecule, not the intermolecular hydrogen bonds. So, if N-H bonds were breaking, that would involve the molecule falling apart, which isn't what happens during boiling. Boiling is just a change of state, not a decomposition of the molecule.\n\nTherefore, option A is probably incorrect. Option B is also likely incorrect because, during boiling, the temperature doesn't rise; it stays constant as the energy goes into breaking bonds.\n\nOption C says the energy within the system remains constant, but that can't be right because energy is being added to the system to cause the phase change.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, option D seems correct: the hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart during boiling.\n\nBut let me double-check. When NH3 boils, it's going from liquid to gas. In the liquid state, NH3 molecules are held together by hydrogen bonds. To become a gas, these molecules need to overcome these bonds and spread out. So, yes, breaking hydrogen bonds makes sense.\n\nAlso, I recall that NH3 has strong hydrogen bonding due to the high electronegativity of nitrogen and the polarity of the N-H bonds. So, significant energy is required to break these bonds during boiling.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: the hydrogen bonds holding separate NH3 molecules together break apart.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
