Low risk and certain\n\nD. Routine and non-complex\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a programmed decision is. From what I remember, programmed decisions are those that are routine and repetitive, usually made in response to structured problems that occur frequently. They are often guided by established policies, procedures, or rules.\n\nOption A says \"Complex and risky.\" That doesn't sound right because programmed decisions are typically straightforward and not overly complex. If they were complex and risky, they would probably require more analysis and custom solutions, which wouldn't fit the definition of programmed decisions.\n\nOption B is \"Uncertain and non-routine.\" Again, this doesn't align with programmed decisions. Uncertain and non-routine decisions are more likely to be non-programmed decisions, which require a unique approach each time they occur.\n\nOption C is \"Low risk and certain.\" This seems plausible because programmed decisions deal with routine situations that are predictable and have established procedures. Low risk and certainty are characteristics that would allow for standardized decision-making processes.\n\nOption D is \"Routine and non-complex.\" This directly matches my understanding of programmed decisions. They are routine, meaning they happen frequently, and non-complex, meaning they don't require extensive analysis or unique solutions.\n\nBetween options C and D, both seem to fit, but I need to choose the most appropriate one. Option C emphasizes the risk and certainty aspects, while option D focuses on routine and non-complex characteristics.\n\nI think option D is a better fit because programmed decisions are primarily characterized by their routine nature and lack of complexity. While they may be low risk and certain, those attributes are more consequences of being routine and non-complex rather than defining characteristics.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is D. Routine and non-complex.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
