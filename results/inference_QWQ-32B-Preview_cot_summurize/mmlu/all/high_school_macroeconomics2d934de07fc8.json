                    "text": "Let's see what a negative or contractionary supply shock does in economics. I think I need to recall what a supply shock is and how it affects different curves.\n\nFirst off, a supply shock is an event that affects the supply of goods and services in an economy, independent of normal market forces. A negative or contractionary supply shock means that there's a decrease in the supply of goods and services. This could be due to various reasons like natural disasters, increases in input prices, or disruptions in production.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Shift the Phillips curve to the left.\n\nThe Phillips curve shows the relationship between inflation and unemployment. Typically, a movement along the Phillips curve shows that lower unemployment is associated with higher inflation, and vice versa. Shifting the Phillips curve to the left would mean that for any given unemployment rate, inflation is lower.\n\nBut a negative supply shock usually leads to both higher inflation and higher unemployment, which would shift the Phillips curve to the right, not left. So, option A doesn't seem right.\n\nB. Shift the investment demand curve to the right.\n\nInvestment demand typically depends on factors like interest rates, expected future profits, and business confidence. A negative supply shock might affect these factors, but I'm not sure if it would shift the investment demand curve to the right.\n\nActually, a negative supply shock could make businesses less optimistic about the future, which might decrease investment. So, it might shift the investment demand curve to the left, not right.\n\nC. Shift the money demand curve to the right.\n\nMoney demand is influenced by factors like income, interest rates, and expectations about the future. A negative supply shock might affect these factors, but I need to think about it carefully.\n\nIf there's a negative supply shock, leading to higher prices and possibly higher inflation, people might want to hold less money because money loses value faster. So, maybe the money demand curve shifts to the left, not right.\n\nD. Shift the Phillips curve to the right.\n\nAs I thought earlier, a negative supply shock typically leads to both higher inflation and higher unemployment. This means that for any given unemployment rate, inflation is higher than before, which would shift the Phillips curve to the right.\n\nLet me double-check this. In the short run, a negative supply shock shifts the short-run Phillips curve upward and to the right, indicating higher inflation and higher unemployment.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, option D seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that sometimes economists talk about the Phillips curve shifting left or right based on changes in expectations. Maybe I need to be careful here.\n\nHowever, in the context of a negative supply shock, the standard effect is to shift the Phillips curve to the right, reflecting higher inflation and higher unemployment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Shift the Phillips curve to the right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
