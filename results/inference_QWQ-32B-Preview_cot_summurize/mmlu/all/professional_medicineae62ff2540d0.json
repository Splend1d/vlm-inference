                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out what's causing this 17-year-old girl's amenorrhea, which means she hasn't had a menstrual period for 6 months. She's been brought in by her mother, but she herself isn't too worried about it. Let's see what information we have and think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, some background: she started menstruating at age 12, which is within the normal range. Her periods were regular every 28 days until about a year ago when they became irregular. Now, she hasn't had a period for 6 months. She's on her high school gymnastics team, which suggests she's involved in pretty intense physical activity. She looks very thin, and her BMI is 15 kg/m2, which is below the normal range. Her pulse is 54 beats per minute, which is lower than average for her age, and her blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, which is also on the low side.\n\nSo, we need to consider what could be causing her amenorrhea. The options given are:\n\nA. Hyperthyroidism\n\nB. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism\n\nC. Hypothyroidism\n\nD. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\n\nLet's look at each one.\n\nStarting with A, hyperthyroidism. That's when the thyroid gland is overactive and produces too much thyroid hormone. Symptoms can include weight loss, rapid heart rate, anxiety, heat intolerance, and sometimes irregular periods. However, in this case, her heart rate is actually low, and her blood pressure is low, which doesn't really fit with hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism usually causes an increased heart rate and higher blood pressure. So, this seems less likely.\n\nOption B is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This is a condition where the body doesn't produce enough gonadotropins, which are hormones like follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are necessary for reproductive functions. This can lead to amenorrhea. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be caused by various things, including excessive exercise, low body weight, and eating disorders. Given that she's a gymnast, involved in intense physical activity, and is underweight, this seems like a plausible cause.\n\nOption C is hypothyroidism, which is the opposite of hyperthyroidism\u2014when the thyroid gland is underactive and doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone. Symptoms can include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and irregular periods. However, again, her heart rate is low, which could be consistent with hypothyroidism, but her weight is very low, which is not typical for hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism usually causes weight gain, not loss. So, this seems less likely.\n\nOption D is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which is a common cause of irregular periods and amenorrhea. It's characterized by elevated androgens, insulin resistance, and multiple small cysts on the ovaries. Symptoms can include acne, excess hair growth, weight gain, and irregular periods. However, in this case, the patient is underweight, and PCOS is more commonly associated with overweight or obesity. Also, she's involved in gymnastics, which typically requires a low body fat percentage, and PCOS often presents with insulin resistance, which doesn't align with her current status.\n\nConsidering all this, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism seems like the most likely cause. Her intense exercise regimen, low body weight, and low BMI are all risk factors for developing this condition. The low heart rate and blood pressure could also be related to her low body weight and high fitness level from gymnastics.\n\nI think the answer is B. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
