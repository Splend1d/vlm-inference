So, it's focusing on emotions rather than logic or reason.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Virtue ethics: This is an ethical theory that emphasizes the role of character and virtue in moral philosophy rather than either doing one's duty or acting in order to bring about good consequences. It's more about cultivating good character traits. But it doesn't specifically locate morality in emotional impulses towards others.\n\nB. Ethical egoism: This is the view that moral agents ought to act in their own self-interest. It's about what's best for the individual. This seems to be more about rational self-interest rather than emotional impulses towards others.\n\nC. Postmodern ethics: Postmodernism is a broad movement that questions the existence of objective reality and truth. In ethics, it might suggest that moral truths are constructed socially and culturally, and can vary greatly. It doesn't specifically focus on emotional impulses towards others.\n\nD. Ethics of duty: This sounds a lot like deontological ethics, which is a set of normative ethical theories that judge the morality of an action based on rules rather than consequences. It's more about following duties or rules, which are often rational constructs.\n\nNone of these seem to perfectly match the description, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe it's none of the above. Or maybe it's a different ethical theory not listed here. For example, care ethics emphasizes care and nurturing as central to moral life, and it does focus on emotional connections and responsibilities to others. But care ethics isn't listed here.\n\nLet me think differently. If the question is about locating morality in emotional impulses towards others, it might be referring to something like sentimentalism in ethics, where moral judgments are based on feelings or sentiments rather than reason.\n\nBut sentimentalism isn't directly listed here. Maybe it's related to one of the options.\n\nVirtue ethics does consider emotions and character, but it's not solely based on emotional impulses. Ethical egoism is about self-interest, which might involve emotions but is more about rational self-interest.\n\nPostmodern ethics is too broad and doesn't specifically focus on emotional impulses.\n\nEthics of duty is about following duties or rules, which are typically rational constructs.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is trying to trick me, or maybe I need to choose the closest option.\n\nIf I had to pick, I might choose virtue ethics because it emphasizes character and emotions, but it's not solely based on emotional impulses towards others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe postmodern ethics could involve rejecting rationality and embracing emotional responses, but that seems like a stretch.\n\nWait, perhaps it's none of the above, but since I have to choose, I'll go with virtue ethics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A.
