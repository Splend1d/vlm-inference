                    "text": "Let's see. The term \"cohort\" is being defined here, and there are four options to choose from. I need to pick the correct definition among these choices.\n\nOption A says it refers to an individual's chronological age. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. I think chronological age is just how old someone is in years, but a cohort might be something different.\n\nOption B mentions a generation of people who lived through major events. That sounds familiar. I've heard about cohorts in terms of generations, like the Baby Boomer cohort or the Millennial cohort. These groups share experiences from certain periods in history.\n\nOption C says it's a person's gender. That doesn't seem right. Gender is male, female, non-binary, etc., which is different from a cohort.\n\nOption D is about a group of people living in the same culture. While that might be partially correct, I think it's too broad. A cohort can be defined within a culture, but it's more specific than just people from the same culture.\n\nLet me think about this. In research and statistics, a cohort often refers to a group of individuals who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined period. For example, in epidemiology, a cohort study might track a group of people who were born in the same year or who were exposed to a particular factor.\n\nIn social sciences, a cohort is often used to describe a group of people who share a similar characteristic, especially a birth cohort, which is a group of people born in the same period and who share similar experiences growing up.\n\nSo, going back to the options, option B seems the most accurate. It refers to a generation of people who lived through major events, which aligns with the concept of a cohort sharing common experiences.\n\nOption A is close because age can be a factor in defining a cohort, but it's not just about individual age; it's about the group sharing that age and the experiences associated with it.\n\nOption C is definitely not correct because gender is a different characteristic altogether.\n\nOption D is too broad because people from the same culture can have diverse ages and experiences.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. A generation of people who lived through major events.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
