To determine the astrological sign for someone born on that day, we need to look at the dates associated with each sign.\n\nLet's recall the typical date ranges for the zodiac signs:\n\n- Libra: September 23 - October 22\n\n- Scorpio: October 23 - November 21\n\n- Sagittarius: November 22 - December 21\n\n- Capricorn: December 22 - January 19\n\n- Aquarius: January 20 - February 18\n\n- Pisces: February 19 - March 20\n\n- Aries: March 21 - April 19\n\n- Taurus: April 20 - May 20\n\n- Gemini: May 21 - June 20\n\n- Cancer: June 21 - July 22\n\n- Leo: July 23 - August 22\n\n- Virgo: August 23 - September 22\n\nGiven that Halloween is on October 31st, which falls after October 22, it would be after the end of Libra and into Scorpio.\n\nSo, October 23 to November 21 is Scorpio.\n\nTherefore, someone born on October 31st would be a Scorpio.\n\nLet's double-check the options provided:\n\nA. Scorpio\n\nB. Capricorn\n\nC. Libra\n\nD. Cancer\n\nBased on the date ranges, the correct answer is A. Scorpio.\n\nIt's possible that some sources might have slightly varying dates for the zodiac signs, but generally, October 31st is well within Scorpio's range.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Scorpio."
