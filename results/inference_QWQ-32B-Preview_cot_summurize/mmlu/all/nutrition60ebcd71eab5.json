                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about free sugars in foods. The options are cows' milk, natural unsweetened orange juice, honey, and agave nectar. I need to figure out which of these don't contain free sugars.\n\nFirst, I should understand what free sugars are. From what I know, free sugars refer to sugars that are added to foods by manufacturers, cooks, or consumers, and those naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices. So, free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides that are added to foods and drinks, as well as those found in honey, syrups, and fruit juices.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nA. Cows' milk: Milk contains lactose, which is a natural sugar present in milk. But is lactose considered a free sugar? I think lactose is inherent to milk and isn't added, so it might not be classified as a free sugar. I need to confirm this.\n\nB. Natural unsweetened orange juice: Orange juice, even if it's natural and unsweetened, contains fruit sugar, which is fructose. Since it's from a fruit juice, I believe this would be considered a free sugar.\n\nC. Honey: Honey is a sweetener that contains natural sugars, primarily fructose and glucose. According to the definition, honey is one of the sources of free sugars.\n\nD. Agave nectar: This is another type of sweetener that contains sugars, mainly fructose. Again, since it's a type of syrup, it should be considered a source of free sugars.\n\nSo, based on this, cows' milk might be the only option that doesn't contain free sugars, assuming that lactose isn't classified as a free sugar.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check about lactose in milk. I recall that lactose is the natural sugar in milk and isn't added; it's inherent to the milk. Therefore, it shouldn't be considered a free sugar. In contrast, sugars in fruit juices and honey are considered free sugars because they are naturally present but are released from the whole fruit or honeycomb.\n\nTo be sure, let's consider the definition from authoritative sources. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines free sugars as \"all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and unsweetened fruit juices.\"\n\nSo, according to WHO, free sugars include:\n\n1. Added sugars by manufacturers, cooks, or consumers.\n\n2. Sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices.\n\nGiven this, let's revisit the options:\n\nA. Cows' milk: Contains lactose, which is not added sugar and not one of the sources listed by WHO for free sugars. So, it doesn't contain free sugars.\n\nB. Natural unsweetened orange juice: This contains fructose, which is a natural sugar in oranges. However, since it's in the form of fruit juice, it's considered a source of free sugars.\n\nC. Honey: As per WHO, honey is a source of free sugars.\n\nD. Agave nectar: This is a type of syrup, and syrups are included in the WHO's definition of free sugars.\n\nTherefore, the food that does not contain free sugars is cows' milk.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any added sugars in cows' milk. Regular cows' milk doesn't have added sugars; it's just lactose naturally present. So, it should be fine.\n\nAlso, I should note that whole fruits contain natural sugars but are not considered free sugars because the sugar is bound within the cellular structure of the fruit. However, once the fruit is juiced, the sugar is released and is considered a free sugar.\n\nIn conclusion, among the options provided, cows' milk is the only one that does not contain free sugars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
