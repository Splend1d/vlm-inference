Wayne W. tells Dr. Pete Pannick that his partner is threatening to harm Dr. Panniclc because Wayne's not happy with the advice he's getting in therapy. Dr. Panniclc knows that Wayne's partner has a history of violent behavior and believes the threat is serious. So, Dr. Panniclc has to decide what to do next.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the options:\n\nA. Continue seeing Wayne in therapy and ask Wayne to bring his partner to the next session to discuss the situation.\n\nB. Continue seeing Wayne in therapy but, with his permission, contact the police to discuss the threat.\n\nC. May terminate therapy with Wayne but only after providing him with pre-termination counseling and appropriate referrals.\n\nD. May terminate therapy with Raymond.\n\nWait, the last option says \"Raymond,\" but the scenario is about Wayne and his partner. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be \"Wayne.\" I'll assume that's the case.\n\nNow, let's think about each option.\n\nOption A: Asking Wayne to bring his partner to therapy. That could be a way to address the issue directly, but given that the partner has a history of violence and is threatening to harm Dr. Panniclc, this might not be the safest approach. Bringing the partner to therapy could potentially put Dr. Panniclc at risk.\n\nOption B: Continuing therapy with Wayne but contacting the police with his permission to discuss the threat. This seems like a prudent step to ensure Dr. Panniclc's safety and possibly prevent any potential harm. Involving law enforcement could be necessary, especially since there's a serious threat and a history of violence.\n\nOption C: Terminating therapy with Wayne after providing pre-termination counseling and appropriate referrals. Terminating therapy might be an option, but given that there's an immediate threat to Dr. Panniclc's safety, simply terminating therapy might not be sufficient. There's a need to address the safety concern first.\n\nOption D: Terminating therapy with Raymond. As I mentioned earlier, I think this might be a typo, and it should be \"Wayne.\" Assuming that's the case, terminating therapy might not be the best first step, especially if there's an immediate threat that needs to be addressed.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems like the most appropriate initial step. Dr. Panniclc should continue to provide therapy to Wayne, ensuring Wayne's welfare, while also taking steps to protect himself by involving the police, with Wayne's permission.\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Panniclc might need to consider his own safety measures, such as changing his therapy location or schedule, ensuring that his practice is secure, and possibly informing his institution or practice about the threat.\n\nIt's also important to document the threat and the actions taken in response to it, for both legal and professional reasons.\n\nIn summary, the best course of action is to continue therapy with Wayne, ensure his welfare, and take steps to protect himself by involving law enforcement, which aligns with option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
