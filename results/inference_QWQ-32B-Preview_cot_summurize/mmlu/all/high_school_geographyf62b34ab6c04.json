Now, centrifugal force, in this context, probably means something that tends to pull a country apart or create divisions within it. So, I need to think about which of these countries has language issues that cause divisions or tensions.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Canada: Canada has two official languages, English and French, with French being predominant in the province of Quebec. There have been separatist movements in Quebec, partly due to language differences and cultural identity. So, language could be seen as a centrifugal force here.\n\nB. United States: The US is predominantly English-speaking, with some Spanish speakers and other languages, but English is the de facto national language. While there are language minorities, I don't recall language being a major divisive force that threatens the unity of the country.\n\nC. Brazil: Portuguese is the official language, and while there may be some regional dialects, I don't think language is a significant centrifugal force in Brazil.\n\nD. Norway: Norwegian is the official language, and again, I don't think language diversity is causing divisions in Norway.\n\nSo, comparing these, Canada seems to be the country where language poses a centrifugal force due to the bilingual nature of the country and the political tensions related to Quebec's status.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any of the other options have language issues that could be centrifugal.\n\nIn the US, there have been debates about immigration and language, with some advocating for English-only policies, but I don't think this rises to the level of a centrifugal force that threatens the country's unity.\n\nIn Brazil and Norway, language doesn't seem to be a significant dividing factor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely Canada.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
