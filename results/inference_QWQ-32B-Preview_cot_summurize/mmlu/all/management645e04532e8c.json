The options are:\n\nA. organising, planning, controlling, leading\n\nB. organising, leading, planning, controlling\n\nC. planning, organising, leading, controlling\n\nD. planning, organising, controlling, leading\n\nI need to figure out which sequence makes the most sense. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what are the basic managerial functions? I remember from my management class that they are typically planning, organising, leading, and controlling. So all options include these functions, just in different orders.\n\nLet's consider the logical sequence. Planning seems like it should come first because it involves setting goals and determining how to achieve them. Without a plan, it's hard to organise anything.\n\nSo if planning is first, that eliminates option A, which has organising first.\n\nNow, between options C and D, the difference is whether controlling comes before or after leading.\n\nLet's think about organising next. After planning, organising involves arranging resources, including people, to carry out the plan. So organising should come after planning.\n\nSo, planning first, then organising makes sense.\n\nNext, leading involves guiding and motivating the team to work towards the goals set in the plan. This would typically come after organising, because you need to have your team and resources organised before you can lead them.\n\nThen, controlling is about monitoring progress and making adjustments as needed to ensure that the goals are met. This seems like it would come last, after leading.\n\nSo, the sequence would be: planning, organising, leading, controlling.\n\nThat matches option C.\n\nBut option D has planning, organising, controlling, leading. That puts controlling before leading, which seems a bit off to me. You'd want to lead your team first, and then control or monitor the process.\n\nAlso, I recall that according to Henri Fayol's management theory, the functions of management are planning, organising, commanding, coordinating, and controlling. Commanding is similar to leading.\n\nIn modern management theory, it's often simplified to planning, organising, leading, and controlling.\n\nSo, based on that, planning first, then organising, then leading, and finally controlling seems to be the correct sequence.\n\nLet me see if there's any other perspective.\n\nMaybe in some situations, a manager might need to lead before organising, but I think organising comes before leading because you need to have your team and resources in place before you can lead them.\n\nAlso, controlling is about monitoring and evaluating performance, which should happen after you've led the team and they've started working.\n\nSo, overall, I think option C is the correct answer: planning, organising, leading, controlling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
