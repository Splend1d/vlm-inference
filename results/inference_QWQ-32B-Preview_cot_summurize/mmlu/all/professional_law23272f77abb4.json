                    "text": "So here's this scenario: a man offers his neighbor $50 to mow his lawn. The neighbor goes ahead and buys gasoline for the mower and starts mowing. Just as he's about to begin, the man says, \"I change my mind, I revoke my offer.\" Now, if the neighbor still mows the lawn, does he get the $50?\n\nLet's break this down. First, there's an offer on the table: \"mow my lawn, and I'll pay you $50.\" This sounds like a unilateral contract, where one party makes a promise in exchange for the other party's performance.\n\nIn contract law, offers for unilateral contracts can generally be revoked at any time before performance is complete. But there's a catch: once the other party has started performing, the offer might become irrevocable.\n\nHere, the neighbor bought gasoline and started the engine. He's taken steps to perform the task. But did he start mowing yet when the man revoked the offer?\n\nThe question says that the neighbor \"started the engine\" and then the man revoked the offer. So, at the moment of revocation, the neighbor hadn't actually started mowing the lawn yet.\n\nOption A says yes, the neighbor can recover $50 because the offer became irrevocable before the revocation. But was it irrevocable at that point?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, an offer for a unilateral contract becomes irrevocable once the offeree has begun performance in reliance on the offer. Here, the neighbor bought gas and started the engine, which could be seen as preparation, but maybe not actual performance.\n\nOption B mentions quasi-contract. Quasi-contract is a concept where the court imposes a obligation to prevent unjust enrichment. So, if the neighbor mows the lawn without an enforceable contract, maybe the man would be unjustly enriched if he doesn't pay.\n\nOption C says no, because the revocation was effective since the neighbor hadn't completed performance. That makes sense if the offer was still revocable at the time of revocation.\n\nOption D says no, because the neighbor had only prepared to accept the offer before revocation. Again, this suggests that since performance hadn't begun, the offer could be revoked.\n\nI think the key here is whether the neighbor had started performing the act of mowing the lawn before the revocation.\n\nStarting the engine might be considered preparation, but actually mowing the lawn would be the performance. If the neighbor hadn't started mowing yet, then perhaps the offer could still be revoked.\n\nBut, if starting the engine on the property is considered a substantial step towards performance, maybe the offer can't be revoked.\n\nI recall that in some cases, if the offeree has relied on the offer to their detriment, there might be estoppel against revocation.\n\nHere, the neighbor bought gasoline in reliance on the offer. That's definitely reliance, but maybe not enough to make the offer irrevocable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the neighbor's actions amounted to a partial performance, making the offer irrevocable.\n\nWait, but in unilateral contracts, revocation is typically allowed until performance is complete. However, there are exceptions, like when the offeree has relied on the offer to their detriment, or when they've begun performance.\n\nIn this case, perhaps the neighbor's purchase of gasoline and starting the engine could be seen as reliance, but not actual performance.\n\nIf the neighbor had already mowed part of the lawn before revocation, that would be different. Then, maybe the offer would be irrevocable.\n\nBut since he hadn't started mowing yet, maybe the offer can be revoked.\n\nTherefore, options C and D seem more plausible.\n\nOption C says no, because the revocation was effective since the neighbor hadn't completed performance. But in this case, it's not about completion; it's about whether performance had begun.\n\nOption D says no, because the neighbor had only prepared to accept the offer prior to revocation. That aligns with the idea that the neighbor hadn't started performing the act of mowing yet.\n\nSo, perhaps D is the better answer.\n\nBut let's consider quasi-contract under option B. Even if there's no enforceable contract, maybe the neighbor can recover under quasi-contract to prevent unjust enrichment.\n\nHowever, quasi-contract usually applies when there's no contract, but it would be unfair for the other party to retain the benefit without paying.\n\nIn this case, if the neighbor mows the lawn after the revocation, perhaps the man is unjustly enriched if he doesn't pay.\n\nBut, did the neighbor have a valid expectation that he would be paid?\n\nThe man revoked the offer, so maybe the neighbor shouldn't proceed with mowing expecting to be paid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the neighbor can argue that he relied on the offer to his detriment by buying gasoline, and should be reimbursed for that.\n\nBut the question is about recovering the $50 for mowing the lawn, not for the gasoline.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me consider the doctrine of promissory estoppel. If the neighbor relied on the offer to his detriment, maybe the offer can't be revoked.\n\nBut promissory estoppel typically requires reliance to the detriment of the relyer.\n\nHere, the neighbor bought gasoline based on the offer. So, perhaps the offer can't be revoked due to promissory estoppel.\n\nIf that's the case, then the neighbor can proceed with mowing the lawn and expect to be paid.\n\nTherefore, option A might be correct.\n\nWait, but promissory estoppel prevents the revocation only if the offeree has reasonably relied on the offer to their detriment.\n\nIn this case, buying gasoline seems like reasonable reliance.\n\nSo, perhaps the offer can't be revoked, and the neighbor can recover the $50.\n\nTherefore, A is the correct answer.\n\nBut option B, quasi-contract, might also allow recovery, but A seems more directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both A and B could be correct, but I have to choose one.\n\nGiven that, I think A is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
