                    "text": " So I'm trying to figure out what Christopher Heath Wellman's position is on this list of options. I've read some of his work, but I need to recall his main arguments regarding immigration and nation-states.\n\nFirst off, option A says that anti-egalitarianism is compatible with liberal cosmopolitanism. I think Wellman is known for critiquing liberal cosmopolitanism, but I'm not sure about the compatibility with anti-egalitarianism. Maybe I need to look into that more.\n\nOption B claims that closing borders to all potential immigrants is inherently racist. Wellman is a philosopher who has written about immigration and justice, and I recall him arguing that states have the right to control their borders, but I don't remember him characterizing border closure as inherently racist. In fact, I think he might disagree with that statement.\n\nOption C says that nation-states have an obligation to open their borders to the least well-off potential immigrants. This sounds like a cosmopolitan position, where there's a moral imperative to help the worst-off, regardless of borders. Wellman, however, is known for his sovereignty-based approach, which might not align with this obligation.\n\nOption D states that nation-states have a presumptive right to close their borders to all potential immigrants. This rings a bell. Wellman has argued that states have moral rights to control their borders, and that immigration restrictions can be justified in certain circumstances. He emphasizes the importance of state sovereignty and the right of states to decide who can become members.\n\nLet me think about this again. If Wellman defends the position that nation-states have a presumptive right to close their borders to all potential immigrants, that would be option D. But I should check if he also considers exceptions for the least well-off, which would relate to option C.\n\nUpon reflection, Wellman does argue that states have moral rights to exclude potential immigrants, but he also acknowledges that there might be moral constraints on this right. For example, he might argue that states shouldn't exclude immigrants purely based on racist criteria, which could relate to option B, but I don't think he characterizes border closure as inherently racist.\n\nRegarding option A, anti-egalitarianism and liberal cosmopolitanism seem like opposing positions, as cosmopolitanism often emphasizes global equality. Wellman might argue that anti-egalitarianism is compatible with a different approach, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nOverall, I believe that Wellman's main position is that nation-states have a presumptive right to control their borders, which aligns with option D. He defends this view based on the idea that states have the right to self-determination and to maintain their political communities.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider each option in light of Wellman's arguments.\n\nOption A: Anti-egalitarianism compatible with liberal cosmopolitanism. Wellman criticizes some aspects of liberal cosmopolitanism, so this might not be his view.\n\nOption B: Closing borders is inherently racist. Wellman likely wouldn't agree with this, as he argues for the moral legitimacy of border control beyond just racial considerations.\n\nOption C: Obligation to open borders for the least well-off. This seems contrary to his sovereignty-based approach.\n\nOption D: Presumptive right to close borders. This aligns with his defense of state sovereignty.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. Wellman defends the position that nation-states have a presumptive right to close their borders to all potential immigrants.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
