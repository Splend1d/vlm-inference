                    "text": "Let's see here. I'm trying to remember about the landmasses during the Pleistocene era, especially regarding the islands in Southeast Asia and the area around Australia.\n\nFirst, I know that during the Pleistocene, which was the Ice Age, sea levels were lower because so much water was locked up in glaciers. That means some areas that are now underwater were actually connected land.\n\nI recall that Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Borneo are all islands in Southeast Asia. During the Pleistocene, when sea levels were lower, these islands were probably connected in some way.\n\nI think there was a term for the combined landmass of these islands during that time. I think it was called \"Sunda.\" Yes, Sunda Land or Sunda Shelf. So, the first blank should be Sunda.\n\nNow, for the second part, about Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania. Again, during the Ice Age, sea levels were lower, so these lands were more connected.\n\nI remember that the landmass connecting Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania was called \"Sahul.\" Yeah, Sahul Land or Sahul Continent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be D. Sunda; Sahul.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is Sunda; Wallacea. Wallacea is actually a biogeographical region between Sunda and Wallacea, known for its unique fauna. So, that doesn't fit the second blank.\n\nOption B has Wallacea and Beringia. Wallacea is, as I said, a biogeographical region, not the connected landmass of Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania. Beringia is the land bridge between Asia and North America, which was exposed during the Ice Age. That's not relevant here.\n\nOption C has Beringia; Sahul. Beringia is again the land bridge between Asia and North America, which isn't related to the Southeast Asian islands or Australia.\n\nSo, definitely, the correct answer is D. Sunda; Sahul.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
