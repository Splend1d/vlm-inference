                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Monte Alb\u00e1n. The question is: \"Monte Alb\u00e1n is located in the ________ and was built by the _________.\"\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Valley of Mexico; Aztec.\n\nB. Valley of Oaxaca; Zapotec.\n\nC. Amazon floodplain; Olmec.\n\nD. Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula; Maya.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out where Monte Alb\u00e1n is located and which culture built it.\n\nFirst, I know that Monte Alb\u00e1n is an archaeological site in Mexico, but I'm not exactly sure where it's located. I think it's in the southern part of the country, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n\nOption A mentions the Valley of Mexico and the Aztecs. I know that the Aztecs were based in the Valley of Mexico, and their capital was Tenochtitlan, which is present-day Mexico City. But I don't think Monte Alb\u00e1n is in the Valley of Mexico.\n\nOption B says the Valley of Oaxaca and the Zapotec. I recall that Oaxaca is a state in southern Mexico, and the Zapotec are an indigenous people from that area. Maybe Monte Alb\u00e1n is located there.\n\nOption C mentions the Amazon floodplain and the Olmec. Wait, the Olmec were an ancient Mesoamerican civilization, but I thought they were from the Gulf Coast of Mexico, not the Amazon floodplain. Maybe this is a mistake.\n\nOption D is the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and the Maya. I know that the Maya civilization was prominent in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, but I don't think Monte Alb\u00e1n is there.\n\nLet me try to recall some facts. Monte Alb\u00e1n is known for its large plazas and monumental architecture. I think it was an important center in Mesoamerica, but I need to remember which culture is associated with it.\n\nI think the Zapotec are the ones who built Monte Alb\u00e1n. I recall that the Zapotec civilization was centered in the Valley of Oaxaca. So, option B seems likely.\n\nBut to be sure, let me eliminate the other options.\n\nOption A: Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico. As I mentioned earlier, their capital was Tenochtitlan, which is different from Monte Alb\u00e1n.\n\nOption C: Amazon floodplain and Olmec. The Olmec are known for their settlements in the Gulf Coast of Mexico, like San Lorenzo and La Venta. The Amazon floodplain is in South America, which is not where the Olmec were located. So, this option doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D: Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Maya. While the Maya did build many impressive sites like Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and Tikal, I don't think Monte Alb\u00e1n is one of them.\n\nTherefore, by elimination, option B seems to be the correct answer: Monte Alb\u00e1n is located in the Valley of Oaxaca and was built by the Zapotec.\n\nTo double-check, I can think about the geographical locations. Oaxaca is indeed in southern Mexico, and the Zapotec have a long history in that region. Monte Alb\u00e1n is known for its unique architecture and writing system, which are characteristic of the Zapotec culture.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that Monte Alb\u00e1n was founded around 500 BCE and was a major center until around 800 CE, after which it went into decline. This timeline corresponds with the Zapotec civilization.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge and the process of elimination, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Valley of Oaxaca; Zapotec.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
