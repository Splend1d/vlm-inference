                    "text": "Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, which is the same speed that light travels. Since the star is 20 light-years away, it means that light from the star takes 20 years to reach Earth. Gravitational waves, traveling at the same speed, would also take 20 years to cover that distance. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 20 years.\n\nTo elaborate a bit more, gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the Universe. They were first predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1916, which posits that massive accelerating objects, such as neutron stars or black holes orbiting each other, should radiate energy in the form of waves of distorted spacetime propagating at the speed of light.\n\nThe speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (about 186,282 miles per second), and this is the universal speed limit, according to Einstein's theory of relativity. No information or energy can travel faster than this speed. Gravitational waves, being a fundamental part of the fabric of spacetime, also propagate at this speed.\n\nSo, if a star 20 light-years away explodes, both the light and the gravitational waves from the explosion would take 20 years to reach Earth, assuming they are traveling through a vacuum and there are no significant gravitational fields bending their paths.\n\nIt's worth noting that detecting gravitational waves is extremely challenging due to their incredibly weak interactions with matter. It wasn't until 2015 that the first direct detection of gravitational waves was announced by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which observed waves generated by the merger of two black holes over a billion light-years away.\n\nIn summary, gravitational waves from a stellar explosion 20 light-years away would reach Earth in 20 years, making option B the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
