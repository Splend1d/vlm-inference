                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, Mr. Maji has a class of 25 students, and he gives them a test. All but three students score between 82 and 94, which means that most of the class did pretty well. But there are three students who scored lower: 47, 55, and 62. The question is asking about these three scores and what they might be considered in statistical terms.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. modes.\n\nB. skewers.\n\nC. outliers.\n\nD. variances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with \"mode.\" The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. So, if many students scored, say, 88, then 88 would be the mode. But in this case, the question is about the three low scores, not necessarily the most frequent score. So, I don't think \"modes\" is the right answer here.\n\nNext, \"skewers.\" I'm not familiar with this term in statistics. It's possible there's a typo, and it should be \"skew.\" Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. In simpler terms, it describes whether the distribution is symmetrical or if it has a longer tail on one side. But \"skewers\" isn't a standard statistical term, so maybe it's a mistake.\n\nThen, \"outliers.\" Outliers are observations that lie an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population. In other words, they are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. Given that most students scored between 82 and 94, and these three students scored much lower, it's possible that these scores are outliers.\n\nFinally, \"variances.\" Variance is a measure of how spread out the data is. It's the average of the squared differences from the mean. While the three low scores would certainly affect the variance, they aren't variances themselves. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nGiven these definitions, it seems like \"outliers\" is the most appropriate term for these three low scores. They are significantly different from the majority of the class's scores.\n\nBut let me double-check. If most students scored between 82 and 94, and only three scored much lower, these three scores could be considered outliers because they don't fit the pattern of the rest of the data.\n\nAlternatively, if \"skewers\" was meant to be \"skew,\" then perhaps the low scores could cause the distribution to skew left, but again, \"skewers\" isn't a statistical term.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. outliers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
