I remember that it wasn't just any group of women, but specifically certain populations were used in the trials. Let me think...\n\nOption A says \"middle- and upper-class American women.\" That seems plausible, but I think I recall that the trials might have involved different demographics.\n\nOption B is \"white American women.\" That could be possible, but again, I think the trials were conducted with a specific group that might not fit this description perfectly.\n\nOption C is \"poor Puerto Rican women.\" I think this might be the correct answer. I remember reading somewhere that the birth control pill was tested on women in Puerto Rico, possibly because of their socioeconomic status.\n\nOption D is \"Asian American women.\" That doesn't ring a bell as being the primary group involved in the early trials.\n\nLet me try to remember more details. The birth control pill was developed in the mid-20th century, right? And its development involved clinical trials to test its effectiveness and safety.\n\nI think the first trials were conducted in places like Puerto Rico, which had a large population and was seen as a suitable location for such experiments. The women who participated might have been from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, perhaps making them more vulnerable to being subjects in these trials.\n\nAlso, I recall that there were ethical considerations around using these populations for testing, as they might not have had the same level of agency or understanding as women from higher socioeconomic classes.\n\nSo, considering all that, I believe the correct answer is C: poor Puerto Rican women.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider why the other options might not be correct.\n\nMiddle- and upper-class American women (option A) might have been involved in later stages or in different ways, but I think the initial trials were conducted with other populations.\n\nWhite American women (option B) might be a part of the general population, but again, the early trials were likely conducted with groups that were more accessible or deemed more appropriate for such studies at the time.\n\nAsian American women (option D) don't seem to be prominently associated with the early birth control pill trials, at least not in my memory.\n\nTherefore, based on my recollection and reasoning, I'll go with option C: poor Puerto Rican women.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
