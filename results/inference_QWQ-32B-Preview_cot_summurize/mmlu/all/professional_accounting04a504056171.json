                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about King, Inc. owning 70% of Simmon Co's outstanding common stock. King has liabilities of $450,000, and Simmon has liabilities of $200,000. But there's also this $100,000 note payable from Simmon to King. I need to figure out what the total liabilities should be in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what consolidated financial statements are. Consolidated financial statements combine the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of a parent company and its subsidiaries as if they are a single economic entity. Since King owns 70% of Simmon, Simmon is a subsidiary of King, and their financial statements need to be consolidated.\n\nNow, when consolidating, internal transactions between the parent and subsidiary need to be eliminated. In this case, the $100,000 note payable from Simmon to King is an internal transaction because it's between two entities that are part of the same consolidated group. So, this note should be eliminated in the consolidation process.\n\nLet me think about how to do that. If Simmon owes $100,000 to King, from the consolidated perspective, this is just money moving between two parts of the same entity, so it doesn't represent an external liability. Therefore, this $100,000 should not be included in the total liabilities of the consolidated entity.\n\nSo, to find the total consolidated liabilities, I should add King's liabilities and Simmon's liabilities and then subtract the internal note payable.\n\nLet's do the math:\n\nKing's liabilities: $450,000\n\nSimmon's liabilities: $200,000\n\nTotal liabilities before elimination: $450,000 + $200,000 = $650,000\n\nNow, subtract the internal note payable: $650,000 - $100,000 = $550,000\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that in consolidation, when a parent owns a subsidiary, the parent's investment in the subsidiary is also adjusted. Specifically, the parent's investment in the subsidiary is adjusted to reflect the parent's share of the subsidiary's equity.\n\nBut in this problem, they're only asking about liabilities, and they've given me the liabilities of both companies and the internal note payable. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the investment adjustment for this particular question.\n\nLet me double-check. If I have King's liabilities at $450,000 and Simmon's liabilities at $200,000, and they owe each other $100,000, which is an internal liability, then in the consolidated view, that $100,000 cancels out.\n\nSo, total consolidated liabilities should be $450,000 + $200,000 - $100,000 = $550,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $520,000\n\nB. $550,000\n\nC. $590,000\n\nD. $650,000\n\nSo, $550,000 is option B.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe I need to consider the non-controlling interest or something like that. Let's see.\n\nSince King owns 70% of Simmon, there's a non-controlling interest of 30%. In consolidation, the non-controlling interest's share of the subsidiary's liabilities might need to be considered, but I think liabilities are generally consolidated on a 100% basis, and then the non-controlling interest is shown separately.\n\nBut in this problem, they're just asking for the total liabilities, so maybe it's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note payable from Simmon to King is part of Simmon's liabilities, and since it's an intercompany transaction, it should be eliminated in consolidation.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Maybe I should consider the consolidated balance sheet entries.\n\nIn the consolidated balance sheet, liabilities would include all external liabilities of both companies, but exclude any intercompany liabilities.\n\nSo, King has liabilities of $450,000, which are external liabilities.\n\nSimmon has liabilities of $200,000, but $100,000 of that is the note payable to King, which is an internal liability.\n\nTherefore, Simmon's external liabilities are $200,000 - $100,000 = $100,000.\n\nSo, total consolidated liabilities would be King's external liabilities plus Simmon's external liabilities: $450,000 + $100,000 = $550,000.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the note payable should be eliminated differently. Let me see.\n\nIn consolidation, the note payable from Simmon to King would be eliminated against the receivable on King's books. So, if King has a receivable of $100,000 from Simmon, and Simmon has a payable of $100,000 to King, these would cancel each other out.\n\nTherefore, in the consolidated balance sheet, neither the receivable nor the payable would appear.\n\nSo, in terms of liabilities, Simmon's $200,000 liabilities include the $100,000 note payable to King. Therefore, the external liabilities of Simmon are $200,000 - $100,000 = $100,000.\n\nAdding that to King's $450,000 liabilities gives $550,000.\n\nI think this is the correct approach.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other aspect I might be missing.\n\nIs there any impact of the ownership percentage on the liabilities? Since King owns 70% of Simmon, do I need to adjust the liabilities based on the ownership percentage?\n\nI don't think so. In consolidation, the liabilities are consolidated on a 100% basis, and the non-controlling interest is recognized for the minority portion of the subsidiary's equity.\n\nSo, in this case, the total liabilities would still be $550,000, and perhaps there would be a non-controlling interest component in the equity section, but since the question is only about total liabilities, I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the note payable from Simmon to King is a elimination entry in consolidation because it's an internal transaction.\n\nSo, in the consolidation entries, you would eliminate the note payable and the corresponding note receivable.\n\nTherefore, Simmon's liabilities would be reduced by $100,000, and King's assets (the note receivable) would also be reduced by $100,000.\n\nBut since the question is only about liabilities, I can focus on the liabilities side.\n\nSo, Simmon's liabilities are $200,000 less the $100,000 internal note payable, which equals $100,000 external liabilities.\n\nAdding that to King's $450,000 liabilities gives $550,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $550,000, which is option B.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose that the note payable is not eliminated, and both the liability and the asset are kept. In that case, the total liabilities would be $450,000 + $200,000 = $650,000, which is option D. But that seems incorrect because it doesn't account for the elimination of the intercompany transaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the note payable is considered a reduction in King's liabilities, but that doesn't make sense because the note payable is Simmon's liability to King.\n\nWait, no, King has a asset (the note receivable), and Simmon has a liability (the note payable). In consolidation, both are eliminated.\n\nSo, Simmon's liabilities are reduced by $100,000, and King's assets are reduced by $100,000.\n\nTherefore, total liabilities are $450,000 (King's liabilities) + $100,000 (Simmon's external liabilities) = $550,000.\n\nI think that holds up.\n\nAnother angle: maybe there's interest on the note that needs to be considered, but the problem doesn't mention any interest, so I can assume it's a straightforward note payable with no interest.\n\nTherefore, I believe $550,000 is the correct total liabilities to be reported in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nb. $550,000"
