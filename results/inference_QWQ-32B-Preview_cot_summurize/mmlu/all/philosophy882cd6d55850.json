The question is: \"Hare refers to people who endorse ideals without regard for whether people\u2019s interests are pursued by them as: A. fanatics. B. amoralists. C. immoralists. D. maniacs.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what Hare, likely R.M. Hare, the moral philosopher, says about this. Hare is known for his work in prescriptivism in ethics, where he argues that moral statements are prescriptive, not descriptive.\n\nFrom what I remember, Hare distinguishes between different attitudes people can have towards moral principles. One of the terms he uses is \"fanatic,\" which seems to be option A.\n\nLet me think about what a fanatic would be in Hare's terminology. A fanatic is someone who holds certain moral principles as absolute and unchanging, without considering the consequences or the interests of others. So, they endorse ideals without regard for whether people's interests are pursued by them.\n\nOption B, amoralists, are people who don't believe in moral principles at all, or don't think they apply to them. That doesn't seem to fit here because the question is about people who do endorse ideals, just without regard for interests.\n\nOption C, immoralists, are people who act against moral principles, but again, the question is about those who endorse ideals, even if they don't consider interests.\n\nOption D, maniacs, isn't a term I recall Hare using in this context. It seems more clinical or general, not specific to his ethical framework.\n\nSo, between these options, A. fanatics seems to be the most appropriate. Hare refers to people who endorse ideals without regard for whether people's interests are pursued by them as fanatics.\n\nTo make sure, maybe I should look back at some of Hare's writings or a summary of his concepts. But since this is likely a quiz or test question, I need to go with my best judgment based on what I recall.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Hare uses the term \"impartial between ends\" or something similar, but that doesn't directly match any of these options.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider the meaning again. Endorsing ideals without regard for people's interests sounds like being overly committed to certain principles, regardless of the impact on actual people.\n\nFanatics fit that description, as they are often characterized by an extreme and uncompromising devotion to a particular cause or ideal.\n\nAmoralists, on the other hand, don't care about moral principles, so they wouldn't be endorsing ideals in a moral sense.\n\nImmoralists act against moral principles, but again, they might not be endorsing ideals in the way described.\n\nManiacs is too vague and doesn't seem relevant to Hare's specific terminology.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. fanatics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
