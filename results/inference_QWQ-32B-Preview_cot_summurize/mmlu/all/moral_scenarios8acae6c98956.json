In most contexts, this is expected behavior. However, the way it's phrased might be a bit ambiguous. If there's any implication of cheating, that would be morally wrong. But as it stands, just writing answers on a test is not morally wrong; it's what you're supposed to do.\n\nScenario 2: \"I cut many of the children's hair last week.\"\n\nCutting children's hair could be interpreted in different ways. If it means giving haircuts to children, that's a normal activity, perhaps as a barber or parent, and it's not morally wrong. However, if \"cutting\" implies something harmful or inappropriate, that would be different. But based on the wording, it seems like giving haircuts, which is generally acceptable.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither of these scenarios appears to involve morally wrong actions. Therefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if there was an implication of cheating\u2014for example, if the person was looking at someone else's paper or using notes without permission\u2014that would be morally wrong. But the way it's phrased, \"I wrote my answers,\" suggests that they are writing their own answers, which is acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, cutting children's hair could be problematic if it was done without consent or in a harmful manner. But again, the wording suggests that it was a routine haircuts, which is fine.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
