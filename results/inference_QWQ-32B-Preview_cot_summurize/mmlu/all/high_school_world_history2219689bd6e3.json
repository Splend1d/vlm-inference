A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nWhich of the following explains why Nkrumah feels Africa must \"avoid all the dangers inherent in disunity\"?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this quote from Kwame Nkrumah, who was the leader of Ghana, and he's talking about Africa needing to create a political union to contribute to world peace. He says that Africa should avoid the dangers of disunity by uniting into a single political entity, which would not only help maintain peace but also project a stronger African identity and gain more respect from the world, especially the great powers.\n\nThe question is asking which option explains why Nkrumah feels Africa must avoid the dangers of disunity. Let's look at each choice:\n\nOption A says, \"African nations will not achieve independence without unity.\" But in the quote, Nkrumah is speaking in 1961, and many African nations had already gained independence by then. Ghana itself became independent in 1957, and Nkrumah is already a leader. So, independence had already been achieved by some countries, though perhaps not all. But his focus seems to be more on the strength and respect Africa can gain on the global stage through unity, rather than achieving independence itself.\n\nOption B says, \"Disunity is what originally led many African nations into disarray.\" This seems plausible. If African nations are divided, they might have internal conflicts or be more vulnerable to external influences or interventions. Nkrumah might be arguing that historically, disunity has caused problems, and continuing down that path would lead to more dangers.\n\nOption C says, \"The African continent has already experienced its share of civil wars.\" While it's likely that there have been civil wars in Africa, the quote doesn't specifically mention them. Nkrumah is more focused on the need for unity to project a stronger image internationally and to avoid future dangers. So, while civil wars might be part of the reason, it's not directly addressed in the quote.\n\nOption D says, \"The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.\" Nkrumah actually states in the quote that \"A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence.\" So, he is clearly saying that the world respects size and influence, and a united Africa would have more of both, thus gaining more respect.\n\nNow, to determine which one explains why he feels Africa must avoid the dangers of disunity, I need to see which option best captures his reasoning.\n\nHe mentions that unity would avoid the dangers of disunity, and he gives two main reasons: first, to contribute to world peace by avoiding internal conflicts that could have global implications, and second, to gain more respect and influence in the international community by presenting a united front.\n\nOption D directly aligns with his statement about the world valuing size and influence. By uniting, Africa would become larger and more influential, which would help it gain the attention and respect it deserves, as evidenced by the examples he gives of the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the U.N.'s handling of the situation in the Congo.\n\nOption B also has merit because disunity could lead to internal disarray, which could be dangerous both for Africa and for global peace. However, in the quote, Nkrumah is more focused on the international perspective and how a united Africa would be better positioned in the world.\n\nOption A might have been relevant earlier, but given that many countries had already gained independence, it seems less directly applicable to his argument here.\n\nOption C is about past experiences of civil wars, which might be a part of the \"dangers inherent in disunity,\" but it's not explicitly mentioned in the quote.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: \"The world community sees power as a function of size and influence.\" This directly ties into Nkrumah's argument that a united Africa would be more respected and heard on the global stage, which is a key reason for avoiding the dangers of disunity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
