Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the equation clearly:\n\n3^(x - 3) + 10 = 19\n\nI need to isolate the exponential part, so I'll subtract 10 from both sides:\n\n3^(x - 3) = 19 - 10\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3^(x - 3) = 9\n\nNow, I know that 9 can be written as a power of 3, because 3 squared is 9. So, I can rewrite the equation as:\n\n3^(x - 3) = 3^2\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\nx - 3 = 2\n\nNow, solving for x, I'll add 3 to both sides:\n\nx = 2 + 3\n\nx = 5\n\nSo, the answer should be 5, which is option C.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If x is 5, then plugging back into the original equation:\n\n3^(5 - 3) + 10 = 3^2 + 10 = 9 + 10 = 19\n\nYes, that checks out. Alternatively, I can look at the other options to see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nOption A: x = 3\n\n3^(3 - 3) + 10 = 3^0 + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11, which is not 19.\n\nOption B: x = 4\n\n3^(4 - 3) + 10 = 3^1 + 10 = 3 + 10 = 13, not 19.\n\nOption C: x = 5\n\n3^(5 - 3) + 10 = 3^2 + 10 = 9 + 10 = 19, which matches.\n\nOption D: x = 6\n\n3^(6 - 3) + 10 = 3^3 + 10 = 27 + 10 = 37, which is too big.\n\nSo, definitely, x = 5 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
