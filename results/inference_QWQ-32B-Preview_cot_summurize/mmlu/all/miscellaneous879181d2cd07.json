Zaire.\n\nHere's a little bit of background: The country has had several names throughout its history. It was a Belgian colony called the Belgian Congo from 1908 until 1960, when it gained independence and became the Republic of Congo. In 1966, it was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Then, in 1971, under the rule of Mobutu Sese Seko, the country was renamed Zaire as part of his Authenticit\u00e9 program, which promoted a return to African roots. In 1997, after the First Congo War, Mobutu was overthrown, and the country was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo again.\n\nSo, to summarize, from 1971 to 1997, it was Zaire."
