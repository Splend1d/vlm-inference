                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what makes a disjunctive syllogism valid. The options are:\n\nA. The minor premise must either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent\n\nB. The minor premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative\n\nC. One of the premises is missing\n\nD. It reaches a truthful conclusion\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a disjunctive syllogism is. I think it's a type of argument where you have a choice between options, and by eliminating one, you conclude the other. Like, \"Either it's raining or it's not. It's not raining. Therefore, it's not raining.\" Wait, that seems off. Let me think again.\n\nActually, a disjunctive syllogism typically has a premise that presents alternatives, usually introduced by \"either/or,\" and then another premise that\u5426\u5b9a\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f97\u51fa\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u4e3a\u771f\u3002\u6bd4\u5982\uff1a\"Either it's raining or it's sunny. It's not sunny. Therefore, it's raining.\"\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n1. Either P or Q.\n\n2. Not Q.\n\n3. Therefore, P.\n\nOr sometimes:\n\n1. Either P or Q.\n\n2. P.\n\n3. Therefore, not Q.\n\nBut I think the standard form is the first one.\n\nNow, looking at option A: \"The minor premise must either affirm the antecedent or deny the consequent.\" Hmm, antecedent and consequent are terms more commonly used in conditional statements, like \"if P then Q,\" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. In a disjunctive syllogism, we're dealing with alternatives, not conditionals. So, this might not be the best fit.\n\nOption B: \"The minor premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative.\" This seems more relevant. In a disjunctive syllogism, the minor premise usually rejects one of the alternatives, leading to the acceptance of the other. So, this sounds promising.\n\nOption C: \"One of the premises is missing.\" I don't think this is a characteristic of a valid disjunctive syllogism. In fact, a valid syllogism should have all necessary premises present to support the conclusion.\n\nOption D: \"It reaches a truthful conclusion.\" Well, a valid argument doesn't necessarily have a true conclusion; it's about the form being correct, not the truth of the premises or conclusion. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nBetween options A and B, B seems more directly related to disjunctive syllogisms. The minor premise rejects one alternative, leading to the acceptance of the other.\n\nLet me double-check. In a disjunctive syllogism, the major premise presents a disjunctive option: either P or Q. The minor premise then denies one of them, say not Q, leading to the conclusion that P must be true.\n\nSo, the minor premise is rejecting one alternative, which aligns with option B.\n\nOption A talks about affirming the antecedent or denying the consequent, which is more related to conditional syllogisms, not disjunctive ones.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B: The minor premise must either accept an alternative or reject an alternative.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
