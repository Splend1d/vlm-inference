In games, bluffing is often a key strategy where players try to mislead each other to gain an advantage.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Outburst: This is a party game where players have to come up with as many answers as possible related to a given theme within a time limit. It's more about quick thinking and remembering facts rather than deceiving other players.\n\nB. Balderdash: In this game, players are given a word or term that they might not know and have to make up a definition for it. Then, the correct definition is provided, and players vote on which definition they think is real. So, the art of bluffing comes into play when you try to make your made-up definition sound plausible so that others will think it's the real one.\n\nC. Pictionary: This is a drawing game where one player draws clues to a word or phrase, and their teammates guess what it is. There's no element of deception or bluffing involved; it's all about accurately communicating through drawings.\n\nD. Scattergories: In this game, players have to come up with unique answers that fit into different categories, all starting with a specific letter, within a time limit. Again, it's more about creativity and quick thinking without any bluffing involved.\n\nSo, comparing all these, Balderdash seems to be the game that relies heavily on bluffing, as players need to convincingly bluff about the meaning of a word to fool others into believing their made-up definition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
