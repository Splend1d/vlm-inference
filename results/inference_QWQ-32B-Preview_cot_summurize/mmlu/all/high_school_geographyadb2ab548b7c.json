Hmm, I think I've heard somewhere that Hindus have something called the Vedas, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look into what each of these is.\n\nFirst, the Talmud. I know that's a important text in Judaism, right? It's a collection of rabbinic writings that interpret the Hebrew Bible. So, that's definitely not Hindu.\n\nNext, the Bible. That's the sacred text of Christianity, isn't it? Both the Old Testament and the New Testament are central to Christian faith. So, not Hindu either.\n\nThe Torah, now, that's the five books of Moses in Judaism: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Again, that's Jewish scripture, not Hindu.\n\nFinally, the Veda. I think this is the one. I recall that Hinduism has ancient texts called the Vedas, which are considered very sacred and contain hymns, rituals, and philosophies. There are four main Vedas: Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda.\n\nTo make sure, maybe I should cross-verify this. What do other sources say about Hindu sacred texts? I know that besides the Vedas, there are other important texts like the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Puranas. But among the options given, the Veda seems to be the correct one.\n\nLet me see, is there any chance that it could be the Torah? No, that's Jewish. Talmud is also Jewish. Bible is Christian. So, by elimination, it's the Veda.\n\nMoreover, Hinduism is one of the oldest religions, and the Vedas are indeed ancient texts that have been passed down through generations. They are considered the foundational texts of Hindu philosophy and practice.\n\nSo, I'm quite confident that the answer is D. Veda.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
