Let's see, the options are:\n\nA. Frank and Bill\n\nB. Tom and Dick\n\nC. Dave and George\n\nD. Ed and Pete\n\nI think I've heard of Frank and Bill before, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up some information about them.\n\nI remember they had a television show called \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.\" It was pretty influential back in the day, known for pushing boundaries and featuring a lot of guest stars.\n\nLet me try to recall some of their skits. There was one where they would do a routine about their parents, Mr. and Mrs. Smothers. I think their father was involved in show business as well.\n\nWait a minute, I think their first names might be Tom and Dick. That seems familiar. Tom and Dick Smothers.\n\nBut let me double-check. I have a feeling that Frank and Bill might be another comedy duo, maybe from a different era.\n\nAlternatively, Dave and George sound like they could be part of a comedy team, but I don't think they're the Smothers Brothers.\n\nAnd Ed and Pete, that doesn't ring any bells for me.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe I can recall their full names.\n\nI think Tom Smothers was the one who was more reserved, and Dick Smothers was the more outgoing one. Yes, that seems right.\n\nI think Tom was the one who played the piano and sang, while Dick was more the straight man.\n\nAlso, I recall that they had a singing duo act as well, performing folk songs.\n\nMoreover, I think they were from California, and their show was produced there.\n\nGiven that, I believe the correct answer is B. Tom and Dick.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should make sure that Frank and Bill aren't another comedy duo.\n\nHmm, Frank and Bill Bolton were a comedy team, but they were active in the mid-20th century, different from the Smothers Brothers.\n\nSo, to confirm, the Smothers Brothers are Tom and Dick Smothers.\n\nYes, that's what I remember now.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Tom and Dick.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
