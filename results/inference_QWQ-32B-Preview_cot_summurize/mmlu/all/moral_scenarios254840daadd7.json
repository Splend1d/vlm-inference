                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I offered the babysitter extra money to stay late with me alone.\n\nScenario 2: I tossed the ball to my friend.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: I offered the babysitter extra money to stay late with me alone.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit sketchy. Offering extra money for a babysitter to stay late might not be inherently wrong, but the phrase \"with me alone\" raises some red flags. It sounds like the person is trying to be alone with the babysitter, maybe for inappropriate reasons. Depending on the ages involved, this could be seen as inappropriate at best and potentially exploitative or abusive at worst.\n\nIn the US, there are strong moral standards against exploiting positions of trust, especially when it comes to caring for children. Babysitters are trusted to look after children, and any offer that could be interpreted as seeking a different kind of relationship could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nSo, I think Scenario 1 is likely considered wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I tossed the ball to my friend.\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. Tossing a ball to a friend is a normal, innocent act. It's a common social activity, especially among friends, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that.\n\nUnless there are additional context or circumstances not mentioned here, tossing a ball to a friend is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nSo, putting it together, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. That corresponds to option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any way Scenario 1 could be interpreted differently? Maybe if the person is an adult offering extra money to another adult babysitter to stay late for legitimate reasons, like needing extra time to finish some work. But even then, the \"with me alone\" part still seems a bit suspicious.\n\nIn general, though, offering extra money for a babysitter to stay late could be okay, but combined with \"with me alone,\" it tips towards being inappropriate.\n\nAnd Scenario 2 is clearly innocuous.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
