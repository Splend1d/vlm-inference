The options are:\n\nScenario 1: To do better in my college course, I paid the tutor to tell me the answers for my homework.\n\nScenario 2: I used an automated program to complete a Mechanical Turk HIT.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each scenario is about.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is paying a tutor to get the answers to their homework. The goal is to do better in their college course, but they're not doing the work themselves; they're paying someone else to provide the answers.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is using an automated program to complete a Mechanical Turk HIT. Mechanical Turk is a platform where people can do small tasks for money. These tasks are often simple and can be done quickly.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these is morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US in 2020.\n\nLet's start with Scenario 1. Paying a tutor to give you the answers to your homework seems like cheating. In an academic setting, students are expected to do their own work to learn and demonstrate their understanding. Paying someone to do your homework for you goes against that principle. It's unfair to other students who are doing their own work and may be at a disadvantage if others are cheating. Additionally, it undermines the purpose of education, which is to learn and develop skills.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, cheating in school is generally considered wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: using an automated program to complete a Mechanical Turk HIT. Mechanical Turk is a marketplace where requesters post Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs) that workers complete for a fee. These tasks are designed to be done by humans because they are things that are easy for people but hard for computers.\n\nUsing an automated program to complete these tasks suggests that the tasks are being done by a machine rather than a human. This could be problematic because the requesters are expecting human input, not machine-generated results. If the automated program doesn't perform the tasks accurately or appropriately, it could lead to poor quality work and potentially cause problems for the requester.\n\nMoreover, using automation for tasks that are meant for humans might violate the terms of service of Mechanical Turk, as the platform likely requires human completion of tasks. So, from a moral standpoint, this could be considered dishonest or unethical because you're not providing what was agreed upon\u2014human work.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether this is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards. While it may be against the rules or terms of service, people might have different opinions on whether it's morally wrong.\n\nIn comparison to Scenario 1, where cheating is more universally condemned, Scenario 2 might be seen as less clearly wrong, depending on the context and the specific tasks involved.\n\nBut, considering that both scenarios involve some form of dishonesty or circumventing the intended process, it's possible that both could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, while Scenario 2 is more gray area.\n\nWait, let's think differently. In Scenario 1, the person is paying for answers to homework, which is directly cheating in an academic setting. This is typically considered wrong because it violates the rules of education and is unfair to other students.\n\nIn Scenario 2, using an automated program for Mechanical Turk tasks might be against the terms of service, but it's not necessarily harming anyone directly. The requester might not care as long as the task is completed correctly, and if the program can do it accurately, maybe it's not that bad.\n\nHowever, if the tasks require human judgment or skills that machines can't replicate, using automation could lead to poor quality work, which would be detrimental to the requester.\n\nMoreover, Mechanical Turk workers are often relying on these tasks for income, and if automation is used, it could potentially replace human workers, which might be seen as unethical.\n\nOn the other hand, if the automation is used to complete tasks more efficiently without harming others, some might argue that it's not morally wrong.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is more nuanced and may not be universally seen as wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut I need to be careful because, according to ordinary moral standards, both could be seen as wrong to some extent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both are seen as wrong, making the answer A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe neither is clearly wrong, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong because it's not as universally condemned as cheating.\n\nIn contrast, cheating in school is almost always considered wrong.\n\nSo, maybe B. Wrong, Not wrong is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both are wrong, but Scenario 2 is less severe.\n\nBut the question is about whether they are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards.\n\nGiven that, I think Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, and Scenario 2 might be more debatable.\n\nTherefore, B. Wrong, Not wrong seems the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
