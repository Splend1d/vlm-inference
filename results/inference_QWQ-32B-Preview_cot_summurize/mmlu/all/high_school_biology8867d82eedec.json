                    "text": "Let's go through each option one by one to determine which statement is correct.\n\nOption A: \"Water flows from hypertonic to hypotonic.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what hypertonic and hypotonic mean in terms of solutions. A hypertonic solution has a higher concentration of solutes compared to another solution, while a hypotonic solution has a lower concentration of solutes. When it comes to water movement, water tends to move from an area of lower solute concentration (hypotonic) to an area of higher solute concentration (hypertonic) through a semi-permeable membrane. This process is known as osmosis. So, actually, water flows from hypotonic to hypertonic, not the other way around. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: \"Germinating seeds use less oxygen than do nongerminating seeds.\"\n\nGerminating seeds are actively growing and metabolizing, which typically requires more energy and therefore more oxygen consumption compared to nongerminating seeds that are in a dormant state. So, it's likely that germinating seeds use more oxygen, not less. This suggests that statement B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"The rate of transpiration decreases with an increase in air movement.\"\n\nTranspiration is the process by which water is transferred from plants to the atmosphere. It primarily occurs through the leaves and is influenced by factors such as air movement, humidity, and temperature. Generally, increased air movement around the leaves can enhance transpiration by removing the boundary layer of saturated air around the stomata, allowing for more water vapor to be released. Therefore, an increase in air movement would likely increase the rate of transpiration, not decrease it. This indicates that statement C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"Smaller DNA fragments migrate more rapidly than do larger DNA fragments on gel electrophoresis.\"\n\nGel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments based on their size. During electrophoresis, DNA fragments are loaded into a gel matrix and an electric field is applied. The DNA molecules, which are negatively charged due to their phosphate backbone, move towards the positive electrode. Smaller DNA fragments can more easily navigate through the gel matrix and therefore migrate faster than larger fragments, which move more slowly due to greater resistance from the gel. This is a fundamental principle in gel electrophoresis. Therefore, statement D seems correct.\n\nGiven that statements A, B, and C are incorrect, and statement D aligns with my understanding of gel electrophoresis, I conclude that option D is the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
