It's about these kids going on an adventure to find a dead body or something like that. Anyway, I need to figure out who wrote the novel it's based on.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Anne Proulx\n\nI'm not sure about her. I think she writes fiction, maybe literary fiction. But I don't recall anything about 'Stand By Me'.\n\nB. Stephen King\n\nNow, Stephen King is a famous author, known for his horror and supernatural fiction. I think he wrote a lot of novels that were made into movies. Maybe 'Stand By Me' is one of them.\n\nC. Dean Koontz\n\nAnother popular author, known for horror, science fiction, and mystery novels. Maybe he wrote something that was adapted into 'Stand By Me'.\n\nD. Frank McCourt\n\nI know Frank McCourt for his memoirs, like 'Angela's Ashes'. Not sure if he wrote a novel that 'Stand By Me' is based on.\n\nHmm, between these authors, I think Stephen King is the most likely candidate. I recall that 'Stand By Me' is based on a short story by him. I think the short story is called \"The Body,\" and it's about these kids who go looking for a dead body. That sounds familiar.\n\nLet me double-check. Stephen King wrote a lot of short stories collected in books like \"Different Seasons,\" and \"The Body\" is part of that collection. 'Stand By Me' is the movie adaptation of \"The Body.\" So, that must be it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should make sure that none of the other authors are connected to 'Stand By Me'. Anne Proulx doesn't ring any bells for me in relation to this movie. Dean Koontz has written many books, but I don't think any of them were adapted into 'Stand By Me'. Frank McCourt's works are more autobiographical, focusing on his life in Ireland, so that doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Stephen King.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
