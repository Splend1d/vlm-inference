                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the reserve ratio and how withdrawing money affects the money in circulation. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, the reserve ratio is 0.10, which means banks have to keep 10% of their deposits as reserves. That makes sense. Now, Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account and keeps it as cash in her refrigerator. Okay, so she's taking that money out of the bank and holding onto it herself.\n\nI need to figure out how this affects the money in circulation. The options are:\n\nA. Decreases it by $9 million\n\nB. Decreases it by $1 million\n\nC. Decreases it by $100,000\n\nD. Increases it by $1 million\n\nHmm. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nWhen Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account, that reduces the bank's deposits by $1 million. Since banks are required to hold 10% of deposits as reserves, that means for every $1 million in deposits, they have to hold $100,000 in reserves.\n\nBut she's taking out $1 million in cash, which is physical money, right? So, that cash is no longer in the bank; it's in her refrigerator. So, the bank's reserves decrease by $1 million, right? Because that's cash they no longer have.\n\nWait, no. Actually, reserves are the cash banks hold, either in their vaults or at the central bank. So, if she withdraws $1 million in cash, the bank's cash reserves decrease by $1 million.\n\nBut, the reserve ratio applies to deposits. So, with a 10% reserve ratio, for every $10 of deposits, they need to hold $1 in reserves.\n\nIn this case, she's withdrawing $1 million in cash, which is part of the bank's reserves. So, the bank's reserves go down by $1 million.\n\nNow, how does this affect the money supply? Well, the money supply is influenced by the bank's ability to make loans. With fewer reserves, the bank can make fewer loans, which in turn reduces the money supply.\n\nThe money multiplier is 1 / reserve ratio, which here is 1 / 0.10 = 10.\n\nSo, if reserves decrease by $1 million, the potential reduction in the money supply is $1 million times the money multiplier, which is $10 million.\n\nWait, but that doesn't match any of the options. The options are decreases by $9 million, $1 million, $100,000, or increases by $1 million.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nIf Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million and keeps it as cash in her refrigerator, that means that $1 million is now sitting idle in her fridge, not being spent or deposited anywhere else.\n\nSo, effectively, that $1 million is removed from circulation because it's not being used for transactions.\n\nTherefore, the money in circulation decreases by $1 million.\n\nBut that's option B. But earlier, I thought about the reserve ratio and the money multiplier, which suggested a larger impact.\n\nMaybe I need to consider both the direct and indirect effects.\n\nDirectly, $1 million is taken out of circulation. Indirectly, since the bank has less reserves, it can make fewer loans, which would reduce the money supply further.\n\nBut perhaps in this specific question, they're only asking about the direct effect of the withdrawal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think about the reserve requirements and how the bank adjusts its lending.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nInitially, the bank has deposits and reserves. When Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million in cash, the bank's reserves decrease by $1 million, and its deposits decrease by $1 million.\n\nNow, the bank needs to maintain a reserve ratio of 10%. So, with deposits decreased by $1 million, the required reserves decrease by $100,000 (which is 10% of $1 million).\n\nBut the bank's actual reserves decreased by $1 million, which is more than the required decrease in reserves of $100,000.\n\nTherefore, the bank has an excess reserve reduction of $900,000 ($1 million - $100,000).\n\nThis means the bank has to adjust its lending to meet the reserve requirement.\n\nSpecifically, the bank may have to call in loans or reduce its lending by an amount that would maintain the reserve ratio.\n\nThe money multiplier comes into play here. With a reserve ratio of 10%, the money multiplier is 10.\n\nSo, for every $1 decrease in reserves beyond what's required, the potential reduction in the money supply is $10.\n\nBut in this case, the bank's reserves decreased by $900,000 more than what's required.\n\nTherefore, the potential reduction in the money supply is $900,000 times the money multiplier of 10, which is $9 million.\n\nWait, but that's option A: decreases it by $9 million.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was a direct decrease of $1 million.\n\nNow, considering the bank's need to adjust its lending, it could be $9 million.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bank doesn't have to reduce its lending by that amount, but the potential reduction is $9 million.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up the formula for the change in the money supply when there's a change in reserves.\n\nI think the formula is change in money supply = change in reserves * money multiplier.\n\nIn this case, change in reserves is -$1 million, and the money multiplier is 10, so change in money supply is -$10 million.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the required reserves only decrease by $100,000, so the excess reserve decrease is $900,000, leading to a $9 million reduction.\n\nI think I'm mixing up required reserves and excess reserves.\n\nLet me try to clarify.\n\nInitially, the bank has deposits and reserves. Let's say deposits are D and reserves are R.\n\nReserve ratio is 0.10, so required reserves are 0.10 * D.\n\nExcess reserves are R - 0.10 * D.\n\nNow, Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million in cash.\n\nSo, deposits decrease by $1 million, and reserves decrease by $1 million.\n\nNew required reserves are 0.10 * (D - 1,000,000).\n\nNew excess reserves are (R - 1,000,000) - 0.10 * (D - 1,000,000).\n\nBut previously, excess reserves were R - 0.10 * D.\n\nSo, the change in excess reserves is [ (R - 1,000,000) - 0.10 * (D - 1,000,000) ] - [ R - 0.10 * D ].\n\nLet's simplify that:\n\n= R - 1,000,000 - 0.10*D + 100,000 - R + 0.10*D\n\n= -1,000,000 + 100,000\n\n= -900,000\n\nSo, excess reserves decrease by $900,000.\n\nNow, the money multiplier is 1 / reserve ratio = 10.\n\nTherefore, the potential reduction in the money supply is $900,000 * 10 = $9,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the money in circulation decreases by $9 million.\n\nSo, option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, I recall that the money multiplier applies to excess reserves, not required reserves.\n\nWhen excess reserves decrease, the bank has less ability to make new loans, which reduces the money supply.\n\nConversely, if excess reserves increase, the bank can make more loans, increasing the money supply.\n\nIn this case, excess reserves decrease by $900,000, leading to a $9 million reduction in the money supply.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Decreases it by $9 million.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial withdrawal directly reduces the money supply by $1 million, and then the multiplier effect comes into play.\n\nBut I think the standard approach is to consider the change in reserves and then apply the money multiplier.\n\nIn this case, the change in reserves is -$1 million, and the money multiplier is 10, so change in money supply is -$10 million.\n\nBut earlier, I considered that required reserves only decrease by $100,000, so excess reserves decrease by $900,000, leading to a $9 million reduction.\n\nNow, I'm getting two different answers.\n\nI need to find out which approach is correct.\n\nLet me look up the relationship between reserve ratio, reserves, and money supply.\n\nI recall that the money supply is related to the monetary base (which includes reserves and currency in circulation) multiplied by the money multiplier.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too deep for my current understanding.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the simplest approach.\n\nIf Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million in cash and keeps it in her refrigerator, that cash is no longer part of the banking system and isn't being used for transactions, so it's effectively out of circulation.\n\nTherefore, the money in circulation decreases by $1 million.\n\nBut according to the answer options, that corresponds to option B.\n\nHowever, considering the reserve ratio and the money multiplier, the reduction could be larger, up to $10 million.\n\nBut based on my earlier calculation, it's $9 million.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether to consider the entire reserve reduction or just the excess reserve reduction.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to consider the change in reserves and apply the money multiplier.\n\nIn that case, change in reserves is -$1 million, money multiplier is 10, so change in money supply is -$10 million.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation, required reserves only decrease by $100,000, so excess reserves decrease by $900,000, leading to a $9 million reduction.\n\nI think the latter approach is more accurate because the required reserves are a function of deposits, and the excess reserves are what banks can use for lending.\n\nTherefore, the potential reduction in the money supply is based on the decrease in excess reserves, which is $900,000, times the money multiplier of 10, equaling $9 million.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Decreases it by $9 million.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident because I feel like I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direct withdrawal reduces the money supply by $1 million, and the indirect effect through reduced lending reduces it by an additional $9 million, totaling a $10 million reduction.\n\nBut that seems to contradict my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I need to accept that this is a complex topic and that different approaches can lead to different answers.\n\nGiven the options provided, and based on my calculation considering excess reserves, I'll go with A. Decreases it by $9 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
