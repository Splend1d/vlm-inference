                    "text": "To construct a truth table for the given argument and determine its validity, we need to evaluate the truth values of the premises and the conclusion for all possible combinations of truth values of the propositions involved. The argument is:\n\n(Premise 1): (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P\n\n(Premise 2): P \u2228 ~O\n\nWe need to see if these premises together necessarily lead to a specific conclusion. However, the conclusion is not explicitly stated in the argument provided. Typically, in a validity check, we have premises and a conclusion, and we check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. Since the conclusion is missing here, I'll assume that the task is to determine if the second statement (P \u2228 ~O) necessarily follows from the first statement ((O \u2261 P) \u2228 P).\n\nAlternatively, interpreting the \"/ \" as a separator between premises, perhaps the argument is meant to have both statements as premises, and we need to check if they together lead to a specific conclusion, but since no conclusion is given, I'll proceed by checking if the second statement logically follows from the first.\n\nFirst, let's construct the truth table for both statements.\n\nWe have two propositions: O and P. Each can be either True (T) or False (F). So, there are four possible combinations.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. O = T, P = T\n\n2. O = T, P = F\n\n3. O = F, P = T\n\n4. O = F, P = F\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement for these combinations.\n\nFirst, evaluate (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P:\n\n- O \u2261 P is true if O and P have the same truth value.\n\n- So, O \u2261 P is:\n\n  - T \u2261 T: T\n\n  - T \u2261 F: F\n\n  - F \u2261 T: F\n\n  - F \u2261 F: T\n\n- Then, (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P is:\n\n  - (T \u2228 T): T\n\n  - (F \u2228 F): F\n\n  - (F \u2228 T): T\n\n  - (T \u2228 F): T\n\nWait, hold on. Let's recalculate that.\n\nActually:\n\n- For O = T, P = T:\n\n  - O \u2261 P: T\n\n  - T \u2228 T: T\n\n- For O = T, P = F:\n\n  - O \u2261 P: F\n\n  - F \u2228 F: F\n\n- For O = F, P = T:\n\n  - O \u2261 P: F\n\n  - F \u2228 T: T\n\n- For O = F, P = F:\n\n  - O \u2261 P: T\n\n  - T \u2228 F: T\n\nSo, the truth values for (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P are: T, F, T, T\n\nNext, evaluate P \u2228 ~O:\n\n- ~O is the negation of O.\n\n  - ~T: F\n\n  - ~F: T\n\n- So, P \u2228 ~O is:\n\n  - T \u2228 F: T\n\n  - F \u2228 F: F\n\n  - T \u2228 T: T\n\n  - F \u2228 T: T\n\nNow, to determine if P \u2228 ~O necessarily follows from (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P, we need to see if whenever (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P is true, P \u2228 ~O is also true.\n\nLooking at the truth table:\n\n- For O = T, P = T:\n\n  - (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P: T\n\n  - P \u2228 ~O: T\n\n- For O = T, P = F:\n\n  - (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P: F\n\n  - P \u2228 ~O: F\n\n- For O = F, P = T:\n\n  - (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P: T\n\n  - P \u2228 ~O: T\n\n- For O = F, P = F:\n\n  - (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P: T\n\n  - P \u2228 ~O: T\n\nSo, in all cases where (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P is true, P \u2228 ~O is also true. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option A says \"Valid\", which would seem to be the correct choice.\n\nBut, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe the argument is meant to have both statements as premises, and we need to see if they together lead to a specific conclusion, but since no conclusion is given, perhaps the task is to see if the premises are consistent or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the argument is meant to be (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P premise, and conclusion is P \u2228 ~O.\n\nIn that case, to check validity, we need to see if whenever the premise is true, the conclusion is also true.\n\nFrom the truth table above, that seems to be the case.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid, and the answer is A.\n\nBut, since the question also provides options for invalidity with counterexamples, perhaps there's a mistake in my evaluation.\n\nLet's double-check.\n\nLooking at the rows where the premise (O \u2261 P) \u2228 P is true:\n\n- O = T, P = T: premise T, conclusion T\n\n- O = F, P = T: premise T, conclusion T\n\n- O = F, P = F: premise T, conclusion T\n\nOnly in the row where O = T, P = F, the premise is false, and the conclusion is false.\n\nSo, in all cases where the premise is true, the conclusion is also true. Therefore, the argument is valid.\n\nHence, the answer is A. Valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
