                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one. I need to understand what each statement is saying and then determine whether they are true or false.\n\n**Statement 1:** Every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a homomorphic image is. A homomorphic image of a group G is the image of G under a homomorphism. So, if \u03c6: G \u2192 H is a homomorphism, then \u03c6(G) is a homomorphic image of G.\n\nNow, a factor group of G is a quotient group G/N, where N is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nThe statement is saying that for any homomorphic image of G, there exists a factor group of G that is isomorphic to it.\n\nI think this is related to the First Isomorphism Theorem, which states that if \u03c6: G \u2192 H is a homomorphism, then G/ker(\u03c6) is isomorphic to \u03c6(G). Here, ker(\u03c6) is the kernel of \u03c6, which is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSo, according to the First Isomorphism Theorem, every homomorphic image \u03c6(G) is isomorphic to G/ker(\u03c6), which is a factor group of G.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\n**Statement 2:** The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.\n\nThis statement is a bit more broad. It's saying that the collection of all homomorphic images of G is the same as the collection of all factor groups of G, considering isomorphism.\n\nFrom Statement 1, we know that every homomorphic image is isomorphic to some factor group. But is every factor group isomorphic to some homomorphic image?\n\nWell, consider a factor group G/N, where N is a normal subgroup of G. Define the canonical homomorphism \u03c0: G \u2192 G/N, which maps each element g to the coset gN. The image of \u03c0 is G/N, so G/N is a homomorphic image of G.\n\nTherefore, every factor group G/N is isomorphic to itself, which is a homomorphic image.\n\nSo, it seems that the homomorphic images of G are exactly the factor groups of G, up to isomorphism.\n\nThus, Statement 2 also appears to be true.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check if there are any exceptions or special cases where this might not hold.\n\nFor Statement 1, is there any homomorphic image that is not isomorphic to any factor group? I don't think so, given the First Isomorphism Theorem.\n\nFor Statement 2, is there any factor group that is not isomorphic to some homomorphic image? Again, since each factor group is itself a homomorphic image via the canonical projection, it seems not.\n\nTherefore, both statements seem to be true.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
