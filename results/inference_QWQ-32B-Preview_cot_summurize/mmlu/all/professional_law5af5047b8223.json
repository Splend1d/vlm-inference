                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It seems like there's a scenario involving a manufacturer and a retailer of drinking fountains, and there's some back and forth about an offer and its acceptance. The question is about whether a revocation of the offer is valid or not.\n\nFirst, let's understand the timeline and the events:\n\n- September 1: Manufacturer mails a signed offer to the retailer stating they have 200 drinking fountains available at $100 each for October delivery, and the offer will remain open until October 1.\n\n- September 29: Manufacturer sends a fax to the retailer revoking the offer, and this fax is received the same day.\n\n- September 30: Retailer mails a letter accepting the offer, requesting delivery of 100 fountains in October and 100 in November. This letter is received by the manufacturer on October 1.\n\nNow, the question is: Is the revocation valid?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Valid, because the retailer had not changed its position in reliance on the September 1 offer.\n\nB. Valid, because there was no consideration to support an option contract.\n\nC. Not valid, because the retailer had 90 days in which to accept.\n\nD. Not valid, because the manufacturer gave assurance that the offer would remain open until October 1.\n\nFirst, option C seems out of place because the offer specifies that it will remain open until October 1, which is about a month from September 1, not 90 days. So, option C can probably be eliminated.\n\nOption A mentions that the retailer had not changed its position in reliance on the offer. This seems related to the concept of estoppel, where a party relies on the promise of another and changes their position accordingly. However, in this case, it's not clear that the retailer has relied on the offer in any way before revocation. But I need to think carefully about this.\n\nOption B talks about consideration to support an option contract. An option contract is where one party pays consideration to keep an offer open for a certain period. Here, the manufacturer offered to keep the offer open until October 1, but there's no mention of any consideration from the retailer. So, perhaps the offer isn't irrevocable unless there's consideration supporting the option.\n\nOption D says the revocation is not valid because the manufacturer assured the offer would remain open until October 1. This seems similar to option A but focuses on the assurance given rather than the retailer's reliance.\n\nLet me think about the law here. In contract law, generally, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance, as long as the revocation is communicated to the offeree before they accept. However, there are exceptions, such as option contracts where consideration is given to keep the offer open.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer offered to keep the offer open until October 1, but there's no mention of any consideration from the retailer. So, it might be argued that the offer is still revocable unless there's consideration supporting the option.\n\nOn September 29, the manufacturer revokes the offer via fax, which is received the same day. The retailer accepts the offer on September 30, with a slight modification in the delivery schedule, and the acceptance is received on October 1.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the revocation on September 29 is effective before the acceptance on October 1.\n\nAlso, the acceptance modifies the delivery schedule, which might be considered a counteroffer, but since the original offer was to deliver in October, and the acceptance requests delivery in October and November, it's a material change, which typically would make the acceptance a counteroffer.\n\nHowever, considering that, the original offer might have been revoked on September 29, so when the retailer accepts on September 30, the original offer might already be revoked.\n\nBut let's look back at the options.\n\nOption D says the revocation is not valid because the manufacturer gave assurance that the offer would remain open until October 1. This seems to suggest that the manufacturer is bound by their assurance, making the offer irrevocable until October 1.\n\nBut in contract law, for an option contract where the offer is kept open, there usually needs to be consideration from the offeree to keep the offer open. Here, there's no mention of any consideration from the retailer to the manufacturer for keeping the offer open.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is correct: the revocation is valid because there was no consideration to support an option contract.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some jurisdictions, there's a rule that if the offeror assures the offeree that the offer will remain open, and the offeree relies on that assurance, then the offeror can't revoke the offer before the specified time, even without consideration. This is sometimes called a \"firm offer\" under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), but that typically applies to merchants and requires specific conditions.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer is a merchant (manufacturer of portable drinking fountains), and the retailer is also a merchant. So, perhaps UCC applies.\n\nUnder UCC section 2-205, a merchant's firm offer, in writing and signed, promising to keep an offer open for a certain period, doesn't require consideration to be irrevocable during that period.\n\nSo, if the manufacturer is a merchant, and the offer is in writing, signed, and promises to keep it open for a specified period, then under UCC 2-205, the offer is irrevocable for that period without needing consideration.\n\nLooking back, the offer is in writing, signed, and promises to remain open until October 1.\n\nTherefore, under UCC 2-205, the offer is irrevocable until October 1, even without consideration from the retailer.\n\nSo, the revocation on September 29 would not be valid because the manufacturer gave assurance that the offer would remain open until October 1.\n\nTherefore, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A says the revocation is valid because the retailer had not changed its position in reliance on the offer. But under UCC 2-205, the offer is irrevocable during the specified period, regardless of whether the offeree relied on it or not.\n\nOption B says the revocation is valid because there was no consideration to support an option contract. But under UCC 2-205, consideration isn't required for the offer to be irrevocable.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the offer is only open until October 1, not 90 days.\n\nOption D says the revocation is not valid because the manufacturer gave assurance that the offer would remain open until October 1, which aligns with UCC 2-205.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) not valid, because the manufacturer gave assurance that the offer would remain open until October 1."
