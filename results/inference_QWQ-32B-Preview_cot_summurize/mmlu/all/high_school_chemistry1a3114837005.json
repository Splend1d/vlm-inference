                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which of the following is expected to be the least soluble in water? A. NaBr, B. NiSO3, C. CrCl3, D. Mn(NO3)2.\" I need to figure out which one of these compounds won't dissolve in water as much as the others. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that water is a polar solvent, meaning it dissolves substances that are also polar or ionic because of its ability to surround and separate ions. So, ionic compounds generally dissolve in water because of this.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. NaBr - that's sodium bromide, which is an ionic compound between sodium and bromide ions.\n\nB. NiSO3 - that's nickel(II) sulfite, another ionic compound.\n\nC. CrCl3 - chromium(III) chloride, again ionic.\n\nD. Mn(NO3)2 - manganese(II) nitrate, also ionic.\n\nSo, all of them are ionic compounds, which generally dissolve in water. But the question is asking for the one that is expected to be the least soluble. That means, even though they all can dissolve in water to some extent, one of them doesn't dissolve as much as the others.\n\nI recall that solubility of ionic compounds in water can be affected by lattice energy and hydration energy. Lattice energy is the energy required to separate the ions in the solid, and hydration energy is the energy released when ions are surrounded by water molecules. If the lattice energy is much higher than the hydration energy, the compound won't dissolve easily.\n\nAlso, solubility rules can help here. There are general rules about which ionic compounds are soluble or insoluble in water. For example:\n\n- Nitrates are generally soluble.\n\n- Chlorides are generally soluble, except for those of silver, lead, and mercury.\n\n- Sulfates are generally soluble, except for those of calcium, barium, lead, etc.\n\n- Bromides are generally soluble, similar to chlorides.\n\nBut in this list, all the compounds are from groups that are generally soluble, except maybe NiSO3, since sulfites can be less soluble than nitrates or chlorides.\n\nWait, but NiSO3 is nickel(II) sulfite. Sulfites can be insoluble, especially with transition metals. For example, calcium sulfite is insoluble, and barium sulfite is also insoluble. So, maybe NiSO3 is less soluble.\n\nBut let's check the others:\n\n- NaBr: Sodium bromide is very soluble in water.\n\n- CrCl3: Chromium(III) chloride is also quite soluble.\n\n- Mn(NO3)2: Manganese(II) nitrate is soluble.\n\nComparatively, NiSO3 might be the least soluble among these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the lattice energy. Compounds with higher lattice energy are less likely to dissolve because more energy is required to break them apart.\n\nLattice energy depends on the charge and size of the ions. Higher charges and smaller sizes lead to higher lattice energies.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- NaBr: Na+ and Br- ions.\n\n- NiSO3: Ni2+ and SO32- ions.\n\n- CrCl3: Cr3+ and Cl- ions.\n\n- Mn(NO3)2: Mn2+ and NO3- ions.\n\nSo, CrCl3 has a trivalent cation, which would have a higher lattice energy due to the higher charge. Maybe that makes it less soluble?\n\nBut wait, chlorides are generally soluble, and CrCl3 is used in many chemical reactions, so I think it's still pretty soluble.\n\nOn the other hand, NiSO3 has a divalent cation and a divalent anion, which would also have a high lattice energy.\n\nMaybe between NiSO3 and CrCl3, NiSO3 is less soluble because of the combination of divalent ions and the fact that sulfites can be less soluble.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Mn(NO3)2 is the most soluble because nitrates are very soluble, and Mn2+ is a divalent ion, but maybe its lattice energy is lower compared to the others.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the least soluble.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NaBr is the most soluble, being a simple alkali metal halide.\n\nSo, perhaps among these, NiSO3 is the least soluble.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look up the solubility values for each of these compounds to be sure.\n\nBut since this is a theoretical question, I should try to reason it out based on what I know.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the common ion effect or any precipitation reactions, but I don't think that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering the dielectric constant of water and how well it can separate the ions.\n\nBut overall, based on general solubility rules and knowing that sulfites can be less soluble than chlorides or nitrates, especially with transition metals, I would guess that NiSO3 is the least soluble in water among these options.\n\nSo, my answer is B. NiSO3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
