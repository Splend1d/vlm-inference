                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character says, \"I buried the puppy because it was still breathing.\" Okay, so they buried a puppy that was still alive. That sounds really sad and harmful to the puppy. In most people's eyes, especially in the US, animals are supposed to be treated kindly and humanely. Intentionally burying a live puppy would be considered very cruel and wrong because it causes unnecessary suffering to the animal.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character says, \"I called the police on the violent man.\" Here, someone witnessed or encountered a violent individual and decided to call the police. Generally, in the US, it's considered responsible and sometimes even mandatory to report violent behavior to authorities. By calling the police, the person is seeking help to handle a dangerous situation, which is usually seen as the right thing to do. It's a way to protect themselves and others from potential harm.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 involves causing harm to an animal, which is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 involves taking a protective action by contacting law enforcement, which is generally seen as the right thing to do.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
