GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period. So, anything that contributes to the production of goods or services within the country should affect GDP.\n\nOption A: You lose $50 betting with a friend. This seems like a personal transaction between you and your friend. It's a transfer of money without any production of goods or services. So, I don't think this affects GDP.\n\nOption B: You fix your brother's car without buying any new parts. Here, you're providing a service\u2014fixing a car\u2014 but it's done within the family, and no new parts are purchased. Since it's an informal, non-market transaction, I don't think this counts towards GDP.\n\nOption C: Your father's firm makes computers and exports them to China. This seems like a clear case where goods are being produced and sold internationally. Exports are a component of GDP because they represent production by domestic firms sold to foreign buyers. So, this should definitely affect GDP.\n\nOption D: You buy 1000 shares of stock in a corporation. Buying stocks is a financial transaction; it's about ownership in a company, not about producing goods or services. So, this shouldn't directly affect GDP.\n\nBased on this, option C seems to be the one that affects GDP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
