                    "text": "I'm trying to remember the normal respiratory rate for adults. I think it's around 12 to 20 breaths per minute, but I'm not sure. Let me see what the options are here.\n\nOption A says 10-12 breaths per minute. That seems a bit low, but maybe for some people. Option B is 8-10 breaths per minute, which sounds even lower. Option C is 20-22 breaths per minute, which seems a bit high to me. And option D is 14-16 breaths per minute, which fits within the range I was thinking of.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that the normal respiratory rate can vary based on age and activity level. For adults, it's usually between 12 and 20 breaths per minute at rest. But this question specifies \"adult male,\" so I don't think there's a difference between males and females in terms of respiratory rate.\n\nLet me double-check what I've learned. In nursing school, we were taught that the normal respiratory rate for adults is 12 to 20 breaths per minute. Anything below 12 might be considered bradypnea, and above 20 could be tachypnea.\n\nLooking at the options again, option A is 10-12, which is slightly below the normal range. Option B is 8-10, which is even lower. Option C is 20-22, which is slightly above normal, and option D is 14-16, which is right in the middle of the normal range.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because I thought the normal range was broader, from 12 to 20. However, perhaps for this specific question, the answer is D, 14-16 breaths per minute, as it's within the normal range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether I know that the normal respiratory rate is slightly lower, around 12 to 16 breaths per minute. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look it up in a reliable source. According to the American Thoracic Society, the normal resting respiratory rate for adults is 12 to 20 breaths per minute.\n\nSo, given that, option D, 14-16 breaths per minute, is within the normal range.\n\nBut option C, 20-22, is also within the higher end of the normal range.\n\nHmm, so maybe the answer is D because it's the most typical or average range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific definition for \"normal\" that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If the normal range is 12 to 20 breaths per minute, then options A, B, C, and D all fall within that range to some extent.\n\nOption A: 10-12, where 10 is slightly below normal and 12 is normal.\n\nOption B: 8-10, which is below normal.\n\nOption C: 20-22, where 20 is normal and 22 is slightly above normal.\n\nOption D: 14-16, which is well within the normal range.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is D because it entirely falls within the accepted normal range, without including rates that are below or above normal.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the question is trying to assess knowledge of the average respiratory rate, which might be around 12 to 16 breaths per minute.\n\nBut according to the ATS, it's 12 to 20.\n\nI think I need to consider that the question specifies \"normal\" respiratory rate, which would include the entire range of what is considered normal, which is 12 to 20 breaths per minute.\n\nHowever, option D is 14-16, which is a subset of that range.\n\nMaybe the answer is D because it represents the most common or average respiratory rate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a specific definition for adults or adult males that I'm not recalling.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the question specifies \"adult male,\" and maybe there is a difference between males and females in respiratory rates.\n\nLet me think about this. Generally, there isn't a significant difference in respiratory rates between males and females. Both have similar respiratory rates.\n\nSo, perhaps that doesn't change anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me by providing ranges that are partially or fully within the normal range.\n\nIn that case, I need to choose the option that best represents the normal respiratory rate for an adult male.\n\nGiven that, option D, 14-16 breaths per minute, is entirely within the normal range and represents the average respiratory rate.\n\nOption C, 20-22, includes 22, which is slightly above the normal range.\n\nOption A, 10-12, includes 10, which is slightly below normal.\n\nOption B, 8-10, is below normal.\n\nTherefore, option D is the best answer because it's fully within the normal range and represents the average respiratory rate for an adult male at rest.\n\nI think that's the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
