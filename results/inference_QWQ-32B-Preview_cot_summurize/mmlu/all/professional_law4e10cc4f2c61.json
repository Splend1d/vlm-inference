Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after a defeat in an election, the Party expelled all non- Native-American members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Native Americans. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in the Sixth Congressional District, an area encompassing a large number of outlying reservations. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own \"Native American Power\" candidate for governor of South Dakota in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poll. A former non-Native American member of the Party is now challenging his exclusion from the Party. Which of the following constitutional provisions would furnish the former member's best ground for challenging his exclusion from the Party?\n\nA. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nB. The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\nC. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nD. The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.\n"

                    "text": "I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out which constitutional provision would best support the former member's challenge to being excluded from the Native American Party. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the Native American Party was founded to promote the political power of Native Americans, and initially, membership was open to any voter who pledged to vote for the party's nominees. But after a defeat, they expelled all non-Native American members, claiming that only Native Americans could be trusted to honor the pledge to vote for the party's nominees. Now, membership is confined to Native Americans.\n\nA former non-Native American member is challenging his exclusion from the party. So, he wants to argue that being kicked out because he's not Native American is unconstitutional. We need to see which constitutional provision would give him the strongest case.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nDue process is about the fairness of legal proceedings. It ensures that people are treated fairly before the law. But in this case, the exclusion is by a private party, the Native American Party, not by the state. So, due process might not be the strongest argument here because it generally applies to actions by the government, not private organizations.\n\nB. The right of assembly as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n\nThe First Amendment protects the right to assemble peaceably. This includes the right to form political parties and associations. However, the party is restricting its membership based on ethnicity. While the right to assemble is protected, restrictions based on ethnicity might still be subject to other constitutional constraints.\n\nC. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe equal protection clause states that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. This clause is often used to challenge discriminatory practices, especially those that classify people based on race or ethnicity.\n\nD. The voting provisions of the Twenty Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe Twenty Fourth Amendment prohibits poll taxes in federal elections and was aimed at eliminating financial barriers to voting. It doesn't directly address membership in political parties or discrimination based on ethnicity.\n\nConsidering these options, the equal protection clause seems most relevant. The former member is being excluded from the party based on his ethnicity, which is a protected characteristic under the equal protection clause. He could argue that this exclusion violates his right to equal protection under the law.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that political parties have some autonomy in determining their own membership rules. But when those rules involve excluding people based on race or ethnicity, that can run afoul of the equal protection clause.\n\nIn the context of political parties, the Supreme Court has addressed similar issues. For example, in California Democratic Party v. Jones (2000), the Court upheld a political party's right to choose its own rules for selecting candidates, including closing its primary to independent voters. This case suggests that political parties have significant control over their internal affairs.\n\nBut in other cases, like Nixon v. Shellacey (1971), the Court has held that political parties are not completely immune from equal protection challenges, especially when state action is involved.\n\nGiven that, the former member might argue that the party's exclusion based on ethnicity constitutes unlawful discrimination under the equal protection clause.\n\nOption A, due process, seems less directly applicable because it's more about the procedures used to exclude him rather than the substantive right to belong to the party.\n\nOption B, the right of assembly, might actually cut both ways. While it protects the party's right to form and set its own rules, the former member could argue that his right to associate with the party is being unconstitutionally restricted.\n\nOption D, the Twenty Fourth Amendment, is not really relevant here since it deals with poll taxes, not membership in political parties.\n\nTherefore, the equal protection clause in option C seems to be the best ground for the former member's challenge.\n\nBut to strengthen this argument, the former member would need to show that the party's exclusionary policy violates equal protection principles, perhaps by demonstrating that it's not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, although in this case, it's a party, not the state.\n\nAlternatively, he could argue that the party's actions are state-sponsored or that the state is involved in some way, which could bring it under the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOverall, while political parties have considerable autonomy, discriminatory practices based on ethnicity might still be subject to constitutional challenges under the equal protection clause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
