                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. It's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a developer who bought a 100-acre tract in 1996 and created a subdivision plan with 100 one-acre residential lots. The plan was recorded in 1997. Over the next few years, the developer sold 60 lots to individual purchasers, and each deed had a clause prohibiting mobile homes or house trailers on any lot within the subdivision.\n\nIn 2003, the developer sold the remaining 40 lots to a builder, and this deed also included the same prohibition clause. The builder then sold all 40 lots, but the deeds to these buyers didn't include the mobile home restriction.\n\nNow, in 2009, one of the buyers from the builder places a mobile home on their property. We need to determine which statement about the buyer's deed is least accurate.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.\n\nTo assess this, we need to understand how covenants run with the land. For a covenant to run with the land, certain requirements must be met:\n\n1. **Privity of estate:** The original parties must have had a privity of estate, meaning their interests in the land were successive.\n\n2. **Intent:** The parties must have intended for the covenant to run with the land.\n\n3. **Notice:** Subsequent purchasers must have notice of the covenant.\n\n4. **Touch and concern the land:** The covenant must relate to the use or enjoyment of the land.\n\nIn this case, the developer and the builder had privity of estate because the developer sold lots to the builder. The intent is clear from the deed's language prohibiting mobile homes. The covenant touches and concerns the land because it restricts how the land can be used.\n\nHowever, when the builder sold to the ultimate buyers, like the one in question, did the covenant run with the land to them? The builder's deeds to these buyers did not include the mobile home restriction. This is crucial.\n\nIf the builder omitted the restriction in the deeds to these buyers, it's possible that the covenant didn't run with the land to them, especially if they had no notice of the restriction.\n\nSo, statement A suggests that the covenant ran as far as the builder but not as far as the buyer. This could be accurate if the buyer had no notice and the builder didn't include the restriction in the deed.\n\nBut let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nB. The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.\n\nThis seems plausible. If the covenant is part of the subdivision plan and runs with the land, any lot owner could enforce it against another lot owner who violates it.\n\nHowever, given that the builder didn't include the restriction in the deeds to some buyers, it might be that only those who had the restriction in their deeds can enforce it.\n\nBut generally, in subdivision covenants, all lot owners agree to certain restrictions, and they can enforce them against each other.\n\nSo, this statement might be accurate, but we need to see if there's a better answer.\n\nC. The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.\n\nConstructive notice typically comes from recording documents. The subdivision plan was recorded in 1997, and it likely included the restrictions.\n\nAdditionally, the developer's deeds to the first 60 purchasers included the restriction, and the deed from developer to builder also included it.\n\nSo, even if the builder didn't include the restriction in the deed to the buyer, the buyer might still have constructive notice from the recorded subdivision plan.\n\nHowever, if the subdivision plan itself doesn't explicitly include the restriction, then perhaps the buyer doesn't have constructive notice.\n\nWe need to be careful here.\n\nD. All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n\nPrivity of estate generally means that there is a relationship between the parties with interests in the same land, such as between grantor and grantee.\n\nIn this case, the builder sold lots to various buyers, so there is privity of estate between the builder and each buyer.\n\nHowever, the question is whether all subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.\n\nIf the builder sold to a buyer, and that buyer sells to another party, there would be privity between the builder and the first buyer, and between the first buyer and the second buyer, but not directly between the builder and the second buyer.\n\nSo, this statement might not be entirely accurate.\n\nNow, considering all options, we need to find the one that is least accurate.\n\nOption A suggests that the covenant ran with the land as far as the builder but not as far as the buyer. This could be accurate if the buyer had no notice of the restriction, especially since it wasn't included in their deed.\n\nOption B says that any subdivision lot owner could enforce the covenant. This might still hold if the subdivision plan included the restriction, even if some deeds didn't.\n\nOption C claims the buyer should have constructive notice. If the subdivision plan was recorded and included the restriction, then yes, the buyer should have constructive notice.\n\nOption D suggests that all subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate, which isn't entirely accurate because privity generally doesn't extend beyond immediate parties.\n\nGiven these analyses, option D seems to be the least accurate statement.\n\nHowever, let's double-check.\n\nIf the builder sold to a buyer, and that buyer sells to another party, there is privity between builder and first buyer, but not between builder and subsequent buyers.\n\nTherefore, statement D is not entirely accurate.\n\nComparing all options, D seems to be the least accurate.\n\nBut wait, option C says the buyer should have constructive notice.\n\nIf the subdivision plan was recorded and included the restriction, then yes, the buyer should have constructive notice.\n\nBut if the subdivision plan didn't include the restriction, only the deeds did, then perhaps the buyer doesn't have constructive notice.\n\nIn this case, the subdivision plan was recorded in 1997, and it created 100 lots.\n\nThe deeds from developer to first 60 purchasers and to the builder included the restriction, but the builder's deeds to the remaining buyers did not.\n\nSo, did the subdivision plan include the restriction?\n\nThe question states that the subdivision plan was recorded, and each deed specified that every lot was to be recorded, and included the prohibition.\n\nIt's possible that the subdivision plan itself included the restriction, in which case the buyer should have constructive notice.\n\nBut the question is a bit unclear on whether the subdivision plan itself included the restriction or not.\n\nIf the subdivision plan included the restriction, then the buyer has constructive notice, and the restriction binds them.\n\nIf the subdivision plan didn't include the restriction, then perhaps the buyer doesn't have constructive notice.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll assume that the subdivision plan did include the restriction, as it was part of the developer's intent.\n\nTherefore, option C is accurate.\n\nOption A suggests that the covenant ran with the land as far as the builder but not as far as the buyer.\n\nGiven that the builder's deed to the buyer didn't include the restriction, and assuming the buyer had no actual notice, perhaps the restriction doesn't bind the buyer.\n\nHowever, with constructive notice from the recorded subdivision plan, it's likely that the restriction still binds the buyer.\n\nTherefore, statement A might be least accurate because the covenant likely did run with the land to the buyer due to constructive notice.\n\nBut I need to be careful.\n\nOption B says that any subdivision lot owner could enforce the covenant.\n\nIf the subdivision plan included the restriction, then yes, any lot owner could enforce it against any other lot owner.\n\nOption D, as we've established, is not entirely accurate because privity of estate doesn't extend beyond immediate parties.\n\nTherefore, between options A and D, I think option D is less accurate.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider that if the builder's deeds to the buyers didn't include the restriction, and the subdivision plan didn't include it, then the buyer might not be bound by the restriction, making option A accurate.\n\nHowever, since the subdivision plan was recorded and likely included the restriction, the buyer has constructive notice, making option A less accurate.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the least accurate statement.\n\nBut upon further reflection, if the subdivision plan included the restriction, then the buyer has constructive notice, and the restriction binds them, even if it wasn't included in their deed.\n\nTherefore, statement A is incorrect because the covenant likely did run with the land to the buyer.\n\nHence, option A is the least accurate statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
