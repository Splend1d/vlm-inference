                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about divided government. So, first off, what exactly is a divided government? In the context of the United States, a divided government occurs when one party controls the White House and another party controls one or both houses of Congress. This setup can lead to various outcomes in terms of policy-making and governance.\n\nNow, the question is asking about what frequently results from a divided government. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Reapportionment of voting districts. Reapportionment is the process of redrawing electoral district boundaries, usually based on census data, to ensure equal representation. While partisan control can influence how districts are drawn, I don't think divided government directly leads to reapportionment. Reapportionment happens periodically, based on census results, regardless of which parties are in power.\n\nOption B: Amendments to the Constitution. Constitutional amendments are significant changes to the nation's fundamental law, requiring supermajority votes in Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. This is a high bar, and while divided government might influence the likelihood of amendments being proposed, it's not necessarily a frequent outcome of divided government.\n\nOption C: Conflict between states and the federal government. Divided government could potentially lead to more conflicts between states and the federal government if different parties control state and federal legislatures and executive branches. However, conflicts between states and the federal government can occur under any government configuration, not just divided ones. So, while possible, it doesn't seem like the most direct or frequent result.\n\nOption D: Delays in the confirmation of those nominated to be ambassadors. This seems more plausible. In a divided government, where one party controls the White House and another controls the Senate (which has the power to confirm presidential appointments), there might be more scrutiny and resistance to the president's nominees. This could lead to delays in confirming ambassadors and other diplomatic appointments.\n\nLet me think about this some more. Ambassadors are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. If the Senate is controlled by the opposition party, they might take a longer time to review and vote on the nominations, especially if they disagree with the president's foreign policy choices or if the nominees are perceived as controversial.\n\nMoreover, in a divided government scenario, partisan tensions can run high, leading to more politicized confirmation processes. This could result in delays as senators from the opposing party seek more information, request additional hearings, or simply drag their feet to block or slow down the president's agenda.\n\nOn the other hand, some appointments might still go through smoothly if the nominees are widely regarded as qualified and non-controversial, even in a divided government. But overall, the potential for delays seems higher in such an environment.\n\nComparing this with the other options, delays in confirmation processes appear to be a more direct and frequent consequence of divided government than reapportionment, constitutional amendments, or intergovernmental conflicts.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D: delays in the confirmation of those nominated to be ambassadors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
