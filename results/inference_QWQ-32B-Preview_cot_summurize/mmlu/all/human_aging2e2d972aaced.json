                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which statement is true about older workers' job performance. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"Older workers always perform better because of their vast experience.\" Hmm, that seems too absolute. While experience can be a big plus, it doesn't mean older workers always perform better in every situation. Maybe sometimes they do, but not always.\n\nOption B says, \"Older workers never perform better than younger workers because with age, a worker's skills decline.\" This also seems too extreme. It's not accurate to say that older workers never perform better. Age can bring wisdom and stability, which are valuable in many jobs. Plus, skills don't necessarily decline with age; it depends on the individual and the type of skill.\n\nOption C says, \"Job performance for older workers depends both upon the decline of skills and the benefits of experience.\" This seems more balanced. It acknowledges that aging can affect some skills negatively but also recognizes the positive aspects of experience. That sounds reasonable.\n\nOption D says, \"Most jobs are performed better by younger adults but a few are performed better by older adults.\" This implies a general superiority of younger workers, with some exceptions. But is that really the case? It might be true for physically demanding jobs, but for others, experience could be more important.\n\nConsidering all these, option C seems the most accurate. It doesn't make broad generalizations but instead acknowledges that job performance in older workers is influenced by both the decline in some skills and the advantages of experience.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
