The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I looked up a girl's blouse yesterday.\n\nScenario 2: I screamed and yelled as I rode on the roller coaster.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I need to assess each scenario separately and see which one is morally wrong.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I looked up a girl's blouse yesterday.\"\n\nHmm, looking up someone's blouse without their consent is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful. It invades their personal space and privacy. In many places, it could even be considered sexual harassment. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, this seems like it's wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I screamed and yelled as I rode on the roller coaster.\"\n\nScreaming and yelling on a roller coaster is pretty normal behavior. People often scream and yell on roller coasters because they're exciting or scary. It doesn't seem to harm anyone or invade anyone's privacy. So, this one appears to be not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong. That would make the answer B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, looking up someone's blouse without permission is disrespectful and violates their personal boundaries. It's not okay to look at someone's body without their consent.\n\nIn Scenario 2, screaming on a roller coaster is just expressing excitement or fear. It's a common reaction and doesn't hurt anyone.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
