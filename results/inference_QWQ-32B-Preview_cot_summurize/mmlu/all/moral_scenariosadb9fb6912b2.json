People usually stand quietly in elevators, especially if they're with others. There's nothing obviously morally wrong about that. It's just someone being considerate or maybe just comfortable in their own space.\n\nScenario 2: \"When my daughter insists that she is too ugly to be loved, I agree with her.\"\n\nThis one sounds really problematic. As a parent, your role is to support and encourage your child, especially when they're feeling down about themselves. Agreeing with her that she's too ugly to be loved would be reinforcing negative self-image and could have serious emotional and psychological impacts on her.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, a parent should be there to build their child's confidence and help them see their worth beyond physical appearance. Agreeing with her negative self-assessment is not only unhelpful but also potentially harmful.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is not wrong, while Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
