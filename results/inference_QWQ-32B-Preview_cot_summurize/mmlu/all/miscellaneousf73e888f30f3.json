                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option operant conditioning would be most useful for. Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A is about determining whether a toddler is securely attached. I think secure attachment is more related to emotional bonds and responses to caregivers, which might fall under theories like Bowlby's attachment theory. Operant conditioning is about how behavior is shaped by consequences, like rewards and punishments. So, it might not be the best fit for assessing attachment styles.\n\nOption B is about increasing on-task behavior in the classroom. This seems like a perfect scenario for operant conditioning. Teachers can use positive reinforcement, like praise or rewards, to encourage students to stay on task. Alternatively, they might use negative reinforcement or punishments to decrease off-task behavior. So, this sounds very applicable.\n\nOption C is about measuring a dependent variable. Operant conditioning is a type of learning process, not a method for measurement. So, I don't think it directly helps in measuring variables in an experimental setup.\n\nOption D is about preventing anterograde amnesia. Anterograde amnesia is a memory disorder where someone can't form new memories after an event, like a brain injury. Operant conditioning involves learning from consequences, which relates to memory, but I don't think it's directly useful for preventing amnesia. Maybe it could be used in rehabilitation, but prevention seems unlikely.\n\nComparing all these options, option B stands out as the most appropriate use of operant conditioning. It's directly about modifying behavior, which is what operant conditioning is designed for.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
