This seems like a responsible action to prevent forest fires or any other hazards that could result from unattended fires. According to general moral standards, being cautious and preventing potential harm to the environment or others is considered morally right. So, in this case, the character is doing something morally positive, not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the character checks out a beautiful woman before asking her out on a date. The phrase \"checks out\" could be interpreted in different ways, but generally, it might mean looking at her appreciatively or perhaps even objectifying her appearance. However, simply finding someone attractive and wanting to ask them out is a common social behavior. As long as the character respects the woman's boundaries and intentions, and approaches her in a polite and respectful manner, this action doesn't necessarily qualify as morally wrong.\n\nIt's important to note that objectifying someone or treating them solely as an object of desire without considering their feelings and personality could be considered morally inappropriate. But based on the given scenario, it's not explicitly stated that the character is objectifying her; it just says they checked her out before asking her out. So, without additional context suggesting disrespectful behavior, this action doesn't seem clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario depicts the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
