                    "text": "So Lemon owned 2000 shares of Spectrol Corp. common stock, bought in year 1 at $10.50 per share. Then in year 4, she received a 5% non-taxable dividend of more Spectrol common stock. After that, in year 5, there was a 2-for-1 stock split. Finally, in the current year, she sold 800 shares, and I need to find out her basis in those 800 shares.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how each of these events affects the basis of the shares.\n\nStarting with the initial purchase:\n\n- Number of shares: 2000\n\n- Purchase price per share: $10.50\n\n- Total basis: 2000 shares * $10.50 = $21,000\n\nNext, in year 4, she received a 5% non-taxable dividend of Spectrol common stock.\n\nA non-taxable dividend in stock means that she's receiving additional shares without any immediate tax consequence, but her basis needs to be allocated between the old and new shares.\n\nFirst, calculate the number of new shares received:\n\n- 5% of 2000 shares = 0.05 * 2000 = 100 shares\n\nSo, after the dividend, total shares held by Lemon:\n\n- Original shares: 2000\n\n- New shares: 100\n\n- Total shares: 2000 + 100 = 2100 shares\n\nNow, the basis needs to be allocated between the original and new shares.\n\nFor non-taxable stock dividends, the basis of the new shares is generally zero, and the basis of the original shares is reduced proportionally.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some cases, the basis is allocated based on the fair market value (FMV) of the old and new shares at the time of the dividend.\n\nBut since it's a non-taxable dividend and no FMV is provided, perhaps the basis of the new shares is considered zero, and the basis of the original shares remains $21,000.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again.\n\nUpon further thought, for non-taxable stock dividends, the basis of the new shares is generally considered zero, and the basis of the original shares is not adjusted immediately. The basis is only adjusted if and when the shares are sold.\n\nBut I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is allocated between the old and new shares based on their relative values.\n\nSince no FMV is provided, maybe the basis is allocated based on the number of shares.\n\nSo, total shares after dividend: 2100\n\nOriginal shares: 2000\n\nNew shares: 100\n\nTherefore, basis per share before dividend: $21,000 / 2000 = $10.50\n\nAfter receiving 100 new shares, perhaps the basis per share remains the same, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is reallocated based on the total number of shares.\n\nWait, perhaps it's best to think of it this way:\n\n- The new shares have a basis equal to their fair market value at the time of receipt, but since it's a non-taxable dividend, perhaps the basis is zero.\n\n- The basis of the original shares is not adjusted at the time of the dividend.\n\nBut when the shares are sold, the basis of the shares sold is determined by identifying which shares are being sold (original or new) and applying the appropriate basis.\n\nHowever, since the question doesn't specify which shares were sold, I might need to assume that the shares sold are from the original shares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is averaged out over all shares.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's look up the general rule for basis allocation in non-taxable stock dividends.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that for non-taxable stock dividends, the basis of the new shares is generally zero, and the basis of the original shares is allocated between the original and new shares based on their relative FMV at the time of the dividend.\n\nBut since FMV is not provided, perhaps I should assume that the basis is allocated based on the number of shares.\n\nSo, total shares after dividend: 2100\n\nOriginal shares: 2000\n\nNew shares: 100\n\nTherefore, basis per share: $21,000 / 2100 = $10 per share\n\nSo, after the dividend, each share has a basis of $10.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nActually, if the new shares have a basis of zero, and the original shares have a basis of $21,000, then the total basis is still $21,000 for 2100 shares, which would be $10 per share.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right way to handle it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis of the original shares is reduced proportionally by the value of the new shares.\n\nBut without FMV, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the lack of specific FMV, perhaps the simplest approach is to assume that the basis is allocated proportionally based on the number of shares.\n\nTherefore, after the dividend, each share has a basis of $21,000 / 2100 = $10 per share.\n\nThen, in year 5, there's a 2-for-1 stock split.\n\nIn a stock split, the number of shares doubles, and the basis per share is halved.\n\nSo, after the 2-for-1 split:\n\n- Total shares: 2100 * 2 = 4200 shares\n\n- Basis per share: $10 / 2 = $5 per share\n\n- Total basis: 4200 shares * $5 = $21,000 (which remains the same)\n\nNow, in the current year, Lemon sold 800 shares.\n\nTo find her basis in the 800 shares sold, it would be 800 shares * $5 per share = $4,000.\n\nBut wait, $4,000 is option A.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that this is correct, considering the earlier steps.\n\nLet me double-check the allocation of basis after the stock dividend.\n\nI recall that for non-taxable stock dividends, the basis of the new shares is generally considered zero, and the basis of the original shares is reduced proportionally based on the FMV of the new shares relative to the old shares.\n\nBut since FMV is not provided, perhaps assuming that the basis is allocated based on the number of shares is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis remains with the original shares, and the new shares have a basis of zero.\n\nIn that case, after the dividend, the 2000 original shares have a basis of $21,000, and the 100 new shares have a basis of zero.\n\nThen, after the stock split, each share's basis is adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, in a stock split, the basis is allocated among the new shares.\n\nSo, if there's a 2-for-1 split, the basis per share is halved.\n\nBut if some shares have a basis of zero, perhaps their basis remains zero after the split.\n\nThis is getting complicated, and since FMV isn't provided, perhaps the simplest approach is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the basis is spread proportionally across all shares after the dividend.\n\nSo, total basis $21,000 across 2100 shares, which is $10 per share.\n\nThen, after the 2-for-1 split, basis per share becomes $5, and selling 800 shares would have a basis of $4,000.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and it matches option A.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor I might be missing.\n\nIs there any adjustment needed for the non-taxable dividend in terms of basis?\n\nI recall that for non-taxable distributions, the basis of the original shares is reduced by the amount of the distribution.\n\nBut since this was a non-taxable stock dividend, and no FMV is provided, perhaps the simplest allocation is appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, in the absence of specific FMV, assuming equal basis per share might be acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the basis per share after the dividend is $10, and after the split, it's $5, leading to a basis of $4,000 for 800 shares sold.\n\nThus, the answer should be A. $4,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
