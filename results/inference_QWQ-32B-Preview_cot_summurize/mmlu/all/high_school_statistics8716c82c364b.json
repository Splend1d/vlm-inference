                    "text": "So I've got this problem about heartworm tests in dogs, and I need to find out the probability that a dog actually has heartworm given that it tested positive. The options are 11%, 18%, 84%, and 88%. Hmm, this seems like a job for conditional probability, maybe Bayes' theorem. Let me try to wrap my head around the information given.\n\nFirst, it says that the test shows a positive result in 96% of dogs that actually have heartworm. So, if a dog has heartworm, there's a 96% chance the test will catch it. That sounds like the sensitivity of the test, right? Sensitivity is the true positive rate.\n\nNext, it says the test shows a negative result in 98% of dogs with no heartworm. So, if a dog doesn't have heartworm, there's a 98% chance it will test negative. That should be the specificity of the test, which is the true negative rate.\n\nAnd it's given that heartworm occurs in 10% of dogs. So, the prevalence is 10%.\n\nI need to find the probability that a dog has heartworm given that it tested positive. That is, P(Has heartworm | Tested positive).\n\nI think Bayes' theorem is the way to go here. Bayes' theorem says:\n\nP(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)\n\nIn this case, A is \"has heartworm,\" and B is \"tested positive.\"\n\nSo, P(Has heartworm | Tested positive) = [P(Tested positive | Has heartworm) * P(Has heartworm)] / P(Tested positive)\n\nI know P(Tested positive | Has heartworm) is 0.96, and P(Has heartworm) is 0.10.\n\nNow, I need to find P(Tested positive). How do I find that?\n\nWell, P(Tested positive) can be found by considering both the dogs that have heartworm and test positive, and the dogs that don't have heartworm but still test positive (false positives).\n\nSo, P(Tested positive) = P(Tested positive | Has heartworm) * P(Has heartworm) + P(Tested positive | Does not have heartworm) * P(Does not have heartworm)\n\nI already have P(Tested positive | Has heartworm) = 0.96 and P(Has heartworm) = 0.10.\n\nNow, P(Does not have heartworm) is 1 - P(Has heartworm) = 0.90.\n\nAnd P(Tested positive | Does not have heartworm) is the false positive rate, which is 1 - specificity.\n\nGiven that specificity is 0.98, false positive rate is 1 - 0.98 = 0.02.\n\nSo, P(Tested positive) = (0.96 * 0.10) + (0.02 * 0.90) = 0.096 + 0.018 = 0.114\n\nNow, plugging back into Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(Has heartworm | Tested positive) = (0.96 * 0.10) / 0.114 = 0.096 / 0.114 \u2248 0.842\n\nSo, that's approximately 84%.\n\nLooking back at the options, C is 84%, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I identified this as a conditional probability problem and decided to use Bayes' theorem, which seems appropriate.\n\nI correctly identified sensitivity as 96% and specificity as 98%.\n\nPrevalence is 10%, which is P(Has heartworm) = 0.10.\n\nThen, P(Tested positive) was calculated by considering both true positives and false positives, which makes sense.\n\nCalculations seem correct: 0.96 * 0.10 = 0.096 and 0.02 * 0.90 = 0.018, summing to 0.114.\n\nThen, 0.096 / 0.114 \u2248 0.842 or 84%.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 84%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can think about it another way.\n\nLet's assume there are 1000 dogs.\n\nAccording to prevalence, 10% have heartworm, so 100 dogs have heartworm, and 900 do not.\n\nOf the 100 with heartworm, 96% test positive, so 96 test positive.\n\nOf the 900 without heartworm, 2% test positive (false positives), so 18 test positive.\n\nTotal positive tests = 96 + 18 = 114.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a dog has heartworm given that it tested positive is 96 / 114 \u2248 0.842 or 84%.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think that confirms it.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 84%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 84\\%} \\]"
