                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I poured the rest of my drink in the kitchen sink.\n\nScenario 2: I woke up at 9 AM after my roommates had gone to work and turned on the blender to make myself a smoothie.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: pouring the rest of my drink down the kitchen sink. Is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, pouring a drink down the sink seems wasteful, right? If I have a drink and I don't finish it, and I just pour it away, that might be seen as wasting resources, which could be considered not good, especially if there's a concern for conservation or if someone else might have wanted that drink.\n\nBut is it morally wrong? In the US, wasting food or drink might be seen as impolite or thoughtless, but it's not typically considered a moral transgression. It's more of a social faux pas.\n\nSo, I think Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: waking up at 9 AM after roommates have gone to work and turning on the blender to make a smoothie.\n\nIs that morally wrong?\n\nWell, making a smoothie for yourself seems harmless, right? It's your choice to have a smoothie, and if you're paying for your own ingredients, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nHowever, consider the context: your roommates have gone to work, and you're waking up later. Is there something about making noise or disturbing others?\n\nBlenders can be loud, and if your roommates are at work and maybe need quiet in the apartment for some reason, or if you're disturbing someone else who is still there, that might be considerate.\n\nBut in this scenario, it says your roommates have gone to work, so presumably, the apartment is quiet, and you're the only one there.\n\nSo, making a smoothie for yourself seems fine.\n\nUnless, maybe, there's something about using shared appliances or ingredients without considering others.\n\nBut the scenario doesn't mention anything about shared ingredients or any restrictions on using the blender.\n\nTherefore, I think Scenario 2 is also \"Not wrong.\"\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, pouring the rest of the drink down the sink\u2014again, it's wasteful, but is it morally wrong?\n\nI think in general, wasting resources isn't considered a moral issue, unless it's in a context where resources are scarce, and your wasting affects others.\n\nBut in a typical home setting, with no such constraints mentioned, it's probably not considered morally wrong.\n\nAnd in Scenario 2, making a smoothie at 9 AM when roommates are at work\u2014again, seems fine.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
