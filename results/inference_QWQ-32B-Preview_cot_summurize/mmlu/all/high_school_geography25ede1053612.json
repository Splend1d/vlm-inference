So, diffusion is basically how ideas, beliefs, or trends spread from one place to another. Now, barriers are things that hinder or slow down this spread. The question is asking which option here wouldn't be considered such a barrier.\n\nOption A is language. Language can definitely be a barrier because if people speak different languages, it's harder for them to understand and adopt each other's cultural traits. So, that seems like a barrier.\n\nOption B is religion. Religion can also be a barrier because different religious beliefs might clash or be incompatible, making it difficult for cultural traits associated with one religion to be accepted by another. So, that makes sense as a barrier too.\n\nOption C is oceans. Oceans have historically been big barriers to diffusion because they make travel and communication more difficult. Islands or places separated by oceans might develop their own unique cultures precisely because of this isolation. So, oceans are definitely a barrier.\n\nNow, option D is \"tolerant complaisant citizens.\" Hmm, that sounds different. \"Tolerant\" means they're open to accepting different ideas, and \"complaisant\" means they're agreeable or obedient. So, if citizens are tolerant and complaisant, they're likely to be more accepting of new cultural traits coming in. That seems like it would facilitate diffusion rather than hinder it.\n\nComparing all the options, A, B, and C are all things that could prevent or slow down the spread of cultural traits, whereas D seems to be something that would encourage it. So, in this context, tolerant complaisant citizens would not be considered a barrier to diffusion.\n\nTo double-check, let's think about it another way. If a society is made up of people who are tolerant and complaisant, they're probably more receptive to new ideas and cultural practices from elsewhere. This would mean that cultural traits can diffuse more easily into their society. Therefore, their attitude would be supportive of diffusion, not a barrier to it.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Tolerant complaisant citizens would not be considered a barrier to the diffusion of a cultural trait.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
