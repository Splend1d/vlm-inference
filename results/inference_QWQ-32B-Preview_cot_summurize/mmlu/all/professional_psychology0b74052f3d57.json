                    "text": "This question is about understanding which type of test is most likely to withstand a legal challenge if it's found to have an adverse impact on a minority group. Adverse impact refers to a situation where a selection procedure disproportionately excludes members of a protected group. In the context of employment testing, it's crucial to choose tests that are fair and legally defensible.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Projective tests: These are tests where the individual's responses are interpreted to reveal hidden emotions and internal feelings. Examples include the Rorschach inkblot test or the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). Projective tests are often subjective and open to interpretation, which can lead to biases. Therefore, they might not hold up well in a legal challenge regarding adverse impact.\n\nB. Empirically keyed tests: These are tests developed based on statistical analysis to predict job performance. They are often used in selection processes. However, if these tests are not properly validated and show adverse impact, they could be challenged in court. The key here is whether they have been validated using job analysis and other standards to ensure they are measuring what they are supposed to measure.\n\nC. Work sample tests: These tests require candidates to perform actual job tasks as part of the selection process. For example, a typing test for a secretary position or a coding test for a programming job. Work sample tests are generally considered to be high in content validity because they directly measure skills needed for the job. They are also less likely to have adverse impact because they focus on specific job-related skills rather than more general abilities that might be influenced by cultural or other biases.\n\nD. Multiple-choice tests: These are tests consisting of a series of questions or problems, each followed by a number of possible answers. They are widely used in educational and employment testing. The validity and fairness of multiple-choice tests depend on how they are constructed and validated. If not properly designed, they can have adverse impact, especially if the content is biased towards a particular group.\n\nConsidering the options, work sample tests (option C) are probably the best choice in terms of withstanding legal challenges related to adverse impact. This is because they directly measure job-relevant skills and are less likely to be influenced by factors unrelated to job performance, such as cultural biases.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that no test is completely immune to legal challenges. All tests used in employment selection should undergo proper validation according to the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures to ensure they are fair and job-related.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
