It is based on the principle that when an electric current passes through a coil placed in a magnetic field, the coil experiences a torque proportional to the current.\n\nTraditionally, galvanometers were used primarily to measure electric current, and they could be calibrated to read in units of current, such as amperes or milliamperes. However, with some modifications, they can also be used to measure voltage.\n\nTo measure voltage, a high resistance is connected in series with the galvanometer, converting it into a voltmeter. The total resistance of the voltmeter determines the voltage range it can measure. Similarly, to measure current, a low resistance (shunt) is connected in parallel with the galvanometer, turning it into an ammeter.\n\nTherefore, with appropriate modifications, a galvanometer can be calibrated to read both electric current and voltage.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Either of these.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
