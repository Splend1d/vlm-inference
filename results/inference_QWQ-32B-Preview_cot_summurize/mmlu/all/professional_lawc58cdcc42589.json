On the day of the robbery, the three participants drove to the store in a stolen van. In accordance with their plan, the defendant was to wait in the getaway van while the two men conducted their heist. While the two men were inside the store, the defendant decided to renounce his involvement and participation in the scheme and hurriedly drove away in the van. In his haste, the defendant failed to see a pedesthan jaywalking across the street, and struck and killed the pedestrian.\nB. A defendant, accompanied by his girlfriend, was attending his law school graduation party. Both the defendant and his girlfriend became highly intoxicated during the party celebration. As the defendant and his girlfriend were leaving the party, the defendant handed his girlfriend the keys to his automobile and directed her to drive home. While driving, the girlfriend suddenly swerved the car across the median strip into the path of an oncoming car, killing the driver of the other vehicle.\nC. A defendant, whose driver's license had been revoked one week previously, was driving on an infrequently traveled country road one night. Knowing that his car brakes were defective, the defendant was traveling at 35 m. p. h. in a zone in which the speed limit was 25 m. p. h. when a victim suddenly darted in front of his car. In an effort to avoid striking the victim, the defendant applied his brakes to no avail. The car struck and killed the victim.\nD. One afternoon a defendant was delivering pornographic materials to various adult bookstores in the community. In this jurisdiction, the delivery of pornographic materials constituted a misdemeanor. As the defendant was on his way to a book store for his final delivery of the day, he inadvertently struck a blind man who was crossing an intersection. Six months later, the blind man died as a result of injuries suffered in the accident.\n"

Murder is a serious crime, usually involving the unlawful killing of another person with malice aforethought. That means there was either an intent to kill, or a reckless disregard for human life that resulted in death.\n\nOption A: Here, the defendant was part of a robbery plan but decided to leave before the robbery happened. Unfortunately, in his haste to leave, he hit and killed a pedestrian who was jaywalking. So, he was involved in a felony, but the death occurred while he was fleeing, not during the commission of the felony. In many jurisdictions, felony murder requires that the death occur during the commission of the felony. Since he had renounced his participation by leaving, it might be harder to tie the death directly to the felony. Additionally, hitting a jaywalker might be considered negligent, but probably not with the malice required for murder.\n\nOption B: The defendant gave his intoxicated girlfriend the keys to drive home. She then caused an accident that led to someone's death. Here, the question is whether the defendant is responsible for his girlfriend's actions. If he knew she was intoxicated and still allowed her to drive, that could be seen as reckless endangerment. However, murder requires a higher degree of intent or recklessness. It's possible he could face vehicular manslaughter or something similar, but murder seems less likely unless there's a specific law holding individuals responsible for the actions of their intoxicated guests.\n\nOption C: The defendant was driving with a revoked license, over the speed limit, and with defective brakes. He hit and killed someone who darted in front of his car. This seems like a case of careless driving leading to death. While his actions were negligent, and possibly reckless, the question is whether they rise to the level of malice required for murder. In many places, vehicular homicide or manslaughter might be more appropriate charges, but again, murder seems steep unless there's a pattern of reckless behavior or prior knowledge of the defects that showed a conscious disregard for human life.\n\nOption D: The defendant was delivering pornographic materials, which is a misdemeanor in this jurisdiction. He accidentally hit a blind man who later died from the injuries. Since the underlying offense is only a misdemeanor, it's less likely to support a murder charge. Typically, felony murder requires that the death occur during the commission of a felony. Here, it's a misdemeanor, so the circumstances don't seem to meet the threshold for murder.\n\nConsidering all these options, none of them perfectly align with the typical elements of murder. However, Option C might come closest if the defendant's actions demonstrated a reckless disregard for human life. Driving with known defective brakes, over the speed limit, and with a revoked license could indicate a conscious indifference to the safety of others. If the court finds that this level of recklessness rises to the level of malice aforethought, then it's possible the defendant could be found guilty of murder.\n\nBut generally, murder convictions require a higher degree of intent or recklessness. Options A, B, and D seem more aligned with lesser offenses like manslaughter or vehicular homicide. Therefore, Option C is the most likely scenario to result in a murder conviction, assuming the defendant's actions exhibited extreme negligence or reckless disregard for human life.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
