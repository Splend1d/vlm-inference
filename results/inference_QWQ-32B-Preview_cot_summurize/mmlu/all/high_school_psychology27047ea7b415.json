They contain fluid and tiny hair cells that sense the rotation of the head, which helps our brain adjust our posture and maintain equilibrium.\n\nOption A, tone quality, seems related to sound, but I believe that's more associated with the cochlea in the inner ear, not the semicircular canals. Option B, melatonin, is a hormone related to sleep cycles, and that's produced by the pineal gland in the brain, not the inner ear. Option D, olfaction, is about smell, which is handled by the olfactory system, not the inner ear.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is C. balance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
