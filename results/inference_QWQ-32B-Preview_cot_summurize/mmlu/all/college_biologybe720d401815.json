                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement correctly describes where mitochondria and chloroplasts are found, especially in plants, animals, and fungi.\n\nFirst, I know that mitochondria are often called the \"powerhouses\" of the cell because they generate energy in the form of ATP. They are present in almost all eukaryotic cells, which include plants, animals, and fungi.\n\nChloroplasts, on the other hand, are found in plant cells and some other eukaryotes like algae. They are responsible for photosynthesis, which is how plants make their food using sunlight.\n\nSo, let's look at option A: \"Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have mitochondria but no chloroplasts.\"\n\nWait a minute, I think plants do have mitochondria because they need energy just like animals do. Photosynthesis provides them with sugar, but they still need mitochondria to break down that sugar into usable energy. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says: \"Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts.\"\n\nAgain, I believe plants do have mitochondria, so this can't be right.\n\nOption C: \"Plants and fungi have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have only mitochondria.\"\n\nThis also suggests that plants and fungi have chloroplasts, which I don't think is accurate. Fungi don't perform photosynthesis, so they shouldn't have chloroplasts.\n\nOption D: \"Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria; animals and fungi have only mitochondria.\"\n\nThis seems more logical. Plants need both to perform photosynthesis and energy production, while animals and fungi, which don't photosynthesize, only need mitochondria for energy.\n\nTo confirm, let me think about fungi. Fungi are heterotrophs, meaning they obtain their nutrients from other organisms. They don't have chloroplasts because they don't make their own food through photosynthesis. They do have mitochondria to produce energy from the nutrients they absorb.\n\nAnimals also don't have chloroplasts; they obtain their energy by consuming other organisms and using mitochondria to break down the nutrients.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option D appears to be the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
