                    "text": "Let's think about this question step by step. We need to identify which of the given options could lead to autocorrelated residuals in a regression model. Autocorrelation in residuals means that the error terms are not independent of each other; instead, they are correlated over time or across observations. This is particularly a concern in time series data.\n\nOption (i): Slowness of response of the dependent variable to changes in the values of the independent variables.\n\nThis makes sense. If the dependent variable doesn't adjust immediately to changes in the independent variables, there might be a carryover effect from one period to the next. For example, if you're modeling the effect of advertising on sales, and the impact of advertising is gradual and builds up over time, then the residuals might be autocorrelated because the full effect isn't captured in the current period.\n\nOption (ii): Over-reactions of the dependent variable to changes in the independent variables.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. If the dependent variable overreacts to changes in the independent variables, it might lead to oscillations or adjustments in subsequent periods to correct the overreaction. This could potentially cause autocorrelation in the residuals, as the overreaction in one period might be followed by a correction in the next period, creating a pattern in the residuals.\n\nOption (iii): Omission of relevant explanatory variables that are autocorrelated.\n\nYes, this is a common cause of autocorrelation in residuals. If there are important variables that are related to the dependent variable and are themselves autocorrelated, and these variables are not included in the model, their effects will be captured in the residuals, leading to autocorrelation in the residuals.\n\nOption (iv): Outliers in the data.\n\nOutliers can certainly affect the residuals, but they don't necessarily lead to autocorrelation. Outliers might cause individual residuals to be large, but unless there is a pattern to these outliers, they won't necessarily create correlation between residuals over time or across observations.\n\nSo, considering all this, options (i), (ii), and (iii) can lead to autocorrelated residuals, while (iv) might affect the residuals but doesn't necessarily cause autocorrelation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where outliers could lead to autocorrelation?\n\nWell, if outliers occur in a systematic way over time, perhaps they could induce some autocorrelation. For example, if there's a trend in the outliers, that could potentially lead to autocorrelation in the residuals. However, generally speaking, outliers are random and don't follow a pattern, so they shouldn't cause autocorrelation.\n\nGiven that, I think sticking with C is the safest choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
