                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option Mill thinks is the strongest objection to utilitarianism. The choices are duty, justice, virtue, and supererogation. I need to recall what Mill says about objections to utilitarianism.\n\nFirst, I remember that utilitarianism is about maximizing happiness or utility. So, objections to it would likely challenge this principle or its implications.\n\nOption A is duty. I think deontological ethics emphasize duty over consequences. Maybe some people object to utilitarianism because it seems to ignore duties or rules that we consider important.\n\nOption B is justice. Justice is a big concept, but I recall that utilitarianism can sometimes lead to outcomes that seem unjust because it focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number. Maybe sacrificing one for the many is an issue here.\n\nOption C is virtue. Virtue ethics focuses on character and virtues like courage and temperance. Perhaps the objection is that utilitarianism doesn't place enough importance on developing virtuous characters.\n\nOption D is supererogation. Supererogatory actions are those that go above and beyond duty. Maybe the objection is that utilitarianism doesn't handle the concept of supererogation well.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these objections Mill considers the strongest. I think Mill discusses justice quite extensively in his defense of utilitarianism. In \"Utilitarianism,\" he has a whole section on justice where he tries to incorporate it into the utilitarian framework.\n\nLet me recall what Mill says about justice. He acknowledges that there is a strong feeling associated with justice, and that violations of justice evoke a strong sense of indignation. He tries to explain why this is the case within a utilitarian framework.\n\nMill argues that justice is a special case of utility, where the interests that are protected are particularly important and pressing. He says that justice often involves the protection of rights, and that the feeling of justice is strong because these rights are crucial for well-being.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Mill recognizes justice as a significant aspect that utilitarianism needs to account for. Therefore, perhaps the strongest objection to utilitarianism comes from the concept of justice.\n\nLet me check option A, duty. While Mill does address deontological ethics and the idea of duty, it doesn't seem to be the central objection he discusses at length.\n\nOption C, virtue, also seems relevant, but again, Mill might not consider it the strongest objection.\n\nOption D, supererogation, is perhaps a more niche concept, and I don't recall Mill discussing it extensively in \"Utilitarianism.\"\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B, justice. Mill likely considers the objection from justice to be the strongest because it touches on fundamental moral intuitions about rights and fairness, which utilitarianism needs to accommodate.\n\nTo confirm, I can look back at Mill's \"Utilitarianism,\" particularly in Chapter V, \"On the Connection between Justice and Utility.\" There, he delves into the relationship between justice and utility, suggesting that justice is a part of utility concerning certain classes of moral rules which are more absolutely binding.\n\nThis further supports the idea that justice is the source of the strongest objection to utilitarianism, as Mill dedicates significant effort to addressing it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
