                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about the spine, and I need to pick the true statement among the options. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Back pain is an uncommon complaint.\" Hmm, I don't think that's true. Back pain is actually very common. I've heard that a lot of people experience back pain at some point in their lives. So, this might be false.\n\nOption B: \"Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine.\" I recall that Schober's test is used in the evaluation of spinal disorders, particularly ankylosing spondylitis. It measures the flexibility of the lumbar spine by having the patient bend forward and measuring the increase in distance between specific points on the back. So, this seems like it could be true.\n\nOption C: \"Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of hypermobility of the spine.\" Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that affects the spine, causing inflammation and stiffness. I think it leads to reduced mobility and fusion of the spinal bones, not hypermobility. So, this might be false.\n\nOption D: \"Pregnancy is a cause of loss of lordosis of the lumbar spine.\" Pregnancy can certainly affect posture and the curvature of the spine due to the growing baby and changes in the body's center of gravity. However, I'm not sure if it directly causes a loss of lordosis. Maybe it causes changes in the curves, but I need to think about this more.\n\nLet me consider Option B again. Schober's test is indeed used to assess the flexibility of the lumbar spine. It's a simple test where markings are made on the back at specific intervals, and the increase in distance between these points is measured when the patient bends forward. This helps quantify the amount of flexion in the lumbar spine, which can be reduced in conditions like ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nComparing this with the other options, Option A is likely false because back pain is common, not uncommon. Option C seems false because ankylosing spondylitis causes stiffness and reduced mobility, not hypermobility. Option D might not be accurate because pregnancy can lead to postural changes, but I don't think it specifically causes a loss of lordosis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely correct answer is Option B: Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
