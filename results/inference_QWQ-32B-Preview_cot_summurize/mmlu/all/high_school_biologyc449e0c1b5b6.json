                    "text": "So I've got this question here about DNA, mRNA, and tRNA sequences, and I need to figure out what the nucleotide sequence of the tRNA anticodon is, given the DNA sequence. The DNA sequence is 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how transcription works. Transcription is the process where DNA is copied into mRNA. The mRNA sequence is complementary to the DNA template strand. So, given the DNA sequence 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032, this must be the template strand because transcription occurs from DNA to mRNA.\n\nIn DNA, the bases are Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Thymine (T). In mRNA, Uracil (U) replaces Thymine (T).\n\nSo, the mRNA sequence would be complementary to the DNA template strand:\n\n- DNA: 5\u2032- C - A - T -3\u2032\n\n- mRNA: 3\u2032- G - U - A -5\u2032\n\nWait, no. Actually, transcription proceeds in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction on the DNA template strand, so the mRNA is synthesized in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction.\n\nLet me correct that. The DNA template strand is 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032, so the mRNA transcribed from it would have:\n\n- C pairs with G (in mRNA, it's U, but in this case, it's mRNA, so G)\n\n- A pairs with U\n\n- T pairs with A\n\nSo, the mRNA sequence should be:\n\n5\u2032- G - U - A -3\u2032\n\nWait, but transcription is from DNA template strand 3\u2032 to 5\u2032, but mRNA is synthesized 5\u2032 to 3\u2032. So, if the DNA template strand is 5\u2032-C-A-T-3\u2032, then the mRNA sequence would be 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, during translation, tRNA molecules bring amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA sequence. Each tRNA has an anticodon that is complementary to the mRNA codon.\n\nSo, the mRNA codon is 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032, and the tRNA anticodon should pair with it.\n\nIn mRNA, the reading frame is 5\u2032 to 3\u2032, and the anticodon of tRNA pairs with the codon on mRNA in a specific way.\n\nI think it's important to remember that the anticodon on tRNA pairs with the codon on mRNA in an antiparallel orientation. That means the 5\u2032 end of the anticodon pairs with the 3\u2032 end of the codon, and vice versa.\n\nSo, if the mRNA codon is 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032, then the tRNA anticodon should be 3\u2032-U-A-C-5\u2032.\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nAnticodon pairs with codon in the following way:\n\n- Codon: 5\u2032 - G - U - A -3\u2032\n\n- Anticodon: 3\u2032 - U - A - C -5\u2032\n\nBecause A pairs with U, and G pairs with C.\n\nWait, but tRNA anticodons are written in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, just like the mRNA codons.\n\nSo, to pair with the mRNA codon 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032, the tRNA anticodon should be 5\u2032-U-A-C-3\u2032.\n\nBecause:\n\n- G pairs with C (in tRNA anticodon)\n\n- U pairs with A\n\n- A pairs with U\n\nWait, no. Hold on.\n\nActually, in the standard base pairing for RNA:\n\n- A pairs with U\n\n- G pairs with C\n\nSo, for the mRNA codon 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032:\n\n- G in mRNA pairs with C in tRNA\n\n- U in mRNA pairs with A in tRNA\n\n- A in mRNA pairs with U in tRNA\n\nTherefore, the tRNA anticodon should be 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because if the mRNA is 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032, then the anticodon should be 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032, but according to the options, that's choice C.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nmRNA codon: 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032\n\ntRNA anticodon: 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032\n\nBecause:\n\n- G (mRNA) pairs with C (tRNA)\n\n- U (mRNA) pairs with A (tRNA)\n\n- A (mRNA) pairs with U (tRNA)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 5\u2032-G-T-A-3\u2032\n\nB. 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032\n\nC. 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032\n\nD. 5\u2032-U-A-C-3\u2032\n\nSo, option C matches the sequence I derived: 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032.\n\nWait, but in option D, it's 5\u2032-U-A-C-3\u2032, which is the sequence I initially thought before correcting myself.\n\nBut according to the base pairing rules, option C is correct.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure about the directionality.\n\ntRNA anticodons are typically written in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, just like mRNA codons.\n\nSo, if mRNA codon is 5\u2032-G-U-A-3\u2032, then the anticodon should be 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032 to pair with it.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 5\u2032-C-A-U-3\u2032.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any wobble pairing or other factors that might affect this.\n\nIn standard pairing, as in this case, there's no wobble; it's straightforward complementarity.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
