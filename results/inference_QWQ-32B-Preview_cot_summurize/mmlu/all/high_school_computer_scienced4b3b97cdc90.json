                    "text": "So I've got this question about digital images and which transformation is considered lossless. Let's see what each option is saying.\n\nOption A: It talks about compressing the image in a way that might lose some information but only causes a small loss of image quality. Hmm, compression often reduces file size by removing some data, especially in formats like JPEG, which is lossy. So, if it's losing information, even if it's just a small amount, that means it's not lossless. Lossless means no information is lost; you can reconstruct the original image perfectly. So, A doesn't sound like lossless.\n\nOption B: This one is about creating a grayscale image by averaging the RGB values of each pixel and assigning that average as the new value, which represents shades of gray from white to black. Now, converting a color image to grayscale means we're discarding the color information and keeping only the brightness levels. That sounds like a loss of information because we're losing the color data. So, even though we're creating a new image, it's not preserving all the original data, which means it's not lossless.\n\nOption C: Here, it's about creating a negative of the image by subtracting each RGB value from 255. So, for example, if a pixel has RGB values of (100, 150, 200), the negative would be (155, 105, 55). This seems like a reversible operation because if I have the negative, I can subtract each value from 255 again to get back the original values. So, it's like a transformation that can be undone without losing any information. That sounds like a lossless transformation.\n\nOption D: This one is about modifying part of the image by copying pixels from one area to another. So, if I take pixels from section A and paste them over section B, I'm overwriting the original pixels in section B. That means the original information in section B is lost forever unless I have a backup. So, that's not lossless because information is being overwritten and lost.\n\nComparing all these options, option C seems to be the only one that describes a lossless transformation because it's a reversible process; I can always get back to the original image by applying the same transformation again.\n\nBut let me double-check. In option C, if I take each pixel's RGB values, subtract them from 255 to get the negative, and then if I subtract those new values again from 255, I should get back the original values. Let's test with an example:\n\nOriginal pixel: (100, 150, 200)\n\nNegative: (155, 105, 55)\n\nNegative of the negative: (100, 150, 200) \u2013 exactly back to original.\n\nSo, yes, it's reversible, meaning no information is lost in the process.\n\nIn contrast, option B, converting to grayscale, involves averaging the RGB values. For example, if a pixel is (255, 0, 0) \u2013 pure red \u2013 the grayscale value would be (85, 85, 85), assuming equal averaging. But if I try to reverse this, I can't determine what the original colors were because multiple color combinations can result in the same grayscale value. So, information is lost.\n\nSimilarly, option A involves compression with potential loss of quality, which means losing some data to make the file smaller.\n\nOption D involves overwriting parts of the image, which directly results in loss of the original data in those areas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: creating the negative of an image by subtracting each RGB value from 255, which is a reversible transformation and thus lossless.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
