This is often associated with low oxygen saturation levels. Normal oxygen saturation levels are typically above 95%, and levels below 90% can be considered low. However, cyanosis usually becomes clinically apparent when oxygen saturation drops to around 85% or lower, but more severely when it's 80% or below. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 80% or below.\n\nTo provide more context:\n\n- Option A (98% or above): This is within the normal range for oxygen saturation, and there would be no cyanosis.\n\n- Option B (94% or above): While 94% is slightly below the ideal range, mild desaturations may not always cause visible cyanosis, but generally, cyanosis is not expected at this level.\n\n- Option D (85% or above): Cyanosis might start to appear around 85% saturation, but it's more prominently seen below 85%.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the visibility of cyanosis can vary depending on the individual's skin tone and the severity of hypoxemia. In some cases, cyanosis may be apparent at higher saturation levels, while in others, it may not be visible until the saturation is quite low.\n\nAdditionally, central cyanosis, which is cyanosis of the core body areas like the lips, tongue, and fingernail beds, is a sign of systemic hypoxia and typically indicates low arterial oxygen saturation. Peripheral cyanosis, affecting the extremities, can be due to poor circulation rather than low oxygen saturation.\n\nIn clinical practice, pulse oximetry is commonly used to monitor oxygen saturation non-invasively, and it's a useful tool for detecting hypoxemia before cyanosis becomes visible.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n- Cyanosis is a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to low oxygen levels in the blood.\n\n- It typically becomes clinically apparent when oxygen saturation drops to around 85% or lower, but is more definitively present at 80% or below.\n\n- Normal oxygen saturation is generally above 95%.\n\n- Pulse oximetry is a useful tool for monitoring oxygen saturation.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Marino, P.
