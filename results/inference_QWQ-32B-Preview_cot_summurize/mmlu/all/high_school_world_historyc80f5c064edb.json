                    "text": "So I've got this question here about what contributed least to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E. And there are four options: A. The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe; B. Refinement of gunpowder technologies; C. The development and application of steam-powered technologies; D. The implementation of joint-stock companies.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what global hegemony means in this context. It probably refers to the dominance of Western European powers in terms of politics, economy, and culture over other parts of the world during that period.\n\nNow, looking at the time frame, 1450 to 1750 C.E., that covers the late Middle Ages through the Age of Exploration and up to the Industrial Revolution. So, it's a crucial period where Western Europe started to assert its influence globally.\n\nOption A is about the exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe. This is often referred to as the Columbian Exchange. It involved the transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World. In terms of food, crops like potatoes, maize, and tomatoes went from the Americas to Europe, while wheat, rice, and domesticated animals like horses and cattle went from Europe to the Americas.\n\nThis exchange had a profound impact on both regions. In Europe, the introduction of new food sources led to population growth because they provided more calories and variety in diet. Potatoes, for example, became a staple food in many European countries, helping to support larger populations. This demographic increase provided a larger workforce for industries and military expansions.\n\nSo, the exchange of food sources definitely contributed to Western European hegemony by supporting population growth and economic development.\n\nOption B is about the refinement of gunpowder technologies. Gunpowder was invented in China and spread to the Islamic world and then to Europe. By the time we reach the 15th century, Europeans had developed various firearms and artillery, which gave them a military advantage over many other societies they encountered during their explorations and conquests.\n\nHaving more advanced weaponry allowed European powers to conquer and colonize other parts of the world more easily. So, this is another significant factor in their hegemony.\n\nOption C is about the development and application of steam-powered technologies. Now, steam power is closely associated with the Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, around the 1760s, with James Watt's improvements to the steam engine. This period saw a shift from manual labor and draft animals to machine-based manufacturing.\n\nHowever, the time frame we're looking at is up to 1750 C.E., which is just before the Industrial Revolution really took off. So, steam-powered technologies were not yet developed or applied on a significant scale during this period.\n\nTherefore, this option seems like it might be the one that contributed least to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E., because it hadn't fully emerged yet.\n\nOption D is about the implementation of joint-stock companies. Joint-stock companies allowed multiple investors to pool their resources into a single business entity, sharing both the costs and the profits. This was a crucial development in finance and economics, as it allowed for larger-scale investments and risk distribution.\n\nDuring the 16th to 18th centuries, many European nations established joint-stock companies to manage their colonial trade and operations, such as the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company. These companies played a significant role in establishing and maintaining European control over overseas territories.\n\nSo, joint-stock companies were instrumental in financing and organizing colonial enterprises, which were key to European hegemony.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems that option C, the development and application of steam-powered technologies, contributed least to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E., because steam power was not yet a significant factor until later in the 18th century.\n\nThe other options\u2014exchange of food sources, gunpowder technologies, and joint-stock companies\u2014all played important roles in enabling European expansion and dominance during that period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
