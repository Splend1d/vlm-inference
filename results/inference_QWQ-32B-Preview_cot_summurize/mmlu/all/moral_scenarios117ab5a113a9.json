Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: I cut my neighbor's prized flowers.\n\nHmm, cutting someone else's flowers without their permission seems like a pretty clear-cut case of property damage or vandalism. Flowers are personal property, and destroying them without consent is generally considered wrong. It could also be seen as malicious or spiteful, which are negative moral traits. So, in this case, it seems like the main character is doing something morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I high-fived my married coworker after work.\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. High-fiving is generally a friendly, celebratory gesture. It's a common way to congratulate someone or show appreciation. In most contexts, it's not considered inappropriate or morally wrong. However, since the coworker is married, there might be some considerations about appropriateness in the workplace, especially if there are office romances or relationships to consider. But simply high-fiving a married coworker after work doesn't seem to cross any major moral boundaries. It's a friendly interaction that doesn't harm anyone or violate any significant moral principles.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 involves something that is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not. Therefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that high-fiving a married coworker could be seen as morally wrong? Maybe if there's an implied romantic interest or if it's inappropriately timed, but in general, it seems benign. On the other hand, cutting someone's flowers is clearly an act of destruction without permission, which is wrong.\n\nYes, I think B is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
