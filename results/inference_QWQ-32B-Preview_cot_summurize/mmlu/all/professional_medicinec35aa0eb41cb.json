Physical examination shows bilateral 1.5-cm fibroglandular masses located beneath the nipple-areolar complex and normal penis and testes. Pubic hair development is Tanner stage 3. Serum concentrations of gonadotropic hormones, estrogens, and testosterone are within the reference ranges. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's breast enlargement?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 14-year-old boy who's supposed to get a physical exam before playing sports, but he's really shy about taking off his shirt because he's got these breast-like growths that have developed over the past year. According to the description, he's average height and weight, and during the exam, the doctor finds these two small, fibrous masses right under his nipples. His private parts seem normal, and his pubic hair is developing as expected for his age.\n\nThey also did some blood tests to check hormone levels, and everything seems to be in the normal range\u2014gonadotropins, estrogens, and testosterone are all where they should be.\n\nNow, the question is asking what's most likely causing his breast enlargement. There are four options:\n\nA. Estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor\n\nB. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome\n\nC. Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (which is another name for Klinefelter syndrome)\n\nD. Normal development\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the patient is 14 years old, which is right in the middle of puberty for most boys. During puberty, it's normal for there to be some hormonal fluctuations that can lead to breast tissue development in males. This is sometimes called gynecomastia, which just means enlargement of the male breast tissue.\n\nGiven that his hormone levels are all within the normal range, and his physical exam shows normal genitalia and appropriate pubic hair development, it suggests that his puberty is proceeding normally.\n\nOption A is an estradiol-secreting Leydig cell tumor. Leydig cells are in the testes and usually produce testosterone. If they were producing estradiol, which is an estrogen, that could lead to breast enlargement. However, the blood tests show that his estrogen levels are normal, so it's less likely that he has a tumor secreting extra estrogen.\n\nOption B, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, is a genetic condition that causes polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and can lead to intestinal problems. It's also associated with a specific skin pigmentation around the eyes, mouth, and hands. But there's no mention of any intestinal symptoms or characteristic skin spots in this patient's description, so it seems unrelated to his breast enlargement.\n\nOption C is seminiferous tubule dysgenesis, which is another term for Klinefelter syndrome. Klinefelter syndrome is when a male has an extra X chromosome, so instead of XY, he has XXY. This can lead to small testes, reduced fertility, and sometimes gynecomastia due to imbalances in hormone levels. However, the physical exam shows normal penis and testes, and hormone levels are normal, so it's unlikely that he has Klinefelter syndrome.\n\nOption D is normal development. Given that he's going through puberty, and his hormone levels are normal, it's possible that this is just a normal variant of puberty where some breast tissue develops temporarily.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most likely answer is D. Normal development.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about why the other options aren't as likely.\n\n- Option A: The hormone levels are normal, so a tumor secreting estradiol would probably alter those levels, but they're within normal ranges.\n\n- Option B: No symptoms or signs suggestive of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are mentioned.\n\n- Option C: Normal genitalia and hormone levels make Klinefelter syndrome unlikely.\n\nTherefore, it seems that this is a case of normal pubertal development, and the breast enlargement will likely regress over time as his hormone levels stabilize.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
