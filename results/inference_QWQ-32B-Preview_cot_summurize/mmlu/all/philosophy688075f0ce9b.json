The Categorical Imperative is a moral law that applies universally and unconditionally, regardless of personal desires or consequences. One formulation of the Categorical Imperative is: \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\"\n\nIn the context of lying promises, Kant argues that if everyone were to make lying promises, the very institution of promising would break down. Promises rely on trust and the expectation that people will keep their word. If lying promises became\u666e\u904d, no one would trust promises anymore, and the concept would lose its meaning and utility.\n\nTherefore, Kant would consider making a lying promise to be morally wrong because it is impossible to universalize such an action without leading to a contradiction or a situation where the action defeats its own purpose. This is known as the \"contradiction in conception\" test within Kant's moral framework.\n\nOption A, \"lying to people can cause them harm,\" is more aligned with consequentialist ethics, which focuses on the outcomes of actions, whereas Kant's ethics is deontological, focusing on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, regardless of their consequences.\n\nOption B, \"lying to people harms society,\" is similar to A but broadens the harm to society as a whole. While Kant does consider the social implications of actions, his moral theory is more concerned with the universality and consistency of the maxim being acted upon.\n\nOption D, \"most people condemn the practice,\" relates to moral consensus or the opinion of the majority, which again is not the primary concern in Kant's deontological ethics. For Kant, morality is not determined by popular opinion but by rational principles that are universally binding.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer according to Kant's moral philosophy is C: you could not consistently will that everyone should make lying promises.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nKant, I.
