                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about corrective lenses for myopia. So, first things first, I need to understand what myopia is and how corrective lenses work for it.\n\nMyopia, or nearsightedness, is a condition where a person can see close objects clearly, but distant objects appear blurry. This happens because the eye's lens is too strong or the eyeball is too long, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it.\n\nNow, corrective lenses are used to adjust the focal point so that light hits the retina correctly. Since myopic eyes have lenses that are too strong, the corrective lenses need to weaken the overall focusing power of the eye. That's why myopic prescriptions are negative, like -5 diopters in this case.\n\nDiopters are a unit of measurement for the refractive power of lenses. A -5 diopter lens is a diverging lens, which means it spreads out the light rays before they enter the eye. This reduces the convergence of light rays, effectively moving the focal point back onto the retina.\n\nSo, the question is asking what image corrective lenses create for distant objects in a myopic eye with a -5 diopter prescription.\n\nLet's recall some optics basics. Lenses can form real or virtual images, and these images can be upright or inverted, depending on the type of lens and the position of the object.\n\nFor a diverging lens, like the -5 diopter lens, and for objects that are very far away, the image formed will be virtual, upright, and located on the same side as the object.\n\nWait, but let's think about this in the context of corrective lenses. The lenses are placed in front of the eye to adjust the light rays so that they appear to come from a point that the eye can focus on properly.\n\nIn this case, the corrective lenses are diverging lenses that take the incoming parallel rays from distant objects and diverge them, making it seem like they are coming from a virtual object at a certain distance in front of the eye.\n\nSo, for a -5 diopter lens, what is the focal length? The focal length f is the reciprocal of the diopter power, but since the power is negative, the focal length is also negative.\n\nSo, f = 1 / P = 1 / (-5 D) = -0.2 m = -20 cm.\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the focal point is on the same side as the object, which is characteristic of a diverging lens.\n\nNow, for a diverging lens, when the object is at infinity, the image is formed at the focal point on the same side as the object. But in this case, since the lenses are corrective, they are designed to make the light appear as if it's coming from a point that the eye can focus on.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the eye's lens as well. The corrective lenses are working in conjunction with the eye's own lens.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the eye as a simple camera model, where the corrective lenses are placed in front to adjust the light before it enters the eye.\n\nSo, for a myopic eye, without corrective lenses, parallel rays from a distant object are focused in front of the retina. To correct this, we need a diverging lens that will spread out the rays so that, when they enter the eye, they are diverging in such a way that the eye's lens focuses them right on the retina.\n\nSo, the corrective lenses create a virtual image of the distant object at a certain distance in front of the eye, which the eye's lens can then focus on the retina.\n\nGiven that the prescription is -5 diopters, and the focal length is -20 cm, the virtual image should be formed at 20 cm in front of the lenses.\n\nTherefore, the image created by the corrective lenses is an upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this.\n\nIn optics, for a diverging lens, when the object is at infinity, the image is formed at the focal point, which is virtual and on the same side as the object.\n\nSo, in this case, the corrective lenses are diverging lenses with f = -20 cm.\n\nObject distance, o = infinity\n\nImage distance, i = f = -20 cm\n\nThe image is virtual, upright, and located 20 cm in front of the lenses.\n\nSince the lenses are placed in front of the eye, the image would be 20 cm in front of the lenses, which is also 20 cm in front of the eye.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option B: An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor I might be missing.\n\nPerhaps the eye's own lens needs to be considered. Normally, the eye's lens can adjust its focal length to focus on objects at different distances, but in myopia, this ability is compromised for distant objects.\n\nCorrective lenses are designed to compensate for this by making the light rays appear as if they are coming from a closer distance that the eye can focus on.\n\nSo, in this case, the corrective lenses create a virtual image at 20 cm in front of the eyes, and then the eye's own lens focuses on this virtual object.\n\nWait, but can the eye focus on a virtual object that is only 20 cm away?\n\nWell, in myopia, the eye has trouble focusing on distant objects, but for closer objects, it can focus better. So, by bringing the image closer to 20 cm in front of the eye, the eye's lens can now focus on it properly.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options:\n\nA. An upright, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.\n\nReal images are formed when light rays actually converge, but diverging lenses don't form real images for objects at infinity. They form virtual images. So, this can't be correct.\n\nC. An inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes.\n\nAgain, diverging lenses don't form real images for objects at infinity. And even if they did, the image would not be inverted. So, this is incorrect.\n\nD. An inverted, virtual image 5 cm behind her eyes.\n\nVirtual images formed by diverging lenses are upright, not inverted, and they are located on the same side as the object, not behind the eyes.\n\nTherefore, the only plausible option is B: An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
