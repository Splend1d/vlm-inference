                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about equity theory in close personal relationships. So, equity theory is all about fairness and balance in relationships. It suggests that people evaluate their relationships by comparing their inputs and outputs with those of their partners or with others in similar relationships.\n\nOption A says that satisfaction is related to one's own contribution/reward ratio and that of their partner. This sounds like it's getting at the heart of equity theory. In equity theory, people calculate their contribution-to-reward ratio and compare it to their partner's ratio. If they feel that their ratio is comparable to their partner's, they tend to feel satisfied. But if there's a discrepancy, like feeling that they're putting in more than they're getting out compared to their partner, that can lead to dissatisfaction.\n\nOption B mentions perceptions of the relative utility of the relationship. Utility here probably refers to the overall value or satisfaction one gets from the relationship. While this is important in relationship satisfaction, it's not specifically about equity or fairness, which is the focus of equity theory.\n\nOption C talks about comparisons between one's current relationship and past relationships. While people might look back and compare, equity theory is more about the current balance within the relationship itself, not so much about historical comparisons.\n\nOption D is about comparisons between one's own relationship outcomes and those of others. This sounds a lot like social comparison theory, where people assess their own situations by comparing themselves to others. While social comparison can influence relationship satisfaction, equity theory is more focused on the internal balance within the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, option A seems to be the most accurate description of what equity theory predicts regarding satisfaction in close personal relationships. It's directly about perceiving one's own contribution and reward ratio in comparison to one's partner's ratio.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
