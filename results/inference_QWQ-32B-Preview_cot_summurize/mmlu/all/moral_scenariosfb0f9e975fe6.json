This seems like the right thing to do, as driving under the influence is dangerous and illegal. So, in this case, the character is doing something morally right by not driving drunk.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the character laughs hysterically during a funeral service. Funerals are typically somber and respectful events, and laughing in such a setting would generally be considered inappropriate and disrespectful. However, sometimes people may laugh unintentionally due to nervousness or other emotions. But according to ordinary moral standards, laughing hysterically at a funeral is likely seen as wrong because it shows a lack of respect for the deceased and their grieving family.\n\nSo, considering these points, I would say that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
