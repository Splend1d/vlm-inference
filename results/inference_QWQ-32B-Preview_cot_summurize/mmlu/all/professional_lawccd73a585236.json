                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a stationery store and a wholesaler of office supply equipment. The stationery store sent a purchase order for 24 pairs of 3.5-inch, right-handed scissors at $4 per pair, and the wholesaler received it on August 12. The wholesaler checked their stock and found only 18 pairs of right-handed scissors but had six pairs of left-handed scissors instead. Without notifying the stationery store, the wholesaler shipped all 24 pairs (18 right-handed and 6 left-handed) to the stationery store. The stationery store knew that left-handed scissors were priced at $3 per pair, which is $1 less than the right-handed ones.\n\nNow, the question is whether an enforceable contract was formed when the wholesaler shipped the 24 pairs of scissors to the stationery store. There are four options provided, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nOption A says yes, because the wholesaler's shipment constituted acceptance of the offer, absent a seasonable notification by the wholesaler to the stationery store that the shipment was made for accommodation only.\n\nOption B says yes, because the wholesaler acted in good faith in making the shipment in reliance on the stationery store's offer.\n\nOption C says no, because the wholesaler could accept the stationery store's offer only by a prompt promise to ship the goods ordered.\n\nOption D says no, because acceptance by performance of an offer for immediate or prompt shipment is legally binding, unless the nonconforming goods are not reasonably resalable.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the nature of the purchase order and the shipment. The purchase order is essentially an offer from the stationery store to buy 24 pairs of right-handed scissors at $4 per pair. The wholesaler received this offer on August 12.\n\nThe wholesaler then shipped 18 pairs of right-handed scissors and 6 pairs of left-handed scissors without notifying the stationery store about the substitution. So, the shipment includes both conforming and nonconforming goods.\n\nIn contract law, acceptance of an offer can be made through performance, especially in cases where the offer requests shipment of goods. However, there are rules regarding the acceptance by performance, particularly when the shipment includes nonconforming goods.\n\nLet me recall the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) provisions related to this scenario, as it deals with sales of goods.\n\nUnder UCC \u00a7 2-207, when the offer specifies the goods and the quantity, the acceptance must conform to the terms of the offer. If the acceptance deviates from the terms of the offer, it can be considered a counteroffer rather than an acceptance.\n\nIn this case, the stationery store offered to buy 24 pairs of right-handed scissors. The wholesaler shipped 18 pairs of right-handed scissors and 6 pairs of left-handed scissors. This is a nonconforming shipment because it includes left-handed scissors instead of the specified right-handed ones.\n\nNow, UCC \u00a7 2-207(1)(b) states that a definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a shipment of conforming or nonconforming goods, or both, may be an acceptance.\n\nBut in this scenario, the shipment includes nonconforming goods. So, does this constitute an acceptance?\n\nUCC \u00a7 2-207(1)(b) also provides that if the acceptance is made by a shipment of nonconforming goods, and the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is made only upon the condition that it constitutes acceptance, then the contract is on that basis.\n\nIn this case, the wholesaler did not notify the stationery store that the shipment was made only upon the condition that it constitutes acceptance. Therefore, according to UCC \u00a7 2-207(1)(b), the shipment does not constitute acceptance unless the seller makes such a notification.\n\nMoreover, UCC \u00a7 2-207(1)(a) provides that acceptance may be by a written or oral expression agreeing to the offer or by performing the duties imposed by the offer.\n\nSo, in this case, since the wholesaler did not provide a notification that the shipment was made only upon the condition that it constitutes acceptance, the shipment alone may not constitute a valid acceptance.\n\nTherefore, options A and B seem less likely to be correct because they assume that the shipment constitutes acceptance without the necessary notification.\n\nOption C states that the wholesaler could accept the stationery store's offer only by a prompt promise to ship the goods ordered. This seems plausible because, under UCC \u00a7 2-207(1)(a), acceptance can be by expression or by performance. However, in this case, the performance was nonconforming, which might not constitute a valid acceptance without the proper notification.\n\nOption D says no, because acceptance by performance of an offer for immediate or prompt shipment is legally binding, unless the nonconforming goods are not reasonably resalable. This option seems to suggest that if the goods are not reasonably resalable, then acceptance by performance is not enforceable. However, I'm not sure about this provision.\n\nLooking back at UCC \u00a7 2-207, it seems that acceptance by shipment of nonconforming goods can be valid only if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is made only upon the condition that it constitutes acceptance.\n\nIn this scenario, since there was no such notification, the shipment may not constitute a valid acceptance.\n\nFurthermore, the stationery store was aware that left-handed scissors were priced lower than right-handed ones, which might indicate that they would not accept the substitution without an agreement.\n\nTherefore, it seems that no enforceable contract was formed when the wholesaler shipped the 24 pairs of scissors to the stationery store, because the shipment included nonconforming goods without the necessary notification.\n\nSo, between options C and D, option C seems more accurate because it states that the wholesaler could accept the offer only by a prompt promise to ship the goods ordered, implying that the shipment of nonconforming goods without notification does not constitute acceptance.\n\nOption D is a bit confusing because it mentions that acceptance by performance is legally binding unless the nonconforming goods are not reasonably resalable. I'm not sure about this provision, but it seems less accurate than option C in this context.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option C: No, because the wholesaler could accept the stationery store's offer only by a prompt promise to ship the goods ordered.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
