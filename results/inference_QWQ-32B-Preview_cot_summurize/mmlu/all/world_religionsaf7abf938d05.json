The options are:\n\nA. 1749-1945\n\nB. 1052-1616\n\nC. 1641-1853\n\nD. 1517-1870\n\nI need to figure out which time span correctly represents when Japan was closed off to Christianity and European influence.\n\nFirst, I recall that Japan had a period known as Sakoku, which means \"closed country.\" During this time, Japan limited its interactions with the outside world, particularly with European powers and Christianity.\n\nLet me think about when Sakoku started and ended. I think it began in the 17th century and lasted until the mid-19th century.\n\nOption A is 1749-1945. That seems too late for the start date. Sakoku started earlier than 1749.\n\nOption B is 1052-1616. That seems way too early. Christianity wasn't even introduced to Japan until the 16th century.\n\nOption C is 1641-1853. This sounds more plausible. I think Sakoku began around the 1630s or 1640s and ended with the arrival of Commodore Perry in the 1850s.\n\nOption D is 1517-1870. The start date is around the time when Christianity was first introduced to Japan, but Sakoku started later, in the 17th century.\n\nLet me verify the exact dates for Sakoku. I remember that it started with the Tokugawa shogunate's policies in the early 17th century.\n\nAfter a bit of research, I find that in 1635, the Tokugawa shogunate instituted laws that restricted trade and contact with the outside world. In 1639, they banned outgoing ships and trade was limited to a few select ports.\n\nThen, in 1641, more restrictive laws were enacted, further closing Japan to foreign influence, including Christianity.\n\nSakoku officially ended in 1853 with the arrival of Matthew Perry's Black Ships, which forced Japan to open up to trade with the United States.\n\nSo, based on this, the time span for Japan's closure to Christianity and Europe would be from 1641 to 1853.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 1641-1853 matches this period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1641-1853.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
