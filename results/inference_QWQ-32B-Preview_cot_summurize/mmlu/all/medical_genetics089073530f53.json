I need to figure out which one is a monosomy. First off, I need to remember what monosomy means.\n\nI think monosomy is when there's only one chromosome of a particular pair instead of the usual two. So, in humans, who have 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs, a monosomy would mean that one of those pairs is missing one chromosome. For example, instead of having two X chromosomes in females, they might have only one X chromosome, which is known as Turner syndrome, I think.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 46,XX - This is the standard female karyotype. Two X chromosomes, which is normal. So, this isn't a monosomy.\n\nB. 47,XXX - This seems like an extra X chromosome. So, instead of 46,XX, it's 47,XXX. That would be trisomy X, I believe. So, that's having three X's, which is more than the normal two for females. Not a monosomy.\n\nC. 69,XYY - This one looks weird. 69 chromosomes? That's way more than the usual 46. I think this might be a mistake or something, but probably not relevant to the question of monosomy.\n\nD. 45,X - This has only 45 chromosomes, which is one less than the normal 46. Assuming that the missing chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes, this would be monosomy X, which is Turner syndrome. So, this seems like the likely candidate for monosomy.\n\nTo confirm, I should recall that in humans, monosomy typically refers to the absence of one chromosome in a pair. The most well-known example is Turner syndrome, which is 45,X, meaning the individual has only one X chromosome and is missing the other sex chromosome.\n\nOption A is just the normal female karyotype, so no monosomy there. Option B is trisomy X, which is having three X's, so that's the opposite of monosomy. Option C looks like it might be a triploid condition, which is when there are three entire sets of chromosomes, but I'm not sure about XYY specifically. Option D is clearly monosomic for the X chromosome.\n\nI think the answer is D. 45,X.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
