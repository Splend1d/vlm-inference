                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, the county government is sending coupons to parents that they can use to subsidize the cost of sending each child to daycare. That means parents get some financial help to pay for daycare.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a subsidy is. A subsidy is basically a payment made by the government to lower the cost for consumers or to support producers. In this case, it's going to parents to help them pay for daycare.\n\nNow, the question is asking what would happen in the market for daycare services. So, I need to think about how this subsidy affects the demand and supply in that market.\n\nLet me recall what demand and supply are. Demand is how much of a good or service people are willing and able to buy at different prices. Supply is how much of a good or service producers are willing and able to provide at different prices.\n\nIn this scenario, the subsidy is going to parents, who are the demand side of the market. So, it's affecting the consumers, not the providers of daycare services.\n\nIf parents get a coupon that subsidizes the cost of daycare, that means they effectively have more money to spend on daycare, or the cost to them is reduced.\n\nSo, with the subsidy, the price that parents pay out of pocket is lower. When the price decreases for consumers, generally, the quantity demanded increases. That's because more parents can afford to send their children to daycare, or those who were already sending their children might choose to send them more hours or to a more expensive daycare.\n\nTherefore, the demand for daycare should increase.\n\nNow, what happens to the market price? Well, if demand increases and supply stays the same, the market price tends to increase. That's because more people want to buy the same amount of daycare services, so daycare providers can charge higher prices.\n\nBut wait, the parents have coupons that subsidize the cost. Does that mean the providers get the\u8865\u8d34 from the government?\n\nHmm. The question says the coupon can be used to subsidize the cost of sending each child to daycare. It doesn't specify who receives the subsidy directly. Is it the parents who get the money to pay the daycare, or is it the daycare providers who get reimbursed by the government?\n\nThis is a bit unclear. Let's assume that the coupon is given to parents, and they can use it to pay part of the daycare fee. So, the parents show the coupon to the daycare provider, and the provider accepts it as payment.\n\nIn this case, the daycare provider effectively gets paid part of the fee by the government through the coupon.\n\nSo, from the provider's perspective, it's like the government is paying part of the cost, which allows parents to afford daycare more easily.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the demand curve would shift to the right because parents can now afford to buy more daycare services at each price level.\n\nIf demand increases and supply remains the same, the equilibrium price will rise.\n\nWait, but the subsidy is making daycare cheaper for parents, so shouldn't more parents opt for daycare, increasing the quantity demanded?\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me think about it another way. Suppose the original price of daycare is $100 per week, and the subsidy is $20 per week per child. So, parents only pay $80 out of pocket.\n\nAt this lower price, more parents might decide to send their children to daycare, or they might choose to send them more days or for longer hours.\n\nSo, the quantity demanded increases.\n\nNow, if the supply of daycare services doesn't change, meaning the number of daycare spots available doesn't increase immediately, then the increased demand would likely lead to higher prices.\n\nDaycare providers might raise their prices because more parents are willing to pay for their services.\n\nAlternatively, if the supply is elastic, meaning daycare providers can easily increase the number of spots available, then the supply might increase in response to the higher demand, which could keep prices stable or even lower them.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify whether the supply is elastic or inelastic.\n\nGiven that, and based on the options provided, it seems that the most likely outcome is that the demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says the demand for daycare falls, lowering the market price. That doesn't make sense because the subsidy should make daycare more affordable, leading to increased demand, not decreased.\n\nOption C says the supply of daycare rises, lowering the market price. Well, if the supply increases, that could lower prices, but in this scenario, the subsidy is going to parents, not to daycare providers. So, it's not directly affecting the supply side. Unless daycare providers decide to expand because of the higher demand, but that would take time.\n\nOption D says the supply of daycare falls, increasing the market price. Again, that doesn't seem directly related to the subsidy given to parents.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the most logical conclusion: the demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that in some cases, subsidies can lead to lower prices for consumers and higher quantities, but in this case, since it's a subsidy to consumers, it should increase demand and lead to higher prices.\n\nBut maybe I need to think about the subsidy in terms of shifting the demand curve.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nOriginal demand curve: D0\n\nWith the subsidy, parents can effectively pay a higher price, so the demand curve shifts to the right to D1.\n\nSupply remains the same: S0\n\nThe new equilibrium occurs at the intersection of D1 and S0, which is at a higher price and higher quantity.\n\nYes, that matches option B.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any other factors.\n\nPerhaps the subsidy could encourage more providers to enter the market, shifting the supply curve to the right as well.\n\nIf that happens, the equilibrium price might not increase as much, or maybe even decrease, while quantity increases.\n\nHowever, in the short run, it's unlikely that new daycare providers can enter the market immediately in response to the subsidy.\n\nDaycare centers take time to set up, meet regulations, hire staff, etc.\n\nSo, in the short run, supply is probably inelastic.\n\nTherefore, the initial effect would be an increase in demand and higher prices.\n\nIn the long run, maybe supply increases, but the question seems to be focusing on the initial outcome.\n\nGiven that, I think option B is the most appropriate answer.\n\nTherefore, the demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
