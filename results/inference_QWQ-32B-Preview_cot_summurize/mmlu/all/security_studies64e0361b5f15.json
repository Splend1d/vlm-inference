Isolation of the effect that the threat of force or the limited use of force, in a given case is dependent on the sufficiency of the \"stick\" for success. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.\nB. Success is an independent function from the amount of coercion required to produce compliance. Ideally, coercion should be required to solve all disputes. If the threshold from persuasion to coercion is crossed, the degree of success is equated to the production intended outcome: to stop or undo an action.\nC. In protracted diplomatic affairs involving a series of inconclusive exchanges which results in tactical/temporary successes followed by new acts of non-compliance, the production of the intended outcome (compliance and ceasing of actions) is regarded as a success from a policy goal perspective.\nD. Coercive diplomacy success resulting from the use of threats and sanctions (inducements may, but need not, be employed) are classified as cheap successes. Successes resulting from the use of limited force count as costly ones. Compliance can only be considered a success if the outcome is lasting.\n"

Coercive diplomacy involves using the threat of force or actual limited use of force to get another party to comply with certain demands. Defining success in this context can be tricky for several reasons.\n\nOption A suggests that success depends on whether the \"stick\" or the threat of force was sufficient to produce compliance. This means that if you threaten someone with a certain action, and they comply because they fear that action, then it's a success. But this approach might not consider whether the compliance is genuine or just temporary, or whether the threat was proportionate to the issue at hand.\n\nOption B says that success is independent of how much coercion was used, as long as compliance is achieved. It even suggests that ideally, coercion should be used for all disputes, which seems extreme. Crossing the threshold from persuasion to coercion might not always be the best approach, and equating success solely to achieving the intended outcome without considering the means used could be problematic.\n\nOption C talks about protracted diplomatic affairs with a series of temporary successes and new acts of non-compliance. In such cases, even if there are tactical successes, the overall goal might not be achieved. So, defining success in these scenarios is difficult because there might be short-term gains but no long-term resolution.\n\nOption D classifies successes based on whether they resulted from threats and sanctions (cheap successes) or from the use of limited force (costly ones). It also states that compliance can only be considered a success if it's lasting. This makes sense because using threats might be less costly than using force, but if the compliance isn't lasting, then perhaps the success wasn't genuine.\n\nOverall, defining success in coercive diplomacy is problematic because it's not just about achieving compliance but also about the sustainability of that compliance, the proportionality of the methods used, and whether the outcome aligns with broader policy goals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
