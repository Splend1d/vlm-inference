                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what affects the speed of sound in air. The options are frequency, wavelength, air temperature, or all of these. I think I remember something about temperature affecting sound speed, but I'm not sure about the others.\n\nFirst, let's think about frequency. Frequency is how often a wave passes a point per unit time. Does the speed of sound change with different frequencies? I think in air, sound waves of different frequencies travel at about the same speed. Like, whether it's a high-pitch or low-pitch sound, they should reach your ears at the same time, right? So, maybe frequency doesn't affect the speed of sound.\n\nWhat about wavelength? Wavelength is related to frequency and speed by the equation speed equals frequency times wavelength. So, if speed is constant, then wavelength would change with frequency. But maybe in some mediums, wavelength affects the speed too. I'm not sure about that.\n\nThen there's air temperature. I recall that heat affects the molecules in the air, making them move faster. Maybe faster-moving molecules can transmit sound waves more quickly. So, higher temperature could mean higher speed of sound.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up how sound travels through air. Sound is a mechanical wave that propagates through a medium by compressing and expanding the particles in that medium. In air, it's through compression and rarefaction of air molecules.\n\nThe speed at which these compressions and rarefactions travel should depend on how quickly the air molecules can respond to the pressure changes. So, if the air is hotter, molecules move faster, which might help transmit the sound faster. That makes sense.\n\nBut does frequency play a role? In air, I think all frequencies travel at the same speed, regardless of their pitch. That's why we can have music and speech travel through air without distortion, for the most part.\n\nWavelength is inversely proportional to frequency for a given speed. So, if speed is constant, then wavelength changes with frequency. But does wavelength itself affect the speed? I don't think so in air.\n\nMaybe in other mediums, like solids or liquids, it's different, but for air, I believe only temperature affects the speed of sound.\n\nLet me try to recall the formula for the speed of sound in air. I think it's something like speed equals the square root of gamma times pressure divided by density, where gamma is the adiabatic index. But in terms of temperature, I think there's a simpler expression.\n\nOh, I think the speed of sound in air is approximately 331 meters per second at 0 degrees Celsius, and it increases by about 0.6 meters per second for every degree Celsius increase in temperature. So, for example, at 20 degrees Celsius, the speed would be around 331 plus (0.6 times 20), which is 331 plus 12, so 343 meters per second.\n\nThis seems to confirm that temperature affects the speed of sound in air.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider frequency and wavelength again. If speed is constant, and speed equals frequency times wavelength, then changing frequency would require a change in wavelength to keep the speed constant. So, in air, it seems that frequency doesn't affect the speed; instead, different frequencies have different wavelengths.\n\nIs there any situation where frequency does affect the speed of sound in air? Maybe at very high frequencies or under certain conditions, but for normal everyday sounds, I don't think so.\n\nSo, based on this, I would say that the speed of sound in air depends on air temperature, not on frequency or wavelength.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. air temperature.\n\nBut wait, the option says \"all of these,\" which would include air temperature. But if only temperature affects the speed, then \"all of these\" would be incorrect because frequency and wavelength don't affect the speed in air.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps in other mediums, frequency does affect the speed of sound, but in air, it's mainly temperature.\n\nAlternatively, maybe wavelength does affect the speed in some way.\n\nLet me consider the properties of sound waves. In a dispersive medium, the speed of sound can depend on frequency, leading to different frequencies traveling at different speeds. But air is considered a non-dispersive medium for sound waves, meaning all frequencies travel at the same speed.\n\nSo, in air, frequency and wavelength don't affect the speed; only temperature does.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. air temperature.\n\nBut the option D says \"all of these,\" which would include frequency and wavelength, which I don't think are correct in this context.\n\nSo, I think D is incorrect, and C is the right choice.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly review:\n\n- Frequency: doesn't affect sound speed in air.\n\n- Wavelength: doesn't affect sound speed in air; it's related to frequency and speed.\n\n- Air temperature: does affect sound speed in air.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. air temperature.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
