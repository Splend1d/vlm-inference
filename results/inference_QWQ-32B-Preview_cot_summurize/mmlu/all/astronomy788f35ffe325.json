                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about the solar nebula's ingredients. I need to figure out which list orders the ingredients from the highest to lowest percentage of mass in the nebula. The options are:\n\nA. hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3) light gases (H He) metals rocks\n\nB. hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3) light gases (H He) rocks metals\n\nC. light gases (H He) hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3) metals rocks\n\nD. light gases (H He) hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3) rocks metals\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the solar nebula is. It's the cloud of gas and dust from which our solar system formed, right? So, understanding its composition is key here.\n\nI remember that the solar nebula was mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, which are the lightest elements. In fact, these two elements make up the majority of the mass in the nebula because they were abundant in the original cloud that collapsed to form the solar system.\n\nSo, if I think about it, the light gases, which are hydrogen (H) and helium (He), should be at the top of the list because they constitute the largest percentage of the mass.\n\nLooking at options A and B, they both have hydrogen compounds first, followed by light gases. But according to my reasoning, light gases should be first. So, maybe A and B are incorrect.\n\nOptions C and D have light gases first, which aligns with what I think is correct.\n\nNow, between C and D, the next category is hydrogen compounds, which make sense because these are compounds that contain hydrogen, like water (H2O), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3). These should come after the pure light gases but before rocks and metals.\n\nFinally, rocks and metals would be the least abundant in terms of mass percentage in the solar nebula because they are heavier elements that formed later in the process of stellar evolution.\n\nLooking back at C and D, both have light gases first, then hydrogen compounds, and then either metals rocks or rocks metals.\n\nI need to decide the order between metals and rocks. Which one has a higher mass percentage?\n\nI think rocks, which include silicates and other minerals, might be more abundant than metals like iron and nickel in the nebula. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the solar abundance or the general composition of the solar system.\n\nIn the solar system, the terrestrial planets (like Earth) have a higher metal and rock content, but in the overall nebula, which was mostly gas, these solids would be a smaller fraction.\n\nI think in the solar nebula, the light gases dominate, followed by compounds like H2O, CH4, NH3, and then the solids like rocks and metals.\n\nSo, between C and D, both have light gases first, then hydrogen compounds, and then metals rocks or rocks metals.\n\nI need to decide which comes next: metals or rocks.\n\nI think rocks, being silicates and other minerals, might be more abundant than metals like iron in the nebula. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe metals are more abundant because iron and nickel are among the most common elements after hydrogen and helium.\n\nWait, but in the context of the solar nebula, I think hydrogen and helium are the most abundant, followed by compounds like water and methane, and then solids like rocks and metals.\n\nBut between rocks and metals, which one is more abundant?\n\nI recall that in the solar system's formation, metals like iron sank to the cores of planets, while rocks formed the mantles and crusts.\n\nBut in the nebula itself, perhaps the distribution was different.\n\nMaybe I should consider the molecular weights. Rocks are composed of higher atomic number elements compared to metals like iron.\n\nWait, no, rocks include silicates, which contain oxygen and silicon, while metals are elements like iron and nickel.\n\nI think in terms of mass percentage in the solar nebula, metals like iron might have been more abundant than rocks, but I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps I need to look at the average composition of the solar system.\n\nI remember that the Sun, which contains most of the mass of the solar system, is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of heavier elements, including metals and rocks.\n\nSo, in the solar nebula, the light gases would be the most abundant, followed by compounds like H2O, CH4, NH3, and then the solids like rocks and metals.\n\nBetween rocks and metals, I think rocks might be more abundant because silicates are common in the universe, but again, I'm not entirely sure.\n\nGiven that uncertainty, perhaps both C and D could be correct, but I need to choose one.\n\nWait, maybe the order is light gases, hydrogen compounds, rocks, and then metals.\n\nBut that doesn't align with any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps metals are a subset of rocks in this context.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rocks and metals are both classified as solids, with rocks being silicates and metals being metallic elements like iron and nickel.\n\nIn that case, perhaps metals are a smaller fraction than rocks in the nebula.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option D is correct: light gases (H He), hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3), rocks, metals.\n\nAlternatively, option C has light gases, hydrogen compounds, metals, rocks.\n\nI need to decide between rocks and metals.\n\nI think rocks, being silicates, might be more abundant than metals in the nebula.\n\nTherefore, option D might be the correct order.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure about the rocks and metals order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a specific knowledge point here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the context of the solar nebula, metals refers to heavier elements, which are less abundant than rocks.\n\nIn that case, rocks would come before metals.\n\nBut that contradicts option D.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider the overall composition of the solar system.\n\nThe Sun is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small percentage of heavier elements.\n\nThe planets have higher concentrations of heavier elements, but the Sun contains most of the mass.\n\nTherefore, in the overall nebula, light gases dominate, followed by compounds, then solids like rocks and metals.\n\nBetween rocks and metals, perhaps rocks are more abundant.\n\nTherefore, option D makes sense: light gases, hydrogen compounds, rocks, metals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe metals are more abundant than rocks.\n\nI need to make a decision.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll go with option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
