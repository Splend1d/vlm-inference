                    "text": "To determine the conjugate acid of the H2PO4- ion, we need to understand the concept of conjugate acids and bases in acid-base chemistry.\n\nIn an acid-base reaction, an acid donates a proton (H+) to a base, forming its conjugate base, and the base accepts the proton, forming its conjugate acid.\n\nSo, the conjugate acid of a base is the species formed when the base accepts a proton.\n\nGiven that, we have the ion H2PO4-, and we need to find its conjugate acid.\n\nFirst, let's identify whether H2PO4- is an acid or a base. Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons in a stepwise manner:\n\n1. H3PO4 donates a proton to form H2PO4- (dihydrogen phosphate ion).\n\n2. H2PO4- can further donate a proton to form HPO42- (hydrogen phosphate ion).\n\n3. HPO42- can donate another proton to form PO43- (phosphate ion).\n\nSo, in this context, H2PO4- can act as both an acid and a base, but in this question, we're considering it as a base to find its conjugate acid.\n\nTherefore, the conjugate acid of H2PO4- would be the species formed when H2PO4- accepts a proton (H+).\n\nLooking at the stepwise dissociation of phosphoric acid:\n\n- H3PO4 \u2192 H+ + H2PO4-.\n\n- H2PO4- \u2192 H+ + HPO42-.\n\n- HPO42- \u2192 H+ + PO43-.\n\nFrom the first dissociation step, H3PO4 donates a proton to form H2PO4-. Therefore, H2PO4- can accept a proton to reform H3PO4.\n\nThus, the conjugate acid of H2PO4- is H3PO4.\n\nLet's verify this by considering the general definition:\n\n- Conjugate acid: base + H+ \u2192 conjugate acid.\n\nSo, H2PO4- + H+ \u2192 H3PO4.\n\nTherefore, the conjugate acid of H2PO4- is H3PO4.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. HPO42-: This is the conjugate base of H2PO4-, not its conjugate acid.\n\nB. H2PO4-: This is the base itself, not its conjugate acid.\n\nC. H3PO4: This matches our conclusion.\n\nD. PO43-: This is the conjugate base of HPO42-, which is one step further in the dissociation series.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C. H3PO4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
