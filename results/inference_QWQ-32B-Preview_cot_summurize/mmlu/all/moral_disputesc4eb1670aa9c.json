                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about moral theories. It's asking about the idea of \"using someone as a mere means\" and which theory it's most related to. The options are consequentialism, Kantianism, utilitarianism, and natural law theory.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"using someone as a mere means\" means. I think it refers to treating a person solely as a tool to achieve one's own ends, without considering their own goals, rights, or dignity. It's like using someone without respecting their autonomy or intrinsic worth.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Consequentialism: This is a type of moral theory that judges actions based on their outcomes or consequences. The right action is the one that leads to the best overall results. So, in consequentialism, the ends can justify the means. But does that necessarily involve using people as mere means? Not necessarily, because consequentialists can consider the well-being of all affected parties, including the person being used. However, there's a risk that in pursuing the best consequences, a consequentialist might overlook the moral significance of how certain outcomes are achieved, potentially leading to treating people as means to an end.\n\nB. Kantianism: This is based on Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy. Kant is famous for his categorical imperative, which includes the idea that we should treat people as ends in themselves, never merely as means to an end. So, Kantianism explicitly addresses and prohibits using someone as a mere means. This seems very relevant to the question.\n\nC. Utilitarianism: This is a specific type of consequentialism that aims to maximize overall happiness or utility. Like general consequentialism, it focuses on outcomes. So, similar to consequentialism, there's a potential to use people as means to increase overall happiness, but it's not inherent to the theory. Utilitarians might argue that respecting individual rights and treating people as ends in themselves generally leads to better overall consequences.\n\nD. Natural law theory: This is a moral theory based on the idea that moral principles are derived from the natural order or human nature. It often emphasizes duties and virtues. Natural law theory generally respects human dignity and inherent rights, so it would likely oppose using people as mere means. However, it's not primarily focused on this specific concept like Kantianism is.\n\nComparing these, Kantianism directly addresses the issue of using people as mere means and prohibits it as a fundamental moral principle. Consequentialism and utilitarianism are more outcome-focused and might sometimes justify using people as means if it leads to better overall results, though they don't inherently endorse it. Natural law theory respects human dignity but isn't specifically centered on this particular concept.\n\nTherefore, the moral theory most centrally concerned with the idea of \"using someone as a mere means\" is Kantianism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
