                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says, \"What is the square root of 81 squared?\" and gives options from A to D. So, I need to find the square root of 81 squared and see which option matches.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"81 squared\" means. Squaring a number means multiplying it by itself, so 81 squared is 81 times 81. Let me calculate that:\n\n81 \u00d7 81.\n\nWell, 80 \u00d7 80 is 6400, and 80 \u00d7 1 is 80, so 80 \u00d7 81 is 6480. Then, 1 \u00d7 81 is 81. So, adding those together: 6480 + 81 equals 6561. So, 81 squared is 6561.\n\nNow, I need to find the square root of 6561. The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, I'm looking for a number that, when squared, equals 6561.\n\nI know that 80 squared is 6400, and 90 squared is 8100. So, the square root of 6561 should be between 80 and 90. Let me try 81 again, but wait, 81 squared is 6561, so the square root of 6561 should be 81.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but the question is \"the square root of 81 squared,\" which is the square root of 6561, which is 81. So, the answer should be 81, which is option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. Sometimes, with square roots, there can be positive and negative roots, but the principal square root is positive. So, in this context, it's probably 81.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 9\n\nB. 27\n\nC. 81\n\nD. 729\n\nOption C is 81, which matches my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the properties of exponents. The square root of a number squared is the absolute value of that number, but since 81 is positive, it should just be 81.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. 81.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
