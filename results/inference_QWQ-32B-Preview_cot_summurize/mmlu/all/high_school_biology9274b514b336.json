But interestingly, their closest relatives were actually land-dwelling reptiles that didn't have those features. So, the question is about whether their dorsal fins and tails are homologous to those of fish, or if it's an example of something else.\n\nFirst, let's recall what homologous structures are. Homologous structures are parts that are similar in different species because they originated from a structure in a common ancestor. So, if two species have homologous parts, it means they inherited them from a shared ancestor that had a similar structure.\n\nNow, in this case, ichthyosaurs and fish both have dorsal fins and tails, but their closest relatives didn't have these features. That suggests that these features developed independently in ichthyosaurs and fish, rather than being inherited from a common ancestor that had them.\n\nThis sounds a lot like convergent evolution. Convergent evolution is when similar traits evolve independently in species that do not share a recent common ancestor, usually because they live in similar environments or have similar lifestyles. So, both ichthyosaurs and fish developed dorsal fins and tails because they lived in water and needed those features to swim efficiently.\n\nAdditionally, these features are adaptations to their aquatic environment. An adaptation is a trait that helps an organism survive and reproduce in its specific environment. So, having dorsal fins and tails is an adaptation for swimming in water.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Homologous - Probably not, since their closest relatives didn't have these features, suggesting they didn't inherit them from a common ancestor.\n\nB. Examples of convergent evolution - This seems likely, as both ichthyosaurs and fish developed similar features independently.\n\nC. Adaptations to a common environment - Definitely, as both needed to swim in water.\n\nD. B and C only - This seems to be the correct choice, as both convergent evolution and environmental adaptation are relevant here.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. B and C only.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. If ichthyosaurs and fish both have dorsal fins and tails, and their closest relatives didn't, it's probably because they each evolved these features separately to cope with their aquatic lifestyles. So, it's convergent evolution leading to adaptations for their environment.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
