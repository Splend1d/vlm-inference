                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a soccer team has $90.00 to spend on soccer balls, and each soccer ball costs $15.60. I need to figure out the greatest number of soccer balls they can buy with that amount. The options are 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\nFirst, I think I should divide the total amount of money they have by the cost of one soccer ball. That should give me the maximum number of balls they can purchase without exceeding their budget.\n\nSo, $90.00 divided by $15.60 per ball.\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n90 divided by 15.60.\n\nHmm, to make it easier, maybe I can eliminate the decimal. If I multiply both numbers by 100, it becomes 9000 divided by 1560.\n\nBut that seems messy. Maybe I can simplify it directly.\n\nLet's see, 15.60 times what equals 90.00?\n\nI can try to do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 15.60 times 5 is 78.00.\n\nBecause 15 times 5 is 75, and 0.60 times 5 is 3.00, so 75 plus 3 is 78.\n\nNow, 90 minus 78 is 12.00.\n\nSo, after buying 5 balls, they would have 12.00 left.\n\nBut since each ball costs 15.60, and 12.00 is less than 15.60, they can't buy another ball with that.\n\nSo, the maximum number of balls they can buy is 5.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a better way to calculate this.\n\nMaybe I can divide 90 by 15.60 directly.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n90 divided by 15.60.\n\nFirst, I can think of it as 90 divided by 15.6.\n\nTo make it easier, maybe I can move the decimal point one place to the right for both numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, 900 divided by 156.\n\nNow, 156 times 5 is 780.\n\nSubtract 780 from 900, which leaves 120.\n\n156 times 0.75 is 117.\n\nSo, 5.75 times 156 is 900 minus 117 is 783.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I should use a different approach.\n\nLet me try to divide 90 by 15.60 using long division.\n\n15.60 goes into 90 how many times?\n\n15.60 times 5 is 78.00.\n\nSubtract that from 90.00, and you get 12.00.\n\nSince 12.00 is less than 15.60, you can't go any further.\n\nSo, again, that suggests that the team can buy 5 soccer balls and have 12.00 left over.\n\nBut let's check if there's a way to get 6 balls.\n\nIf I multiply 15.60 by 6, what do I get?\n\n15 times 6 is 90, and 0.60 times 6 is 3.60.\n\nSo, 90 plus 3.60 is 93.60.\n\nBut the team only has 90.00, so 93.60 is over their budget.\n\nTherefore, they can't afford 6 balls.\n\nWhat about 5 balls?\n\n5 times 15.60 is 78.00.\n\nThat's within their budget, and they'd have 12.00 left.\n\nBut they can't buy a fraction of a ball, so 5 is the maximum whole number of balls they can purchase.\n\nWait, but let's see if there's any way to get more balls within the budget.\n\nSuppose they buy 5 balls for 78.00, and with the remaining 12.00, maybe they can't buy another full ball, but perhaps there's a better deal or something.\n\nBut according to the problem, soccer balls cost a flat rate of 15.60 each, and the team has 90.00 to spend.\n\nSo, no, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a discount for buying multiple balls, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nSo, I don't think that's the case.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of soccer balls the team can buy is 5.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 5.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the other options.\n\nOption A is 4.\n\nIf they buy 4 balls, that would cost 4 times 15.60, which is 62.40.\n\nThen, they would have 90.00 minus 62.40 equals 27.60 left.\n\nBut that's more than enough to buy another ball, so opting for 4 balls wouldn't maximize their purchase.\n\nOption C is 6, which we already saw costs 93.60, which is over their budget.\n\nOption D is 7, which would cost even more: 7 times 15.60 is 109.20, which is way over 90.00.\n\nSo, again, that's not feasible.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed B. 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
