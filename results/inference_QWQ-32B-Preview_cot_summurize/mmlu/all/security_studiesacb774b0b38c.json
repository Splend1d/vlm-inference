                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about international regimes in the context of liberalism. I need to pick the statement that best defines what an international regime is, according to liberal theory.\n\nFirst, I should recall what liberalism in international relations is all about. Liberalism generally holds that cooperation among states is possible and desirable, often through institutions and rules that facilitate peaceful interaction and mutual benefit.\n\nNow, looking at option A: \"The term international regime refers to the governmental or political apparatus that defines the state within the international system.\" Hmm, this seems a bit off. It sounds like it's describing the domestic government of a state rather than an international regime. International regimes, as I understand them, are more about the rules and norms that govern interactions between states, not the internal political structure of a state.\n\nOption B: \"The term refers to a set of formal or informal principles to which governmental actors subscribe in their decision-making on a particular subject.\" This sounds more accurate. In liberalism, international regimes are often seen as sets of rules, norms, and decision-making procedures that shape how states behave in specific issue-areas, like trade, human rights, or the environment. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption C: \"International regimes are independent bodies established by a collaboration of governmental and non-state actors to oversee international decision-making processes.\" This statement introduces non-state actors and independent bodies, which might be more aligned with some realist or constructivist views, but in liberalism, international regimes are typically seen as being composed of rules and norms that states agree to follow, not necessarily as independent bodies. So, this seems less accurate.\n\nOption D: \"International regimes are also known as international organisations and play a fundamental role as lobbyists, advocating the views of interest groups to state actors.\" Wait, this seems confused. International organisations are indeed part of international regimes, but saying that regimes are known as international organisations is not quite right. Also, the lobbying aspect seems out of place in the definition of an international regime.\n\nComparing all these options, option B seems to capture the essence of an international regime in liberalism best. It highlights that regimes consist of principles that guide governmental decision-making on specific issues, which aligns with the liberal emphasis on rules and norms facilitating cooperation among states.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
