                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure out which of these events has the greatest probability when tossing a fair coin 100 times. Let's see what each option is asking for.\n\nOption A is H = 50, which means exactly 50 heads in 100 tosses.\n\nOption B is T >= 60, which is the same as saying the number of tails is 60 or more. Since there are only 100 tosses, that would be 60 tails or more, which means 40 heads or fewer.\n\nOption C is 51 <= H <= 55, meaning the number of heads is between 51 and 55, inclusive.\n\nOption D is H >= 48 and T >= 48. Hmm, wait a second. If H is the number of heads and T is the number of tails, and there are 100 tosses, then T = 100 - H. So, T >= 48 means 100 - H >= 48, which simplifies to H <= 52. Therefore, option D is H >= 48 and H <= 52, which is the same as 48 <= H <= 52.\n\nAlright, so now I need to compare the probabilities of these four events:\n\nA: H = 50\n\nB: H <= 40\n\nC: 51 <= H <= 55\n\nD: 48 <= H <= 52\n\nSince the coin is fair, the number of heads H follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 100 and p = 0.5. The binomial distribution is symmetric in this case because p = 0.5.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: H = 50.\n\nThe probability of getting exactly 50 heads in 100 tosses is given by the binomial probability formula:\n\nP(H = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nHere, n = 100, k = 50, p = 0.5.\n\nSo, P(H = 50) = (100 choose 50) * (0.5)^50 * (0.5)^50 = (100 choose 50) * (0.5)^100\n\nI know that (100 choose 50) is the largest binomial coefficient for n = 100, but I don't need to calculate it exactly right now. I just need to compare it to the other probabilities.\n\nNext, option B: H <= 40.\n\nThis is the cumulative probability from H = 0 to H = 40.\n\nSince the distribution is symmetric, P(H <= 40) = P(H >= 60).\n\nBecause of symmetry, P(H <= 40) = P(H >= 60), and since the total probability is 1, P(H <= 40) + P(41 <= H <= 59) + P(H >= 60) = 1.\n\nBut because of symmetry, P(H <= 40) = P(H >= 60), so 2*P(H <= 40) + P(41 <= H <= 59) = 1.\n\nI know that P(H <= 40) is going to be fairly small because 40 is two standard deviations away from the mean. Let me recall that for a binomial distribution, the mean is np = 50, and the standard deviation is sqrt(np(1-p)) = sqrt(25) = 5.\n\nSo, H = 40 is two standard deviations below the mean. In a normal distribution, the probability of being two standard deviations below the mean is about 2.28%, but since the binomial distribution is discrete, it might be slightly different.\n\nBut for now, I'll note that P(H <= 40) is small.\n\nOption C: 51 <= H <= 55.\n\nThis is the probability that H is between 51 and 55, inclusive.\n\nSince the distribution is symmetric and unimodal, with the highest probability at H = 50, the probabilities for H = 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55 will be slightly less than P(H = 50), but still significant.\n\nOption D: 48 <= H <= 52.\n\nThis is the probability that H is between 48 and 52, inclusive.\n\nAgain, since the distribution is symmetric and unimodal, P(H = 50) is the highest, and P(H = 49) = P(H = 51), P(H = 48) = P(H = 52), and so on.\n\nSo, option D includes H = 48, 49, 50, 51, and 52.\n\nComparing options C and D, option D is closer to the mean, and includes H = 50, which has the highest probability.\n\nOption C goes slightly farther from the mean in the positive direction.\n\nHowever, since the distribution is symmetric and unimodal, the probabilities in option D should sum to more than those in option C, because they include the highest probability point.\n\nWait, but actually, H = 50 is included in both C and D, but option D includes H = 48 and H = 49, while option C includes H = 54 and H = 55.\n\nGiven that H = 50 has the highest probability, and probabilities decrease as we move away from the mean, P(H = 48) = P(H = 52), P(H = 49) = P(H = 51), and so on.\n\nSo, P(H = 48) < P(H = 49) < P(H = 50) > P(H = 51) > P(H = 52), and similarly P(H = 53) < P(H = 54) < P(H = 55).\n\nBut since option D includes H = 48 and H = 52, which have lower probabilities than H = 51 and H = 50 in option C, it's not immediately clear which one has a higher total probability.\n\nWait, no. Option C includes H = 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, while option D includes H = 48, 49, 50, 51, 52.\n\nGiven that P(H = 50) > P(H = 51) > P(H = 52) > P(H = 53) > P(H = 54) > P(H = 55), and P(H = 48) < P(H = 49) < P(H = 50), it's likely that the sum of probabilities in option D is greater than that in option C, because option D includes H = 50, which has the highest probability.\n\nBut to be sure, let's think about the central limit theorem. For a large number of trials like n = 100, the binomial distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 5.\n\nSo, option D corresponds to H between 48 and 52, which is within 0.4 standard deviations from the mean (since sd = 5, 50 - 48 = 2, which is 2/5 = 0.4 sd).\n\nSimilarly, option C is H between 51 and 55, which is from 0.2 to 1 standard deviation above the mean.\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution, we can estimate the probabilities.\n\nFirst, for option D: 48 <= H <= 52.\n\nConverting to standard normal z-scores:\n\nZ1 = (48 - 50)/5 = -0.4\n\nZ2 = (52 - 50)/5 = 0.4\n\nThe probability P(-0.4 <= Z <= 0.4) can be found using the standard normal table.\n\nP(Z <= 0.4) - P(Z <= -0.4) = 2*P(Z <= 0.4) - 1.\n\nFrom the standard normal table, P(Z <= 0.4) \u2248 0.6554.\n\nSo, P(-0.4 <= Z <= 0.4) \u2248 2*0.6554 - 1 = 0.3108.\n\nSimilarly, for option C: 51 <= H <= 55.\n\nZ1 = (51 - 50)/5 = 0.2\n\nZ2 = (55 - 50)/5 = 1.0\n\nP(0.2 <= Z <= 1.0) = P(Z <= 1.0) - P(Z <= 0.2).\n\nFrom the table, P(Z <= 1.0) \u2248 0.8413, P(Z <= 0.2) \u2248 0.5793.\n\nSo, P(0.2 <= Z <= 1.0) \u2248 0.8413 - 0.5793 = 0.2620.\n\nTherefore, option D has a higher probability than option C.\n\nNow, option A is P(H = 50), which in the normal approximation is roughly the density at Z = 0, but since we're dealing with a continuous distribution approximating a discrete one, we should apply the continuity correction.\n\nFor H = 50, the continuity correction is P(49.5 <= H <= 50.5).\n\nZ1 = (49.5 - 50)/5 = -0.1\n\nZ2 = (50.5 - 50)/5 = 0.1\n\nP(-0.1 <= Z <= 0.1) \u2248 2*P(Z <= 0.1) - 1.\n\nP(Z <= 0.1) \u2248 0.5398.\n\nSo, P(-0.1 <= Z <= 0.1) \u2248 2*0.5398 - 1 = 0.0796.\n\nComparing this to option D's probability of approximately 0.3108, option D is larger.\n\nOption B is P(H <= 40), which is P(Z <= (40 - 50)/5) = P(Z <= -2).\n\nFrom the standard normal table, P(Z <= -2) \u2248 0.0228.\n\nThis is much smaller than option D's probability.\n\nTherefore, option D has the greatest probability among the four options.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check the calculations to make sure.\n\nFirst, for option D: 48 <= H <= 52.\n\nZ1 = -0.4, Z2 = 0.4.\n\nP(-0.4 <= Z <= 0.4) \u2248 0.3108.\n\nFor option C: 51 <= H <= 55.\n\nZ1 = 0.2, Z2 = 1.0.\n\nP(0.2 <= Z <= 1.0) \u2248 0.2620.\n\nFor option A: H = 50.\n\nP(49.5 <= H <= 50.5) \u2248 0.0796.\n\nFor option B: H <= 40.\n\nP(Z <= -2) \u2248 0.0228.\n\nIndeed, option D has the highest probability.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the number of outcomes included in each event.\n\nOption A has only one specific outcome, H = 50.\n\nOption B has many outcomes, from H = 0 to H = 40, but they are in the tails of the distribution, so individually they have low probability.\n\nOption C has five possible outcomes: H = 51 to H = 55.\n\nOption D has five possible outcomes: H = 48 to H = 52.\n\nBut since option D includes H = 50, which has the highest probability, and H = 49 and H = 51 are very close, while option C includes H = 55, which has lower probability, option D should have a higher total probability.\n\nFurthermore, option D covers a range closer to the mean, which has higher probability density.\n\nTherefore, the event with the greatest probability is option D: H >= 48 and T >= 48.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
