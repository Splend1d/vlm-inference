                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says, \"The 80% rule is used to determine if...\" and then gives four options. So, I need to figure out what the 80% rule is primarily used for in the context of these options.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the 80% rule is. I recall that it's related to employment practices and discrimination, but let me refresh my memory. The 80% rule, also known as the four-fifths rule, is a rule of thumb used in the United States to assess whether a particular selection rate for a minority group is significantly lower than that of a majority group, which might indicate potential adverse impact or discrimination.\n\nSo, adverse impact refers to practices that, while appearing neutral, disproportionately exclude certain groups of people from employment opportunities. The 80% rule helps determine if such an impact is occurring.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. a selection procedure is having an adverse impact.\n\nB. a selection procedure is cost effective.\n\nC. a performance appraisal measure has adequate relevance.\n\nD. a performance appraisal measure has adequate utility.\n\nGiven that the 80% rule is about assessing whether there's a significant difference in selection rates between groups that could indicate discrimination, it seems most directly related to option A: determining if a selection procedure is having an adverse impact.\n\nOption B, cost effectiveness, doesn't seem directly related to the 80% rule's purpose, which is more about fairness and absence of discrimination rather than financial considerations.\n\nOptions C and D talk about performance appraisal measures, specifically their relevance and utility. While performance appraisals can be selection procedures, the 80% rule is more broadly about any selection procedure, not specifically about the qualities of the performance appraisal measures themselves.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer seems to be A. a selection procedure is having an adverse impact.\n\nTo double-check, maybe I should consider each option briefly.\n\nOption A: This aligns closely with what I know about the 80% rule. It's used to check if a selection procedure is disproportionately excluding members of a particular group.\n\nOption B: Cost effectiveness isn't directly related to the 80% rule's purpose, which is more about ensuring fairness in selection procedures.\n\nOption C: Relevance of performance appraisal measures would pertain to whether the appraisal is measuring job-relevant qualities, which is different from the 80% rule's focus on selection rates between groups.\n\nOption D: Utility of performance appraisal measures refers to their effectiveness in predicting job performance or other criteria, again separate from the issue of adverse impact.\n\nSo, yes, option A seems to be the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should look up a quick definition or example of the 80% rule to confirm.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that the 80% rule is indeed a tool used in employment to detect potential adverse impact in selection procedures. It compares the selection rate of the group with the lowest selection rate to that of the group with the highest selection rate. If the ratio is less than 80%, there may be adverse impact.\n\nFor example, if the selection rate for the majority group is 50% and for the minority group is 40%, the ratio is 40/50 = 80%, which is the threshold. Anything below 80% may indicate adverse impact.\n\nThis reinforces that the 80% rule is specifically used to assess whether selection procedures have an adverse impact on minority groups, which corresponds to option A.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the correct answer is A. a selection procedure is having an adverse impact.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
