                    "text": "Let's tackle this real estate law problem step by step. It's a bit complex with multiple transactions and relationships involved, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, we have Ann, who owns a tract of land. On August 1, 2005, she sells an undivided one-half interest in this land to Hunter and Willa, who are husband and wife. The purchase price is $100,000, and it's paid entirely by Hunter. The deed specifies that they are taking title as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants or tenants in common.\n\nSo, at this point, Ann still owns the other half of the tract, and Hunter and Willa own the other half as tenants by the entirety.\n\nFast forward to August 1, 2006, Ann sells her remaining interest in the tract to Hunter and Brandon, who is Hunter's brother, for $125,000. Hunter pays $80,000, and Brandon pays the remaining $45,000. The deed states that they are taking title as joint tenants, not as tenants in common.\n\nNow, we need to figure out what interests everyone has in the tract after these two sales.\n\nLet's first understand the initial sale to Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety. Tenancy by the entirety is a form of concurrent ownership available only to married couples, and it has characteristics similar to joint tenancy, including the right of survivorship. So, if one spouse dies, the surviving spouse automatically inherits the entire interest.\n\nIn this case, Hunter and Willa own half the tract as tenants by the entirety.\n\nThen, Ann sells her remaining half interest to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants. Joint tenancy also includes the right of survivorship, meaning that when one joint tenant dies, their interest passes to the surviving joint tenant(s).\n\nSo, after the second sale, here's what we have:\n\n- Hunter and Willa own half the tract as tenants by the entirety.\n\n- Hunter and Brandon own the other half as joint tenants.\n\nNow, on August 1, 2007, Hunter, Willa, and Brandon die in a common disaster, and the order of their deaths cannot be established.\n\nThis is crucial because the right of survivorship depends on who survives whom.\n\nSince the order of deaths cannot be established, we need to look at the default rules for determining survivorship in such cases.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, when multiple people die in a common disaster and the order cannot be determined, the law presumes that the oldest died first, followed by the next oldest, and so on. However, there are other approaches as well, such as simultaneous death or last survivor rules.\n\nBut in property law, especially regarding concurrent estates with rights of survivorship, the general rule is that the interests pass according to the survivorship rights only if the surviving tenant outlives the deceased tenant by a certain period, often referred to as \"surviving to the end of the day.\"\n\nGiven that all three died in a common disaster, it's likely that none of them survived the others, so the right of survivorship doesn't come into play.\n\nTherefore, their interests would pass according to their wills or intestacy laws to their heirs.\n\nThe problem states that Hunter's will and Willa's will devise whatever interest they have in the land to their son.\n\nSo, we need to determine what interests Hunter and Willa had in the land that could be devised to their son.\n\nFirst, let's look at Hunter's interest.\n\nHunter has two interests:\n\n1. His half interest in the tenants by the entirety with Willa.\n\n2. His interest in the joint tenancy with Brandon.\n\nSimilarly, Willa has her half interest in the tenants by the entirety with Hunter.\n\nBrandon has his interest in the joint tenancy with Hunter.\n\nNow, since Hunter and Willa are tenants by the entirety, and that form of ownership includes the right of survivorship, but since both died simultaneously, the right of survivorship doesn't apply, and their interests pass to their heirs.\n\nSimilarly, Hunter and Brandon are joint tenants, and again, since both died simultaneously, the right of survivorship doesn't apply, and their interests pass to their respective heirs.\n\nSo, let's first look at the tenants by the entirety between Hunter and Willa.\n\nSince they both died simultaneously, their interests in that half of the tract pass to their heirs according to their wills.\n\nThe problem states that both Hunter and Willa devise their interests to their son.\n\nTherefore, the son receives both Hunter's and Willa's interests in the tenants by the entirety, which together make up the entire half interest in the tract.\n\nNow, let's look at the joint tenancy between Hunter and Brandon.\n\nAgain, since both died simultaneously, their interests pass to their heirs.\n\nHunter's interest in this joint tenancy would pass to his son via his will.\n\nBrandon's interest would pass to his heirs according to his will or intestacy laws, but the problem doesn't specify anything about Brandon's will or heirs, so we'll assume that Brandon's interest passes to his heirs, who are not specified.\n\nHowever, the question is only asking about the son's interest, who is the son of Hunter and Willa.\n\nSo, focusing on the son's inheritance:\n\n- He receives Hunter's interest in the tenants by the entirety with Willa.\n\n- He receives Willa's interest in the tenants by the entirety with Hunter.\n\n- He receives Hunter's interest in the joint tenancy with Brandon.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the son's ownership interest in the land, and the options are fractions of the entire tract.\n\nWe need to calculate what portion of the entire tract the son owns after all these transfers.\n\nLet's recap the ownership before the deaths:\n\n- Hunter and Willa own half the tract as tenants by the entirety.\n\n- Hunter and Brandon own the other half as joint tenants.\n\nWhen Hunter and Willa die, their interests pass to their son.\n\nSo, the son receives:\n\n- The entire half interest that was held by Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety.\n\n- Hunter's share of the joint tenancy with Brandon.\n\nSince Hunter and Brandon owned the other half as joint tenants, each owned half of that half, meaning each owned a quarter of the entire tract.\n\nTherefore, Hunter's interest in the joint tenancy was a quarter of the tract.\n\nSo, the son receives that quarter from Hunter.\n\nAdditionally, the son receives the half interest from Hunter and Willa's tenants by the entirety.\n\nTherefore, the son's total interest is:\n\nHalf (from tenants by the entirety) + quarter (from joint tenancy) = three-quarters of the tract.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure this is accurate.\n\nThe initial sale was Ann selling half to Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety.\n\nThen, Ann sold her remaining half to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants.\n\nSo, the ownership was:\n\n- Hunter and Willa: half as tenants by the entirety.\n\n- Hunter and Brandon: half as joint tenants.\n\nWhen Hunter and Willa die, their interests pass to their son.\n\nSo, the son gets:\n\n- The entire half that was held by Hunter and Willa.\n\n- Hunter's quarter from the joint tenancy with Brandon.\n\nTherefore, son owns half plus quarter, which is three-quarters.\n\nBut, we need to consider if Brandon has any interest that might affect this.\n\nBrandon died simultaneously, so his interest in the joint tenancy passes to his heirs.\n\nBut in the joint tenancy with Hunter, since both died simultaneously, their interests pass to their respective heirs.\n\nSo, Hunter's quarter passes to the son, and Brandon's quarter passes to Brandon's heirs.\n\nTherefore, the son owns three-quarters of the tract:\n\n- Half from Hunter and Willa's tenants by the entirety.\n\n- Quarter from Hunter's share of the joint tenancy.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.\n\nBut let's check if there's any mistake here.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to consider the fact that in the joint tenancy, Hunter and Brandon each own half of the remaining half, which is a quarter each of the whole tract.\n\nSo, Hunter's interest in the joint tenancy is a quarter, which passes to the son.\n\nWilla only had an interest in the tenants by the entirety, which was half, and that passes to the son.\n\nTherefore, son receives half plus quarter, which is three-quarters.\n\nBut, perhaps there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the son only receives Hunter's interest in the joint tenancy, and Willa's interest in the tenants by the entirety, but we need to see how the interests overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me try to approach this from the beginning again.\n\nAnn owns the entire tract.\n\nShe sells half to Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety.\n\nSo, Hunter and Willa own half together as tenants by the entirety.\n\nThen, Ann sells the other half to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants.\n\nSo, Hunter owns a half as tenant by the entirety with Willa and a half as joint tenant with Brandon.\n\nBut wait, no, Hunter owns half with Willa as tenants by the entirety, and the other half with Brandon as joint tenants.\n\nSo, his interest is:\n\n- Half as tenant by the entirety.\n\n- Half as joint tenant.\n\nThen, when Hunter dies, his interests pass accordingly.\n\nBut since Hunter and Willa die simultaneously, their interests in the tenants by the entirety pass to their heirs.\n\nSimilarly, their interests in the joint tenancy pass to their heirs.\n\nSo, in the tenants by the entirety, since both died simultaneously, the entire half passes to their son.\n\nIn the joint tenancy, Hunter's quarter passes to the son, and Brandon's quarter passes to Brandon's heirs.\n\nTherefore, the son owns three-quarters in total.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nLet me consider the joint tenancy separately.\n\nHunter and Brandon own the half as joint tenants.\n\nEach owns a quarter of the whole tract.\n\nWhen both die simultaneously, their interests pass to their heirs.\n\nSo, Hunter's quarter passes to the son, and Brandon's quarter passes to Brandon's heirs.\n\nSimilarly, in the tenants by the entirety, Hunter and Willa both die simultaneously, so their half interest passes to their son.\n\nTherefore, the son receives half from the tenants by the entirety and a quarter from the joint tenancy, totaling three-quarters.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.\n\nBut let's see why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A is an undivided one-third interest, which would be incorrect because the son receives more than that.\n\nOption B is an undivided one-quarter interest, which is even less and clearly incorrect.\n\nOption C is an undivided one-half interest, but we've established that the son receives more than that.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
