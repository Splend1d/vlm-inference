                    "text": "So I've got this problem here from Mill Co. They reported a pretax income of $152,500 for the year ended December 31. But during the year-end audit, the external auditors found some errors. Specifically, the ending inventory was overstated by $30,000, and the depreciation expense was understated by $64,000. I need to figure out what the correct pretax income should be after adjusting for these errors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these errors mean and how they affect the financial statements.\n\nStarting with the ending inventory being overstated by $30,000. Inventory is an asset, and if it's overstated, that means the asset account has a higher balance than it should. This would lead to higher cost of goods sold (since beginning inventory plus purchases minus ending inventory equals COGS), but wait, actually, if ending inventory is overstated, that means less COGS, because COGS = beginning inventory + purchases - ending inventory. So, an overstatement in ending inventory would result in lower COGS and therefore higher gross profit and higher pretax income.\n\nBut Mill Co. already reported a pretax income of $152,500, which is higher than it should be due to this overstatement. So, to correct this, I need to reduce the pretax income by the amount of the overstatement's effect.\n\nSimilarly, depreciation expense was understated by $64,000. Depreciation is an expense, so if it's understated, that means expenses are lower than they should be, leading to higher pretax income.\n\nAgain, since pretax income is higher than it should be due to this error, I need to reduce it by the amount of the understatement to correct it.\n\nSo, both errors caused the pretax income to be higher than it should be, and I need to adjust it downward by the combined effect of these errors.\n\nLet me try to calculate that.\n\nFirst, the overstatement of ending inventory by $30,000 led to an understatement of COGS by $30,000, which in turn led to an overstatement of pretax income by $30,000.\n\nSecond, the understatement of depreciation expense by $64,000 directly led to an overstatement of pretax income by $64,000.\n\nTherefore, the total overstatement of pretax income is $30,000 + $64,000 = $94,000.\n\nSo, to get the correct pretax income, I need to subtract this $94,000 from the reported $152,500.\n\n$152,500 - $94,000 = $58,500.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if I'm missing something.\n\nI recall that in some cases, inventory errors can affect not only the current period but also the next period. For example, if ending inventory is overstated in one year, it will be beginning inventory for the next year, and so on. But since this is for the year ended December 31, and we're only adjusting the current year's numbers, I think correcting the current year's overstatement is sufficient.\n\nAlso, depreciation is an expense that affects the income statement directly, so the understatement directly impacts the pretax income.\n\nSo, my calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct pretax income should be $58,500.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $58,500\n\nB. $118,500\n\nC. $186,500\n\nD. $246,500\n\nOption A matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps the overstatement of ending inventory affects cost of goods sold in the next period. But since we're only dealing with the current year, and the error is in the ending inventory of this year, which is the beginning inventory for next year, but we're not concerned with next year's numbers here.\n\nSo, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the effects on the income statement.\n\nPretax income is calculated as revenues minus expenses.\n\nEnding inventory overstatement leads to lower COGS, which is an expense, so pretax income is higher.\n\nUnderstated depreciation expense also leads to lower expenses and higher pretax income.\n\nSo, both errors cause pretax income to be higher than it should be.\n\nCorrecting these errors means reducing pretax income by the amount of the overstatement.\n\nSo, $152,500 - $30,000 - $64,000 = $58,500.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. $58,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA. $58,500"
