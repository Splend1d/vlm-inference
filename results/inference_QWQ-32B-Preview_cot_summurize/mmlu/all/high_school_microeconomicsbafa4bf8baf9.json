Okay, let's look at each one.\n\nOption A says: \"how unlimited resources are allocated between scarce wants.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit off. I think I remember that economics deals with scarcity, but isn't it that resources are scarce and wants are unlimited? So this seems backwards.\n\nOption B: \"how money is circulated through the economy.\" Well, money is certainly a part of economics, but doesn't economics cover more than just the circulation of money? Maybe this is too narrow.\n\nOption C: \"how corporations maximize the share price of their stock.\" This seems very specific. Corporations are a part of economics, but economics isn't just about corporations and stock prices. There's more to it, right?\n\nOption D: \"how scarce resources are allocated to satisfy unlimited wants.\" This sounds familiar. I think this is the standard definition of economics. Resources are scarce, meaning we don't have enough to satisfy all our wants, which are unlimited, so we need to make choices about how to allocate them.\n\nLet me think about this again. Scarcity is a fundamental concept in economics. Because resources are limited, but human wants are unlimited, economics is about making decisions on how to allocate those resources efficiently to satisfy as many wants as possible.\n\nSo, comparing the options:\n\nA has it backwards: resources are scarce, wants are unlimited.\n\nB is too narrow; economics isn't just about money circulation.\n\nC is too specific; it's about corporations and stock prices, which is just one aspect of economics.\n\nD matches the standard definition I recall.\n\nTherefore, D seems to be the best completion for the definition of economics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
