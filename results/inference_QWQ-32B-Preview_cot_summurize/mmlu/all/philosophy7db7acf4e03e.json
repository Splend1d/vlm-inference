The question is: \"According to d'Holbach, all the mental and moral attributes that people think are evidence for an immaterial soul are in fact _____.\" And the options are: A. purely intellectual, B. purely physical and natural, C. ethereal, D. undetermined.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who d'Holbach was and what his beliefs were regarding the soul. d'Holbach was a philosopher from the Enlightenment period, and I think he was a materialist. Materialists believe that everything, including mental states and consciousness, can be explained in terms of physical processes in the brain and body. So, he probably didn't believe in an immaterial soul.\n\nGiven that, if he thought that mental and moral attributes weren't evidence for an immaterial soul, then he likely believed they were something else. Looking at the options:\n\nA. purely intellectual - That seems a bit vague. Intellectual attributes could still be part of a physical system, but it doesn't directly contradict the idea of an immaterial soul.\n\nB. purely physical and natural - This aligns with his materialist views. If he believed that everything is physical and natural, then mental and moral attributes would also be explained by physical processes.\n\nC. ethereal - Ethereal suggests something\u8f7b\u76c8\u7684 or \u4e0d\u5b9e\u5728\u7684, which might be closer to an immaterial soul, not something he would agree with.\n\nD. undetermined - This suggests that he didn't have a specific view on what these attributes were, which doesn't sound right given his materialist stance.\n\nSo, based on d'Holbach's materialism, it makes sense that he would argue that mental and moral attributes are purely physical and natural phenomena, not evidence for an immaterial soul.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. purely physical and natural.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
