Their possible genotypes are BB or BO.\n\n- The other parent has type AB blood. Their genotype is AB.\n\nWe need to find the probability that their child has type O blood, which has the genotype OO.\n\nLet's consider the possible combinations:\n\n1. If the type B parent has genotype BB:\n\n- Possible gametes: B\n\n- Type AB parent: possible gametes: A or B\n\n- Possible combinations:\n\n- Child receives B from type B parent and A from type AB parent: AB\n\n- Child receives B from type B parent and B from type AB parent: BB\n\n- Neither combination results in OO.\n\n2. If the type B parent has genotype BO:\n\n- Possible gametes: B or O\n\n- Type AB parent: possible gametes: A or B\n\n- Possible combinations:\n\n- Child receives B from type B parent and A from type AB parent: AB\n\n- Child receives B from type B parent and B from type AB parent: BB\n\n- Child receives O from type B parent and A from type AB parent: AO\n\n- Child receives O from type B parent and B from type AB parent: BO\n\n- None of these combinations result in OO.\n\nFrom both scenarios, we see that it is impossible for the child to have type O blood (OO) given the parents' blood types.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 0%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
