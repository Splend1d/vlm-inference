                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what an \"internationally wrongful conduct\" is. There are a few options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nOption A says it's an action or omission that breaches a rule of international criminal law. Hmm, international criminal law deals with crimes like genocide and war crimes, so maybe wrongful conduct is related to that. But I think internationally wrongful conduct might be a broader concept.\n\nOption B says it's every breach of an international obligation of the State, whether attributable to it or not. That seems too broad. If a breach isn't even attributable to the State, how can it be considered wrongful conduct by that State?\n\nOption C states that internationally wrongful conduct consists of an action or omission attributable to the State, which constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State. This sounds more precise. It ties wrongful conduct to actions or omissions that can be directly linked to the State and that violate its international obligations.\n\nOption D says it's conduct that cannot be excused on grounds of necessity, force majeure, etc. So, this is talking about conduct that doesn't have legitimate excuses. But doesn't internationally wrongful conduct include conduct that is breach of an obligation, and then we look at whether there are any excuses or justifications?\n\nI think Option C is the most accurate. It defines internationally wrongful conduct as an action or omission that can be attributed to the State and that breaches an international obligation. This seems to align with how international law generally views State responsibility.\n\nLet me think about this some more. In international law, States are held responsible for certain actions or omissions that violate their international obligations. These actions have to be attributable to the State, meaning that they were done by the State's organs or persons acting on behalf of the State.\n\nOption A seems too narrow because it limits wrongful conduct to breaches of international criminal law, which is just one area of international law.\n\nOption B is too broad because it includes breaches that aren't even attributable to the State, which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D seems to be talking about the consequences or excuses for wrongful conduct, not the definition of wrongful conduct itself.\n\nSo, based on this, I believe Option C is the correct definition of internationally wrongful conduct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
