                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out why Pompeii was so well preserved. There are four options here, and I need to pick the right one. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says that the layer of volcanic pumice created a seal over the remains. Hmm, I remember that Pompeii was buried by volcanic ash from Mount Vesuvius. Pumice is a type of volcanic rock, so maybe this is correct. The ash covered everything quickly, like a blanket, and protected the city from the elements and scavengers. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption B mentions avalanches pushing the remains into the sea, and that seawater preserves things. Wait, Pompeii is near the coast, but I don't think the remains were pushed into the sea. From what I know, the city was buried under ash and pumice, not swept away by avalanches into the water. So, this seems less likely.\n\nOption C talks about poisonous volcanic gases killing people instantly. While it's true that volcanic gases were deadly, and they did kill people quickly, I don't see how that directly contributes to the preservation of the city. Preservation has more to do with how the remains were covered and protected after the disaster, not just how people died.\n\nOption D says that the Romans embalmed the victims with salt from seawater. I don't recall any evidence that the Romans embalmed their dead in that way. Embalming was more common in ancient Egypt, not in Roman times. Besides, Pompeii wasn't just about the human remains; the entire city was preserved, including buildings, frescoes, and everyday objects.\n\nSo, considering all this, option A seems the most accurate. The layer of volcanic pumice created a seal over the remains, protecting them from decay and damage over centuries. That's why when archaeologists started excavating Pompeii, they found so many details intact, giving us a incredible glimpse into Roman life.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
