                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that a certain medicine causes side effects in one in five patients. So, that means that for every five patients who take this medicine, one of them will experience side effects. Now, the doctor prescribes this medicine to four unrelated patients, and I need to find the probability that none of these four patients will develop side effects.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the probability of a single patient not experiencing side effects is. Since one in five patients get side effects, that means four in five don't get them. So, the probability that one patient doesn't get side effects is 4/5, which is 0.8.\n\nNow, since the patients are unrelated, I can assume that their reactions to the medicine are independent events. That means the outcome for one patient doesn't affect the others. So, to find the probability that all four patients don't get side effects, I need to multiply the individual probabilities together.\n\nSo, the probability that none of the four patients get side effects is (4/5) raised to the power of 4, which is (4/5)^4.\n\nLet me calculate that. (4/5)^4 is the same as 0.8^4.\n\n0.8 \u00d7 0.8 = 0.64\n\n0.64 \u00d7 0.8 = 0.512\n\n0.512 \u00d7 0.8 = 0.4096\n\nSo, the probability is 0.4096.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.8\n\nB. 0.4096\n\nC. 0.25\n\nD. 0.2\n\nIt looks like option B is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- P(k) is the probability of k successes in n trials\n\n- C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial\n\n- n is the number of trials\n\n- k is the number of successes\n\nIn this case, a \"success\" is a patient not experiencing side effects, which is what we want. So, p = 4/5 = 0.8, n = 4, and k = 4 (since we want all four patients to not experience side effects).\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nP(4) = C(4,4) * (0.8)^4 * (1-0.8)^(4-4)\n\nC(4,4) is 1, (0.8)^4 is 0.4096, and (0.2)^0 is 1.\n\nSo, P(4) = 1 * 0.4096 * 1 = 0.4096\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the probability that each patient does not have side effects, and since the events are independent, multiply the probabilities together, which is what I did first.\n\nSo, I'm confident that 0.4096 is the correct probability.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 0.4096.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
