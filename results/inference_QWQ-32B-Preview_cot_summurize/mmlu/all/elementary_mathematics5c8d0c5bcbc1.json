                    "text": "So I have this problem here: a student has 3 puzzles, each with 1,250 pieces, and I need to find the total number of pieces in all the puzzles. The options are A) 3,650, B) 3,750, C) 4,650, and D) 4,750. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It seems straightforward\u2014there are 3 puzzles, each with 1,250 pieces, and I need to find the total number of pieces. So, basically, I need to multiply the number of puzzles by the number of pieces per puzzle.\n\nSo, that would be 3 multiplied by 1,250. Let me write that down: 3 \u00d7 1,250.\n\nNow, how do I do this multiplication? I can break it down into simpler parts. I know that 1,250 is the same as 1,000 plus 250. So, 3 \u00d7 1,250 = 3 \u00d7 (1,000 + 250) = (3 \u00d7 1,000) + (3 \u00d7 250).\n\nCalculating each part separately:\n\n3 \u00d7 1,000 = 3,000\n\n3 \u00d7 250 = 750\n\nNow, adding those together: 3,000 + 750 = 3,750.\n\nSo, the total number of pieces is 3,750.\n\nLooking back at the options, B) 3,750 matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I can try a different method to verify.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the multiplication directly. 3 \u00d7 1,250.\n\nI know that 3 \u00d7 125 = 375, and since 1,250 is 125 multiplied by 10, the result should be 375 multiplied by 10, which is 3,750. That matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can add 1,250 three times: 1,250 + 1,250 + 1,250.\n\n1,250 + 1,250 = 2,500\n\n2,500 + 1,250 = 3,750\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of miscounting. Maybe the puzzles aren't all exactly 1,250 pieces, but the problem says each puzzle has 1,250 pieces, so I can assume they are all the same.\n\nAlso, ensure that the number of puzzles is indeed 3. The problem states \"3 puzzles,\" so that seems clear.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there might be any pieces missing or anything like that, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I should assume all pieces are present.\n\nMoreover, check the answer options to see if there's any trick or misdirection. The options are 3,650; 3,750; 4,650; and 4,750. My calculation leads to 3,750, which is option B, and it seems correct based on the straightforward multiplication.\n\nBut just to be extra sure, let's try another approach. Maybe using long multiplication:\n\n     1,250\n\n   \u00d7     3\n\n   -------\n\n     3,750\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nAlternatively, consider the place values: 1,250 has 1 thousand, 2 hundreds, 5 tens, and 0 ones. Multiplying each by 3:\n\n- 1 thousand \u00d7 3 = 3 thousands\n\n- 2 hundreds \u00d7 3 = 6 hundreds\n\n- 5 tens \u00d7 3 = 15 tens (which is 150)\n\n- 0 ones \u00d7 3 = 0 ones\n\nAdding them up: 3,000 + 600 + 150 + 0 = 3,750.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The total number of pieces is 3,750, which is option B.\n\nHowever, looking at the other options, I wonder why they might be included. Maybe to catch common calculation errors.\n\nFor example, if someone added 1,250 + 1,250 and got 2,500, then added another 1,250 and mistakenly got 3,650 instead of 3,750, they might choose option A.\n\nSimilarly, option C is 4,650, which is higher, perhaps resulting from a different mistake, like multiplying 3 \u00d7 1,550 or something similar.\n\nOption D is 4,750, which is even higher.\n\nBut based on my calculations, 3,750 seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the magnitude. 1,250 pieces per puzzle times 3 should be a little over 3,000, which aligns with 3,750.\n\nAlternatively, if the student had 4 puzzles of 1,250 pieces, that would be 5,000 pieces, which is more than any of the options, so 3 puzzles should be less than that.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can think about it in terms of thousands.\n\n1,250 is 1.25 thousand.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 1.25 thousand = 3.75 thousand, which is 3,750.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that 3,750 is the correct total number of pieces.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B) 3,750.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
