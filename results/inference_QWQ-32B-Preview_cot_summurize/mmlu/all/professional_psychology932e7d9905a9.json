                    "text": "Piaget's theory of cognitive development is a well-known framework in psychology that outlines the stages through which individuals progress as they develop cognitively. Jean Piaget, a Swiss psychologist, proposed that cognitive development occurs in a series of distinct stages, each characterized by different ways of thinking and understanding the world.\n\nLet's look at the options provided:\n\nA. During infancy only\n\nB. From birth to late childhood only\n\nC. From birth through late adolescence only\n\nD. Throughout the life span\n\nFirst, it's important to know that Piaget's theory focuses on the development of intelligence and cognitive abilities from infancy through childhood and into adolescence. He identified four main stages of cognitive development:\n\n1. **Sensorimotor stage** (birth to about 2 years): Infants learn about the world through their senses and actions, developing object permanence.\n\n2. **Preoperational stage** (approximately 2 to 7 years): Children begin to use symbols and language but struggle with logical operations and egocentrism.\n\n3. **Concrete operational stage** (approximately 7 to 11 years): Children develop logical thinking about concrete events and understand concepts like conservation.\n\n4. **Formal operational stage** (approximately 11 years and up): Adolescents and adults can think abstractly and hypothetically, solving problems systematically.\n\nGiven these stages, Piaget's theory covers cognitive development from birth through adolescence. However, some critics argue that his theory does not account for cognitive development beyond adolescence, suggesting that cognitive abilities continue to evolve in adulthood.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. During infancy only \u2013 This is too narrow, as Piaget's theory extends beyond infancy.\n\nB. From birth to late childhood only \u2013 This is partially correct but doesn't include adolescence.\n\nC. From birth through late adolescence only \u2013 This seems accurate, as Piaget's stages go up to formal operations, which begin around age 11 and continue into adolescence.\n\nD. Throughout the life span \u2013 This suggests that Piaget's theory covers cognitive development across the entire life span, which may not be entirely accurate, as his original stages stop in adolescence.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some researchers have extended Piaget's theory to include post-formal thinking in adulthood, but this was not part of Piaget's original framework.\n\nGiven the standard understanding of Piaget's theory, option C seems to be the most appropriate answer: \"From birth through late adolescence only.\"\n\nIt's also important to recognize that while Piaget's theory has been influential, it has limitations and has been critiqued and extended by other researchers in the field of cognitive development.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
