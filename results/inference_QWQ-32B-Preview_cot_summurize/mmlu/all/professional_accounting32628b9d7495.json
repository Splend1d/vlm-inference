                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to order these (risk, return) pairs from least to most favorable for a rational and risk-averse investor. The pairs are (2,2), (2,3), and (4,2). Risk is measured in standard deviations, and return is in percentages. The hint suggests imagining a scatter diagram with standard deviation on the x-axis and return on the y-axis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to be a rational and risk-averse investor. A rational investor is someone who makes decisions based on logical analysis and seeks to maximize their utility, which in investment terms often means maximizing returns for a given level of risk. A risk-averse investor is someone who prefers investments with lower risk for a given level of return. So, they would generally prefer higher returns and lower risks.\n\nGiven that, I need to order these pairs from least to most favorable. Least favorable would be the one that the investor likes the least, and most favorable would be the one they like the most.\n\nLet's list out the pairs again for clarity:\n\n- (2,2): Risk = 2, Return = 2\n\n- (2,3): Risk = 2, Return = 3\n\n- (4,2): Risk = 4, Return = 2\n\nNow, looking at these, I can see that two of them have the same risk level of 2, but different returns. The third one has a higher risk of 4 but the same return as one of the others.\n\nSince the investor is risk-averse, they prefer lower risk for the same return. So, between (2,2) and (4,2), which both have a return of 2, the investor would prefer (2,2) over (4,2) because it has lower risk for the same return.\n\nNow, between (2,2) and (2,3), both have the same risk level, but (2,3) offers a higher return. So, for the same risk, the investor would prefer the higher return, which is (2,3).\n\nSo, the ordering from least to most favorable would be:\n\n1. The one the investor likes the least.\n\n2. The next one.\n\n3. The one they like the most.\n\nGiven that, let's think about it.\n\nThe investor likes higher returns and lower risks. So, (2,3) is attractive because it has higher return and lower risk compared to (4,2). Between (2,2) and (4,2), since they have the same return but different risks, the investor would prefer (2,2) over (4,2).\n\nSo, the least favorable would be (4,2), because it has the highest risk and not the highest return.\n\nThen, (2,2) would be next, because it has lower risk but also lower return compared to (2,3).\n\nAnd the most favorable would be (2,3), because it has the highest return with the lowest risk among the options.\n\nWait a minute, but actually, in reality, if you have two options with the same risk, you'd prefer the higher return. And if you have two options with the same return, you'd prefer the lower risk.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- (4,2) is worse than (2,2) because they have the same return but (4,2) has higher risk.\n\n- (2,3) is better than (2,2) because it has higher return with the same risk.\n\nTherefore, from least to most favorable:\n\n(4,2) < (2,2) < (2,3)\n\nSo, the order is (4,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (4,2),(2,2),(2,3)\n\nB. (2,2),(2,3),(4,2)\n\nC. (2,2),(4,2),(2,3)\n\nD. (2,3),(2,2),(4,2)\n\nOption A matches the order I came up with: (4,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any scenario where (2,2) could be preferred over (2,3)?\n\nWell, no, because for the same risk, higher return is always preferred by a rational investor.\n\nSimilarly, between (2,2) and (4,2), (2,2) is preferred because it has lower risk for the same return.\n\nTherefore, the least favorable is (4,2), then (2,2), and most favorable is (2,3).\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider the concept of utility.\n\nUtility is a measure of satisfaction an investor gets from an investment. For a risk-averse investor, the utility function is such that the marginal utility of wealth decreases as wealth increases.\n\nIn other words, the investor is less satisfied with higher risks for the same return.\n\nSo, in this case, (4,2) would have lower utility compared to (2,2), and (2,3) would have higher utility than (2,2).\n\nTherefore, the ordering is correct.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the scatter diagram:\n\n- Plot risk on the x-axis and return on the y-axis.\n\n- So, (2,2) is at point (2,2)\n\n- (2,3) is at point (2,3)\n\n- (4,2) is at point (4,2)\n\nFor a risk-averse investor, they would prefer higher returns and lower risks, so points that are higher up and to the left are better.\n\nSo, (2,3) is the best, followed by (2,2), and then (4,2) is the worst.\n\nTherefore, from least to most favorable: (4,2), (2,2), (2,3), which is option A.\n\nBut now I'm a bit confused because in the options, option A is (4,2),(2,2),(2,3), which seems correct based on this logic.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose we think in terms of risk-return trade-off.\n\nThe investor is risk-averse, so they need to be compensated with higher returns for taking on higher risk.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- (2,2): Risk 2, Return 2\n\n- (2,3): Risk 2, Return 3\n\n- (4,2): Risk 4, Return 2\n\nComparing (2,2) and (4,2):\n\n- For the same return, (2,2) has lower risk, so it's preferred.\n\nComparing (2,2) and (2,3):\n\n- For the same risk, (2,3) has higher return, so it's preferred.\n\nTherefore, the ordering is (4,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look at the ratio of return to risk.\n\nSo, return per unit of risk.\n\n- (2,2): 2/2 = 1\n\n- (2,3): 3/2 = 1.5\n\n- (4,2): 2/4 = 0.5\n\nSo, based on this, (2,3) has the highest return per unit of risk, followed by (2,2), and then (4,2).\n\nBut since the investor is risk-averse, they might not solely focus on return per unit of risk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the Sharpe ratio, which is similar.\n\nBut in this case, since we don't have a risk-free rate, maybe it's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering standard deviation as a measure of risk, and return as is.\n\nGiven that, and the investor being risk-averse, the ordering should be based on minimizing risk for a given return, or maximizing return for a given risk.\n\nIn this case, since we have two options with the same risk, and one with higher return, the higher return one is preferred.\n\nSimilarly, for options with the same return, the lower risk one is preferred.\n\nTherefore, the order is (4,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's another perspective.\n\nSuppose we think about indifference curves.\n\nIndifference curves for a risk-averse investor are typically downward sloping, with higher utility for higher returns and lower risks.\n\nSo, in the risk-return plane, the investor prefers points that are northeast of other points.\n\nMeaning, higher return and lower risk.\n\nSo, (2,3) is better than (2,2), which is better than (4,2).\n\nTherefore, the order is (4,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nThus, option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering variance instead of standard deviation, but since standard deviation is just the square root of variance, the ordering would be the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering semivariance, but without specific information, it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the coefficient of variation, which is standard deviation divided by mean return.\n\nBut in this case, it's similar to what I did earlier with return per unit of risk.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think option A is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
