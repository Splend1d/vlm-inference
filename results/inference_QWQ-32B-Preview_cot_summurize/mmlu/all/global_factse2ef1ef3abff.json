                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the percentage of people in India who thought political parties were corrupt as of 2013. The options are 26%, 46%, 66%, and 86%. I don't remember the exact statistic, but I know that corruption has been a significant issue in Indian politics for a long time. I think a majority of people would have perceived political parties as corrupt, so maybe it's higher than 50%. Let me consider each option:\n\nA. 26% - That seems too low. If only 26% of people thought political parties were corrupt, that would be a minority, and given the public discourse on corruption in India, I doubt that's the case.\n\nB. 46% - This is still less than 50%. It suggests that slightly less than half of the population thought political parties were corrupt. Again, I suspect the perception was higher.\n\nC. 66% - This is more plausible. It's two-thirds of the population, which seems reasonable given the widespread reports of corruption in Indian politics around that time.\n\nD. 86% - This is very high, almost nine out of ten people. While corruption is a major issue, I'm not sure if such a high percentage of the population would have perceived all political parties as corrupt.\n\nLet me try to recall if there were any major surveys or studies around 2013 that addressed this issue. I remember that Transparency International often releases corruption perception indexes, but I'm not sure if they specifically asked about political parties in India.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there were Gallup polls or other public opinion surveys that looked into this. Perhaps I can look up some general information about public perception of corruption in Indian politics around 2013.\n\nIn 2013, India was going through a phase where corruption was a hot topic. There were protests and movements like Anna Hazare's anti-corruption campaign that gained significant traction. This suggests that corruption was a major concern for a large portion of the population.\n\nGiven that, it's likely that a substantial majority of people perceived political parties as corrupt. So, between 66% and 86%, I need to decide which one is more accurate.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say 66% is more reasonable. 86% seems too high because even within a corrupt system, some people might still have faith in certain parties or believe that not all parties are equally corrupt.\n\nOn the other hand, 66% aligns with the idea that corruption is widespread but not universal. It allows for the possibility that some people still view certain political entities as relatively cleaner.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to estimate this based on voting patterns or trust in government statistics. I know that trust in government can be an indicator of perceived corruption.\n\nAccording to the Edelman Trust Barometer, in 2013, trust in government in India was around 64%, which is lower but not as low as 26%. However, this isn't directly related to perceptions of corruption in political parties.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the corruption perception index by Transparency International for that year. In 2013, India was ranked 94th out of 177 countries, with a score of 36 on a scale from 0 (most corrupt) to 100 (least corrupt). This indicates a significant perception of corruption, but it doesn't translate directly into a percentage of people who think political parties are corrupt.\n\nPerhaps I should think about it differently. If the overall corruption perception index suggests a corrupt environment, it's reasonable to assume that a high percentage of people view political parties as corrupt.\n\nGiven that, 66% seems plausible, but 86% might be an overestimation. Unless there was a specific survey that found an exceptionally high percentage, I'd lean towards 66%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 46%, suggesting that less than half of the population perceived corruption in political parties. But that seems counterintuitive given the context.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the question is tricking me into thinking that it's a high percentage, but in reality, it was lower. Maybe only 26% of people thought political parties were corrupt, and the rest didn't see it as a major issue.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the public sentiment and the anti-corruption movements at the time.\n\nI think I need to consider that even if corruption is prevalent, not everyone may perceive it in the same way. There might be variations based on region, political affiliation, and other factors.\n\nHowever, given that corruption was a central issue in public discourse, it's likely that a substantial majority was concerned about it.\n\nLet me consider that in a democracy with multiple political parties, people might have varying opinions about which parties are corrupt and which aren't. So, while many might perceive some parties as corrupt, others might not share that view.\n\nPerhaps that's why 86% is too high because even in a corrupt system, some people might still believe that their preferred party is clean.\n\nOn the other hand, 66% seems like a reasonable estimate for the proportion of people who think political parties are corrupt.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 46%, indicating that just under half the population perceives corruption in political parties.\n\nBut again, considering the public outrage and protests against corruption, I find it hard to believe that only 46% perceived political parties as corrupt.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 86%, suggesting that an overwhelming majority saw corruption as a pervasive issue in political parties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is 66%, and 86% is too extreme.\n\nI'm going to make an educated guess and choose C. 66%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
