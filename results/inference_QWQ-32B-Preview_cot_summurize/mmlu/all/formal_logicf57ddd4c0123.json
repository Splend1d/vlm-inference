                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here, and I need to construct a truth table for the given argument and then determine whether it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick a counterexample from the options provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the argument is:\n\n1. ~X \u2283 Y\n\n2. Y \u2283 Z\n\n3. ~Z / ~X\n\nSo, we have three statements, and the conclusion is ~X, given the premises ~X \u2283 Y, Y \u2283 Z, and ~Z.\n\nTo construct a truth table, I need to evaluate the truth values of these statements for all possible combinations of truth values for X, Y, and Z. Since there are three variables, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.\n\nLet me list out the columns I'll need in my truth table:\n\n- X\n\n- Y\n\n- Z\n\n- ~X\n\n- ~Z\n\n- ~X \u2283 Y\n\n- Y \u2283 Z\n\n- ~Z \u2283 ~X\n\nWait, but the conclusion is ~X, and the premises are ~X \u2283 Y, Y \u2283 Z, and ~Z. I need to see if, when all premises are true, the conclusion ~X is also true.\n\nActually, looking back, the third premise is ~Z, and the conclusion is ~X. So, in the truth table, I need to look for rows where all three premises (~X \u2283 Y), (Y \u2283 Z), and (~Z) are true, and see if in those rows, ~X is also true.\n\nLet me correct that: the conclusion is ~X, and the premises are ~X \u2283 Y, Y \u2283 Z, and ~Z. So, if all premises are true, does ~X have to be true?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"/ \" symbol means something else. Sometimes in logic, \"/\" is used to separate premises from the conclusion, but in this context, it's possible that \"/~X\" means \"therefore ~X\", making ~X the conclusion.\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed.\n\nSo, I'll create a truth table with columns for X, Y, Z, ~X, ~Z, ~X \u2283 Y, Y \u2283 Z, and finally, the conclusion ~X.\n\nBut to check for validity, I need to see if whenever all premises are true, the conclusion is also true.\n\nSo, in the truth table, I'll look for rows where (~X \u2283 Y) is true, and (Y \u2283 Z) is true, and (~Z) is true, and see if in those rows, ~X is also true.\n\nIf there is any row where all premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid, and that row would be a counterexample.\n\nLet me start by listing all possible truth values for X, Y, Z:\n\n1. X = T, Y = T, Z = T\n\n2. X = T, Y = T, Z = F\n\n3. X = T, Y = F, Z = T\n\n4. X = T, Y = F, Z = F\n\n5. X = F, Y = T, Z = T\n\n6. X = F, Y = T, Z = F\n\n7. X = F, Y = F, Z = T\n\n8. X = F, Y = F, Z = F\n\nNow, for each of these rows, I'll compute the values for ~X, ~Z, ~X \u2283 Y, Y \u2283 Z, and ~X.\n\nLet's do this step by step.\n\nFirst row: X = T, Y = T, Z = T\n\n- ~X = F\n\n- ~Z = F\n\n- ~X \u2283 Y: F \u2283 T = T (since a false antecedent makes the implication true)\n\n- Y \u2283 Z: T \u2283 T = T\n\n- ~Z: F\n\nSo, premises: (~X \u2283 Y) = T, (Y \u2283 Z) = T, (~Z) = F\n\nSince ~Z is F, the third premise is false, so this row doesn't satisfy all premises.\n\nSecond row: X = T, Y = T, Z = F\n\n- ~X = F\n\n- ~Z = T\n\n- ~X \u2283 Y: F \u2283 T = T\n\n- Y \u2283 Z: T \u2283 F = F (since T \u2283 F is F)\n\n- ~Z: T\n\nHere, (Y \u2283 Z) is F, so this row doesn't satisfy all premises.\n\nThird row: X = T, Y = F, Z = T\n\n- ~X = F\n\n- ~Z = F\n\n- ~X \u2283 Y: F \u2283 F = T\n\n- Y \u2283 Z: F \u2283 T = T\n\n- ~Z: F\n\nAgain, ~Z is F, so this row doesn't satisfy all premises.\n\nFourth row: X = T, Y = F, Z = F\n\n- ~X = F\n\n- ~Z = T\n\n- ~X \u2283 Y: F \u2283 F = T\n\n- Y \u2283 Z: F \u2283 F = T\n\n- ~Z: T\n\nHere, all premises are true: (~X \u2283 Y) = T, (Y \u2283 Z) = T, (~Z) = T\n\nNow, check the conclusion ~X: ~X = F\n\nSo, in this row, all premises are true, but the conclusion is false.\n\nThis suggests that the argument is invalid, and this row is a counterexample.\n\nWait a minute, but let's check the other rows to be sure.\n\nFifth row: X = F, Y = T, Z = T\n\n- ~X = T\n\n- ~Z = F\n\n- ~X \u2283 Y: T \u2283 T = T\n\n- Y \u2283 Z: T \u2283 T = T\n\n- ~Z: F\n\n~Z is F, so this row doesn't satisfy all premises.\n\nSixth row: X = F, Y = T, Z = F\n\n- ~X = T\n\n- ~Z = T\n\n- ~X \u2283 Y: T \u2283 T = T\n\n- Y \u2283 Z: T \u2283 F = F\n\n- ~Z: T\n\n(Y \u2283 Z) is F, so this row doesn't satisfy all premises.\n\nSeventh row: X = F, Y = F, Z = T\n\n- ~X = T\n\n- ~Z = F\n\n- ~X \u2283 Y: T \u2283 F = F\n\n- Y \u2283 Z: F \u2283 T = T\n\n- ~Z: F\n\n(~X \u2283 Y) is F, so this row doesn't satisfy all premises.\n\nEighth row: X = F, Y = F, Z = F\n\n- ~X = T\n\n- ~Z = T\n\n- ~X \u2283 Y: T \u2283 F = F\n\n- Y \u2283 Z: F \u2283 F = T\n\n- ~Z: T\n\n(~X \u2283 Y) is F, so this row doesn't satisfy all premises.\n\nSo, the only row where all premises are true is the fourth row: X = T, Y = F, Z = F\n\nIn this row, the conclusion ~X is false, which means the argument is invalid.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Valid\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when X, Y, and Z are true\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when Y and Z are true and Z is false\n\nWait, that seems contradictory: \"Y and Z are true and Z is false\"? That can't happen, since Z can't be both true and false at the same time.\n\nProbably a typo. Maybe it's \"Invalid. Counterexample when Y is true and Z is false.\"\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when X is true and Y and Z are false\n\nSo, option D describes X = T, Y = F, Z = F, which is exactly the counterexample I found.\n\nOption B suggests X, Y, Z are all true, but in that case, ~Z is false, so it's not a counterexample.\n\nOption C seems flawed because it's logically impossible for Z to be both true and false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nJust to summarize:\n\n- Constructed truth table for X, Y, Z\n\n- Evaluated premises and conclusion in each row\n\n- Found that only in the row where X = T, Y = F, Z = F are all premises true, but conclusion is false\n\n- Therefore, argument is invalid\n\n- Option D correctly identifies this counterexample\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
