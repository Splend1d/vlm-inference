The teacher wants to do an activity that helps the class become aware of the common interests they share with the new student. That sounds like a great goal because sometimes kids might feel different or left out if they're from a different background.\n\nOption A is inviting a member of the new student's family to discuss the family's culture with the class. That seems like a nice way to educate the class about the new student's background, but I'm not sure if it directly addresses the issue of finding common interests. It's more about learning about differences, which is important, but maybe not what's being asked here.\n\nOption B is creating a chart that shows how students are similar. This sounds promising because it directly aims to highlight commonalities among the students, including the new one. By listing similarities, the class can see that they have more in common than they might think.\n\nOption C is using a globe to show where the new student's family comes from. Again, this is educational and helps the class understand the new student's background, but it might not directly address finding common interests.\n\nOption D is asking the class to help the new student learn classroom rules through role-playing. This is helpful for the new student to understand the rules, but it might not necessarily bring the class together by highlighting their shared interests.\n\nComparing all these options, I think option B is the best because it directly focuses on identifying and showcasing the similarities among the students, which should help in building connections and reducing feelings of exclusion.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe combining some of these activities would be even better, but since we have to choose just one, I'll go with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
