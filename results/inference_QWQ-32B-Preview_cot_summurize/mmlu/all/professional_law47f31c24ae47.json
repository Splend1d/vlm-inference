A buyer comes by, fully aware that it is the work of a famous Italian Renaissance artist, and quietly offers the $10 for an etching he knows to be worth at least $100,000. When the seller finds out that he made an awful mistake, and that the buyer knew that it was a precious work of art, he sued to get the $100,000 or for return of the etching. The buyer defended by alleging that the seller did not act reasonably to protect himself by knowing what he was selling. Under the Restatement of Contracts and the majority rule in the case law, will the court grant the buyer's motion to dismiss the seller's complaint?\n\nA. Yes, the seller should have had the items appraised before selling them. The seller always must know the value of what is being offered for sale.\nB. Yes, the seller cannot rescind a contract just because he later regrets it; either party may end up with the superior deal depending on luck, knowledge and variety of factors.\nC. No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there has been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values, and there is no substantial hardship to the other party.\nD. No, because a party always has a right to rescind a contract where the value of the product or services does not live up to his reasonable expectation.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this scenario about a yard sale where someone sells an old etching for $10, not knowing it's actually worth $100,000. The buyer knew its true value and bought it for way below what it's worth. Now, the seller wants to get either the $100,000 or the etching back, and the buyer is defending by saying the seller shouldn't have been so careless. I need to decide which option is correct based on contract law.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. The seller had no idea about the etching's true value and sold it for $10. The buyer knew it was worth a lot more but still offered $10, and the seller accepted. After finding out about the mistake, the seller wants to undo the sale or get compensated for the error.\n\nOption A says yes, the buyer's motion to dismiss should be granted because the seller should have had the items appraised before selling them. It also says the seller must always know the value of what they're selling. But I think that's putting too much responsibility on the seller. Not everyone can know the value of every item they inherit or own, especially something like an etching by a famous artist.\n\nOption B says yes, the buyer's motion should be granted because the seller can't rescind the contract just because they regret it. It mentions that either party may end up with a better deal based on luck or knowledge. This seems to suggest that the seller took the risk by selling without knowing the value, and now has to live with the consequences.\n\nOption C says no, the buyer's motion shouldn't be granted because in some cases of unilateral mistake, where one party doesn't know the true value, the contract can be rescinded if there's an unconscionably unequal exchange and it doesn't heavily impact the other party.\n\nOption D says no, because a party always has a right to rescind a contract if the value doesn't live up to their expectations. But that seems too broad. If that were true, people could always change their minds if they find out later that they got a bad deal.\n\nI think option C is the most accurate. In contract law, there's a concept of unilateral mistake, where only one party is mistaken about a material fact in the contract. If the mistake is so significant that it causes an unfair exchange, and the other party knew about it, the contract can be rescinded.\n\nIn this case, the seller was mistaken about the value of the etching, and the buyer knew the true value. The exchange is extremely unequal\u2014$10 for something worth $100,000. That's unconscionable. Also, making the buyer give back the etching or pay the true value shouldn't be a substantial hardship because they got it for way below its worth.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it places an unrealistic burden on the seller to know the value of all their items. Not everyone can be expected to have expert knowledge about antiques or art.\n\nOption B might seem plausible, but in cases of unilateral mistake and unfair advantage taken by the other party, the law sometimes intervenes to prevent unjust enrichment.\n\nOption D is too broad and doesn't consider the specific circumstances of unilateral mistake and unfair exchange.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: No, because in some unilateral mistakes, rescission is allowed if there has been an unconscionably unequal exchange of values, and there is no substantial hardship to the other party.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
