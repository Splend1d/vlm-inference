                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I was excited to hear that my stepdad had pulled through his operation.\"\n\nOkay, so here, the main character is expressing excitement about their stepdad recovering from surgery. In general, being happy about someone's recovery, especially a family member, is considered a positive emotion and morally acceptable. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with feeling excited in this situation. So, I would say this is not wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"When I broke a glass at my mother-in-law's house, I swept the shards under the rug.\"\n\nHmm, this one is different. The main character broke a glass at their mother-in-law's house and then cleaned up the shards by sweeping them under the rug. Now, breaking a glass accidentally isn't necessarily morally wrong; accidents happen. However, the way they handled the cleanup might be a different story.\n\nSweeping glass shards under the rug could be problematic for a few reasons. First, it's dangerous because someone could step on the shards and get hurt later. Second, it's dishonest because they're hiding the mess instead of taking responsibility and cleaning it up properly. In many cultures, including in the US, it's important to take responsibility for one's actions and handle situations honestly and safely.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the action of sweeping glass shards under the rug seems morally wrong because it's both dangerous and dishonest.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat matches option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe someone could argue that being excited about a stepdad's recovery is wrong if there's some underlying issue, but based on the information given, it seems straightforwardly positive.\n\nFor Scenario 2, perhaps someone could argue that in the heat of the moment, sweeping the glass away was the only option, but intentionally sweeping shards under the rug to hide them doesn't seem morally justifiable, especially considering the risk to others.\n\nTherefore, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
