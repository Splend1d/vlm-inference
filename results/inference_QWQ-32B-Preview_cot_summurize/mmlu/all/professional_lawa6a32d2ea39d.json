The tutor sent the law student a copy of the tutor's standard tutorial agreement. The agreement stated that the tutor's rate was $50 per one-hour session. The law student then telephoned the tutor and said, \"This agreement looks fine to me. I'd like you to give me 10 sessions over the next 10 days. \" The tutor replied, That will be fine. Fill in 10 sessions on the agreement, sign it, and bring it to me tomorrow when we have our first session. \" The student then said, \"I want you to really push me to do my best. In fact, if I get an A in any class I'll pay you an additional $100 for each A. \"The next day, the law student brought the signed agreement to the tutorial session. The tutor conducted all 10 sessions. Two weeks later, when the results of the finals were released, the law student excitedly called the tutor and exclaimed, \"Thank you so much I just found out that I received two A's and two B's in my classes!\" The tutor then sent the law student a bill for $700. Two days later the tutor received a check from the law student in the amount of $500. Included with the check was a note which read, \"You taught me contract law very well. I now know that I am not obligated to pay you the additional $200 for the A's, because that was just a gratuitous promise. \" On the back of the check the law student typed the following:\"Endorsement of this check by payee constitutes surrender of all claims against me arising out of our tutorial arrangement. \"In need of money, the tutor endorsed and cashed the check. What is the probable legal effect of the tutor's endorsement of the check?\n\nA. It constituted a discharge of a liquidated claim.\nB. It constituted an accord and satisfaction of an unliquidated claim.\nC. Part payment of a liquidated claim would not constitute a discharge of the entire amount due.\nD. Part payment of an unliquidated claim does not constitute sufficient consideration for the discharge of the entire claim.\n"

                    "text": "So here's this scenario involving a law student and a tutor, and there's some confusion about payments and contracts. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the tutor has a standard agreement that charges $50 per one-hour session. The law student agrees to this and wants 10 sessions, so that would be $500 in total for the sessions. But then the student adds, \"If I get an A in any class, I'll pay you an extra $100 for each A.\" So, there's an additional conditional payment based on the student's performance.\n\nThe tutor conducts all 10 sessions as agreed. After the finals, the student gets two A's and two B's, so according to the additional agreement, the tutor should get $100 for each A, which is $200, plus the original $500 for the sessions, totaling $700.\n\nHowever, the student sends a check for only $500 and includes a note saying that the additional $200 for the A's isn't owed because it was a \"gratuitous promise.\" The check also has a statement that endorsing it means the tutor gives up all claims related to the tutorial arrangement.\n\nThe tutor, needing money, endorses and cashes the check. Now, the question is about the legal effect of this endorsement.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. It constituted a discharge of a liquidated claim.\n\nB. It constituted an accord and satisfaction of an unliquidated claim.\n\nC. Part payment of a liquidated claim would not constitute a discharge of the entire amount due.\n\nD. Part payment of an unliquidated claim does not constitute sufficient consideration for the discharge of the entire claim.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a liquidated and an unliquidated claim are.\n\nA liquidated claim is one where the amount owed is fixed and determined. An unliquidated claim is one where the amount owed is not yet determined or is in dispute.\n\nIn this case, the original tutoring sessions amount to $500, which is liquidated because it's a set rate for a set number of sessions. The additional $100 per A is also now liquidated because the student got two A's, so it's $200. Therefore, the total claim is $700, which is liquidated.\n\nHowever, the student is only paying $500 and claiming that the additional $200 isn't owed. So, there's a dispute about the additional amount.\n\nNow, the check for $500 is being offered in full satisfaction of what the tutor believes is a $700 debt. The tutor endorses and cashes the check.\n\nIn contract law, accepting a partial payment can sometimes be considered an accord and satisfaction, meaning that the parties agree to settle the debt for less than what is claimed.\n\nBut, for accord and satisfaction to apply, there usually needs to be a good faith dispute about the amount owed. Here, the tutor believes the total is $700, and the student is arguing that it's only $500.\n\nThe check is for $500, and the endorsement includes a statement that accepting this check discharges all claims related to the tutorial arrangement.\n\nSo, by endorsing and cashing the check, is the tutor accepting $500 in full satisfaction of the debt, thereby discharging the remaining $200?\n\nOption A says it constitutes a discharge of a liquidated claim. Since the total claim is liquidated at $700, accepting $500 could be seen as discharging the entire claim.\n\nOption B says it's an accord and satisfaction of an unliquidated claim. But in this case, the claim is liquidated, not unliquidated, because the total amount is determined.\n\nOption C states that part payment of a liquidated claim doesn't discharge the entire amount due. This is generally true, but accord and satisfaction can operate even with liquidated claims if there's a dispute and the parties agree to settle for less.\n\nOption D is about part payment of an unliquidated claim not constituting sufficient consideration for discharging the entire claim. Again, in this case, the claim is liquidated.\n\nGiven that, the most accurate answer seems to be Option A: It constituted a discharge of a liquidated claim.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that in some jurisdictions, there are specific rules about accord and satisfaction, and the intentions of the parties must be clear. The tutor might argue that they endorsed the check only because they needed money and didn't realize the implications, but legally, endorsing a check with a restrictive endorsement like that could be seen as accepting the terms.\n\nSo, the probable legal effect is that the tutor has discharged the entire claim by endorsing and cashing the check, even though the total claim was liquidated at $700 and only $500 was paid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
