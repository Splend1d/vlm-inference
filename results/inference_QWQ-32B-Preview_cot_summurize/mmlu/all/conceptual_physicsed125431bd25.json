                    "text": "So I have this question here about light refracting when it passes from one medium to another. It's asking which of the options changes during this process. The options are:\n\nA. Speed only\n\nB. Wavelength only\n\nC. Both speed and wavelength\n\nD. Neither of these\n\nOkay, first I need to recall what happens when light refracts. Refraction is when light bends as it goes from one material to another, like from air into water. This bending happens because light travels at different speeds in different materials.\n\nI think that when light moves from one medium to another, its speed changes. For example, light travels faster in air than in water. So, option A says \"Speed only.\" But I'm not sure if only the speed changes or if something else changes too.\n\nWait, I think wavelength is also involved in refraction. Maybe both speed and wavelength change. Let me think about that.\n\nI remember that the speed of light in a medium is related to the medium's refractive index. The refractive index is a measure of how much the medium slows down light compared to vacuum.\n\nAlso, the relationship between speed, wavelength, and frequency is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ v = f \\lambda \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the speed, \\( f \\) is the frequency, and \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength.\n\nNow, when light passes from one medium to another, does the frequency change?\n\nI think the frequency stays the same because frequency is determined by the source of the light and doesn't change as it moves through different media.\n\nSo, if frequency remains constant and speed changes, then wavelength must also change to keep the equation \\( v = f \\lambda \\) balanced.\n\nLet me put that another way: if speed decreases but frequency stays the same, then wavelength must decrease proportionally to keep the equation valid.\n\nSimilarly, if speed increases, wavelength would increase, assuming frequency remains constant.\n\nSo, in refraction, both speed and wavelength change, but frequency remains the same.\n\nWait, but the question is about what changes when light refracts, and it mentions speed and wavelength. It doesn't mention frequency, which is good because the question is focused on speed and wavelength.\n\nSo, based on what I just thought, both speed and wavelength change when light refracts, while frequency remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: Both speed and wavelength.\n\nBut let me double-check this.\n\nI recall that when light goes from air into water, it slows down and its wavelength decreases, but the frequency remains the same.\n\nSimilarly, when light goes from water back into air, it speeds up and its wavelength increases, but again, frequency remains the same.\n\nSo, it makes sense that both speed and wavelength change during refraction.\n\nOption A says \"Speed only,\" but that can't be right because wavelength also changes.\n\nOption B says \"Wavelength only,\" but that's also not correct because speed changes as well.\n\nOption D says \"Neither of these,\" which contradicts what I know about refraction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Both speed and wavelength.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard that frequency is the only quantity that remains constant when light passes from one medium to another. Is that true?\n\nYes, that's correct. Frequency remains constant, while speed and wavelength change accordingly.\n\nSo, in summary, during refraction, light's speed and wavelength change, but its frequency stays the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Both speed and wavelength.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\n"
