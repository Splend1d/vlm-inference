                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about sales tax on food and how it affects people with different incomes. It says that people with lower incomes spend a larger percentage of their income on food compared to people with higher incomes. And then it asks what category of tax a sales tax on food would fall into: progressive, proportional, regressive, or neutral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these tax categories means:\n\n1. **Progressive tax**: This is a tax where the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases. In other words, richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than poorer people do.\n\n2. **Proportional tax**: Also known as a flat tax, this is where everyone pays the same percentage of their income in taxes, regardless of how much they earn.\n\n3. **Regressive tax**: This is a tax where the tax rate decreases as the taxable amount increases. In simpler terms, poorer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than richer people do.\n\n4. **Neutral tax**: I'm not entirely sure about this one, but I think it means that the tax doesn't affect people's behavior or decisions and doesn't favor any particular group.\n\nNow, the question is about a sales tax on food. Sales tax is a tax levied on the sale of goods and services, and in this case, it's specifically on food. The key point here is that people with lower incomes spend a larger percentage of their income on food than those with higher incomes.\n\nSo, if a sales tax is applied to food, how does that affect different income groups?\n\n- For someone with a lower income, since they spend a larger portion of their income on food, the sales tax on food would represent a bigger chunk of their total income.\n\n- For someone with a higher income, food expenses make up a smaller portion of their income, so the same sales tax would represent a smaller percentage of their total income.\n\nTherefore, the sales tax on food would take a larger percentage of income from lower-income individuals compared to higher-income individuals.\n\nLooking back at the tax categories:\n\n- Progressive: higher rates for higher incomes.\n\n- Proportional: same rates for all incomes.\n\n- Regressive: lower rates for higher incomes.\n\n- Neutral: no particular pattern.\n\nGiven that the sales tax on food results in lower-income people paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to higher-income people, this sounds like a regressive tax.\n\nWait a minute, progressive taxes are where richer people pay a higher percentage, which is the opposite of what's happening here. Proportional taxes have everyone paying the same percentage, but in this case, lower-income people are paying a higher percentage. Regressive taxes are where poorer people pay a higher percentage, which matches this scenario.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Regressive.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that this could be considered proportional or neutral?\n\nIf the sales tax rate is the same for everyone, regardless of income, then in terms of the tax rate, it's proportional. However, because lower-income people spend a larger portion of their income on food, the effective tax rate is higher for them. So, even though the tax rate on food is the same for everyone, the overall impact on income is greater for lower-income individuals.\n\nTherefore, in terms of effective tax rate on income, it's regressive.\n\nAlternatively, if the tax was based on ability to pay, like in a progressive tax system, then perhaps it could be considered differently. But since it's a sales tax on food, it's based on consumption, not income.\n\nSo, I think C. Regressive is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any way this could be progressive or neutral.\n\n- Progressive: As mentioned, progressive taxes have higher rates for higher incomes. In this case, lower-income people are paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes, which is the opposite of progressive.\n\n- Neutral: A neutral tax doesn't favor any particular group. However, since lower-income people are disproportionately affected, it's not neutral.\n\nTherefore, the only logical choice is C. Regressive.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
