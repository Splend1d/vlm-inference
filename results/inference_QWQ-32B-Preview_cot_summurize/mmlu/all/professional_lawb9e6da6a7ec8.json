That same day, he telephoned an auto supply company and ordered the necessary materials to perform the repair work. Two days later, the mechanic met the man at a party and this conversation took place:The man: \"Disregard the letter I sent you last week. \"The mechanic: \"No way, man, I already ordered the materials on from the auto supply company. \"The man: \"Sorry, but I sold my car yesterday, so forget the repair work. \"If the mechanic initiates suit for breach of contract, which of the following is the man's strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the parties?\n\nA.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which argument is the strongest for the man to claim that no enforceable contract was formed between him and the mechanic. Let's look at each option step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"The mechanic had not completed performance before the man revoked his offer.\" Okay, so the man revoked his offer before the mechanic finished the work. But in contract law, revocation has to happen before acceptance. Here, the mechanic might have already accepted the offer by starting the work, even if he hasn't completed it yet. So, maybe this isn't the strongest argument.\n\nOption B: \"The man's offer could only be accepted by a return promise.\" Hmm, let's see. The man offered to pay $275 for specific services: changing the oil, replacing the oil filter, and adjusting the carburetors by February 10. The mechanic's acceptance would typically be by performing the services and then asking for payment. So, it seems like acceptance is by performance, not just by a return promise. Therefore, this might not be the best argument.\n\nOption C: \"Because the man made his offer by letter, the mechanic could accept only in the same manner.\" I think this is about the mirror image rule and the mode of acceptance. Generally, the acceptance should match the offer in terms of communication, but there are exceptions and nuances. However, in modern contract law, the acceptance can be communicated in a reasonable manner, unless specified otherwise. So, this might not be the strongest argument.\n\nOption D: \"Although the mechanic was preparing to perform the repair work, he had not begun the requested acts of acceptance when the man revoked his offer.\" This seems promising. If the mechanic hadn't started the actual work yet when the man revoked the offer, then the revocation might be effective. In contract law, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance, as long as the revocation is communicated to the offeree.\n\nLet's think about the timeline:\n\n- February 1: Man sends the letter.\n\n- February 3: Mechanic receives the letter and orders materials.\n\n- February 5: Man meets mechanic at a party and says to disregard the letter.\n\nSo, between February 3 and 5, the mechanic ordered materials but didn't start the actual repair work. If acceptance is by performance, then starting the work would be the acceptance. If the man revoked the offer before the mechanic started the work, then perhaps the revocation is valid, and no contract was formed.\n\nBut, the mechanic did order materials in preparation for the work, which might show intent to accept, but perhaps that's not enough.\n\nComparing all options, option D seems to directly address whether acceptance had occurred before revocation. If the mechanic hadn't begun the acts of acceptance (i.e., starting the repair work) when the man revoked the offer, then the revocation might be effective, rendering the contract unenforceable.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the man's strongest argument that no enforceable contract was formed between the parties.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
