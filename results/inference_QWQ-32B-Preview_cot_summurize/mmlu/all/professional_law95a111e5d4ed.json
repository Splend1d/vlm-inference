                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this uncle who owns a property in fee simple, which means he has complete ownership with no limitations. He executes a deed giving the property to his nephew and niece for the life of his nephew, and then to his gardener. I need to figure out what kind of ownership rights each person has based on this granting clause.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the terms being used here. A life estate is an interest in property that lasts for the life of a specified person. So, \"for the life of my nephew\" suggests that the nephew has a life estate in the property.\n\nNow, it says \"to my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew.\" So, both the nephew and the niece are getting an interest in the property during the nephew's lifetime. But what kind of co-ownership is this? Are they joint tenants or tenants in common?\n\nJoint tenants have equal shares and the right of survivorship, meaning that when one dies, the other automatically gets the full interest. Tenants in common, on the other hand, can have unequal shares and can leave their share to someone else upon death.\n\nIn this case, since it's for the life of the nephew, and the interest goes to the gardener after that, I need to think about how the interests are held during the nephew's life.\n\nAlso, there's the gardener, who gets the property after the nephew's life ends. So, what is the gardener's interest called? Is it a remainder or an executory interest?\n\nA remainder is an interest that follows a life estate. It can be vested, meaning it's definite and certain to become possessory when the life estate ends, or it can be contingent, meaning it depends on some future event.\n\nAn executory interest is a future interest that cuts short or terminates an earlier interest.\n\nGiven that the property goes to the gardener after the nephew's life, it seems like the gardener has a remainder interest.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The nephew and niece are joint tenants in fee simple defeasible, and the gardener has an executory interest.\n\nWait, fee simple defeasible means ownership that can be terminated upon the occurrence of a specified event. But in this case, the nephew and niece have an interest for the life of the nephew, which is a life estate, not fee simple. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nB. The nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder.\n\nLife estate pur autre vie is a life estate that lasts for the life of another person. So, if the niece's interest is for the life of the nephew, that makes sense. And the gardener has a vested remainder, meaning that upon the nephew's death, the gardener definitely gets the property.\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nC. The nephew and niece are tenants in common for the life of the first to die, the nephew and niece have contingent remainders in fee simple defeasible, and the gardener has an executory interest.\n\nThis is confusing. Tenants in common for the life of the first to die would mean their interests are measured by the life of the first to die, but the granting clause specifies \"for the life of my nephew.\" So, it's specifically the nephew's life, not the first to die.\n\nAlso, contingent remainders are uncertain because they depend on some future event, but in this case, the gardener's interest seems pretty certain once the nephew dies.\n\nD. The nephew has a life estate, the niece also has a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder.\n\nThis is similar to option B, but it doesn't specify that the niece's life estate is pur autre vie.\n\nWait, in option B, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, meaning her interest lasts for the life of the nephew, just like the nephew's.\n\nBut in option D, it just says the niece also has a life estate, which could be for her own life or for the nephew's life.\n\nGiven the granting clause, \"to my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew,\" it seems that both have an interest measured by the nephew's life.\n\nSo, in that case, option B might be more accurate.\n\nBut let's think about the co-ownership between the nephew and the niece.\n\nAre they joint tenants or tenants in common?\n\nIn many jurisdictions, when property is granted to two or more people for lives measured by one of them, they are considered joint tenants.\n\nHowever, I need to confirm that.\n\nAlso, option B says the nephew has a life estate, and the niece has a life estate pur autre vie.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWell, if it's granted to both for the life of the nephew, then the niece's interest is also dependent on the nephew's life, so it's pur autre vie.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAnd then the gardener has a vested remainder, which seems right.\n\nOption D says the niece also has a life estate, but doesn't specify pur autre vie, which might be less precise.\n\nSo, between B and D, B seems better.\n\nBut let's look at option C again.\n\nIt says the nephew and niece are tenants in common for the life of the first to die, which doesn't align with the granting clause, as the interest is for the life of the nephew, not the first to die.\n\nSo, option C seems incorrect.\n\nOption A is also incorrect because the nephew and niece don't have fee simple defeasible; they have life estates.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is option B: the nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
