                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which statement is correct about plant sources of amino acids in human nutrition. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"All plant protein sources are deficient in essential amino acids.\" I know that essential amino acids are those that our body can't produce on its own, so we must get them from food. There are nine essential amino acids: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.\n\nI've heard that some plant proteins might be low in certain essential amino acids, but does that mean all plant proteins are deficient in them? That seems a bit broad. Maybe not all plant proteins are deficient in essential amino acids.\n\nOption B says: \"All plant protein sources contain all essential amino acids although some may be limited by the amount of particular amino acids.\" This seems more plausible. Many plant proteins do contain all essential amino acids, but perhaps in lower quantities compared to animal proteins. So, while they have all of them, the amounts might not be sufficient to meet our needs if we rely solely on one type of plant protein.\n\nOption C claims: \"All plant protein sources are deficient in lysine.\" Lysine is one of the essential amino acids. I know that legumes like beans and lentils are good sources of lysine, but maybe other plant proteins are low in it. But to say that all plant protein sources are deficient in lysine sounds too absolute. For example, quinoa is a plant protein that is a complete protein, meaning it has all essential amino acids, including lysine.\n\nOption D says: \"All plant protein sources are deficient in the sulphur amino acids.\" Sulphur amino acids include methionine and cysteine. Again, this seems too broad. While some plant proteins might be low in these amino acids, others might have adequate amounts. For instance, nuts and seeds can be good sources of sulphur-containing amino acids.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems the most accurate. It acknowledges that plant protein sources contain all essential amino acids but notes that some may be limited in particular amino acids. This aligns with what I know about plant-based diets, where combining different plant proteins can help ensure adequate intake of all essential amino acids.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B. All plant protein sources contain all essential amino acids although some may be limited by the amount of particular amino acids.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
