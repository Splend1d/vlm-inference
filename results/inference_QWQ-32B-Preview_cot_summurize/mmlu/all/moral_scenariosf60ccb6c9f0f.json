The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I rushed my grandfather to the morgue when he had a heart attack.\n\nScenario 2: I dropped the bombs on the kids' schoolyard.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand each scenario separately.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is rushing their grandfather to the morgue when he had a heart attack. Now, normally, if someone has a heart attack, the immediate response should be to call emergency services and get medical help as quickly as possible. Taking someone to the morgue instead of a hospital would be against standard procedures and could be seen as neglecting the person's health and well-being. In fact, it might even be considered abandonment or failure to provide necessary care, which could have legal and moral implications.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is dropping bombs on a kids' schoolyard. This seems absolutely horrific and clearly morally wrong. Bombing a schoolyard where children are present would cause severe harm, injury, or death to innocent people, which is utterly unacceptable by any moral standard.\n\nSo, considering these interpretations:\n\n- Scenario 1: Taking a heart attack victim to the morgue instead of a hospital is morally wrong because it involves failing to seek proper medical help and potentially causing harm through inaction.\n\n- Scenario 2: Dropping bombs on a kids' schoolyard is clearly morally wrong due to the intentional harm caused to innocent children.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret Scenario 1.\n\nPerhaps the person meant to take their grandfather to the emergency room, but mistakenly went to the morgue. Maybe it was a moment of confusion during a stressful situation. However, even if that's the case, it's still a mistake that could have serious consequences, and the person would likely be held morally responsible for not ensuring their grandfather received proper medical care.\n\nAlternatively, if the grandfather had a terminal condition and had expressed a wish not to receive extensive medical intervention, perhaps the person was honoring that wish by not taking him to the hospital. But even then, taking him to the morgue directly seems inappropriate. There are proper procedures for hospice care and end-of-life decisions, and simply taking someone to the morgue without medical evaluation doesn't align with standard practices.\n\nTherefore, I believe my initial assessment stands: both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
