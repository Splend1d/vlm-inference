In this case, matrix A has 7 columns and matrix B has 7 rows, so multiplication is possible.\n\nThe dimensions of the resulting product matrix AB are determined by the number of rows from the first matrix A and the number of columns from the second matrix B.\n\n- Matrix A has 2 rows.\n- Matrix B has 5 columns.\n\nTherefore, the product matrix AB will have dimensions 2 \u00d7 5.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 2 \u00d7 5.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Check compatibility for multiplication:**\n   - Matrix A: 2 \u00d7 7\n   - Matrix B: 7 \u00d7 5\n   - The number of columns in A (7) matches the number of rows in B (7), so multiplication is possible.\n\n2. **Determine the dimensions of the product matrix AB:**\n   - The number of rows in AB comes from matrix A: 2 rows.\n   - The number of columns in AB comes from matrix B: 5 columns.\n   - Therefore, AB has dimensions 2 \u00d7 5.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The correct choice is B. 2 \u00d7 5.\n\n**Additional note:**\n\n- Option A (2 \u00d7 2) would be incorrect because it doesn't match the rule of rows from A and columns from B.\n- Option C (5 \u00d7 2) reverses the dimensions, which is not correct.\n- Option D (7 \u00d7 7) doesn't align with the multiplication rules for the given matrices.\n\nThus, the only correct answer is B. 2 \u00d7 5."
