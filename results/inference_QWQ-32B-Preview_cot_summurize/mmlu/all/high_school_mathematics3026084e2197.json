This means that the prime factors of \\( n \\) can only be 2 and/or 5.\n\nSecond, \\( n \\) must contain the digit 9.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 32\n\nB. 64\n\nC. 4096\n\nD. 256\n\nWe need to check each option to see if it meets both conditions.\n\nLet's start with option A: 32\n\n- Check if 32 is of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\):\n\n\\( 32 = 2^5 \\times 5^0 \\), which satisfies the condition for \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) to be a terminating decimal.\n\n- Check if 32 contains the digit 9:\n\n32 does not contain the digit 9.\n\nTherefore, option A does not satisfy both conditions.\n\nNext, option B: 64\n\n- Check if 64 is of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\):\n\n\\( 64 = 2^6 \\times 5^0 \\), which satisfies the condition for \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) to be a terminating decimal.\n\n- Check if 64 contains the digit 9:\n\n64 does not contain the digit 9.\n\nTherefore, option B does not satisfy both conditions.\n\nNow, option C: 4096\n\n- Check if 4096 is of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\):\n\n\\( 4096 = 2^{12} \\times 5^0 \\), which satisfies the condition for \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) to be a terminating decimal.\n\n- Check if 4096 contains the digit 9:\n\n4096 contains the digit 9.\n\nTherefore, option C satisfies both conditions.\n\nFinally, option D: 256\n\n- Check if 256 is of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\):\n\n\\( 256 = 2^8 \\times 5^0 \\), which satisfies the condition for \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) to be a terminating decimal.\n\n- Check if 256 contains the digit 9:\n\n256 does not contain the digit 9.\n\nTherefore, option D does not satisfy both conditions.\n\nBetween options C and D, only option C satisfies both conditions. However, we need to ensure that there isn't a smaller positive integer than 4096 that satisfies both conditions.\n\nLet's consider smaller numbers that are powers of 2 or 5 and contain the digit 9.\n\nStart with smaller powers of 2:\n\n- \\( 2^1 = 2 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 2^4 = 16 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 2^6 = 64 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 2^7 = 128 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 2^8 = 256 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 2^9 = 512 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 2^{10} = 1024 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 2^{11} = 2048 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\) \u2192 contains 9\n\nNext, consider powers of 5:\n\n- \\( 5^1 = 5 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 5^2 = 25 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 5^3 = 125 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 5^4 = 625 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 5^5 = 3125 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 5^6 = 15625 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 5^7 = 78125 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n- \\( 5^8 = 390625 \\) \u2192 contains 9\n\nSo, \\( 5^8 = 390625 \\) contains the digit 9, and it is smaller than 4096.\n\nWait, but 390625 is larger than 4096. Wait, no, 390625 is larger than 4096.\n\nWait, 4096 is \\( 2^{12} \\), which is 4096, and \\( 5^8 = 390625 \\), which is much larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider products of powers of 2 and 5, not just pure powers of 2 or 5.\n\nBut in this case, since \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\), and we are looking for the smallest such \\( n \\) that contains the digit 9.\n\nGiven that \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\) is the smallest power of 2 that contains the digit 9, and \\( 5^8 = 390625 \\) is larger, and considering products like \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\), but that would generally make the number larger.\n\nWait, perhaps there are smaller numbers that are products of 2 and 5 that contain the digit 9.\n\nLet's check some smaller products:\n\nFor example, \\( 2^3 \\times 5^2 = 8 \\times 25 = 200 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n\\( 2^4 \\times 5^3 = 16 \\times 125 = 2000 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n\\( 2^5 \\times 5^4 = 32 \\times 625 = 20000 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n\\( 2^6 \\times 5^5 = 64 \\times 3125 = 200000 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\nThese are getting larger, and none contain the digit 9.\n\nAlternatively, consider smaller exponents:\n\n\\( 2^1 \\times 5^1 = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n\\( 2^2 \\times 5^1 = 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n\\( 2^1 \\times 5^2 = 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n\\( 2^2 \\times 5^2 = 4 \\times 25 = 100 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n\\( 2^3 \\times 5^1 = 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\n\\( 2^1 \\times 5^3 = 2 \\times 125 = 250 \\) \u2192 does not contain 9\n\nNone of these contain the digit 9.\n\nTherefore, the smallest \\( n \\) of the form \\( 2^a \\times 5^b \\) that contains the digit 9 is \\( 2^{12} = 4096 \\).\n\nHence, the answer is C. 4096.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4096} \\]"
