This is the initial stage where information from the environment is briefly held and processed before it is either discarded or transferred to short-term memory. Sensory memory has a very limited capacity and a short duration, typically lasting only a fraction of a second to a few seconds.\n\nTo provide more context, the three-box model, also known as the multi-store model of memory proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin, consists of three main components:\n\n1. **Sensory Memory**: This is the first stage where information from the environment is briefly held. It includes different types of sensory stores such as iconic memory for visual information and echoic memory for auditory information. Sensory memory has a large capacity but information decays rapidly unless it is attended to and passed on to the next stage.\n\n2. **Short-Term Memory (STM)**: Information that is attended to in sensory memory is transferred to short-term memory. STM has a limited capacity, generally holding about 7\u00b12 items, and also has a limited duration, with information lasting only about 20-30 seconds unless rehearsed. Rehearsal can help maintain information in STM and potentially transfer it to long-term memory.\n\n3. **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**: Through processes such as elaborative rehearsal and organization, information from STM can be transferred to LTM. LTM has an effectively unlimited capacity and can store information for extended periods, from hours to years.\n\nSo, in this model, the sequence is sensory memory \u2192 short-term memory \u2192 long-term memory.\n\nNow, to address the other options:\n\n- **A. Short-term memory**: This is the second stage in the model, where information from sensory memory is held temporarily if it is attended to.\n\n- **B. Eidetic memory**: This is a type of sensory memory that allows some individuals, particularly children, to recall images, sounds, or objects in vivid detail after only a few seconds of exposure. However, it is not a stage in the three-box model but rather a specific type of sensory memory.\n\n- **C. Semantic memory**: This is a component of long-term memory that involves factual knowledge and general knowledge about the world. It is not part of the initial stages in the three-box model.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. sensory memory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
