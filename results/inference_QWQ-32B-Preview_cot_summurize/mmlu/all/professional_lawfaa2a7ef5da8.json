                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex with multiple parties and dates involved, so I need to make sure I understand the chain of events and the legal principles at play.\n\nFirst, there's a widower who owned a piece of property alone. He died on March 1, 1999, and devised the property to both his co-worker and his boss \"as their community property.\" The co-worker and the boss are siblings and neither is married.\n\nSo, the widower left the property to his co-worker and boss as community property. Now, community property is a form of joint ownership typically associated with married couples, where each owner has an equal, undivided interest in the entire property. However, in this case, it's being left to two siblings who are not married. I need to think about whether community property can be devised to non-spouses.\n\nMoving on, the boss died intestate on May 1, 2001, leaving her daughter as her sole heir. The daughter moved into the house the next day, May 2, 2001.\n\nNow, the daughter, as administratrix of her mother's estate, wants to collect half of the insurance and property taxes that her mother paid from the co-worker. The co-worker, on the other hand, claims he's not liable for any expenses and that the daughter has no interest in the property. His attorney even says he owns the entire property now and that the daughter owes him rent for occupying the premises.\n\nThere's an action to determine the title of the property, and the question is: what interest, if any, does the daughter have in the property?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole property by right of survivorship.\n\nB. An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant-in-common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs.\n\nC. An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.\n\nD. An undivided whole interest, because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part and parcel of the unit group that owns the whole.\n\nAlright, let's analyze this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the type of co-ownership that exists between the co-worker and the boss when they received the property from the widower.\n\nThe widower devised the property to them \"as their community property.\" Community property is a form of ownership where each owner has an equal, undivided interest in the whole property, and it's typically associated with married couples. However, in some jurisdictions, community property can be created between non-spouses by express agreement or by the terms of a deed or will.\n\nSo, in this case, since the widower specified that the property should be theirs as community property, it's possible that they hold the property as community property owners, even though they're not married.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of community property ownership.\n\nIn community property, each owner has a right of survivorship, meaning that when one owner dies, their interest passes to the surviving owner(s). However, I need to confirm if this right of survivorship applies when community property is held by non-spouses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the devise created a different form of co-ownership, such as joint tenancy or tenancy in common.\n\nJoint tenancy also includes the right of survivorship, where upon the death of one joint tenant, their interest automatically passes to the surviving joint tenants.\n\nTenancy in common, on the other hand, does not have a right of survivorship. Each tenant in common can leave their interest to whomever they choose upon their death.\n\nGiven that the widower specified \"community property,\" but the recipients are not spouses, perhaps the law won't recognize it as community property and instead treats it as tenancy in common or joint tenancy.\n\nI need to look into the law to see how a non-spousal community property arrangement is treated.\n\nAssuming that the law doesn't recognize community property between non-spouses, the devise might be interpreted as creating a joint tenancy or tenancy in common.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the law in the jurisdiction where this property is located does allow non-spouses to hold property as community property. I don't know that, so I'll have to proceed with the assumption that it's not recognized.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the devise is ineffective to create community property, and instead, they hold the property as joint tenants or tenants in common.\n\nI need to determine which one applies.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, when property is devised to multiple recipients without specifying the type of co-ownership, it's presumed to be joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n\nHowever, in other jurisdictions, it's presumed to be tenancy in common without right of survivorship.\n\nI need to consider which presumption applies here.\n\nIf it's joint tenancy, then upon the death of one joint tenant, their interest passes to the surviving joint tenant(s) by right of survivorship.\n\nIf it's tenancy in common, then upon the death of one tenant, their interest passes to their heirs as per their will or intestacy laws.\n\nGiven that, if it's joint tenancy, then when the boss died, her interest in the property passed to the co-worker by right of survivorship, and the daughter would have no interest in the property.\n\nIf it's tenancy in common, then when the boss died intestate, her interest would pass to her heirs, which is her daughter, and the daughter would own half of the property.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA says the daughter has no interest because the co-worker acquired the whole property by right of survivorship. That would be the case if they held the property as joint tenants.\n\nOption B says the daughter has an undivided one-half interest because upon the death intestate of a tenant in common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs. That would be the case if they held the property as tenants in common.\n\nOption C mentions tenancy by the entirety, but tenancy by the entirety is a form of co-ownership specifically for married couples, so that doesn't apply here since the co-worker and the boss are not married.\n\nOption D says the daughter has an undivided whole interest because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant owns the whole property. But that's not accurate because in joint tenancy, each joint tenant owns the whole property together, but upon death, only the right of survivorship applies.\n\nSo, option D seems incorrect.\n\nBetween options A and B, I need to determine whether they held the property as joint tenants or tenants in common.\n\nGiven that the widower specified \"as their community property,\" but they are not spouses, perhaps the law doesn't recognize it as community property and instead defaults to the default rule for co-ownership in that jurisdiction.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the default is tenancy in common unless there's a specific intent to create joint tenancy.\n\nHowever, in some places, particularly in conveyancing, when property is conveyed to multiple grantees, it's presumed to be joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n\nI need to consider which presumption applies.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps the term \"community property\" in the devise is sufficient to imply an intent to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the law doesn't allow non-spouses to hold property as community property, so the devise is ineffective in that regard.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the property is held as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's held as tenants in common.\n\nThis is a bit tricky.\n\nLet me consider the attorney's advice to the co-worker. The attorney said that the co-worker acquired the entire property by right of survivorship and that the daughter owes him rent, suggesting that the co-worker now owns the entire property alone.\n\nHowever, is that correct?\n\nIf they held the property as joint tenants, then yes, the co-worker would own the entire property upon the boss's death.\n\nBut if they held it as tenants in common, then the boss's interest would pass to her daughter, and the daughter would own half the property, with the co-worker owning the other half.\n\nNow, regarding the daughter's claim for half the insurance and property taxes paid by the boss during her occupancy.\n\nIf the daughter owns half the property, then she would be responsible for half the expenses, so the co-worker wouldn't owe her anything.\n\nAlternatively, if the co-worker owns the entire property by right of survivorship, then the daughter as a tenant might owe rent.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nI need to focus on determining the type of co-ownership.\n\nLet me look at the answer options again.\n\nOption A: None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole property by right of survivorship.\n\nOption B: An undivided one-half interest, because upon the death intestate of a tenant in common, the latter's interest descends to his heirs.\n\nOption C: An undivided one-half interest, because in a tenancy by the entirety, either sibling can make a testamentary disposition.\n\nOption D: An undivided whole interest, because in a joint tenancy, every joint tenant is part and parcel of the unit group that owns the whole.\n\nFirst, option C can be eliminated because tenancy by the entirety is only for married couples.\n\nOption D is incorrect because in joint tenancy, each joint tenant has an undivided interest in the whole property, but upon death, the right of survivorship applies, so the surviving joint tenant(s) acquire the deceased's interest.\n\nSo, option D is not accurate.\n\nBetween options A and B, I need to decide whether they held the property as joint tenants or tenants in common.\n\nGiven that the widower specified \"as their community property,\" but they are not spouses, perhaps the law doesn't recognize it as community property and instead treats it as joint tenancy or tenancy in common.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, when property is devised to multiple grantees without specifying the type of co-ownership, it's presumed to be joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n\nIf that's the case here, then option A would be correct: the daughter has no interest in the property because the co-worker acquired the entire property by right of survivorship upon the boss's death.\n\nHowever, if the law in this jurisdiction requires that community property can only be held by spouses, and thus the devise as community property is ineffective, and instead, they hold as tenants in common, then option B would be correct: the daughter inherits her mother's one-half interest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the law allows non-spouses to hold property as community property, in which case, similar to joint tenancy, there would be a right of survivorship, leading to option A.\n\nBut I don't know the specific law in this jurisdiction.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider general principles.\n\nAssuming that community property can only be held by spouses, and they are not spouses, then the devise as community property might be ineffective, and they hold as joint tenants or tenants in common.\n\nIf they hold as joint tenants, then option A is correct.\n\nIf they hold as tenants in common, then option B is correct.\n\nI need to determine which is more likely.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, when property is devised to multiple grantees without specifying the type of co-ownership, it's presumed to be joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n\nIf that's the case here, then option A is correct.\n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, it's presumed to be tenancy in common without right of survivorship.\n\nI need to know the default rule in this jurisdiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the specific language \"as their community property\" is sufficient to imply an intent to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the law will construe it as tenants in common.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to consider the attorney's advice to the co-worker.\n\nThe attorney said that the co-worker acquired the entire property by right of survivorship and that the daughter owes him rent.\n\nIf the attorney is correct, then option A is right.\n\nBut is the attorney correct?\n\nWell, that depends on the type of co-ownership.\n\nIf they held as joint tenants, then yes, the co-worker owns the entire property upon the boss's death, and the daughter would be a tenant and owe rent.\n\nIf they held as tenants in common, then the daughter inherits her mother's half-interest, and she owns half the property, so she doesn't owe rent; she's an owner.\n\nGiven that, I need to determine the type of co-ownership.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to interpret the devise to create community property between non-spouses.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, non-spouses can hold property as community property if they expressly agree to it.\n\nHere, the widower specified \"as their community property,\" so perhaps that's sufficient to create community property between them, even as non-spouses.\n\nIf that's the case, then there would be a right of survivorship, and the co-worker would own the entire property upon the boss's death, making option A correct.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if non-spouses can hold property as community property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the law doesn't allow it, and thus they hold as joint tenants or tenants in common.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the attorney advised the co-worker that he owns the entire property by right of survivorship, perhaps in this jurisdiction, the default is joint tenancy with right of survivorship.\n\nTherefore, option A is correct: the daughter has no interest in the property because the co-worker acquired the entire property by right of survivorship.\n\nAlternatively, if they held as tenants in common, then option B would be correct.\n\nGiven the attorney's advice and the presumptions in many jurisdictions, I'm leaning towards option A.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the title.\n\nFor example, did the boss have any rights to dispose of her interest during her lifetime?\n\nIf they held as joint tenants, typically, neither party can dispose of their interest without the consent of the other joint tenants.\n\nBut since the boss died intestate, her interest would pass to her heirs by intestacy laws if there's no right of survivorship.\n\nWait, in joint tenancy, the right of survivorship overrides intestacy laws because the interest automatically passes to the surviving joint tenants.\n\nIn tenancy in common, the interest passes per the deceased's will or intestacy laws.\n\nGiven that, if they held as joint tenants, the co-worker would own the entire property upon the boss's death, and the daughter would have no interest.\n\nIf they held as tenants in common, the daughter would inherit her mother's half-interest.\n\nGiven that, and considering the attorney's advice, I think option A is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. None, because the co-worker acquired title to the whole property by right of survivorship.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
