                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here involving adverse possession, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a man who owns a piece of land with a run-down log cabin. He loses interest in it, doesn't maintain it, and lets tax bills pile up. In 1990, a homeless couple moves into the cabin and starts restoring it, fencing the perimeter, and maintaining the grounds. They even start paying the taxes, knowing there's an absentee owner.\n\nThen, in 2000, the owner shows up and demands rent. The couple agrees and pays rent for two years, but then they stop after consulting an attorney. The statutory period for adverse possession in the state is 20 years. In 2011, the owner files an ejectment action to assert his ownership rights.\n\nThe question is, can the couple prevail on a theory of adverse possession?\n\nOption A says yes, because they were on the land for over 20 years. Option B says no, because they missed some tax payments during that 20-year period. Option C says no, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent. Option D says yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.\n\nAlright, so adverse possession generally requires that the possessor's occupation of the land is:\n\n1. Actual: They physically occupy the property.\n\n2. Open and notorious: Their possession is visible and not secretive.\n\n3. Hostile: Without the owner's permission.\n\n4. Exclusive: They treat the property as their own.\n\n5. Continuous for the statutory period: In this case, 20 years.\n\nNow, let's look at the couple's actions.\n\nThey moved in in 1990 and started restoring the cabin, fencing, and maintaining the grounds. They paid taxes, which suggests they were treating the property as their own. This seems to meet the actual, open, hostile, and exclusive possession requirements.\n\nThe statutory period is 20 years, and from 1990 to 2010 would be 20 years. The owner filed the ejectment action in 2011, so technically, they had possessed the property for over 20 years.\n\nHowever, there's a complication: in 2000, the owner demanded rent, and the couple paid rent for two years before stopping.\n\nThis payment of rent could be seen as recognizing the owner's title, which might defeat the hostile element of adverse possession. Adverse possession requires that the possession be hostile, meaning without the owner's permission.\n\nIf the couple paid rent, that suggests they were accepting the owner's title and paying for the use of the land, which is not hostile possession.\n\nSo, did this payment of rent for two years break the continuity of their adverse possession?\n\nIn adverse possession, continuity is key. If the possession is interrupted, the clock resets.\n\nPaying rent might be considered an interruption of the adverse possession because it acknowledges the owner's title.\n\nTherefore, even though they had possessed the property for over 20 years, the payment of rent for two years might reset the statutory period.\n\nAfter stopping payment in 2002, they would have to accumulate another 20 years of adverse possession to qualify.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011 is only about 9 years, which is far short of the 20-year requirement.\n\nTherefore, option C seems correct: no, because the hostile possession was interrupted for two years when they paid rent.\n\nNow, option B says no, because they missed some tax payments during that 20-year period.\n\nBut in the scenario, it says they started paying the taxes in 1990 and continued to pay them until they stopped after consulting an attorney. It doesn't specify if they missed any tax payments during the 20 years, so I don't think this is the issue.\n\nOption D says yes, because they owned the property due to paying the taxes on it.\n\nBut paying taxes doesn't convey ownership. Tax payments might give them some rights, but ownership isn't transferred just by paying taxes.\n\nSo, based on the analysis, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
