                    "text": "I think the answer is A. Plessy v. Ferguson. I remember learning about this case in history class. It was about a man named Homer Plessy who was part African American and part white, and he tried to sit in a train car that was for whites only. He was arrested, and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided that as long as the facilities for different races were equal, it was okay for them to be separate. That's where the phrase \"separate but equal\" comes from. So, in this case, even though the train cars for blacks and whites might look the same, they were still separated by race.\n\nOption B, McCulloch v. Maryland, is about the powers of the federal government versus the states. The Court decided that the federal government had certain implied powers beyond what was explicitly written in the Constitution, and that states couldn't interfere with federal institutions, like taxing a federal bank.\n\nOption C, Gibbons v. Ogden, is about interstate commerce. The Court ruled that Congress has the authority to regulate commerce between states, and that this power is supreme over state laws that might conflict with federal regulations.\n\nOption D, Brown v. Board of Education, is actually the case that overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson. In Brown v. Board, the Supreme Court decided that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, stating that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\n\nSo, to sum it up, Plessy v. Ferguson established \"separate but equal,\" and Brown v. Board of Education said that separation isn't equal, especially in schools.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
