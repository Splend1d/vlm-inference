However, since the student did not have a car, he rode the bus to and from the college each day. The student soon discovered that he was spending up to two hours each day to make the round trip to and from college on the bus, whereas the trip could be made in half that time if he had a car. He decided to buy a car and asked his father to accompany him as he looked for a car to purchase. After visiting a number of car lots, the son finally found a used car to his liking. However, the son only had $2,500 in his bank account, and the price of the car was $10,000. Since the son had not built up a credit history, the car lot was reluctant to sell the car to the son. The father then told the finance manager of the car lot, \"If you will sell the car to my son and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due. \" The finance manager then approved the deal, which required the son to pay $2,500 down and monthly payments of $500 for 15 months. Six months later, the son defaulted on the payment plan, and the car lot sought recovery from the father without first suing the son.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, we have a high school graduate who's now in college, but he's facing a commute issue. He's spending up to two hours a day on the bus, which is twice as long as it would take if he had a car. So, he decides to buy a car and enlists his father's help to find one.\n\nHe finds a used car for $10,000, but he only has $2,500 in savings. Since he hasn't established credit yet, the car dealership is hesitant to sell him the car on finance. His father steps in and makes a promise to the finance manager: \"If you sell the car to my son, and for any reason he defaults on the payments, I will pay the balance due.\"\n\nBased on this promise, the finance manager agrees to the sale, with terms of $2,500 down and $500 monthly payments for 15 months. Six months in, the son stops making payments, and the car lot goes straight to the father to recover the remaining balance without first suing the son.\n\nNow, the question is: With regard to the father's obligation under his promise to the finance manager, how would the court likely rule?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Relieve the father of liability because the car lot failed to first sue the son.\n\nB. Relieve the father of liability because the father was never under a duty as a surety.\n\nC. Not relieve the father of liability because of the main purpose exception.\n\nD. Not relieve the father of liability because parents are responsible for the debts of their children.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the legal concepts here, particularly regarding suretyship and the obligations of a surety.\n\nA surety is someone who promises to pay the debt or perform the obligation of another person if that person defaults. In this case, the father is acting as a surety for his son's car loan.\n\nOne of the key principles in suretyship is that the surety has the right to be indemnified by the principal debtor (in this case, the son). Additionally, the surety usually has the right of subrogation, which means that if the surety pays the debt, they step into the shoes of the creditor and can pursue the principal debtor for reimbursement.\n\nAnother important concept is that the surety is generally entitled to demand that the creditor first sue the principal debtor before coming after the surety. This is to ensure that the surety isn't prematurely forced to pay when the principal might still have the ability to fulfill the obligation.\n\nGiven that, option A seems plausible: relieve the father of liability because the car lot failed to first sue the son. This aligns with the principle that the surety should not be pursued until the principal debtor has been sued and unable to pay.\n\nOption B suggests relieving the father of liability because he was never under a duty as a surety. However, from the scenario, it's clear that the father did make a promise to cover the balance if the son defaulted. This sounds like a suretyship agreement, so this option seems less likely.\n\nOption C mentions not relieving the father of liability because of the main purpose exception. The main purpose exception in suretyship law provides that if the surety's primary purpose in entering into the agreement was for their own benefit, then certain suretyship protections may not apply. In this case, the father was guaranteeing the son's loan primarily for the son's benefit, not his own, so this exception might not apply. Therefore, this option seems less likely.\n\nOption D suggests not relieving the father of liability because parents are responsible for the debts of their children. While parents may sometimes be responsible for their children's debts, especially for necessary expenses, this is not a universal rule and can vary by jurisdiction. In this case, the father voluntarily undertook the obligation, so this option might not be the primary consideration.\n\nConsidering these points, option A seems to be the most appropriate. The father, as a surety, likely has the right to require that the creditor first sue the principal debtor (the son) before coming after him. Since the car lot didn't follow this procedure, the court might relieve the father of liability.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that legal outcomes can depend on specific jurisdictional laws and the exact terms of the agreement. The principles I've outlined are general common law principles, but local laws might have variations.\n\nIn conclusion, based on standard suretyship principles, the court would most likely relieve the father of liability because the car lot failed to first sue the son.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
