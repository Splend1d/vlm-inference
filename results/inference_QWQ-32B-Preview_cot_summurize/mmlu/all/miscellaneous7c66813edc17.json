                    "text": "I'm trying to remember where the Harlem Globetrotters were formed. I know they're famous for their basketball skills and entertaining performances. Let's see, the options are Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York City.\n\nFirst, I think about the name \"Harlem Globetrotters.\" Harlem is a neighborhood in New York City, so that might suggest they were formed in New York City. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nLet me think back to what I've learned about sports history. I recall that the team has a long history, dating back to the early 20th century. Maybe I should consider where professional basketball was popular at that time.\n\nBoston has a rich sports history, being home to the Boston Celtics, one of the original NBA teams. But I don't think the Globetrotters started there.\n\nPhiladelphia also has a strong sports presence, with teams like the 76ers. However, I don't recall any connection between Philadelphia and the Globetrotters' formation.\n\nChicago is another major sports city. I know that the NBA's Bulls are based there, but I don't remember if the Globetrotters have any connection to Chicago.\n\nNew York City, besides having Harlem, also has a prestigious sports history, with teams like the Knicks in basketball. It seems plausible that the Globetrotters could have started there.\n\nWait a minute, I think I'm confusing the location of Harlem with the formation place of the team. While Harlem is in New York City, I'm not sure if that's where they were formed.\n\nLet me try to recall more specific information. I remember that the Globetrotters are known for integrating entertainment into their basketball games, which might suggest they started in a city with a strong cultural scene.\n\nHarlem in New York City was a center for African American culture in the early 20th century, so it makes sense that the team could have been formed there.\n\nBut I have a feeling that the team might have been formed elsewhere and then moved to Harlem. Maybe that's why I'm hesitating.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the year 1926. What was happening in sports during that time? Professional basketball was still developing, and there were several leagues around.\n\nI think the answer is New York City because of the connection to Harlem. Even if the team was formed elsewhere, their association with Harlem suggests a New York City origin.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they were formed in Chicago, which was also a hub for African American culture and sports.\n\nWait, I seem to recall a story about the team being formed in Chicago and then moving to Harlem. Is that accurate?\n\nLet me consider that possibility. If they were formed in Chicago and moved to Harlem, then technically they were formed in Chicago, but are associated with Harlem.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is Chicago.\n\nBut the question is specifically about where they were formed in 1926.\n\nI need to be careful here. If I choose New York City, I might be thinking of their association with Harlem rather than their actual formation place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they were formed in Philadelphia. I don't have any particular reason to think that, though.\n\nBoston seems less likely, but I wouldn't completely rule it out.\n\nHmm, I'm getting confused now. Maybe I should look for a pattern or eliminate some options.\n\nI'll eliminate Boston first because I don't see a strong connection between the Globetrotters and Boston.\n\nBetween Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York City, I need to decide.\n\nI think Chicago is a strong candidate because of its history with African American culture and sports.\n\nAlso, the Original Chicago Globetrotters was the original name of the team, which suggests they were indeed formed in Chicago.\n\nI believe that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Chicago.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
