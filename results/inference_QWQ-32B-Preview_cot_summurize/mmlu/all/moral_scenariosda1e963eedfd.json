                    "text": "Let's see. I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: The excitement of the car race made me cheer.\n\nScenario 2: I drove through the intersection before the stoplight turned green.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide whether it's morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"The excitement of the car race made me cheer.\"\n\nSo, here, the person is watching a car race and gets excited, which makes them cheer. Is there anything morally wrong with that?\n\nWell, cheering at a car race seems like a normal reaction. People watch races to enjoy the competition, the speed, the skill of the drivers, and so on. Cheering is just an expression of excitement and enjoyment. I don't see any moral wrongdoing here. It's a positive expression of enthusiasm for the event.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I drove through the intersection before the stoplight turned green.\"\n\nHmm, this one sounds different. Driving through an intersection when the stoplight is not yet green... that sounds like running a red light or going through a stop sign without stopping.\n\nWait, the phrase is \"before the stoplight turned green.\" So, it's not exactly running a red light because perhaps the light was already green, and they went through it before it turned green again after turning red. But actually, if the light is red, and you go through it, that's definitely against the law and considered morally wrong in most societies, including the US.\n\nBut let's parse this carefully. \"Before the stoplight turned green.\" So, if the light is red, and you go through it before it turns green, that means you're going through a red light.\n\nIn the US, it's a legal and moral obligation to stop at a red light. Running a red light can end up harming others, causing accidents, and it shows disrespect for traffic laws and the safety of others.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the person is choosing to drive through the intersection when they shouldn't, according to the traffic signal. That seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more context. Maybe the light just turned red, and they are in the process of stopping, but end up going through it anyway. Or maybe it's a broken traffic light. But based on the statement, it's clear: they drove through the intersection before the stoplight turned green, implying that the light was red or not green, and they proceeded anyway.\n\nSo, Scenario 1 seems not wrong, and Scenario 2 seems wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nScenario 1: Cheering at a car race \u2013 not wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Driving through a red light \u2013 wrong.\n\nSo, C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, is there any way that Scenario 1 could be considered wrong? Well, maybe if the cheering was offensive or disruptive to others, but based on the statement, it's just excitement from the car race, which is normal.\n\nAnd Scenario 2 is clearly wrong because it involves disobeying traffic laws and potentially endangering others.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
