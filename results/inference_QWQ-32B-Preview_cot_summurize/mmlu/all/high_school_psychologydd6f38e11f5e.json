                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the option that best represents someone with anterograde amnesia. First, I should remember what anterograde amnesia is. It's when someone can't form new memories after an event or injury. So, they have trouble remembering things that happen after the amnesia started.\n\nOption A is about a six-year-old who can't remember her second birthday party. That seems like childhood amnesia, where young kids don't have good memory for early childhood events. Not anterograde amnesia.\n\nOption B is about a twenty-year-old who can't remember details of a traumatic event six months ago. That sounds more like repressed memory or maybe post-traumatic stress, but not specifically anterograde amnesia, which is about forming new memories after the event.\n\nOption C mentions a thirty-six-year-old man with hippocampus damage who can't transfer information into long-term memory. The hippocampus is crucial for forming new memories, so if it's damaged, that would prevent new memories from being stored. This sounds a lot like anterograde amnesia.\n\nOption D is about a fifteen-year-old who fell off his bike and can't remember events right before the accident. That might be retrograde amnesia, which is forgetting events before the amnesia started, but the question is about anterograde amnesia, which is about after.\n\nSo, between these options, option C seems to fit best with the definition of anterograde amnesia. The damage to the hippocampus directly affects the ability to transfer new information into long-term memory, which is the key feature of anterograde amnesia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
