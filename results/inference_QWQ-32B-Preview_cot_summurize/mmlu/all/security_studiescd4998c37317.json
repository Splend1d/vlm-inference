Non-traditional security threats encompass a broad range of issues that go beyond military and political concerns, including health, environment, and economic stability. HIV/AIDS affects not only individual health but also has significant social, economic, and political implications that can undermine the security of nations and regions. For example, it can lead to decreased workforce productivity, increased healthcare costs, and social instability, all of which are critical for a nation's overall security. While options A and C touch on aspects related to HIV/AIDS, they do not capture the comprehensive nature of why it is considered a non-traditional security issue as effectively as option B."
