                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about group theory. The question is: for which integers n between 3 and 11 is there only one group of order n, up to isomorphism? The options are:\n\nA. For no such integer n\n\nB. For 3, 5, 7, and 11 only\n\nC. For 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 only\n\nD. For 4, 6, 8, and 10 only\n\nOkay, so I need to determine for each n from 3 to 11 how many non-isomorphic groups there are of order n.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a group of order n is a set with n elements that satisfies the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility.\n\nAlso, two groups are isomorphic if there exists a bijective homomorphism between them, meaning they have the same algebraic structure.\n\nSo, the task is to find for which n in {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11} there is only one distinct group structure.\n\nI know that for prime orders, there is only one group up to isomorphism, which is the cyclic group of that order. That's because in a group of prime order p, every non-identity element has order p, making the group cyclic.\n\nSo, for n=3,5,7,11, which are all prime, there should be only one group up to isomorphism, which is the cyclic group of that order.\n\nBut wait, what about n=9? 9 is 3 squared, which is not prime. What groups of order 9 are there?\n\nI think there are two groups of order 9 up to isomorphism: the cyclic group C9 and the direct product C3 \u00d7 C3.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nActually, for n=p^2 where p is prime, there are exactly two non-isomorphic groups: the cyclic group of order p^2 and the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p.\n\nSo, for n=9=3^2, there should be two groups: C9 and C3 \u00d7 C3.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4=2^2, there should be two groups: C4 and C2 \u00d7 C2.\n\nBut wait, the question is about n from 3 to 11, so including n=4, but according to option B, it's only for primes 3,5,7,11.\n\nOption C includes n=9, suggesting there's only one group there, but I think there are two.\n\nOption D lists n=4,6,8,10, which are the composite numbers in that range.\n\nBut according to my earlier reasoning, for n=4, there are two groups: C4 and C2 \u00d7 C2.\n\nFor n=6, is there only one group? I think not. There's C6, the cyclic group, and the symmetric group S3, which is non-abelian.\n\nSo, for n=6, there are at least two groups: C6 and S3.\n\nFor n=8, which is 2^3, I believe there are five groups up to isomorphism: C8, C4 \u00d7 C2, C2 \u00d7 C2 \u00d7 C2, D4 (dihedral group), and Q8 (quaternion group).\n\nFor n=9, as previously mentioned, two groups: C9 and C3 \u00d7 C3.\n\nFor n=10, which is 2\u00d75, two groups: C10 and D5 (dihedral group).\n\nSo, only for n=3,5,7,11, which are primes, there should be only one group up to isomorphism, the cyclic group of that order.\n\nWait, but for n=9, there are two groups, so option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D says for n=4,6,8,10 only, but according to my reasoning, for these n, there is more than one group, but the question is asking for n where there's only one group.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is correct: for n=3,5,7,11 only, there's only one group up to isomorphism.\n\nBut let me double-check n=9.\n\nIs there only one group of order 9, or two?\n\nI think there are two: C9 and C3 \u00d7 C3.\n\nBut C3 \u00d7 C3 is isomorphic to C9? No, C3 \u00d7 C3 is not cyclic, while C9 is cyclic.\n\nSo, they are not isomorphic, meaning there are two distinct groups of order 9.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, there are two groups up to isomorphism.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4, there are two groups: C4 and C2 \u00d7 C2.\n\nFor n=6, at least two: C6 and S3.\n\nFor n=8, five groups.\n\nFor n=10, two groups: C10 and D5.\n\nHence, only for n=3,5,7,11, which are primes, there is only one group up to isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: for 3,5,7, and 11 only.\n\nWait, but option C includes n=9, which we've determined has two groups.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider n=12. Not in the range, but to see the pattern.\n\nFor n=12, there are several groups: C12, C6 \u00d7 C2, A4 (alternating group), D6, etc.\n\nSo, more than one group.\n\nSimilarly, for n=15=3\u00d75, there are two groups: C15 and C3 \u00d7 C5, but C3 \u00d7 C5 is isomorphic to C15 since gcd(3,5)=1.\n\nWait, no, C3 \u00d7 C5 is isomorphic to C15 because 3 and 5 are coprime.\n\nSo, for n=15, there is only one group up to isomorphism, which is C15.\n\nBut n=15 is outside the given range.\n\nSimilarly, for n=9, there are two groups: C9 and C3 \u00d7 C3, which is not isomorphic to C9.\n\nSo, in the given range, only n=3,5,7,11 have exactly one group up to isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
