                    "text": "So Decker sold his house for $500,000 and bought a new one for $600,000. He's 62 and single. He lived in the old house for 15 years. The cost basis of the old house was $200,000. I need to figure out how much gain he should recognize from the sale.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"recognize\" means in this context. In tax terms, recognizing gain means he has to report it as income and possibly pay taxes on it.\n\nDecker sold his principal residence, and he lived there for 15 years, which is more than the required period to qualify for the exclusion of gain on the sale of a main home.\n\nFor single filers, the exclusion amount is up to $250,000 of gain. So, if Decker has a gain of up to $250,000, he doesn't have to recognize it.\n\nLet me calculate the gain. Gain is selling price minus cost basis.\n\nGain = $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000.\n\nSo, his gain is $300,000.\n\nBut the exclusion is up to $250,000 for singles. So, he can exclude $250,000 of that gain.\n\nTherefore, the recognizable gain would be $300,000 - $250,000 = $50,000.\n\nWait, but he bought a new house for $600,000, which is more than the sale price of the old one. Does that affect anything?\n\nI think the exclusion is based on the time lived in the property and the amount of gain, not on what he does with the proceeds.\n\nSo, since he lived there for more than 2 years (actually 15 years), he qualifies for the exclusion.\n\nTherefore, he can exclude up to $250,000 of the $300,000 gain, meaning he has to recognize $50,000.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other condition or if I'm missing something.\n\nThe question says he purchased a new house within six months for $600,000. Is there any provision related to reinvesting the proceeds into a new home?\n\nI think the exclusion is straightforward for principal residences: if you live in it for at least 2 of the last 5 years, you can exclude up to $250,000 of gain as a single filer.\n\nSince he's single, and he lived there for 15 years, he qualifies for the full exclusion of $250,000.\n\nSo, gain is $300,000, exclude $250,000, recognize $50,000.\n\nBut let me double-check the exclusion amount. Is it still $250,000 for singles in the current tax code?\n\nI believe so, but tax laws can change, so if this is for a current exam, I should confirm.\n\nAssuming it's $250,000, then $50,000 is the recognizable gain.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. $0\n\nB. $50,000\n\nC. $175,000\n\nD. $300,000\n\nOption B seems correct.\n\nBut why is $175,000 an option? Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a provision for matching the exclusion with the amount reinvested.\n\nHe sold for $500,000 and bought for $600,000, so he reinvested all the proceeds and more.\n\nMaybe the exclusion is limited to the amount reinvested.\n\nBut I don't recall such a provision. The exclusion is based on the gain and the time lived, not on the reinvestment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exclusion is pro-rata based on the amount reinvested.\n\nWait, perhaps using the concept of deferral when buying a more expensive home.\n\nBut I think the exclusion is still applicable regardless of the new home's price.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different rule for individuals over 55.\n\nDecker is 62, which is over 55. Is there an additional exclusion for seniors?\n\nActually, in the past, there was a provision for partial exclusion for seniors, but I believe that was eliminated.\n\nI need to make sure about that.\n\nAssuming there's no additional exclusion for being over 55, then the standard exclusion is $250,000 for singles.\n\nTherefore, recognizable gain is $300,000 - $250,000 = $50,000.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different rule now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exclusion is based on the difference between the new home and the old one.\n\nBut I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exclusion is reduced based on income.\n\nBut Decker's income isn't mentioned, so probably not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exclusion is phased out at certain income levels.\n\nAgain, no income mentioned, so probably doesn't apply here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exclusion is based on the length of time lived in the home.\n\nBut he lived there for 15 years, which is more than the required 2 years.\n\nSo, I think he qualifies for the full exclusion.\n\nTherefore, recognizable gain is $50,000.\n\nBut let's consider another angle.\n\nPerhaps the cost basis needs to be adjusted for improvements made over the years.\n\nBut the question doesn't mention any improvements, so I assume the cost basis is $200,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the selling expenses reduce the selling price.\n\nBut the question says \"net amount of $500,000 after all selling expenses,\" so the selling price is already net of expenses.\n\nTherefore, gain is indeed $300,000.\n\nExclusion is $250,000, so recognizable gain is $50,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. $50,000.\n\nBut why is $175,000 an option? Maybe there's a different calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exclusion is calculated differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the exclusion is calculated based on the ratio of the selling price to the buying price.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a provision for recognizing gain only if the new home is less expensive.\n\nBut Decker bought a more expensive home, so he shouldn't have to recognize any gain.\n\nWait, maybe that's it.\n\nIf he buys a more expensive home, he can defer the gain.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nI think there might be a provision for deferring gain if you buy a more expensive home.\n\nWait, in real estate, if you sell a property and buy a more expensive one, you can defer the gain by reinvesting the proceeds into the new property.\n\nThis is similar to a 1031 exchange, but I thought 1031 exchanges don't apply to principal residences.\n\nSo perhaps that's not applicable here.\n\nWait, but the question mentions that he purchased a new house within six months.\n\nIs there a provision for deferring gain on the sale of a principal residence if you buy a new one within a certain period?\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps that's why $0 is an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he can exclude up to $250,000 and the rest is taxable, but perhaps there's a way to defer some of the gain.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up the tax code for exclusion of gain on the sale of a principal residence.\n\nGenerally, for singles, the exclusion is up to $250,000 of gain, provided you meet the ownership and use tests.\n\nOwnership and use tests are met if you owned the home and lived in it for at least 2 of the last 5 years.\n\nDecker owned and lived there for 15 years, so he meets that.\n\nTherefore, he can exclude up to $250,000 of gain.\n\nHis gain is $300,000, so he has to recognize $50,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $50,000.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to exclude more gain if he buys a more expensive home.\n\nI need to check if there are any provisions for that.\n\nAfter some research, I find that the exclusion is not dependent on the price of the new home.\n\nThe exclusion is up to $250,000 for singles, and $500,000 for married filing jointly, provided the ownership and use tests are met.\n\nTherefore, Decker can exclude up to $250,000 of his $300,000 gain, and the remaining $50,000 is recognizable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. $50,000.\n\nBut perhaps there's a twist here.\n\nWait, the question says he purchased a new house within six months for $600,000.\n\nIs there any provision related to the timing of the purchase that affects the exclusion?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nThe exclusion is based on meeting the ownership and use tests, regardless of what you do with the proceeds.\n\nTherefore, Decker can exclude up to $250,000, and the remaining $50,000 is recognizable.\n\nSo, the answer is B. $50,000.\n\nBut why is $175,000 an option?\n\nMaybe if there was a different exclusion amount, but for singles, it's $250,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if he didn't meet the use test, but he did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if he had multiple homes, but the question says it's his principal residence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if he rented part of the house, but the question doesn't mention that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if he improved the house significantly, but again, the question doesn't mention that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if he claimed depreciation on the home, but again, the question doesn't indicate that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a calculation based on the cost basis.\n\nWait, the cost basis is $200,000, and he sold it for $500,000, so gain is $300,000.\n\nExclusion is $250,000, so $50,000 recognizable gain.\n\nBut perhaps the cost basis is incorrect.\n\nWait, the cost basis is given as $200,000, so that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other expenses that should be considered in the cost basis, but the question says \"after all selling expenses,\" so I think the net amount is $500,000.\n\nTherefore, gain is $300,000.\n\nExclusion is $250,000, so $50,000 recognizable gain.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $50,000.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps there's a different rule for individuals who are over 55.\n\nWait, in the past, there was a provision that allowed individuals over 55 to exclude up to $125,000 of gain, even if they didn't meet the 2-out-of-5-year test.\n\nBut in this case, Decker lived there for 15 years, so he already meets the test.\n\nMoreover, I think that provision was repealed in 1997.\n\nTherefore, it doesn't apply here.\n\nTherefore, the standard exclusion of $250,000 applies, and the recognizable gain is $50,000.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. $50,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
