                    "text": "In the film 'Easy Rider,' the emblem on the back of Peter Fonda's leather jacket is the American flag. So, the correct answer is B. American flag.\n\nThis choice is significant because it represents the protagonist's journey and his relationship with America. The American flag on his jacket symbolizes his pride in his country and his desire to explore and understand it better. However, throughout the movie, he faces various challenges and prejudices, which highlight the complexities and contradictions within American society at that time.\n\nOption A, the peace symbol, was a common emblem during the era of the film, associated with the counterculture and anti-war movements. While Fonda's character, Wyatt, is part of this counterculture, the specific emblem on his jacket is the American flag.\n\nOption C, two white doves, might represent peace and harmony, but it's not the emblem featured on Fonda's jacket in the film.\n\nOption D, the Harley-Davidson logo, is relevant because the characters in 'Easy Rider' ride Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are iconic symbols of American motorcycling culture. However, the logo is not depicted on Fonda's leather jacket in the film.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. American flag."
