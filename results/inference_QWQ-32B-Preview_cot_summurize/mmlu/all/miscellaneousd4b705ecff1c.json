Jerry Garcia, C. Jeff Beck, and D. Keith Richards. Hmm, I don't recall any of them being particularly known for fashion design, but apparently one of them dabbled in necktie design. Let's see what I can remember about each of them.\n\nStarting with A. Eric Clapton. He's a legendary guitarist, known for his work with Cream, Derek and the Dominos, and his solo career. He's more famous for his music and his philanthropy, like founding the Crossroads Centre for drug and alcohol recovery. I don't think he's ever designed neckties.\n\nOption B. Jerry Garcia. He was the lead guitarist of the Grateful Dead, and he's iconic for his distinctive sound and the band's improvisational live performances. Garcia was also known for his art, particularly his poster designs for the Grateful Dead shows. Maybe he designed some tie patterns, but I'm not sure.\n\nC. Jeff Beck. He's another legendary guitarist, known for his technical skill and innovative use of guitar effects. He's been in bands like The Tridents and Jeff Beck Group, and has had a successful solo career. I don't think he's involved in fashion design.\n\nD. Keith Richards. The Rolling Stones' guitarist, famous for his rhythm and lead guitar work, and his songwriting partnership with Mick Jagger. He's also known for his distinctive appearance and lifestyle. Again, not really known for fashion design.\n\nHmm, none of them really jump out as being fashion designers, but maybe one of them did something in that area. Let me think about Jerry Garcia again. I know he designed posters and some other art related to the Grateful Dead, so maybe he designed some tie patterns as well. Or perhaps Keith Richards has some fashion line that includes ties.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's not about designing the ties themselves, but perhaps endorsing or collaborating on a tie line. For example, some musicians have partnered with fashion brands to create clothing lines that include ties.\n\nLet me consider Eric Clapton again. He's got a lot of merchandise out there, maybe including ties. But I don't recall anything specific.\n\nJeff Beck, not really known for merchandise beyond guitar gear.\n\nKeith Richards, same as Keith. Maybe he has some fashion line, but I'm not aware of it.\n\nJerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead had a massive merchandise operation, including clothing, so maybe ties were part of that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of them had a side project that involved designing ties. Maybe as a hobby or something.\n\nI think I need to make an educated guess here. Since Jerry Garcia was involved in art and design for Grateful Dead merchandise, it's possible that he designed ties as well. So, I'll go with B. Jerry Garcia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
