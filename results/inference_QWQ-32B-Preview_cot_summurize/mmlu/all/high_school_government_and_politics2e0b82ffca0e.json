                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what happens when the Senate and the House of Representatives pass different versions of the same bill. There are four options here, and I need to pick the most accurate one.\n\nOption A says that the president signs the version he prefers. But I don't think that's how it works. From what I remember, the president usually gets to sign a bill only after both houses have agreed on the same version. So if they pass different versions, I don't think the president just picks one to sign.\n\nOption B suggests that the bill goes back to each house's committee and restarts the legislative process. That seems inefficient. Restarting the entire process just because there are differences seems like it would waste a lot of time and effort. I don't recall that being the standard procedure.\n\nOption C says that all amendments to the bill are invalidated, and the original version is sent to the president. That also seems unlikely. If both houses have made changes, invalidating all amendments and going back to the original doesn't resolve the differences. It just ignores the work both houses have done.\n\nOption D mentions that the two legislative bodies form a conference committee. I think this is the most plausible option. A conference committee is supposed to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions of a bill. That makes sense because it provides a structured way to bring both versions together and create a single, unified bill that both houses can agree on.\n\nLet me double-check what I know about conference committees. From my government classes, I recall that when the House and Senate pass different versions of a bill, a conference committee is often formed. This committee includes members from both houses who work together to iron out the differences and propose a compromise version of the bill. Once the committee reaches an agreement, both the House and the Senate must vote on the revised bill again. If both houses approve the compromise version, it can then be sent to the president for signature.\n\nComparing this to the other options, forming a conference committee seems like the standard procedure for resolving differences between the House and Senate versions of a bill. The other options don't align as well with what I know about the legislative process.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D: The two legislative bodies form a conference committee.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
