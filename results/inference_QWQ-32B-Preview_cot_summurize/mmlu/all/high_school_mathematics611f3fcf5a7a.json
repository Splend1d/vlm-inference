                    "text": "So Ben is rolling four fair 20-sided dice, and we need to find the probability that exactly two of them show an even number. The options are fractions, so I guess we need to simplify our answer to match one of those.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. Each die has 20 faces, numbered from 1 to 20. Half of these numbers are even, and half are odd, right? So, from 1 to 20, there are 10 even numbers and 10 odd numbers.\n\nSo, the probability of getting an even number on one die is 10/20, which simplifies to 1/2. Similarly, the probability of getting an odd number is also 1/2.\n\nNow, Ben is rolling four dice, and we want exactly two of them to show an even number. This sounds like a binomial probability problem, where we have a fixed number of independent trials (dice rolls), each with two possible outcomes (even or odd), and we want exactly k successes (even numbers) out of n trials (dice rolls).\n\nThe formula for binomial probability is:\n\nP(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere:\n\n- C(n, k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time.\n\n- p is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\n- n is the number of trials.\n\n- k is the number of successes.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- n = 4 (since there are four dice)\n\n- k = 2 (we want exactly two even numbers)\n\n- p = 1/2 (probability of getting an even number on one die)\n\nSo, plugging these values into the formula:\n\nP(2) = C(4, 2) * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^(4-2)\n\nFirst, let's calculate C(4, 2). I know that C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\nSo, C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * 2!) = (4*3*2*1) / (2*1 * 2*1) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nNext, (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nAnd (1/2)^(4-2) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSo, P(2) = 6 * (1/4) * (1/4) = 6 * (1/16) = 6/16.\n\nSimplifying 6/16, we get 3/8.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5/24\n\nB. 5/16\n\nC. 3/8\n\nD. 5/8\n\nOption C is 3/8, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the probability for one die: yes, 10 even numbers out of 20, so 1/2.\n\nSecond, the binomial formula seems correctly applied.\n\nC(4, 2) is indeed 6.\n\n(1/2)^2 is 1/4, and (1/2)^2 is again 1/4.\n\nMultiplying them together: 6 * 1/4 * 1/4 = 6/16 = 3/8.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of specific sequences.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling four 20-sided dice is 20^4, but since we're only concerned with even or odd, and the probability is symmetric, we can treat each die as having two outcomes: even or odd, each with probability 1/2.\n\nSo, the total number of outcomes is 2^4 = 16.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes, where exactly two dice show even, is C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nSo, probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes = 6/16 = 3/8.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to list all possible sequences of even and odd for four dice, there would be 16 possibilities, and exactly 6 of them would have exactly two evens.\n\nFor example:\n\nEEEO, EEOE, EOE E, OOEE, EEOO, EOEO, etc.\n\nBut counting them individually would be time-consuming, so the combinatorial approach is better.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3/8, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{8}} \\]"
