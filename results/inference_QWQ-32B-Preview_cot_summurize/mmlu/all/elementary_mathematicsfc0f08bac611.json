                    "text": "So I have this problem: find 1 over 6 plus 1 over 8. The options are A) 7 over 24, B) 2 over 14, C) 1 over 7, and D) 1 over 4. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how to add fractions. When the denominators are different, I can't just add the numerators directly. I need to find a common denominator. So, for 1/6 and 1/8, I need to find a number that both 6 and 8 can divide into without leaving a remainder.\n\nThe denominators are 6 and 8. Let's list some multiples:\n\nMultiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, etc.\n\nMultiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, etc.\n\nThe smallest number that appears in both lists is 24. So, 24 is the least common denominator (LCD) for 6 and 8.\n\nNow, I need to convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 24.\n\nStarting with 1/6:\n\nTo get from 6 to 24, I multiply the denominator by 4. So, I also multiply the numerator by 4:\n\n1 * 4 = 4\n\nSo, 1/6 = 4/24\n\nNext, 1/8:\n\nTo get from 8 to 24, I multiply the denominator by 3. So, I multiply the numerator by 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nSo, 1/8 = 3/24\n\nNow, I can add them together:\n\n4/24 + 3/24 = 7/24\n\nSo, the sum is 7/24.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA) 7 over 24\n\nB) 2 over 14\n\nC) 1 over 7\n\nD) 1 over 4\n\nOption A matches the answer I got, which is 7/24.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if any of the other options could be equal to 7/24.\n\nOption B: 2/14\n\nSimplify 2/14 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2:\n\n2 \u00f7 2 = 1\n\n14 \u00f7 2 = 7\n\nSo, 2/14 = 1/7, which is option C. But 1/7 is not equal to 7/24.\n\nOption D: 1/4\n\nIs 1/4 equal to 7/24?\n\nTo compare, let's find a common denominator. The denominators are 4 and 24. The LCD is 24.\n\nConvert 1/4 to a fraction with denominator 24:\n\n1 * 6 = 6\n\n4 * 6 = 24\n\nSo, 1/4 = 6/24\n\nComparing 6/24 and 7/24, they are not equal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) 7 over 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
