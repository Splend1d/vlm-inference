Respite. Okay, so I need to figure out which one is the insurance program for poor people of all ages.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these options is.\n\nA. Hospice: I think hospice is a type of care for people who are at the end of their lives, right? Like, when someone has a terminal illness and they need palliative care, that's hospice. So, that's not an insurance program; it's a type of care.\n\nB. Medicaid: Hmm, I've heard of Medicaid before. I think it's a government program that helps people who don't have a lot of money to get health insurance. Maybe this is the one.\n\nC. Medicare: Okay, Medicare is the health insurance program for seniors, right? Like, people who are 65 and older, and also some younger people with disabilities. So, it's not for poor people of all ages.\n\nD. Respite: I'm not sure what respite is. I think it might be short-term care for people who need a break from their regular care, maybe for caregivers who need a break. But again, not an insurance program.\n\nSo, between these options, Medicaid seems like the one that provides health insurance for poor people of all ages. Let me make sure.\n\nMedicaid is a joint federal and state program that helps people with low income and limited resources to pay for medical expenses. It covers a wide range of services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, long-term care, and more. And it's for people of all ages, not just seniors or specific groups.\n\nHospice is a type of care, not an insurance program.\n\nMedicare is specifically for seniors and some disabled individuals, regardless of income.\n\nRespite care is short-term care to give caregivers a break, but again, not an insurance program.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Medicaid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
