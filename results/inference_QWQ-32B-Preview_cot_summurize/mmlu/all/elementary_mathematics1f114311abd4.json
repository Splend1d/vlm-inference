I need to choose the correct one that represents the expression using the distributive property without simplifying it.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what the distributive property is. I think it's the rule that allows me to multiply a number by each term inside the parentheses and then add those products together. So, for example, if I have a(b + c), it becomes a*b + a*c. That seems right.\n\nIn this case, the expression is 4(3 + 2). So, applying the distributive property, I should multiply 4 by 3 and then 4 by 2, and keep it as that without adding them up.\n\nSo, that would be 4*3 + 4*2. Looking at the options, that matches option B: 4(3) + 4(2).\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A is 4(3) + 2. That seems like only part of the distributive property. It multiplied 4 by 3 but didn't multiply 4 by 2.\n\nOption C is 20, but the problem says not to simplify, so that can't be right.\n\nOption D is 3 + 4(2), which seems to have added 3 and then multiplied 4 by 2, but that doesn't follow the distributive property.\n\nSo, it looks like option B is the correct choice here.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I understand this correctly. The distributive property is about distributing the multiplication over addition or subtraction. So, in 4(3 + 2), the 4 is being distributed to both 3 and 2 inside the parentheses.\n\nIf I were to apply the distributive property step by step, it would look like this:\n\nFirst, multiply 4 by 3, which is 12.\n\nThen, multiply 4 by 2, which is 8.\n\nSo, the expression becomes 12 + 8.\n\nBut the problem says \"do not simplify,\" which probably means don't add them up to get 20. So, keeping it as 4(3) + 4(2) seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. Option B is the correct restatement using the distributive property without simplifying.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
