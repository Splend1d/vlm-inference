Hoover Dam\n\nFirst, I know that Nevada is a state in the western United States, known for cities like Las Vegas and Reno. It's also home to several natural and man-made attractions.\n\nStarting with option A, the Liberace Museum: Liberace was a famous pianist and entertainer who lived in Las Vegas for many years. There is indeed a museum dedicated to him in Las Vegas, Nevada, where his extravagant memorabilia is displayed. So, that's in Nevada.\n\nOption B is Pikes Peak. I recall that Pikes Peak is a prominent landmark, often referred to as the \"Queen of the Rockies.\" I believe it's located in Colorado, specifically near the city of Colorado Springs. If that's the case, then it's not in Nevada.\n\nJust to make sure, I should confirm the location of Pikes Peak. A quick search confirms that Pikes Peak is in Colorado, not Nevada.\n\nMoving on to option C, Lake Mead. I know that Lake Mead is a large reservoir formed by the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. Since the Hoover Dam is on the border between Nevada and Arizona, Lake Mead stretches across both states, but a significant portion is in Nevada, near Las Vegas.\n\nSo, Lake Mead is indeed in Nevada.\n\nOption D is the Hoover Dam. As I just mentioned, the Hoover Dam is located on the border between Nevada and Arizona, so it's partially in Nevada.\n\nTherefore, among these options, Pikes Peak is the one that is not in Nevada.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
