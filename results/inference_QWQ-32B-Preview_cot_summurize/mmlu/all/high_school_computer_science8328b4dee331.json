Let's list them out again to make sure I've got them all:\n\nA. Making a purchase at an online store that uses public key encryption to transmit credit card information.\n\nB. Paying a bill using a secure electronic payment system.\n\nC. Reserving a hotel room by emailing a credit card number to a hotel.\n\nD. Withdrawing money from a bank account using an ATM.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which one of these poses the greatest risk to my personal cybersecurity. Let's consider each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option A: buying something online from a store that uses public key encryption for credit card info. Public key encryption is a standard security measure that helps protect data in transit. So, if they're using that, it means that my credit card information is being encrypted and should be secure while it's being transmitted. I think that's a relatively safe way to make a purchase online.\n\nOption B: paying a bill using a secure electronic payment system. Again, if it's secure, that probably means they have measures in place to protect my data, like encryption and maybe two-factor authentication or something like that. So, this also seems pretty safe.\n\nOption C: reserving a hotel room by emailing my credit card number to the hotel. Hmm, emailing sensitive information like credit card numbers is generally not recommended because email is not a secure way to transmit data. Emails can be intercepted or accessed by unauthorized people if they're not encrypted. So, this seems like it could be risky.\n\nOption D: withdrawing money from an ATM. ATMs are generally secure, but there are risks like skimming devices that can capture your card information, or cameras that might record your PIN. But assuming it's a reputable bank's ATM and I'm being cautious, the risk might be lower.\n\nComparing all these, option C stands out as the most risky because emailing credit card information is not secure. Unlike the other options, which have built-in security measures, emailing sensitive data exposes it to potential interception or unauthorized access.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Reserving a hotel room by emailing a credit card number to a hotel poses the greatest personal cybersecurity risk among these options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
