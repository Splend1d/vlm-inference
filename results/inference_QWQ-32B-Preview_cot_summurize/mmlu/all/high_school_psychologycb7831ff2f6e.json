These stages describe the process that people go through when facing their own death or the death of a loved one.\n\nIn the context of a person facing a terminal illness, the first stage is typically denial. This is a psychological defense mechanism where the person refuses to accept the reality of the situation. It's a way for the mind to cope with the overwhelming news and to buy time to come to terms with the diagnosis.\n\nSo, according to K\u00fcbler-Ross, the first reaction is denial, not acceptance, anger, or bargaining.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
