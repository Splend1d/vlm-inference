The options are research brief, research proposal, research question, and research programme. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, a research brief is usually the document that the client provides to the agency outlining the problem or the research needed. So, that seems like it's coming from the client to the agency, not the other way around. So, maybe not A.\n\nA research proposal sounds like something the agency would present to the client detailing their plan on how to approach the research. It should include methods, timelines, maybe budget estimates, and so on. That seems pretty likely.\n\nA research question is more like the specific question the research is trying to answer. It's a key part of the research, but it's not a document that outlines the entire investigation process.\n\nA research programme sounds a bit broader, maybe referring to a series of related research projects or a long-term research plan. It doesn't seem to fit exactly here.\n\nSo, between these options, the research proposal seems to be the most appropriate answer. It's the document where the agency outlines their approach and methods for investigating the problem discussed in the brief.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\n- Research brief: Typically from client to agency, not the other way around.\n\n- Research proposal: From agency to client, detailing the research plan.\n\n- Research question: A specific question to be answered by the research, not a document.\n\n- Research programme: Seems more broad and long-term, not specifically for detailing a single investigation.\n\nYeah, I think B, the research proposal, is the correct answer here. It makes sense that after discussing the brief, the agency would provide a proposal outlining how they'll conduct the research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
