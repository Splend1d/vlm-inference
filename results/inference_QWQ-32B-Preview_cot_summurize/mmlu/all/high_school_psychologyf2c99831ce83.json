                    "text": "So I've got this question here about what to do when universal screening data shows that very few students are meeting school competencies. And there are four options:\n\nA. Changes must be made in the delivery of the core program.\n\nB. Students who are not meeting competencies must be given strategic or supplemental instruction.\n\nC. Students must be given more time to develop competencies.\n\nD. Students who are not meeting competencies must be evaluated for learning disabilities.\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. First, it's important to understand what universal screening is. Universal screening is a process where all students are assessed to identify those who may be at risk for academic or behavioral problems. So, if the data from these screenings show that very few students are meeting the expected competencies, that suggests there might be an issue with the overall instructional approach or the curriculum itself.\n\nOption A suggests making changes in the delivery of the core program. That makes sense because if the core program isn't effectively teaching the majority of students, then adjustments need to be made to improve its delivery. This could involve training teachers, updating instructional materials, or changing teaching strategies to better meet the needs of students.\n\nOption B proposes giving strategic or supplemental instruction to students who aren't meeting competencies. While this is a useful intervention for students who are struggling, if very few students are meeting competencies, it might indicate a broader issue that needs to be addressed at the core program level. Providing supplemental instruction to many students could be resource-intensive and might not address the root cause of the problem.\n\nOption C suggests giving students more time to develop competencies. While giving students additional time can be helpful, if the core instruction isn't effective, simply extending the time might not lead to significant improvements. It's important to ensure that the instruction students are receiving is of high quality and appropriately challenging.\n\nOption D recommends evaluating students who are not meeting competencies for learning disabilities. While it's important to identify students with learning disabilities, if very few students are meeting competencies, it's unlikely that a learning disability is the primary issue for the majority of students. This approach might be more appropriate if only a small number of students are struggling.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like the most comprehensive approach would be to look at the core program first. If the core instruction isn't effective for most students, then changing the delivery of the core program makes sense. This aligns with Option A.\n\nAdditionally, while Options B, C, and D might be part of a broader intervention plan, they may not address the fundamental issue if the core instruction is lacking. Therefore, I think Option A is the most appropriate initial step.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
