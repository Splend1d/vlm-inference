                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\nEvery two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nAccording to the second passage, which of the following contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here that's referencing two different passages, one about mining in South America and another about tribute payments in Siberia. The question is specifically about the second passage, which talks about the difficulties faced by native Siberians in fulfilling their tribute obligations to the Russians. It's asking which factor contributed most to their burden.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries\n\nB. Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra\n\nC. Competition from Russian hunters and trappers\n\nD. Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the passage says. It's a report from Heinrich von F\u00fcch in 1744 about the treatment of natives in Northeast Siberia. The passage mentions that natives are required to pay yasak tribute, which could be in the form of sables, red foxes, or cash. Initially, there were plenty of furbearing animals, but over time, the number of sables and foxes decreased, especially in areas from the Arctic Ocean down to the great Lena River. Additionally, many natives couldn't hunt because they had lost their horses, which were pawned to yasak collectors.\n\nSo, the main points are:\n\n1. Natives have to pay tribute in furs or cash.\n\n2. Initially, there were plenty of furbearing animals, but now there are fewer sables and foxes.\n\n3. Many natives can't hunt because they don't have horses.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries\n\nThe passage doesn't mention anything about missionaries or their interference. It's focused on the tribute system and the depletion of animal resources. So, this seems unlikely to be the main contributor to the natives' burden based on the information provided.\n\nB. Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra\n\nThe passage doesn't suggest that natives are inexperienced in hunting in their own environment. In fact, it implies that they are the ones who know how to hunt these animals, as they are required to pay tribute in furs. So, it's unlikely that inexperience is the main issue here.\n\nC. Competition from Russian hunters and trappers\n\nThe passage mentions that natives are required to pay tribute in furs, but it doesn't explicitly state that Russian hunters and trappers are competing with them for the same resources. However, it's possible that Russian presence led to increased hunting pressure, but this isn't directly stated.\n\nD. Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals\n\nThis seems to directly align with what the passage says. It mentions that initially, there were plenty of furbearing animals, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in the specified areas. This suggests that overhunting has led to the depletion of these animal populations, making it harder for natives to fulfill their tribute obligations.\n\nAdditionally, the passage notes that many natives can't hunt because they have pawned their horses to yasak collectors. This suggests that they have fallen into debt and have lost their means of transportation, which are essential for hunting over large areas.\n\nSo, considering these points, it seems that the overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals is a major factor contributing to the natives' burden. They have fewer animals to hunt, and many have lost their horses, which are necessary for hunting.\n\nOption C, competition from Russian hunters and trappers, could be a contributing factor, but it's not directly mentioned in the passage. The passage focuses more on the depletion of animals and the loss of horses by the natives.\n\nTherefore, the most directly supported answer based on the passage is D. Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the loss of horses due to pawning to yasak collectors is also a significant issue. Without horses, natives can't effectively hunt, which exacerbates the problem of depleted animal populations.\n\nBut since the question asks for the factor that contributed most to the burden, and considering that the depletion of animals is mentioned explicitly as a reason for the difficulty in fulfilling tribute, while the loss of horses is an additional complication, I would still go with D.\n\nOption A is not supported by the passage, and option B seems unlikely given the context.\n\nSo, my answer is D. Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
