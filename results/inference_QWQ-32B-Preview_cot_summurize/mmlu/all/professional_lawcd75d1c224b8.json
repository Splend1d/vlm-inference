Over several months, parts of the building have been wobbling, especially during bad weather when the river hits it harder. Employees and customers complained about this, but the general manager didn't do anything about it.\n\nOne windy night, a section of the pier collapses into the river, killing 28 people\u2014both customers and employees. It turns out that officials had previously cited the club for violating safety regulations, but still, nothing was done.\n\nThe police arrested the general manager and charged him with involuntary manslaughter. He's defending himself by saying that his failure to act doesn't meet the legal requirements for manslaughter.\n\nWe need to decide which option the court is likely to choose:\n\nA. This was not manslaughter because the omission to respond to safety citations isn't enough to show the high degree of criminal negligence required.\n\nB. The failure to act is less bad than actively being reckless, so there's not enough evidence to charge manslaughter.\n\nC. A corporate employee can't be prosecuted for manslaughter regarding how they perform or don't perform their duties for the company.\n\nD. The charge of involuntary manslaughter is legally valid because the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful given the circumstances.\n\nFirst, let's understand what involuntary manslaughter is. It's usually defined as unintentional killing due to recklessness or criminal negligence. Recklessness means consciously disregarding a substantial and unjustifiable risk.\n\nIn this case, the general manager knew about the wobbling building and safety citations but didn't take any action to fix the issues. Despite knowing the risks, he chose to do nothing, which led to the collapse and deaths.\n\nOption A suggests that omitting to respond to safety citations isn't sufficient for the high degree of criminal negligence required for manslaughter. But in reality, ignoring known risks and failing to act when you have a duty to do so can constitute criminal negligence.\n\nOption B says that failing to act is less culpable than active recklessness, so there's insufficient evidence for manslaughter. However, in law, omissions can be just as culpable as actions if there's a duty to act. The general manager had a duty to ensure the safety of the club's patrons and employees, and by not addressing known safety issues, he may have breached that duty.\n\nOption C claims that a corporate employee can't be prosecuted for manslaughter in relation to their duties for the corporation. But this is incorrect. Individuals, including corporate employees, can be held criminally liable for their actions or omissions that result in harm, provided they had a duty of care.\n\nOption D states that the charge is legally sufficient because the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful under the circumstances. This seems to align with the principles of criminal law, where failing to act when there's a duty to do so can constitute recklessness.\n\nGiven this analysis, option D appears to be the most accurate. The general manager's failure to address known safety issues, despite complaints and official citations, demonstrates a reckless disregard for the safety of others. This recklessness, leading to deaths, is sufficient to support a charge of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nSo, the court is likely to decide that the charge of involuntary manslaughter is legally sufficient because the manager's omissions were reckless and unlawful under the circumstances.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
