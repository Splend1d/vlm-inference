                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about US adults' views on computer programs and human bias as of 2018. The options are 43%, 58%, 73%, and 88%. I don't remember the exact statistic, but I think it's pretty high. People generally seem concerned about bias in algorithms.\n\nI recall that there have been several studies and reports about public perception of AI and bias. Maybe I can recall something from news articles or studies I've read. I think Pew Research Center often does surveys on technology and public opinion.\n\nLet me think about this. In 2018, there was a lot of discussion about algorithmic bias and how AI can perpetuate human biases. So, it's likely that a significant portion of US adults were aware of this issue.\n\nLooking at the options, 43% seems too low because it's less than half. 58% is a majority, but still less than 60%. 73% is substantially higher, indicating that nearly three-quarters of adults believed this. 88% is very high, meaning that almost nine out of ten adults held this view.\n\nGiven that awareness about AI and bias was increasing around that time, I would guess that it's higher rather than lower. Maybe around 73% or 88%. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait a minute, I think I remember a study that said around 75% of US adults believe that algorithms will always reflect some level of human bias. That sounds familiar. So, 73% is close to that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it was an even higher percentage like 88%. But that seems too high. It's unlikely that nearly nine out of ten adults would hold that view unless it was widely accepted.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Maybe I can eliminate some options. 43% seems too low because, as I said, there was a lot of discussion about this. So, probably more than just 43% would hold that view.\n\nBetween 58%, 73%, and 88%, I'm inclined to go with 73%. It seems like a reasonable majority without being too extreme.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 58%. But that feels a bit low to me.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it in terms of public opinion on technology. Generally, the public can be skeptical of technology, especially regarding potential drawbacks like bias.\n\nGiven that, it's possible that a large majority, perhaps even 88%, believe that computer programs will always reflect human bias.\n\nBut again, that seems too high. I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps I can look at it this way: if most people believe that humans are biased, and computer programs are created by humans, then it's logical to conclude that computer programs will reflect human bias.\n\nIf that's the case, then a high percentage like 73% or 88% makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, there might be some people who believe that computer programs can be objective and free from human bias.\n\nSo, maybe the percentage isn't as high as 88%.\n\nI think 73% is a safe guess.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
