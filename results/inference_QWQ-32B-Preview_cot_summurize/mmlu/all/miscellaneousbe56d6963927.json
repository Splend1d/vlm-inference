They had a lot of power and controlled the government, even though there was an emperor. The shogunate system started in the 12th century and lasted until the mid-19th century when the Meiji Restoration restored imperial rule.\n\nI remember learning about the samurai, who were warriors serving the shoguns. They had a code of honor called bushido. It's interesting how the shoguns and samurai played such a big role in Japanese history.\n\nI don't think China was ruled by shoguns. China had emperors and dynasties, like the Ming and Qing dynasties. North Korea has had a series of leaders, but I don't recall shoguns being part of their history. Taiwan is mostly known for being part of China or having its own government, but again, no shoguns.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that the answer is Japan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
