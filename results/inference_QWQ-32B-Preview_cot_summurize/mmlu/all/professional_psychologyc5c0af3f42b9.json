                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Z scores. So, transformed scores are used to make raw scores more understandable and to compare them within a distribution. Z scores are a type of transformed score that standardizes raw scores in terms of standard deviations from the mean.\n\nOption A says \"raw scores stated in SD terms.\" That sounds like Z scores because Z scores express how far a raw score is from the mean in terms of standard deviations.\n\nOption B says \"score minus the mean divided by the SD.\" That's the formula for calculating a Z score: Z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3. So, this is definitely about Z scores.\n\nOption C says \"permits comparisons across different measures and tests.\" Z scores are useful for comparing scores from different distributions because they standardize the scores to a common scale. So, this is also about Z scores.\n\nOption D says \"tells you how many SDs away from the mean a score is.\" That's exactly what a Z score indicates. A Z score of 1 means the score is one standard deviation above the mean, -1 means one standard deviation below, and so on.\n\nWait a minute, the question is asking for the statement that is NOT about Z scores. But all these options seem to be describing Z scores. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check. The question is: \"From your knowledge about Transformed Scores, which statement is not about the Z SCOREs?\"\n\nHmm. Perhaps one of these options could apply to other transformed scores as well, not just Z scores.\n\nOption A: \"raw scores stated in SD terms.\" This seems specific to Z scores.\n\nOption B: \"score minus the mean divided by the SD.\" This is the Z score formula.\n\nOption C: \"permits comparisons across different measures and tests.\" While Z scores do this, other transformed scores like T scores or percentile ranks also allow comparisons across different measures. So, maybe this is not exclusive to Z scores.\n\nOption D: \"tells you how many SDs away from the mean a score is.\" Again, this is specific to Z scores.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is the answer because it can apply to other transformed scores besides Z scores.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. The question is asking which statement is NOT about Z scores. If all options are about Z scores, then there's a problem. But if one of them can apply to other transformed scores as well, then maybe that's the one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I understand that Z scores are expressed in terms of standard deviations, and maybe one of the options is misstated.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that Z scores can be negative, while some other transformed scores are always positive or within a certain range.\n\nBut none of the options mention positivity or negativity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding that Z scores have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, but none of the options mention that directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me by including options that are true for Z scores, and I need to find the one that isn't.\n\nWait, perhaps one of the options is actually incorrect for Z scores.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nOption A: \"raw scores stated in SD terms.\" This is correct for Z scores.\n\nOption B: \"score minus the mean divided by the SD.\" This is the Z score formula.\n\nOption C: \"permits comparisons across different measures and tests.\" While true for Z scores, it's also true for other transformed scores.\n\nOption D: \"tells you how many SDs away from the mean a score is.\" This is what Z scores represent.\n\nMaybe the answer is C because, while Z scores do allow comparisons across different measures, other transformed scores can also do that. Perhaps the question is trying to point out that this is a feature of transformed scores in general, not just Z scores.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that Z scores don't necessarily permit comparisons across different measures and tests if those measures have different standard deviations or means. But that doesn't seem right because Z scores standardize the scores, making them comparable.\n\nWait, perhaps in some contexts, Z scores aren't directly comparable if the underlying distributions have different characteristics. But generally, Z scores are used for comparison purposes.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Given the options, I believe the answer is C because it's a feature of transformed scores in general, not exclusive to Z scores.\n\nSo, the statement that is not specifically about Z scores is C: \"permits comparisons across different measures and tests.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
