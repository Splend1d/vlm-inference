                    "text": "So I have this problem here: If f(3) = 8 and f'(3) = -4, then f(3.02) is approximately... and there are a few options. I'm going to try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like I need to approximate the value of the function f at x = 3.02, given that I know the function's value and its derivative at x = 3.\n\nI recall that derivatives can be used to approximate function values near a known point using something like the linear approximation formula. The formula for linear approximation is:\n\nf(x) \u2248 f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)\n\nWhere:\n\n- f(a) is the known value of the function at point a.\n\n- f'(a) is the derivative of the function at point a.\n\n- x is the point near a where we want to approximate the function value.\n\nIn this problem:\n\n- a = 3\n\n- f(a) = f(3) = 8\n\n- f'(a) = f'(3) = -4\n\n- x = 3.02\n\nPlugging these values into the linear approximation formula:\n\nf(3.02) \u2248 8 + (-4)(3.02 - 3)\n\nFirst, calculate (3.02 - 3):\n\n3.02 - 3 = 0.02\n\nNow, multiply by the derivative:\n\n-4 * 0.02 = -0.08\n\nFinally, add this to f(3):\n\n8 + (-0.08) = 7.92\n\nSo, according to the linear approximation, f(3.02) is approximately 7.92.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -8.08\n\nB. 7.92\n\nC. 7.98\n\nD. 8.02\n\nOption B matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there's a better way to approximate this or if I've made any mistakes.\n\nIs there a possibility that the function isn't linear near x = 3, making the linear approximation inaccurate? Well, with only the first derivative information, linear approximation is the standard method. Unless the function has some known curvature or higher-order derivatives provided, linear approximation should suffice for small changes in x, like from 3 to 3.02.\n\nAlternatively, if the function were quadratic or of higher degree, higher-order terms could affect the approximation, but with only the first derivative given, I don't have that information.\n\nAnother thing to check is if there's any misunderstanding of the notation or the given values. The function is f, and f(3) = 8, f'(3) = -4. No issues there.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the calculation is correct:\n\nf(3.02) \u2248 8 + (-4)(0.02) = 8 - 0.08 = 7.92\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the approximate value of f(3.02) is 7.92, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
