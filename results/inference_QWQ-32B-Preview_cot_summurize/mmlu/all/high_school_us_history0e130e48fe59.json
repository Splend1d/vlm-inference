                    "text": "Based on the information provided in the Charter of Privileges granted by William Penn, it's clear that Pennsylvania was a proprietary colony. William Penn received a land grant from King Charles II and was given the authority to govern the colony. This type of colony was under the control of a proprietor or a group of proprietors who held the land rights and governing powers, subject to the overall authority of the British Crown.\n\nLet's look at each option to confirm:\n\nA. A charter colony in which the King granted a charter to a group of businessmen or colonists.\n\n- Charter colonies were established by companies or groups of people with a royal charter from the King, granting them the right to settle and govern a specific area. Examples include the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the Providence Plantations. While Pennsylvania had a charter, it was granted to a single individual, William Penn, rather than a group, which makes it more of a proprietary colony.\n\nB. A proprietary colony in which the King entrusted government to a proprietor and his family.\n\n- This seems to fit Pennsylvania's situation perfectly. William Penn was granted the land by King Charles II, and he had the authority to govern the colony. His descendants could inherit this right, making it a proprietary colony.\n\nC. A royal colony in which the King appointed the governor.\n\n- In royal colonies, the King directly appointed the governor, and the colony was governed in the name of the Crown. Examples include Virginia and New York after they became royal colonies. Pennsylvania, under William Penn and his heirs, was not governed by a royally appointed governor but by the proprietor.\n\nD. An independent colony governed outside the authority of the King.\n\n- This option suggests a colony that operates without any ties to the British Crown, which was not the case for Pennsylvania. Even as a proprietary colony, Pennsylvania was still under the ultimate authority of the King, and the proprietor operated within the framework set by the Crown.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best answer is B. A proprietary colony in which the King entrusted government to a proprietor and his family.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
