                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about PKU and mental retardation. So, PKU stands for Phenylketonuria, right? I remember that it's a genetic disorder. Let me think about what causes it and how it can lead to mental retardation.\n\nOkay, from what I recall, PKU is caused by a deficiency in an enzyme that's needed to break down the amino acid phenylalanine. So, if that enzyme isn't working properly, phenylalanine builds up in the body, which can be toxic to the brain and lead to mental retardation if not managed.\n\nNow, the question is asking about how to prevent the mental retardation associated with PKU. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Removal of environmental toxins.\n\nHmm, while removing environmental toxins is generally a good idea for overall health, I don't think it directly addresses the root cause of PKU. PKU is a metabolic disorder, not an environmental issue.\n\nB. Blood transfusions.\n\nBlood transfusions are used to treat conditions where there is a need to replace blood lost due to injury or disease, or to treat certain blood disorders. I don't see how a blood transfusion would address the metabolic issue in PKU.\n\nC. A special diet.\n\nThis seems promising. Since PKU is related to the inability to properly metabolize phenylalanine, restricting foods that contain phenylalanine should help prevent it from building up in the body. I think this is the key to managing PKU and preventing mental retardation.\n\nD. Antibiotics.\n\nAntibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections. PKU is not an infection; it's a metabolic disorder. So, antibiotics wouldn't address the underlying issue here.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it seems like the correct answer is C, a special diet. I think this makes sense because by controlling the intake of phenylalanine, we can prevent its buildup and thus avoid the neurological problems associated with PKU.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. Is there any other treatment for PKU besides dietary management? I think in some cases, there are medications that can help, but I believe dietary management is the primary approach.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether environmental factors play a role in PKU. Since it's a genetic disorder, environmental toxins might exacerbate the condition, but they aren't the direct cause, so removing them wouldn't necessarily prevent the mental retardation associated with PKU.\n\nBlood transfusions are definitely not relevant here, as they don't affect metabolic pathways.\n\nAnd antibiotics are used for infections, which again, aren't related to the metabolic issues in PKU.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that the answer is C, a special diet. This is the standard treatment for PKU, and it's been shown to be effective in preventing mental retardation when started early, preferably in infancy.\n\nI think that's the answer I'll go with.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
