To determine whether a child is in the preoperational or concrete operational stage, Piaget would focus on specific cognitive abilities that distinguish these stages.\n\nOption A, object permanence, is actually a concept associated with the sensorimotor stage, where infants learn that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen or heard. This is not relevant for distinguishing between the preoperational and concrete operational stages.\n\nOption B, attachment, is more related to emotional and social development, particularly in the context of Bowlby's attachment theory, rather than Piaget's cognitive development stages.\n\nOption C, concepts of conservation, are crucial for differentiating between the preoperational and concrete operational stages. Conservation tasks assess a child's ability to understand that certain properties of objects remain the same despite changes in their form or appearance. For example, conservation of number involves understanding that the quantity of items remains the same even if they are rearranged; conservation of mass involves understanding that the amount of substance remains the same even if its shape is changed; and conservation of volume involves understanding that the quantity of liquid remains the same even if it is poured into a differently shaped container.\n\nIn the preoperational stage, children typically lack the ability to conserve because they focus on only one aspect of a situation at a time (this is known as centration) and have difficulty considering multiple dimensions simultaneously. They also exhibit egocentrism, which means they have trouble taking the perspective of others.\n\nIn contrast, children in the concrete operational stage can perform conservation tasks because they have developed the ability to decenter, meaning they can consider multiple aspects of a situation simultaneously. They can also think logically about concrete events and understand reversibility and reciprocity.\n\nOption D, hypothesis testing, is more associated with the formal operational stage, where adolescents and adults can think abstractly, reason hypothetically, and consider possible outcomes and solutions to problems.\n\nTherefore, to determine whether a child is in the preoperational or concrete operational stage, Piaget would test their understanding of conservation concepts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
