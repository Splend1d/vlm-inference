                    "text": "To determine which of the given molecules has an octet of electrons around the central atom, we need to look at the Lewis structures of each molecule and see if the central atom has eight electrons in its valence shell.\n\nLet's go through each option step by step:\n\n**Option A: BF3 (Boron Trifluoride)**\n\n1. Boron (B) is the central atom.\n2. Boron has 3 valence electrons.\n3. Each fluorine (F) atom has 7 valence electrons.\n4. In BF3, boron forms single bonds with each of the three fluorine atoms.\n5. This means boron shares one electron with each F, totaling 3 shared pairs.\n6. Therefore, boron has 3 bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in only 6 electrons around it.\n7. This is called an incomplete octet.\n\nSo, BF3 does not have an octet around the central atom.\n\n**Option B: NH4+ (Ammonium Ion)**\n\n1. Nitrogen (N) is the central atom.\n2. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons.\n3. Each hydrogen (H) atom has 1 valence electron.\n4. In NH4+, nitrogen forms single bonds with four hydrogen atoms.\n5. This means nitrogen shares one electron with each H, totaling 4 shared pairs.\n6. Additionally, there is a positive charge, which means one electron has been removed.\n7. Therefore, nitrogen has 4 bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in 8 electrons around it.\n8. This is an octet.\n\nSo, NH4+ has an octet around the central atom.\n\n**Option C: PF5 (Phosphorus Pentafluoride)**\n\n1. Phosphorus (P) is the central atom.\n2. Phosphorus has 5 valence electrons.\n3. Each fluorine (F) atom has 7 valence electrons.\n4. In PF5, phosphorus forms single bonds with each of the five fluorine atoms.\n5. This means phosphorus shares one electron with each F, totaling 5 shared pairs.\n6. Therefore, phosphorus has 5 bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in 10 electrons around it.\n7. This is called an expanded octet.\n\nSo, PF5 does not have an octet around the central atom; it has more than an octet.\n\n**Option D: SF6 (Sulfur Hexafluoride)**\n\n1. Sulfur (S) is the central atom.\n2. Sulfur has 6 valence electrons.\n3. Each fluorine (F) atom has 7 valence electrons.\n4. In SF6, sulfur forms single bonds with each of the six fluorine atoms.\n5. This means sulfur shares one electron with each F, totaling 6 shared pairs.\n6. Therefore, sulfur has 6 bonding pairs and no lone pairs, resulting in 12 electrons around it.\n7. This is also an expanded octet.\n\nSo, SF6 does not have an octet around the central atom; it has more than an octet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAmong the given options, only NH4+ has an octet of electrons around the central atom.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
