The question is asking about where the dollar amount of the effects of these differences should be disclosed.\n\nLet me read the options again:\n\nA. Is required to be included only in the auditor's report.\n\nB. Is required to be included only in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nC. Is required to be included both in the notes to the financial statements and the auditor's report.\n\nD. Need not be quantified and included in either the notes to the financial statements or the auditor's report.\n\nHmm, so the entity is preparing its financial statements on an income tax basis, which is different from the generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The notes already include a summary of significant accounting policies that discuss the basis of presentation and how it differs from GAAP.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the dollar amount of these differences needs to be disclosed, and if so, where.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why there are differences between income tax basis and GAAP. I know that for tax purposes, certain transactions are treated differently than for financial reporting purposes. For example, depreciation methods, revenue recognition, and expense deductions might vary between tax rules and GAAP.\n\nSince the financial statements are prepared on an income tax basis, but GAAP is the standard for financial reporting, there should be disclosure about these differences, especially if they are material.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A says it's required only in the auditor's report. That might make sense because the auditor is expressing an opinion on the financial statements prepared on a non-GAAP basis, so they might need to disclose the effects in their report.\n\nOption B says it's required only in the notes to the financial statements. This also makes sense because the notes are where additional information about the accounting policies and their effects are disclosed.\n\nOption C combines both A and B, saying it's required in both the notes and the auditor's report.\n\nOption D says it need not be quantified and included in either place, which seems unlikely because transparency is important in financial reporting.\n\nI think options A, B, or C are more plausible.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, if the financial statements are prepared on an income tax basis, which is a special basis of accounting, the users of the financial statements need to know how this differs from the standard GAAP basis.\n\nThe notes already include a summary of significant accounting policies, which discusses the basis of presentation and how it differs from GAAP. That's good, but sometimes, just describing the differences isn't enough; quantifying the effects can provide more clarity to the users.\n\nSo, perhaps the dollar amount of the effects should be disclosed somewhere.\n\nNow, where should this be disclosed?\n\nIn the notes to the financial statements, it makes sense to include quantitative information about the differences, especially if they are material. This would help users understand the magnitude of these differences and how they impact the financial position and performance of the entity.\n\nOn the other hand, the auditor's report is where the auditor expresses their opinion on the financial statements and may include additional paragraphs if there are material departures from GAAP.\n\nSo, perhaps the auditor should also mention the quantitative effects of the differences in their report, especially if they are material.\n\nWait, but the auditor's report is typically more about the overall opinion on the financial statements and any qualifications or additional matters they need to bring to the users' attention.\n\nIf the financial statements are prepared on a non-GAAP basis, the auditor should disclose that in their report and maybe even quantify the differences if they are significant.\n\nBut is this a requirement?\n\nI'm not entirely sure about the specific requirements here.\n\nLet me consider the auditing standards. In the United States, auditors follow the Generally Accepted Auditing Standards, which are established by the PCAOB for public companies and the AICPA for non-public entities.\n\nFor non-GAAP financial statements, auditors are required to disclose the basis of accounting used and any significant differences from GAAP.\n\nMoreover, if the differences are material, it's important to quantify them so that users can assess the impact.\n\nI think both the notes to the financial statements and the auditor's report should include this information.\n\nIn the notes, it's appropriate to provide detailed explanations and quantitative data about the differences.\n\nIn the auditor's report, especially if the financial statements are prepared on a special basis, the auditor should mention that the statements are not presented in conformity with GAAP and describe the basis of accounting used.\n\nAdditionally, if there are material differences, the auditor might need to quantify those in their report or at least refer to the notes where the quantification is provided.\n\nSo, option C seems to make the most sense because it requires disclosure in both the notes and the auditor's report.\n\nBut let me check if there's any specific authoritative guidance on this.\n\nI recall that Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) 89, \"Special Reports,\" addresses audits of financial statements prepared on a special basis of accounting.\n\nAccording to SAS 89, when an auditor issues a report on financial statements prepared in accordance with a comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP, the auditor should state that the financial statements are presented in accordance with that basis and that such basis is the basis of accounting used.\n\nFurthermore, the auditor should include a separate paragraph in the report to explain the basis of accounting used and that the financial statements are not presented in conformity with GAAP.\n\nBut does SAS 89 require quantification of the differences between the special basis and GAAP in the auditor's report?\n\nI don't recall it specifying that, but it does allow for inclusion of quantitative information if necessary for understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, the financial statements themselves, particularly the notes, should provide sufficient disclosure about the accounting policies and any differences from GAAP, including quantitative data where appropriate.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the dollar amount of the effects should be included in the notes to the financial statements, and the auditor's report should refer to that disclosure or, if necessary, include quantitative information if it's essential for understanding the auditor's opinion.\n\nGiven that, option C appears to be the most comprehensive answer, as it requires disclosure in both the notes and the auditor's report.\n\nHowever, I'm still a bit unsure because I don't remember specific requirements mandating quantitative disclosure in both places.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's only required in one place.\n\nLet me consider the FASB Accounting Standards Codification related to disclosures.\n\nIn the ASC Topic 205-40, \"Presentation of Financial Statements\u2014Going Concern\u2014Special Purpose Framework,\" there is guidance on when and how to disclose differences from GAAP.\n\nBut I need to find more specific guidance on quantifying the differences between income tax basis and GAAP.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the AICPA's Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS), since SSARS often deal with special bases of accounting.\n\nSSARS No. 24, \"Compilation and Review of Financial Statements,\" provides standards for compilations and reviews of financial statements, including those prepared on a special basis of accounting.\n\nIn SSARS No. 24, there is an emphasis on the need for adequate disclosure of the basis of accounting used and any deviations from GAAP.\n\nHowever, I don't see specific requirements for quantifying the differences in either the notes or the auditor's report.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the SEC's requirements, but since the question doesn't specify whether it's for a public company or not, I'll assume it's for a private entity.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps in the auditor's report, when an auditor is reporting on financial statements prepared on a special basis, they need to include a paragraph explaining that the statements are not presented in conformity with GAAP and describe the basis used.\n\nMoreover, if material, they might need to disclose the pro forma effects of conforming to GAAP.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nI think in some cases, when financial statements are presented on a special basis, the auditor might be required to present schedules or supplementary information showing the reconciling items between the special basis and GAAP.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nPerhaps I should look at a sample auditor's report for financial statements prepared on a special basis.\n\nFrom my memory, the auditor's report would typically include a paragraph stating that the financial statements are presented in accordance with a special basis of accounting and that such basis differs from GAAP.\n\nIt might also refer to the notes to the financial statements for a description of the differences.\n\nIn some cases, especially if the differences are material, the auditor might include quantitative information in the report or require that it be presented in the financial statements.\n\nBut I'm not certain about the specific requirements.\n\nGiven that, I think the most accurate answer is option C: the dollar amount of the effects of the difference between the income tax basis and GAAP is required to be included both in the notes to the financial statements and the auditor's report.\n\nThis ensures that the users of the financial statements have a clear understanding of the differences and their impact from both the entity's and the auditor's perspectives.\n\nOption D is probably incorrect because transparency and full disclosure are paramount in financial reporting, and quantifying material differences is generally expected.\n\nOption A and B are partial answers, but option C seems more comprehensive.\n\nI'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
