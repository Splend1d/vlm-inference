                    "text": "Let's think about this scenario. So, the child is scared by a dog barking, and then her mother picks her up, and the child starts to calm down. We need to understand what's happening biologically during this calming process.\n\nFirst, when the child hears the sudden barking, her body likely goes into a fight-or-flight response. That's the body's way of preparing to deal with a perceived threat. This response is managed by the sympathetic nervous system.\n\nNow, when the mother picks her up, the child feels safe, and her body starts to relax. This calming down process is the opposite of the fight-or-flight response. It's like the body is saying, \"Okay, it's okay now, we're safe.\"\n\nSo, which part of the nervous system is responsible for this calming effect? It's the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system is often referred to as the \"rest and digest\" system because it helps the body return to a state of calm after a period of stress.\n\nLet me look at the options again to make sure.\n\nOption A says: \"The parasympathetic nervous system resumes control and reverses the sympathetic responses.\"\n\nThat sounds right. The parasympathetic nervous system is taking over again after the sympathetic nervous system was active during the scare.\n\nOption B says: \"The sympathetic nervous system resumes control and reverses the parasympathetic responses.\"\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense because the sympathetic nervous system is the one that causes the fight-or-flight response. If it resumes control, the child wouldn't be calming down.\n\nOption C says: \"The autonomic nervous system resumes control and reverses the peripheral responses.\"\n\nThe autonomic nervous system includes both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. So, while it's true that the autonomic nervous system is involved, this option is a bit too broad. It's specifically the parasympathetic part that's causing the calming effect.\n\nOption D says: \"The peripheral nervous system resumes control and reverses the autonomic responses.\"\n\nThe peripheral nervous system includes both the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. Again, this is too broad. And it's not the peripheral nervous system that's reversing the autonomic responses; it's the parasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system that's counteracting the sympathetic responses.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
