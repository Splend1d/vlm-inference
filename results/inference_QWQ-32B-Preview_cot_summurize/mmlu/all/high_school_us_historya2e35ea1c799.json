Many of us began maturing in complacency.\n\"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . .\"\n\u2014Port Huron Statement, 1962\nThe primary intended audience for the Port Huron Statement was\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I'm looking at this passage from the Port Huron Statement from 1962, and I need to figure out who the primary intended audience was. The options are African Americans in the South, government officials, middle-class college students, or factory workers. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Port Huron Statement is. A quick search tells me it was a document created by the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), which was a major student organization during the 1960s in the US. So, right away, it seems like it might be aimed at students, possibly middle-class college students.\n\nLooking at the passage, it starts by talking about being kids and the US being the wealthiest and strongest country, with the atom bomb, and the initiation of the United Nations. It mentions American values like freedom, equality, and government by the people. So, it seems to be speaking to people who have grown up with these ideals.\n\nThen, it says, \"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss.\" It mentions two main issues: the struggle against racial bigotry in the South and the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the atom bomb. It says that these events compelled many from silence to activism.\n\nSo, the audience seems to be people who had a comfortable upbringing, probably middle-class, who are now being awakened to social and political issues. The language used is reflective and somewhat intellectual, which might suggest an educated audience, like college students.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. African Americans in the South: While the statement mentions the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, it doesn't seem directly addressed to them. It's more about how these events affected the authors and their generation.\n\nB. Government officials: There's criticism of the government's handling of the Cold War and racial issues, but it doesn't seem directly addressed to government officials.\n\nC. Middle-class college students: This seems plausible, given the SDS affiliation and the reflective tone about growing up with American values and becoming activists.\n\nD. Factory workers: There's no direct mention of labor issues or factory workers in the passage.\n\nAdditionally, the Port Huron Statement was authored by Tom Hayden, who was a student at the University of Michigan, and it was intended to be a manifesto for the SDS, which was a student organization. So, it makes sense that the primary audience would be middle-class college students who might identify with the values and concerns expressed in the statement.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C. middle-class college students.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
