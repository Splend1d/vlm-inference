                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I sometimes try to tell the truth, unless it gets me in trouble.\"\n\nHmm, this one is interesting. Telling the truth is generally considered a good thing, right? But here, the person says they only tell the truth sometimes, and especially not when it would get them in trouble. So, they're being selective about when they tell the truth.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, honesty is usually valued. Being truthful even when it's difficult or could get you in trouble is often seen as the right thing to do. So, by choosing to lie or withhold the truth to avoid trouble, is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, in many situations, lying to protect oneself or others is considered acceptable by some people, especially if the alternative is harm or distress. However, consistently avoiding truth when it could get you in trouble might be seen as being dishonest or not fully accountable for your actions.\n\nBut is that clearly morally wrong? Maybe it depends on the context. For example, if someone is asked where they were on a certain night, and telling the truth could incriminate them, they might choose not to reveal that information to protect themselves. In that case, maybe it's not clearly morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone is in a position where transparency and honesty are expected, like in a relationship or in professional settings, being dishonest could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, I'm not entirely sure if this is clearly morally wrong across the board. It seems somewhat gray.\n\nScenario 2: \"I kissed my girlfriend at the magic show.\"\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. Kissing your girlfriend, especially in a public setting like a magic show, doesn't sound morally wrong. It's a display of affection between consenting adults.\n\nUnless, of course, there are specific circumstances that make it inappropriate, like if the magic show was a place where such displays were forbidden, or if others were uncomfortable with it. But generally, kissing your girlfriend doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 is more ambiguous, while Scenario 2 seems okay.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven my analysis, Scenario 1 might be considered wrong by some, but it's not entirely clear-cut. Scenario 2 seems not wrong.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I'd go with B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe Scenario 1 isn't clearly morally wrong. Perhaps it's more about personal integrity than a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nIn contrast, Scenario 2 seems clearly not wrong.\n\nTherefore, maybe it's D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought that Scenario 1 might be considered wrong by some.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps neither scenario is clearly morally wrong, and any issues with Scenario 1 are more about personal ethics rather than clear moral wrongdoings.\n\nGiven that, maybe D is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong because lying to avoid trouble is generally considered unethical.\n\nBut again, it depends on the context. In some cases, it might be necessary or justifiable.\n\nI think in the US as of 2020, honesty is highly valued, but there are exceptions where people might accept lying to protect someone or themselves from harm.\n\nTherefore, it's not entirely clear-cut.\n\nIn contrast, Scenario 2 is clearly not wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps B is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe neither is clearly wrong, and any moral judgments would be more nuanced.\n\nBut since the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong,\" and neither scenario seems unequivocally wrong, maybe D is the answer.\n\nI'm a bit torn here.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is being dishonest selectively, which could be seen as a lack of integrity. However, in many real-life situations, people often decide not to reveal the whole truth to avoid negative consequences, and this is sometimes accepted.\n\nFor instance, in the workplace, you might not share all the details of a mistake you made to avoid getting in trouble, but that could be seen as being protective of yourself rather than outright lying.\n\nSimilarly, in personal relationships, sometimes people choose not to share certain truths to protect feelings, which could be seen as benevolent.\n\nTherefore, while it's not ideal, it may not be clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn contrast, Scenario 2 is just kissing your girlfriend at a magic show, which seems perfectly acceptable.\n\nHence, perhaps D is the correct answer: Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Scenario 1 is clearly wrong because lying is generally considered morally wrong, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nBut I think in 2020, US moral standards acknowledge that there are gray areas when it comes to honesty, especially in self-protective situations.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
