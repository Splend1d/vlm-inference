The options are Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, Joan Baez, and Peter Yarrow.\n\nFirst, I know that Bob Dylan is a very famous folksinger who was active in the 1960s. He wrote a lot of protest songs and was involved in the civil rights movement. But I'm not sure if he founded any institute related to non-violence.\n\nWoody Guthrie is another iconic figure in folk music. He wrote \"This Land Is Your Land\" and was known for his political activism. However, I don't recall him founding any institute specifically for the study of non-violence.\n\nJoan Baez is also a prominent folksinger who was very involved in the civil rights and anti-war movements. She was a friend of Martin Luther King Jr. and was known for her support of non-violent activism. Maybe she founded such an institute?\n\nPeter Yarrow is part of the folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary. They were known for their folk songs with social messages, but I don't think he founded an institute for the study of non-violence.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe it was Martin Luther King Jr. who founded something like that, but he's not listed here. Wait, but the question specifies a folksinger.\n\nI recall that Joan Baez was closely associated with Martin Luther King Jr. and was involved in non-violent protest training. In fact, I think she was involved in setting up workshops on non-violence.\n\nLet me check what I can remember about the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence. I think it was founded in 1965, and it was aimed at training activists in non-violent protest techniques.\n\nGiven that Joan Baez was very involved in the civil rights movement and was a close associate of Martin Luther King Jr., it makes sense that she would be the one to found such an institute.\n\nBob Dylan, while very influential, was more known for his songwriting and less for founding organizations. Woody Guthrie was more of a songwriter and less involved in organizing institutes. Peter Yarrow, again, was part of a folk group that promoted social messages but didn't founder any known institutes.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. Joan Baez.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
