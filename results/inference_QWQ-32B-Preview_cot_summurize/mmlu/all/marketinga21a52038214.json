Brand loyalty, B. Brand mark, C. Trade name, D. Trademark.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means and how they relate to owning a brand.\n\nStarting with A, brand loyalty. That's when customers prefer a particular brand and keep buying from it. It's more about customer behavior and preference, not about legal rights to use a brand. So, probably not the answer.\n\nOption B, brand mark. I think a brand mark is like a symbol or design that represents a brand. For example, the Nike swoosh. But does having a brand mark give exclusive rights to use it by law? I'm not sure. Maybe related, but perhaps not directly the answer.\n\nOption C, trade name. A trade name is the name a business operates under. It's like the name you see on a store sign or in advertisements. But is it something that gives exclusive rights by law? I think trade names can be protected, but I'm not entirely sure how that works.\n\nOption D, trademark. I've heard about trademarks before. They are signs or symbols that represent a company or product and are legally registered to prevent others from using them. So, this seems like it could be the answer.\n\nLet me think again. The question is about exclusive rights by law to use a brand. A brand can include things like the name, logo, symbol, etc., that identify a product or company.\n\nBrand loyalty is about customer attachment, not legal rights.\n\nA brand mark seems like it could be part of a trademark, but maybe not the same thing.\n\nA trade name is the name of the business, which might be protected, but again, not sure if that's the same as having exclusive rights by law.\n\nA trademark, though, is specifically designed to give the owner exclusive rights to use certain\u6807\u8bc6 in commerce, to identify their goods or services.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D, trademark.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider each option again.\n\nA. Brand loyalty: No, that's about customer behavior, not legal rights.\n\nB. Brand mark: This might be part of a trademark, but perhaps not the same as the legal protection.\n\nC. Trade name: While trade names can be protected under trademark law, the term \"trade name\" might not specifically imply the exclusive rights granted by law.\n\nD. Trademark: This is the legal registration that gives exclusive rights to use a particular mark or name in connection with goods or services.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D. Trademark.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
