                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage from Maximilien Robespierre, a key figure during the French Revolution. He's talking about the purity of the French Revolution and how it brings both strength and weakness. The strength comes from having public interest override private interests, which sounds pretty noble. But the weakness is that it rallies all the \"vicious men\" against them. So, there's this sense of being under threat from internal and external enemies.\n\nRobespierre then says that to protect the Republic, they must either smother these enemies or perish with it. He argues that the first maxim of their policy should be to guide the people through reason and the enemies through terror. He defines terror as \"justice, prompt, severe, inflexible,\" and sees it as an expression of virtue, specifically as a consequence of democratic principles applied to the country's urgent needs.\n\nNow, the question is asking which political principle this passage articulates. The options are:\n\nA. \"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\" - This is a Marxist principle about distribution and work, which doesn't seem directly related to Robespierre's discussion about terror and public versus private interests.\n\nB. \"Might makes right\" - This is a principle suggesting that whatever is powerful is therefore good or just. Robespierre is arguing that terror, which is a form of power, is justified because it's an expression of virtue and democracy. So, this seems plausible.\n\nC. \"The end justifies the means\" - This is a principle where the desired outcome justifies any method, even unethical ones. Robespierre is arguing that terror is necessary to protect the Republic, suggesting that the ends (protecting the public interest and the Republic) justify the means (terror).\n\nD. \"The government is best that governs least\" - This is a libertarian or minimal state principle, which contradicts Robespierre's emphasis on active government intervention through terror to protect public interest.\n\nGiven this analysis, options A and D seem less fitting. Option A because it's about economic distribution, and option D because it advocates for minimal government, whereas Robespierre is advocating for strong governmental action.\n\nBetween options B and C, both could potentially apply. \"Might makes right\" aligns with the use of terror as a form of power justified by virtue and democracy. \"The end justifies the means\" is also applicable because Robespierre is arguing that the necessity of protecting the Republic justifies the use of terror.\n\nHowever, \"the end justifies the means\" might be a better fit because Robespierre is explicitly stating that terror is necessary to achieve the end goal of preserving the Republic and public interest. He's justifying severe measures based on the urgency and importance of the ends they serve.\n\n\"Might makes right\" is more about the inherent goodness of power, whereas Robespierre is using power (terror) as a means to achieve what he sees as a virtuous end. So, while there is an element of power in his argument, the focus is more on the justification of means through the ends they serve.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the passage most directly articulates the principle that \"the end justifies the means.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
