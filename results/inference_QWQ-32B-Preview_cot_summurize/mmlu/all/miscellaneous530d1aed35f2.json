IRS.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is an investment account that most people would know about.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these options represents.\n\nA. CNN: I know CNN is a news network. It stands for Cable News Network. It's where people go to get news and information. So, it's not an investment account; it's a media company.\n\nB. EMC: EMC isn't ringing any bells for me. I think it might stand for something specific, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a type of company or a service, but I don't think it's an investment account.\n\nC. IRA: IRA sounds familiar. I think IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account. From what I recall, it's a type of savings account for retirement that offers some tax advantages. So, it seems like an investment account.\n\nD. IRS: IRS is the Internal Revenue Service. It's a government agency responsible for collecting taxes and administering the tax code in the United States. So, it's not an investment account; it's a government body.\n\nBased on this, it seems like IRA is the only option that represents an investment account. CNN is a news network, EMC is unclear to me, and IRS is a government agency.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check what EMC stands for. Maybe it is an investment account that I'm not familiar with. Let me think about it. EMC could stand for different things depending on the context. In some cases, it might refer to a type of storage company or something else, but I don't think it's related to investment accounts.\n\nOn the other hand, IRA is definitely an investment account. It's designed for individuals to save for retirement, and it can hold various investment products like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.\n\nSo, considering that, the answer should be C. IRA.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any of the other options could be investment accounts. But CNN is clearly a media company, and IRS is a government agency. Unless there's some obscure meaning I'm missing, IRA is the only plausible investment account among the options.\n\nTherefore, the commonly-known investment account here is IRA, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
