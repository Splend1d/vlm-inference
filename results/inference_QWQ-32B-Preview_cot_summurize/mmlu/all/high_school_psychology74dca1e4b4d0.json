                    "text": "Let's think about this scenario with my little cousin. So, he watches me at the computer, and as soon as I get up, he goes straight for the keyboard. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: superstition. Superstition is belief in supernatural causes for events. Does my cousin believe that using the keyboard will bring good luck or something like that? Nah, that doesn't seem likely. He's probably just curious about what I was doing.\n\nOption B is classical conditioning. That's where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus, eliciting a response. For example, if every time I use the computer, there's a specific sound or light, and he associates that with the computer, maybe. But in this case, it's not clear what the neutral stimulus is that's been paired with the computer usage.\n\nOption C is operant aversive conditioning. Operant conditioning involves rewards and punishments to shape behavior. Aversive conditioning specifically uses punishment to reduce a behavior. Is my cousin being punished or rewarded for using the keyboard? If he uses the keyboard and gets scolded, that might be aversive. But the question is about why he tries to use it when I'm not there, so it's not directly clear.\n\nOption D is modeling. Modeling is when someone observes and imitates another's behavior. So, if my cousin sees me using the computer and wants to do what I do, that makes sense. He's copying my behavior because he sees me interacting with the keyboard.\n\nLet me think about this again. When I'm at the computer, he watches me, and as soon as I leave, he goes for the keyboard. It seems like he's interested in what I was doing and wants to replicate it. That sounds a lot like imitation, which is a key aspect of modeling.\n\nAlso, consider that young children learn a lot through observation and imitation. They see adults and older children doing things and try to do the same, even if they don't fully understand what they're doing. So, in this case, my cousin is likely modeling his behavior after mine.\n\nLet's compare this to the other options again. Superstition doesn't fit because there's no indication of supernatural beliefs. Classical conditioning might be a stretch unless there's some specific stimulus that's always present when I use the computer, which isn't mentioned. Operant conditioning would involve some consequence for his behavior, but in this scenario, he's just trying to use the keyboard when I'm not there; we don't know about any rewards or punishments related to that action.\n\nTherefore, modeling seems to be the most straightforward explanation for his behavior. He's observed me using the computer and is trying to do the same thing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
