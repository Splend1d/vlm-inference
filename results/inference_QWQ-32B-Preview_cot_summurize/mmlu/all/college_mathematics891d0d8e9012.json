                    "text": "So I have this problem: I need to find the units digit of 7 raised to the 25th power. The options are A. 1, B. 3, C. 5, and D. 7. I'm not super confident with exponents, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I know that the units digit is the rightmost digit of a number. So, for example, in 7, the units digit is 7. When I square 7, which is 7 to the power of 2, I get 49, and the units digit there is 9. If I do 7 cubed, that's 7 times 49, which is 343, and the units digit is 3. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check: 7 times 7 is 49, and 49 times 7 is 343. Yes, units digit is 3.\n\nOkay, so let's see a pattern here. Let me list out some powers of 7 and see what their units digits are.\n\n7^1 = 7, units digit is 7.\n\n7^2 = 49, units digit is 9.\n\n7^3 = 343, units digit is 3.\n\n7^4 = 2401, units digit is 1.\n\n7^5 = 16807, units digit is 7.\n\nHmm, interesting. I see a pattern here: 7, 9, 3, 1, and then it repeats with 7 again.\n\nSo, it seems like every 4 powers, the units digit cycles back to 7.\n\nSo, the pattern is: 7, 9, 3, 1, and repeats.\n\nSo, to find the units digit of 7^25, I need to see where 25 falls in this cycle.\n\nSince the cycle repeats every 4 powers, I can divide 25 by 4 and see what the remainder is.\n\n25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1.\n\nA remainder of 1 means that 7^25 has the same units digit as 7^1, which is 7.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I understand this. If the exponent is 1 more than a multiple of 4, the units digit is 7. If it's 2 more, it's 9, and so on.\n\nSo, 25 divided by 4 is 6 times 4 is 24, plus a remainder of 1, so it's like 7^1, which is 7.\n\nBut let's check another way. Let's see 7^4 is 2401, units digit 1.\n\n7^5 is 16807, units digit 7.\n\n7^6 is 117649, units digit 9.\n\n7^7 is 823543, units digit 3.\n\n7^8 is 5764801, units digit 1.\n\nAgain, the pattern repeats every 4 exponents.\n\nSo, for exponent 25, which is 4*6 +1, it should have the same units digit as 7^1, which is 7.\n\nAlternatively, exponent 24 would be like 7^4, units digit 1, and 7^25 would be 1 times 7, which is 7.\n\nSo, yes, the units digit should be 7.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, D is 7.\n\nBut the other options are 1, 3, and 5.\n\nBut according to my reasoning, it should be 7.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation for 7^3, I got 343, which ends with 3, and 7^4 is 2401, ends with 1, and 7^5 is 16807, ends with 7, and so on.\n\nSo, every 4th power, it cycles back to 1, and then to 7 again.\n\nSo, indeed, 7^25 should have the same units digit as 7^1, which is 7.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of exponents in mod 4.\n\nThe exponent 25 mod 4 is 1, so it's equivalent to 7^1.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 7.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check another exponent.\n\nLet's see 7^9. 9 divided by 4 is 2 remainder 1, so should be like 7^1, which is 7.\n\nCalculating 7^9: 7^8 is 5764801, times 7 is 40353607, which ends with 7.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, 7^10 should be like 7^2, which is 9.\n\nCalculating 7^10: 40353607 times 7 is 282475249, which ends with 9.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the pattern holds.\n\nTherefore, for 7^25, the units digit is 7.\n\nBut wait, the options include 1, 3, 5, and 7, and according to my reasoning, it's 7.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to think about it.\n\nI recall that for units digits, you can just look at the units digit of the base and see how it behaves when raised to different exponents.\n\nSo, for 7, the pattern is 7, 9, 3, 1, and repeats.\n\nSo, the cycle length is 4.\n\nTo find the units digit of 7^25, I can find 25 mod 4.\n\n25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1, so it's equivalent to 7^1.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 7.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that any power of 7 that is a multiple of 4 will end with 1, and then the next power will end with 7.\n\nSince 24 is a multiple of 4, 7^24 ends with 1, and 7^25 is 7^24 times 7, which is 1*7=7, so units digit is 7.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 7.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should check one more exponent.\n\nLet's see 7^13. 13 divided by 4 is 3 remainder 1, so should be like 7^1, which is 7.\n\nCalculating 7^13: that's a big number, but according to the pattern, it should end with 7.\n\nSimilarly, 7^17 should end with 7, and so on.\n\nYes, the pattern holds.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the units digit of 7^25 is 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
