Johann Strauss I, also known as the \"Father of the Waltz,\" and his sons, Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss, were prominent composers of Viennese waltzes in the 19th century. Johann Strauss II, in particular, is famous for compositions like \"The Blue Danube\" and \"Tales from the Vienna Woods,\" which exemplify the graceful and melodic characteristics of the waltz.\n\nWhile the tango originated in Argentina and Uruguay, the fox-trot was popularized in the early 20th century, and square dancing has its roots in traditional English and French folk dances, it is the waltz that the Strauss family is most renowned for promoting and perfecting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. waltz."
