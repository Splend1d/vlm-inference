                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and I need to figure out which statement is true about protons and neutrons regarding their angular momentum. Let's see what each option is saying.\n\nOption A says that both protons and neutrons have orbital and spin angular momentum. Option B says that protons have both orbital and spin, but neutrons only have spin. Option C says that both have only orbital angular momentum, and Option D says that both have only spin angular momentum.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what angular momentum means in the context of subatomic particles. Angular momentum can be of two types: orbital and spin. Orbital angular momentum comes from the motion of the particle around some point, like how the Earth orbits the Sun. Spin angular momentum, on the other hand, is an intrinsic property of the particle, like the Earth spinning on its axis.\n\nNow, protons and neutrons are subatomic particles found in the nucleus of an atom. They are composed of even smaller particles called quarks, which are held together by the strong nuclear force.\n\nLet's think about protons first. Protons are known to have spin angular momentum. In fact, all fermions, which include protons, have half-integer spin values. For protons, the spin is 1/2. But do they also have orbital angular momentum?\n\nIn the context of atomic physics, electrons in an atom can have both orbital and spin angular momentum because they orbit the nucleus. However, protons and neutrons are inside the nucleus, and the concept of orbital angular momentum for them is different. In the nucleus, protons and neutrons are bound together in a quantum mechanical system, and their motion is described by wave functions rather than classical orbits.\n\nSo, do protons and neutrons have orbital angular momentum within the nucleus? The answer is yes, they can have orbital angular momentum relative to each other as they move within the nucleus. This is similar to how electrons have orbital angular momentum around the nucleus in an atom.\n\nNow, what about spin angular momentum? As I mentioned earlier, both protons and neutrons are fermions and have intrinsic spin of 1/2.\n\nSo, summarizing for protons: they have both orbital and spin angular momentum.\n\nWhat about neutrons? Neutrons are also fermions with spin 1/2, so they have spin angular momentum. Do they have orbital angular momentum within the nucleus? Just like protons, neutrons also move within the nucleus and can have orbital angular momentum.\n\nTherefore, both protons and neutrons have both orbital and spin angular momentum.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Protons and neutrons have orbital and spin angular momentum.\n\nB. Protons have orbital and spin angular momentum, neutrons have spin angular momentum.\n\nC. Protons and neutrons possess orbital angular momentum only.\n\nD. Protons and neutrons possess spin angular momentum only.\n\nBased on what I've just reasoned, Option A seems to be the correct statement.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any scenario where neutrons would only have spin angular momentum and not orbital angular momentum? In some models, perhaps in certain energy states, the orbital angular momentum could be zero, but in general, particles within the nucleus do have orbital motion.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be about general properties, not specific energy states. So, generally speaking, both protons and neutrons have both types of angular momentum.\n\nTherefore, I think Option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
