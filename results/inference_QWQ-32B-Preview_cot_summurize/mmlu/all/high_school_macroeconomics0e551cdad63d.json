                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about shifting the demand curve for the Mexican peso. I need to figure out which option will cause the demand curve to shift to the left. First, I should recall what a demand curve represents in the context of foreign exchange markets.\n\nThe demand curve for a currency shows how much of that currency is demanded at different exchange rates. Shifting the demand curve to the left means that, at any given exchange rate, less of the currency is being demanded.\n\nOkay, so let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Speculation that the peso will increase in value.\n\nIf people speculate that the peso will increase in value, they might want to buy more pesos now to sell them later at a higher price. This would actually increase the demand for pesos, shifting the demand curve to the right, not left. So, this doesn't seem to be the answer.\n\nOption B: An increase in interest rates in Mexico relative to other countries.\n\nHigher interest rates in Mexico would make investing in Mexican assets more attractive. This would likely increase the demand for pesos as foreign investors seek to take advantage of higher returns. Again, this would shift the demand curve to the right.\n\nOption C: A lower rate of inflation in Mexico relative to other countries.\n\nIf Mexico has lower inflation compared to other countries, its goods become relatively cheaper. This could increase the demand for Mexican exports, which would in turn increase the demand for pesos from foreign buyers. Once again, this seems to shift the demand curve to the right.\n\nOption D: A decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles.\n\nIf there's a decrease in the international demand for Mexican textiles, this means that foreign buyers will be purchasing less of these goods. Since they would need fewer pesos to buy these textiles, the demand for pesos would decrease. This would shift the demand curve for pesos to the left.\n\nWait a minute, let me think about this again. If fewer textiles are being bought, that means less need for pesos, which should decrease demand. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nComparing all the options, only option D seems to cause a leftward shift in the demand curve for pesos. The other options all seem to increase demand, shifting the curve to the right.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. A decrease in the international demand for Mexican-made textiles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
