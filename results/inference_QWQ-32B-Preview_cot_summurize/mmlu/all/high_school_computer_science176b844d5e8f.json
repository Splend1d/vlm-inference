Python follows the standard mathematical order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS:\n\n- Parentheses\n\n- Exponents\n\n- Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n\n- Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\nIn this expression, we have addition (`+`) and the modulo operator (`%`). According to PEMDAS, modulo operations are performed before addition.\n\nSo, I should first calculate `3 % 3`, and then add 1 to the result.\n\nLet's compute `3 % 3`:\n\nThe modulo operator returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. So, 3 divided by 3 is 1 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, `3 % 3` equals 0.\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression:\n\n`1 + 0`\n\nThis simplifies to 1.\n\nSo, the value of the expression `1 + 3 % 3` is 1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 1\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 4\n\nThe correct answer is B. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
