Let's think this through.\n\nFirst, I know that Marx wrote some important books like \"Das Kapital\" and \"The Communist Manifesto.\" Maybe knowing where these books were written could help me figure out his nationality.\n\nI think \"The Communist Manifesto\" was written in Germany, but I'm not entirely sure. Also, I recall that Marx spent a lot of time in England, maybe in London. Perhaps he was English?\n\nWait, no, I think he was exiled to England. So maybe he wasn't English by birth. Let me check what I know about his early life.\n\nI believe Marx was born in Germany. His full name is Karl Heinrich Marx, which sounds very German. So, maybe he was German?\n\nBut then again, he spent a significant part of his life in England, so maybe he took British citizenship or something. I'm not sure about that.\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nA. Russian - I don't think Marx was Russian. Russian thinkers like Lenin and Trotsky come to mind, but Marx doesn't seem Russian to me.\n\nB. German - That seems plausible. As I thought earlier, his name sounds German, and he was born there.\n\nC. Danish - Hmm, I don't recall any connection between Marx and Denmark.\n\nD. English - He lived in England for a long time, but was he English by nationality?\n\nI think the key here is to distinguish between where someone was born and where they lived. Nationality usually refers to the country of birth or citizenship.\n\nGiven that, Marx was born in Germany, so his nationality should be German, even if he lived in England for a significant part of his life.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should consider if he naturalized as British or not. I don't think he did. Marx faced exile in England, but I don't recall any information about him becoming a British citizen.\n\nTherefore, his nationality remains German.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. German.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
