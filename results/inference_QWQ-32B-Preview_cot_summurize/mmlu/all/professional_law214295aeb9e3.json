                    "text": "So Billy was charged with grand theft, and there was this trial that started on a Thursday afternoon. The jury was picked and sworn in, but they were let go for the day. Then, because Friday was the Fourth of July, the judge told them to come back on Monday. So, the trial resumed on Monday morning at 8:30. By late evening, the judge had finished instructing the jury. Because it was late, the jurors were kept together for the evening so they could start early the next morning.\n\nThey came back Tuesday morning and couldn't reach a verdict. Since they couldn't decide, the trial judge let them go home that evening. Then, on Wednesday morning, the jury got together again and returned a guilty verdict.\n\nNow, Billy is appealing, and we need to figure out which of these issues is his strongest argument for reversing the verdict:\n\nA. That the jurors didn't start considering the evidence until several days after they were empaneled.\n\nB. That the jury was allowed to go home after they were sworn in.\n\nC. That the jury took several days to return a verdict.\n\nD. That the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what does it mean to be \"empaneled\"? It means that the jurors were selected and sworn in to serve on the jury for this particular trial.\n\nSo, on Thursday, they were empaneled and sworn in, but didn't start hearing evidence yet. They were dismissed for the day, and then the trial started again on Monday morning.\n\nOption A says that the jurors didn't begin to consider evidence until several days after they were empaneled. Is this a problem? Well, there might be some argument about delay affecting their memory or something, but in practice, jurors are often selected a few days before the trial starts, especially in serious cases. So, this might not be a strong argument.\n\nOption B says that the jury was allowed to go home after they were sworn in. Again, this seems pretty standard. Juries are often sworn in and then released until the trial begins. So, this doesn't seem like a significant issue.\n\nOption C is that the jury took several days to return a verdict. Well, some trials can take much longer, and the time it takes to deliberate is generally up to the jury. As long as they're not rushed or unduly influenced, the length of time shouldn't be a problem.\n\nOption D is that the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations. Hmm, this might be more problematic. Once deliberations begin, there are rules about sequestration and ensuring that the jury doesn't get influenced externally.\n\nLet's look back at the timeline:\n\n- Trial starts Monday morning, instructions are given by late evening.\n\n- Jurors are sequestered for the evening to start early the next morning.\n\n- They come back Tuesday morning, can't reach a verdict, and are allowed to go home that evening.\n\n- On Wednesday morning, they assemble again and return a guilty verdict.\n\nSo, after starting deliberations on Monday evening, they were sequestered until Tuesday morning. Then, after another day of deliberations on Tuesday, they were allowed to go home even though they hadn't reached a verdict.\n\nIs this allowed? In some jurisdictions, juries are sequestered during deliberations, especially in high-profile or sensitive cases, to prevent external influences. However, in many cases, juries are allowed to go home if they can't reach a verdict by the end of the day, as long as they're instructed not to discuss the case or seek outside information.\n\nBut there might be concerns about the jury being influenced over night or about the continuity of their deliberations.\n\nComparing options A, B, C, and D, option D seems to be the most potentially problematic because it involves the jury being allowed to go home in the middle of their deliberations.\n\nPerhaps Billy's attorney could argue that allowing the jury to separate after they had begun deliberations could have led to external influences or improper communications, which could have affected the verdict.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C seem like normal parts of the trial process.\n\nTherefore, Billy's strongest issue for seeking a reversal would likely be option D: the fact that the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
