                    "text": "Let's see what an MSA is. I remember that MSA stands for Metropolitan Statistical Area, and it's used to define regions that have a certain level of urbanization and population density. So, option A says it includes only the 10 largest cities in the United States. That doesn't sound right because MSAs are used for many more areas than just the top 10 cities.\n\nOption B mentions that it's composed of at least one central city with a population of at least 50,000 and surrounds densely urbanized counties. That sounds plausible. I think MSAs are defined based on central cities and the surrounding areas that are economically integrated with them.\n\nOption C says it's an area that experiences strong storms at least 50% of the year. That doesn't make sense. MSAs are about population and economic activity, not weather patterns.\n\nOption D mentions a large city with a population of at least 1 million and is immediately surrounded by suburbs. Well, some MSAs do have large cities, but the threshold is actually lower than 1 million. I think the standard is closer to 50,000, as mentioned in option B.\n\nSo, between options B and D, B seems more accurate because it has a lower population threshold and mentions densely urbanized counties, which aligns with how MSAs are defined.\n\nLet me double-check. I recall that MSAs are defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and they are used by various agencies like the Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics to report data.\n\nThe current definition, as per OMB, requires a central city with a population of at least 50,000, and the surrounding counties must have a high degree of social and economic integration with the central city, as measured by commuting patterns.\n\nSo, option B is correct in mentioning a central city with at least 50,000 population and surrounding densely urbanized counties.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the population threshold is higher than what's required for an MSA.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
