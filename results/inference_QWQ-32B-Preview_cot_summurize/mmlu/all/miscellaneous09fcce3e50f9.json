I know that atomic mass refers to the total mass of protons and neutrons in an atom's nucleus.\n\nFirst, I should recall the approximate atomic masses of these elements or think about their positions in the periodic table, since atomic mass generally increases as you move from left to right and from top to bottom.\n\nHelium is a light element. It's in group 18, period 1. Its atomic number is 2, so it has 2 protons and usually 2 neutrons, making its atomic mass about 4 atomic mass units (amu).\n\nSodium is in group 1, period 3. Its atomic number is 11, so it has 11 protons. The atomic mass of sodium is around 23 amu.\n\nUranium is a heavy element in group 3, period 7. Its atomic number is 92, with 92 protons. Uranium has a much higher atomic mass, approximately 238 amu.\n\nCopper is in group 11, period 4. Its atomic number is 29, so it has 29 protons. The atomic mass of copper is about 64 amu.\n\nComparing these values:\n\n- Helium: about 4 amu\n\n- Sodium: about 23 amu\n\n- Uranium: about 238 amu\n\n- Copper: about 64 amu\n\nClearly, Uranium has the highest atomic mass among these options.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember the exact atomic masses, I could have considered the periodic table's structure. Elements towards the bottom right have higher atomic numbers and thus generally higher atomic masses. Uranium is one of the heaviest naturally occurring elements, so it makes sense that it would have the highest atomic mass here.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Uranium.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
