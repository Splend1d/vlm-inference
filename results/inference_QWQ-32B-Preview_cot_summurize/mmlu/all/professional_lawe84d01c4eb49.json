                    "text": "So here's this scenario: a kid is playing with a ball in his front yard, throws it too hard, and accidentally hits a neighbor's new car. The neighbor gets really angry and threatens to kill the kid. The kid runs inside and tells his mom what happened. The kid isn't too upset, but the mom has a major emotional breakdown and needs months of therapy to recover. Now, if the mom sues the neighbor for the mental anguish she suffered, what's going to happen?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. She recovers, even though she wasn't there when the threat was made.\n\nB. She recovers, because she wouldn't have suffered the emotional trauma if not for the neighbor's threat to her child's life.\n\nC. She doesn't recover, because she wasn't present when the threat was made.\n\nD. She doesn't recover, because the neighbor didn't touch her child.\n\nHmm. This seems like a case involving intentional infliction of emotional distress or something similar. I need to think about the legal principles here.\n\nFirst, for someone to be liable for emotional distress, generally, there needs to be some wrongdoing on their part, like intentional or reckless conduct that causes severe emotional harm to another person.\n\nIn this case, the neighbor threatened to kill the child, which is certainly intentional and reckless behavior. Now, the question is, did this conduct cause emotional distress to the mom?\n\nWell, it seems like it did. The mom had an emotional breakdown and needed therapy, which suggests that she suffered severe emotional harm.\n\nBut here's the thing: she wasn't present when the threat was made. The threat was made to the child, and the child came and told her about it later.\n\nSo, is the neighbor liable for the mom's emotional distress even though he didn't make the threat directly to her and she wasn't there when it happened?\n\nThis is where it gets a bit tricky.\n\nIn law, there's a concept called \"bystander liability\" or \"third-party liability\" for emotional distress. This is when someone is liable for emotional distress caused to a person who is not the direct target of their conduct but is closely related to the direct target.\n\nIn this case, the mom is closely related to the direct target, which is her child. So, it's possible that the neighbor could be liable for the mom's emotional distress.\n\nBut, there are usually some requirements for this kind of liability to apply. For example, the relationship between the direct target and the person suffering emotional distress needs to be close, like parent and child, spouse, etc.\n\nAlso, the person suffering emotional distress usually needs to have witnessed the harmful event or heard about it shortly after it happened.\n\nIn this scenario, the mom wasn't present when the threat was made, but she heard about it immediately from her child. So, perhaps that's close enough.\n\nAdditionally, the emotional distress has to be reasonably foreseeable as a result of the defendant's conduct. In other words, the neighbor should have realized that threatening the child could cause emotional harm to the mom.\n\nGiven that, it seems plausible that the neighbor could be liable for the mom's emotional distress.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA says she recovers even though she wasn't present when the threat was made. That seems possible, given the bystander liability concept.\n\nB says she recovers because she wouldn't have suffered the emotional trauma had it not been for the neighbor's threat to her child's life. That also makes sense, as there's a direct causal link between the threat and her emotional distress.\n\nC says she doesn't recover because she wasn't present when the threat was made. But, as per bystander liability, presence isn't always required, especially if she's closely related to the direct victim.\n\nD says she doesn't recover because the neighbor didn't touch her child. But, in this case, it's not about physical contact; it's about the threat and the emotional impact it had on the mom.\n\nSo, between A and B, both seem plausible. Maybe they're just rephrasing the same thing.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is both A and B, but since it's a multiple-choice question, I have to pick one.\n\nPerhaps the most direct answer is B, because it explains the causal relationship between the threat and the mom's emotional distress.\n\nBut A also makes sense, emphasizing that she wasn't present when the threat was made, yet she can still recover.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the law is such that she can't recover because she wasn't present, in which case C would be the answer.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, given the bystander liability principles.\n\nOr maybe D, but again, the lack of physical contact doesn't necessarily preclude emotional distress claims.\n\nI think the key here is whether the mom can recover for emotional distress even though she wasn't present when the threat was made.\n\nGiven that the threat was made to her child, and she heard about it immediately, causing her severe emotional harm, it's possible that she can recover.\n\nTherefore, options A and B seem more appropriate than C and D.\n\nBetween A and B, I think B explains better why she can recover: because the neighbor's threat to her child's life caused her emotional trauma.\n\nSo, I'm going with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
