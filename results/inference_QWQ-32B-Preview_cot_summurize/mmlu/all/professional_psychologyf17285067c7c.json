                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Rosenhan's research on pseudopatients in psychiatric hospitals. So, Rosenhan did this famous study where he and some associates pretended to have mental illnesses to get admitted into psychiatric hospitals. Then, once inside, they behaved normally, but the staff still kept treating them as if they were mentally ill.\n\nOkay, so the question is asking which of these options best describes what Rosenhan's research demonstrated. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"confirmed that participation in a research study alters the behavior of research participants.\" Hmm, that's interesting. In this case, the pseudopatients did alter their behavior to some extent because they pretended to have auditory hallucinations to get admitted. But once inside, they behaved normally. So, while their initial behavior was altered to feign symptoms, afterward, they behaved naturally. So, this option seems a bit too broad. It's not just about altering behavior in general but specifically about how their behavior was perceived despite acting normally.\n\nOption B: \"demonstrated that labeling a person changes the person's behavior.\" This is touching on the idea that once someone is labeled as mentally ill, their behavior might change to conform to that label. While that's an interesting concept related to self-fulfilling prophecies and labels, in Rosenhan's study, the pseudopatients didn't actually change their behavior after admission; they behaved normally. However, the staff continued to interpret their normal behaviors as pathological. So, it's more about how the label affected the perceptions of others rather than changing the individuals' behaviors.\n\nOption C: \"showed that the environment influences how a person's behavior is perceived.\" This seems quite relevant. Rosenhan's study highlighted how the hospital environment and the expectations of the staff colored their interpretations of the pseudopatients' behaviors. Even when the pseudopatients were acting normally, their actions were seen through the lens of their mental illness label. So, the environment\u2014specifically, the psychiatric hospital setting and the professionals' expectations\u2014shaped how their behavior was perceived.\n\nOption D: \"showed that 'central traits' have a greater impact than other traits on impression formation.\" This is referring to a concept in social psychology where certain central traits overshadow other characteristics when forming impressions of people. While that might be generally true, it's not directly what Rosenhan's study was about. His study was more about the power of labels and environments in shaping perceptions, rather than the impact of specific traits on impression formation.\n\nComparing these options, option C seems to capture the essence of Rosenhan's findings most accurately. The study demonstrated how the hospital environment and the preconceptions of the staff influenced their perceptions of the pseudopatients' behavior, seeing pathology where there was none.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C: \"showed that the environment influences how a person's behavior is perceived.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
