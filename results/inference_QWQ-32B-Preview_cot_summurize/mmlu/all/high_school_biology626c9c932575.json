                    "text": "I've got this question here about DNA sequences in humans and chimpanzees, and it says they're very similar. The question is asking for the most likely explanation of why that is. There are four options:\n\nA. Humans evolved from chimpanzees millions of years ago.\n\nB. Chimpanzees evolved from humans millions of years ago.\n\nC. Humans and chimpanzees evolved from a recent common ancestor\u2014about 6 million years ago.\n\nD. Humans and chimpanzees evolved from a distant common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about evolution and common ancestors. I remember that all living things share some degree of genetic similarity because we all evolved from common ancestors at some point. But the degree of similarity can tell us how recently two species shared a common ancestor.\n\nOption A says humans evolved from chimpanzees millions of years ago. That doesn't sound right because humans and chimpanzees are both descendants of a common ancestor, but neither evolved directly from the other. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B says chimpanzees evolved from humans millions of years ago. Again, similar to A, it's not accurate because humans didn't give rise to chimpanzees. We both have a shared ancestor.\n\nOption C suggests that humans and chimpanzees evolved from a recent common ancestor, about 6 million years ago. That sounds familiar. I've heard that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor around that time period.\n\nOption D says humans and chimpanzees evolved from a distant common ancestor about 4 billion years ago. That seems way too far back. While it's true that all life on Earth shares a common ancestor billions of years ago, 4 billion years is probably too early. The first life forms appeared around that time, but humans and chimpanzees diverged much more recently.\n\nSo, between C and D, C makes more sense because the DNA sequences are very similar, which suggests a recent common ancestor. If the common ancestor was 4 billion years ago, I'd expect a lot more differences in our DNA.\n\nMoreover, evolutionary biology and molecular clock studies suggest that the human and chimpanzee lineages split around 6 to 8 million years ago. So, option C aligns with that.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is that humans and chimpanzees evolved from a recent common ancestor about 6 million years ago.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
