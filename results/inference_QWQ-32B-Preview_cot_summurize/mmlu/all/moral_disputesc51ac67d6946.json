                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Norcross's view on moral status and rationality. The question is:\n\n\"According to Norcross, any attempt to justify the claim that humans have a higher moral status than other animals by appealing to some version of rationality as the morally relevant difference between humans and animals will\n\nA. fail to give an adequate answer to the argument from marginal cases.\n\nB. fail to make the case that such a difference is morally relevant to the status of animals as moral patients as opposed to their status as moral agents.\n\nC. both A and B\n\nD. neither A nor B\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what Norcross says about this. I remember that Norcross is a philosopher who argues against speciesism, meaning he thinks it's unethical to give preferential treatment to humans solely based on their species membership.\n\nThe argument here seems to be about using rationality as a basis for assigning higher moral status to humans compared to animals. So, if someone says, \"Humans are more rational than animals, therefore humans have higher moral status,\" Norcross might have some objections to that.\n\nOption A mentions the \"argument from marginal cases.\" I think this refers to the idea that there are some humans who have lower levels of rationality than some animals. For example, a severely mentally disabled human might have less rational capacity than a chimpanzee. So, if we base moral status on rationality, it would be inconsistent to give higher status to all humans just because most humans have higher rationality.\n\nNorcross likely points out that this creates a problem for those who want to use rationality as the dividing line between humans and animals in terms of moral status. Therefore, option A seems plausible.\n\nOption B talks about the difference between moral patients and moral agents. Moral agents are those who can make moral decisions and are responsible for their actions, while moral patients are those who can be affected by actions and thus have moral considerations applied to them, regardless of their ability to make moral decisions.\n\nSo, even if humans are generally more rational and thus better moral agents, that doesn't necessarily mean they have higher moral status as patients. In other words, the moral status of an individual as a recipient of moral consideration might not depend on their rationality or agency.\n\nNorcross might argue that characteristics like the ability to suffer or have interests are more relevant to moral patienthood than rationality. Therefore, using rationality to justify higher moral status doesn't address the issue of moral patienthood.\n\nGiven that, option B also seems to be something Norcross would agree with.\n\nSo, if both A and B are correct descriptions of Norcross's view, then the answer should be C, both A and B.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any reason to think that Norcross wouldn't hold one of these views?\n\nWell, Norcross is known for arguing that moral status should be based on characteristics like sentience rather than rationality. So, he would likely agree that rationality is not morally relevant to the status of animals as moral patients.\n\nAlso, the argument from marginal cases is a standard move in animal ethics to challenge speciesist positions, so it's probable that Norcross uses it.\n\nTherefore, it seems that both A and B are correct, making C the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
