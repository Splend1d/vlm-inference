Principle actors are social constructs that are made through political practices.\n\nB. Natural-science methodology is the best way to study social science; interpretive methodologies lack the coherence required for in-depth analysis.\n\nC. Knowledge of the social world is not objective, as there is no divide between the social world and knowledge of that world.\n\nD. The purpose of theory is not explanation in terms of generalizable causal claims, but contextual understanding and practical knowledge.\n\nI need to identify which one is NOT a unifying principle according to Krause.\n\nFirst, I recall that Critical Security Studies (CSS) is an approach that questions traditional notions of security and challenges the status quo. It often draws from various theoretical perspectives to understand security issues more broadly.\n\nKrause is likely Ken Booth or possibly another scholar, but I think in this context, it's Ken Booth who has contributed significantly to CSS.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nOption A: \"Principle actors are social constructs that are made through political practices.\"\n\nThis sounds like it aligns with constructivist approaches in international relations, which argue that identities and interests are shaped through social interactions and practices. So, this seems consistent with critical approaches that question fixed identities.\n\nOption B: \"Natural-science methodology is the best way to study social science; interpretive methodologies lack the coherence required for in-depth analysis.\"\n\nThis seems contrary to critical approaches. Critical security studies often critique positivist methodologies commonly used in natural sciences, arguing that social phenomena require different methods of analysis. Interpretive methodologies are often favored in critical studies because they allow for a deeper understanding of meanings and contexts.\n\nOption C: \"Knowledge of the social world is not objective, as there is no divide between the social world and knowledge of that world.\"\n\nThis reflects a postmodern or critical perspective that knowledge is constructed and influenced by power relations and perspectives. It aligns with the idea that objectivity is a myth in social sciences, which is a common stance in critical security studies.\n\nOption D: \"The purpose of theory is not explanation in terms of generalizable causal claims, but contextual understanding and practical knowledge.\"\n\nAgain, this aligns with critical approaches that emphasize understanding the complexity of social phenomena rather than seeking universal laws. It suggests that theories should be context-specific and aimed at practical applications rather than abstract generalizations.\n\nGiven these reflections, option B seems to be at odds with the principles of critical security studies. It advocates for natural-science methodology in social sciences, which is typically opposed by critical scholars who argue for more interpretive and context-specific methods.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
