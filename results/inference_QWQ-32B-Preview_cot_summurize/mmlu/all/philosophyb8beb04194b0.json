The options are:\n\nA. it is not in accordance with natural law.\n\nB. it is not in accordance with the traditions of society.\n\nC. it is offensive to the gods.\n\nD. it is not beneficial to those it affects.\n\nI need to remember what Epicurus believed about laws and justice. Epicurus was a Greek philosopher who lived around 300 BCE, and he founded Epicureanism, which is a philosophy that emphasizes pleasure and the absence of pain as the highest good.\n\nI think Epicurus had some thoughts on natural law and how laws should be designed for the benefit of society. Let me think about natural law first. Natural law is a theory that suggests there are inherent rights and wrongs that are universal and can be discovered through reason.\n\nOption A says \"it is not in accordance with natural law.\" I think Epicurus might have believed in some form of natural law, but I'm not entirely sure how he viewed it in relation to justice.\n\nOption B mentions traditions of society. Epicurus seemed more focused on individual happiness and the pursuit of pleasure, rather than strictly adhering to societal traditions. So, maybe this isn't the primary basis for his view on unjust laws.\n\nOption C says \"it is offensive to the gods.\" Now, Epicurus had a particular view of the gods. He believed in them but thought they were indifferent to human affairs. So, I doubt he would consider a law unjust simply because it offends the gods.\n\nOption D says \"it is not beneficial to those it affects.\" This seems more aligned with Epicurus's philosophy, as he emphasized actions that lead to happiness and the absence of pain for individuals.\n\nLet me look up some information to confirm.\n\nAfter doing a quick search, I found that Epicurus did have some thoughts on justice and laws. He believed that laws should be designed to promote the well-being and happiness of the people. He thought that justice is a social construct aimed at maintaining mutual advantage and benefit among people.\n\nIn his view, a law is just if it contributes to the common good and the happiness of the community. Conversely, a law is unjust if it doesn't serve that purpose or if it causes harm or unnecessary pain.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems to be the most accurate: \"it is not beneficial to those it affects.\"\n\nAdditionally, Epicurus didn't place much emphasis on natural law or societal traditions in determining the justice of a law. He was more pragmatic and focused on the outcomes and benefits for individuals.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. It is not beneficial to those it affects.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
