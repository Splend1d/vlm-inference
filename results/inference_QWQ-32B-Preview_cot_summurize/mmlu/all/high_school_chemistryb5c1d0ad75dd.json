                    "text": "Let's tackle this equilibrium problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on equilibrium constants, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the reaction and what's given:\n\nThe reaction is Br\u2082(g) + Cl\u2082(g) \u21cc 2 BrCl(g), and the equilibrium constant K is 15.0 at a certain temperature.\n\nInitially, there are 10.0 grams of BrCl in a 15.0-liter reaction vessel. I need to find the concentration of BrCl at equilibrium.\n\nAlright, so first things first: I need to convert the mass of BrCl to moles because equilibrium concentrations are in terms of molarity (moles per liter).\n\nWhat's the molar mass of BrCl? Bromine (Br) is approximately 80 g/mol, and chlorine (Cl) is about 35.5 g/mol. So, the molar mass of BrCl is 80 + 35.5 = 115.5 g/mol.\n\nNow, moles of BrCl = mass / molar mass = 10.0 g / 115.5 g/mol \u2248 0.0866 mol.\n\nSince the volume of the reaction vessel is 15.0 liters, the initial concentration of BrCl is:\n\n[BrCl]\u2080 = moles / volume = 0.0866 mol / 15.0 L \u2248 0.00577 M.\n\nNow, I need to set up an ICE table to find the equilibrium concentrations.\n\nLet's write the balanced equation again:\n\nBr\u2082 + Cl\u2082 \u21cc 2 BrCl.\n\nWait a minute, actually, looking back, the reaction is Br\u2082 + Cl\u2082 \u21cc 2 BrCl, but according to the problem, Br2 reacts with Cl2 to form BrCl, so the equation is correct.\n\nNow, at equilibrium, some Br\u2082 and Cl\u2082 will be formed from the decomposition of BrCl.\n\nLet's assume that at equilibrium, the concentration of Br\u2082 and Cl\u2082 both increase by x M, and the concentration of BrCl decreases by 2x M.\n\nSo, ICE table:\n\nInitial:\n\n[Br\u2082] = 0 M (assuming no Br\u2082 initially)\n\n[Cl\u2082] = 0 M (assuming no Cl\u2082 initially)\n\n[BrCl] = 0.00577 M\n\nChange:\n\n[Br\u2082] increases by x M\n\n[Cl\u2082] increases by x M\n\n[BrCl] decreases by 2x M\n\nEquilibrium:\n\n[Br\u2082] = x M\n\n[Cl\u2082] = x M\n\n[BrCl] = 0.00577 - 2x M\n\nNow, the equilibrium constant expression for K is:\n\nK = [BrCl]^2 / ([Br\u2082][Cl\u2082])\n\nGiven that K = 15.0.\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium concentrations:\n\n15.0 = (0.00577 - 2x)^2 / (x * x)\n\nSimplify:\n\n15.0 = (0.00577 - 2x)^2 / x^2\n\nTaking square roots on both sides:\n\nsqrt(15.0) = (0.00577 - 2x) / x\n\nApproximately, sqrt(15) \u2248 3.873\n\nSo:\n\n3.873 = (0.00577 - 2x) / x\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\n3.873x = 0.00577 - 2x\n\nAdd 2x to both sides:\n\n3.873x + 2x = 0.00577\n\n5.873x = 0.00577\n\nx = 0.00577 / 5.873 \u2248 0.000982 M\n\nNow, the equilibrium concentration of BrCl is:\n\n[BrCl] = 0.00577 M - 2x \u2248 0.00577 M - 2*(0.000982 M) \u2248 0.00577 M - 0.001964 M \u2248 0.003806 M\n\nSo, [BrCl] \u2248 0.003806 M, which is approximately 3.8 \u00d7 10^-3 M.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3.8 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L\n\nB. 5.77 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L\n\nC. 1.97 \u00d7 10^-3 M\n\nD. 9.9 \u00d7 10^-4 M\n\nSo, option A seems to match our calculation.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I set up the reaction correctly.\n\nThe reaction is Br\u2082 + Cl\u2082 \u21cc 2 BrCl.\n\nBut according to the problem, Br2 reacts with Cl2 to form BrCl, which is correct.\n\nAnd the equilibrium constant K = [BrCl]^2 / ([Br\u2082][Cl\u2082]) = 15.0.\n\nOur calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try solving the quadratic equation instead of taking square roots to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting from:\n\n15.0 = (0.00577 - 2x)^2 / (x^2)\n\nMultiply both sides by x^2:\n\n15.0 x^2 = (0.00577 - 2x)^2\n\nTake square roots:\n\nsqrt(15.0) x = 0.00577 - 2x\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, expand the right side:\n\n15.0 x^2 = (0.00577 - 2x)^2\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n15.0 x^2 = 0.00577^2 - 2*0.00577*2x + (2x)^2\n\n15.0 x^2 = 0.0000333 + 0.02308 x + 4x^2\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n15.0 x^2 - 4x^2 - 0.02308 x - 0.0000333 = 0\n\n11.0 x^2 - 0.02308 x - 0.0000333 = 0\n\nNow, solve the quadratic equation:\n\nx = [0.02308 \u00b1 sqrt(0.02308^2 - 4*11.0*(-0.0000333))] / (2*11.0)\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\nD = (0.02308)^2 - 4*11.0*(-0.0000333) \u2248 0.0005326 + 0.0014652 \u2248 0.0019978\n\nsqrt(D) \u2248 0.04470\n\nSo,\n\nx = [0.02308 + 0.04470] / 22.0 \u2248 0.06778 / 22.0 \u2248 0.00308 M\n\nOr\n\nx = [0.02308 - 0.04470] / 22.0 \u2248 (-0.02162) / 22.0 \u2248 -0.000983 M\n\nNegative concentration doesn't make sense, so x \u2248 0.00308 M\n\nThen, [BrCl] = 0.00577 M - 2*(0.00308 M) \u2248 0.00577 M - 0.00616 M \u2248 -0.00039 M\n\nWait, that's negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, perhaps the positive x value is not valid in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic formula.\n\nLet me check the quadratic equation again.\n\nStarting from:\n\n11.0 x^2 - 0.02308 x - 0.0000333 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [0.02308 \u00b1 sqrt(0.02308^2 - 4*11.0*(-0.0000333))] / (2*11.0)\n\nCalculate discriminant again:\n\nD = (0.02308)^2 - 4*11.0*(-0.0000333) = 0.0005326 + 0.0014652 = 0.0019978\n\nsqrt(D) \u2248 0.04470\n\nSo,\n\nx = [0.02308 + 0.04470] / 22.0 = 0.06778 / 22.0 \u2248 0.00308 M\n\nOr\n\nx = [0.02308 - 0.04470] / 22.0 = (-0.02162) / 22.0 \u2248 -0.000983 M\n\nAgain, negative concentration is invalid.\n\nBut if I take x = 0.00308 M, then [BrCl] becomes negative, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that the positive root is not valid, so perhaps the approximation method is more appropriate here.\n\nGoing back to the approximation method:\n\nFrom 15.0 = (0.00577 - 2x)^2 / (x^2)\n\nTaking square roots:\n\nsqrt(15.0) = (0.00577 - 2x) / x\n\n3.873 x = 0.00577 - 2x\n\n5.873 x = 0.00577\n\nx = 0.00577 / 5.873 \u2248 0.000982 M\n\nThen, [BrCl] = 0.00577 M - 2*(0.000982 M) \u2248 0.003806 M, which is 3.8 \u00d7 10^-3 M, option A.\n\nGiven that the quadratic approach led to an invalid negative concentration, the approximation seems acceptable here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 3.8 \u00d7 10^-3 mol/L.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3.8 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mol/L}} \\]"
