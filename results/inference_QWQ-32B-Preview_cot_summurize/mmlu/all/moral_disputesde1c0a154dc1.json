He believed that moral actions are those that follow universal moral laws, which are discovered through reason. So, it doesn't fit into consequentialism, which focuses on outcomes, or virtue ethics, which emphasizes character traits. Utilitarianism is a type of consequentialism that aims for the greatest happiness for the greatest number, which is different from Kant's deontological approach. Therefore, none of the above options accurately describe Kant's moral theory."
