The question is, which operation should he use to find the answer?\n\nLet's break this down. We have 25 people in total, and each boat carries 5 people. So, to find out how many boats are needed, Peter should think about how many groups of 5 people there are in 25 people.\n\nAdding 5 to 25 would just give him 30, which doesn't make sense in this context because he's trying to find the number of boats, not the total number of something else.\n\nMultiplying 25 by 5 would give him 125, which is way too big and doesn't relate to finding the number of boats.\n\nSubtracting 5 from 25 would give him 20, but again, that doesn't help in determining the number of boats needed.\n\nSo, the logical operation here is to divide 25 by 5. When you divide 25 by 5, you get 5. That means there are 5 boats needed to carry 25 people, with each boat holding 5 people.\n\nTo verify this, Peter can think about it differently. If each boat holds 5 people, and there are 5 boats, then 5 boats times 5 people per boat equals 25 people, which matches the total number of people.\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. Divide 25 by 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
