                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about finding the standard deviation of an equally weighted portfolio of two stocks, A and B. Let's see what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I know that the standard deviations of Stocks A and B are 6% and 18%, respectively. Their correlation is 0.2, and the portfolio is equally weighted, meaning each stock makes up 50% of the portfolio.\n\nI need to find the standard deviation of this portfolio. I remember that the formula for the standard deviation of a two-asset portfolio is:\n\n\u03c3p = \u221a(wA\u00b2 * \u03c3A\u00b2 + wB\u00b2 * \u03c3B\u00b2 + 2 * wA * wB * \u03c1AB * \u03c3A * \u03c3B)\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03c3p is the standard deviation of the portfolio\n\n- wA and wB are the weights of stocks A and B in the portfolio\n\n- \u03c3A and \u03c3B are the standard deviations of stocks A and B\n\n- \u03c1AB is the correlation between stocks A and B\n\nSince it's an equally weighted portfolio, wA = wB = 0.5.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u03c3p = \u221a((0.5)\u00b2 * (0.06)\u00b2 + (0.5)\u00b2 * (0.18)\u00b2 + 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.2 * 0.06 * 0.18)\n\nLet me calculate each part step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate wA\u00b2 * \u03c3A\u00b2:\n\n(0.5)\u00b2 * (0.06)\u00b2 = 0.25 * 0.0036 = 0.0009\n\nNext, wB\u00b2 * \u03c3B\u00b2:\n\n(0.5)\u00b2 * (0.18)\u00b2 = 0.25 * 0.0324 = 0.0081\n\nNow, the covariance term: 2 * wA * wB * \u03c1AB * \u03c3A * \u03c3B\n\n2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.2 * 0.06 * 0.18 = 1 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.2 * 0.06 * 0.18\n\nWait, 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5\n\nSo, 0.5 * 0.2 * 0.06 * 0.18\n\nFirst, 0.2 * 0.06 = 0.012\n\nThen, 0.012 * 0.18 = 0.00216\n\nFinally, 0.5 * 0.00216 = 0.00108\n\nNow, add all these up:\n\n0.0009 + 0.0081 + 0.00108 = 0.01008\n\nNow, take the square root of that sum to get \u03c3p:\n\n\u03c3p = \u221a0.01008 \u2248 0.1004 or 10.04%\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 10%\n\nB. 5%\n\nC. 3.40%\n\nD. 9.70%\n\n10% seems to be the closest answer. I think A is the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nwA = wB = 0.5\n\n\u03c3A = 6% = 0.06\n\n\u03c3B = 18% = 0.18\n\n\u03c1AB = 0.2\n\nFirst term: wA\u00b2 * \u03c3A\u00b2 = (0.5)^2 * (0.06)^2 = 0.25 * 0.0036 = 0.0009\n\nSecond term: wB\u00b2 * \u03c3B\u00b2 = (0.5)^2 * (0.18)^2 = 0.25 * 0.0324 = 0.0081\n\nThird term: 2 * wA * wB * \u03c1AB * \u03c3A * \u03c3B = 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.2 * 0.06 * 0.18\n\nCalculate inside: 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5\n\nThen, 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1\n\nThen, 0.1 * 0.06 = 0.006\n\nThen, 0.006 * 0.18 = 0.00108\n\nNow, sum them up: 0.0009 + 0.0081 + 0.00108 = 0.01008\n\nSquare root: \u221a0.01008 \u2248 0.1004 or 10.04%\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the standard deviation of the portfolio is approximately 10%, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
