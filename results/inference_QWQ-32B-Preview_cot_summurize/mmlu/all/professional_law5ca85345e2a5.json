The options are substantive due process, equal protection, procedural due process, or none of these.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nSubstantive due process is about the content of the laws themselves. It ensures that the laws are fair and just, and don't violate certain fundamental rights, even if the procedures to enact them were followed properly.\n\nEqual protection, on the other hand, is about ensuring that all individuals are treated equally under the law. It's mainly associated with the 14th Amendment in the U.S. Constitution, which says that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction \"the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nProcedural due process is about the steps and procedures that must be followed before the government can take away someone's life, liberty, or property. It's about fair process.\n\nSo, in this question, it's about denying certain fundamental rights to some individuals but not others. That sounds a lot like treating some people differently under the law, which would be an equal protection issue.\n\nBut let me think about substantive due process again. If the law itself is denying a fundamental right, that could be a substantive due process problem. But the key here is that it's being denied to some but not others, which again sounds more like an equal protection issue.\n\nProcedural due process seems less relevant here because it's not about the content of the rights or the equality of treatment, but about the procedures followed before taking action.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Equal protection problem.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if it could be both substantive due process and equal protection.\n\nFor example, if a law denies a fundamental right to a certain group, that could violate substantive due process because the right is fundamental, and it could violate equal protection because it's denying the right based on some characteristic.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking for one type of problem, and since it's specifically about denying rights to some but not others, equal protection seems to be the primary issue here.\n\nNone of these is option D, but that doesn't seem likely since both substantive and equal protection deal with rights.\n\nSo, my final answer is B. Equal protection problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
