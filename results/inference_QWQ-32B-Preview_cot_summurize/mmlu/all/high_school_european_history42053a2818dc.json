                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Herbert Spencer, and it's from 1851 about social statistics and survival of the fittest applied to humankind. The question is asking what nineteenth-century political philosophy Spencer was an advocate of, and the options are conservatism, anarchism, liberalism, or socialism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these political philosophies stands for in the nineteenth century.\n\nConservatism generally favors traditional institutions and practices, often supporting the status quo and gradual, organic change.\n\nAnarchism is against all forms of hierarchical and coercive authority, advocating for a society without rulers or authorities.\n\nLiberalism in the nineteenth century usually promotes individual liberty, private property, laissez-faire economics, and constitutional government.\n\nSocialism advocates for collective or governmental ownership and control of production and distribution, emphasizing social equality.\n\nNow, looking at Spencer's passage, he says that the government assuming the role of relieving the poor is forbidden by the principle that government should only protect. He argues that demanding contributions from citizens for mitigating distress is reversing the government's function. He believes the state's role is to enforce fundamental laws that protect individual freedom without infringing on others, but not to insure satisfaction.\n\nHe also mentions that poverty of the incapable, distresses of the imprudent, starvation of the idle, and the competition between the weak and the strong are natural and even benevolent in the larger scheme of things because they promote the survival of the fittest, which is beneficial for universal humanity.\n\nSo, Spencer is arguing against government intervention in social welfare, promoting a hands-off approach where individuals are responsible for their own fate, and natural selection determines who succeeds or fails.\n\nThis sounds a lot like classical liberalism, which emphasizes individual liberty and minimal state intervention in economic and social affairs.\n\nConservatism might support limited government, but it also values tradition and social order, which isn't prominently featured in this passage.\n\nAnarchism would go further than Spencer, rejecting all forms of government, whereas Spencer still sees a role for government in protecting individual freedoms.\n\nSocialism is clearly opposed to Spencer's views, as it advocates for government intervention to redistribute wealth and provide for the less fortunate.\n\nTherefore, among the options given, liberalism seems the closest fit to Spencer's philosophy as expressed in this passage.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any hint of conservatism, anarchism, or socialism in the passage.\n\nThere's no mention of preserving traditional institutions or social hierarchies, which might be expected in conservatism.\n\nThere's no rejection of government per se, which anarchism would advocate.\n\nAnd there's a clear opposition to government intervention in social welfare, which socialism supports.\n\nSo, again, liberalism seems the most appropriate choice.\n\nMoreover, Spencer's idea of \"survival of the fittest\" applied to humans aligns with social Darwinism, which was influential in late nineteenth-century liberal thought, particularly in justifying laissez-faire economics and individual responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Liberalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
