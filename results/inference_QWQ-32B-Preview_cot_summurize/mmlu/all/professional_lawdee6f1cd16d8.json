The city council has enacted an ordinance requiring illegal aliens to pay a $100 \"school fee\" for each child enrolled in a city public school. Citizens and legal aliens are not required to pay the school fee. The city council has enacted this law to raise funds to hire additional teachers who are bilingual. The city determined that over 15% of children attending public schools in the city were illegal aliens. Furthermore, the city conducted a study and found that the overwhelming majority of illegal aliens residing in the city did not pay any local property taxes. As a result, since the city provided educational benefits to the children of illegal aliens, the school fee furthered a significant governmental interest. The illegal alien, who is indigent, is unable to pay the city school fee. The city will not allow her children to attend school unless the fee is paid. If she seeks your legal advice regarding the constitutionality of the fee, you should advise her that the ordinance is\n\nA. valid, because the city can demonstrate that the school fee is necessary to further a compelling governmental interest.\nB. valid, because the imposition of the school fee is substantially related to a legitimate governmental interest.\nC. invalid, because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens is not substantially related to an important governmental interest.\nD. invalid, because the cost of educating the children imposed an undue burden on the public school system by requiring the school board to hire additional bilingual teachers.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the best advice to give this illegal alien mom about the city's new school fee. It's a tricky situation because she's indigent and can't pay the $100 fee per child, and the city won't let her kids go to school without it. The city says it's to raise money for bilingual teachers since many kids are illegal aliens who don't pay property taxes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal principles here. The city is treating illegal aliens differently from citizens and legal aliens by making them pay this fee. So, it's a question of equal protection under the law. The equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment says that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Now, illegal aliens are still \"persons\" and are entitled to some level of protection, but their rights are more limited compared to citizens and legal residents.\n\nI recall that illegal aliens don't have an absolute right to K-12 education, but there's a Supreme Court case, Plyler v. Doe, from 1982, that's relevant here. In Plyler, the Court struck down a Texas law that allowed local school districts to deny enrollment to children who weren't legally present in the country. The Court found that denying these children education wouldn't serve a compelling state interest and that education was important for them to become productive members of society.\n\nSo, in this case, the city is trying to make illegal aliens pay a fee to cover the cost of educating their children, specifically to hire bilingual teachers. They say it's to further a significant governmental interest, which seems similar to what the Texas law was trying to do in Plyler.\n\nLooking back at Plyler, the Court found that education was too important to deny to anyone, regardless of their immigration status, because it affects their ability to contribute to society and helps integrate them into American life. The city here isn't denying education entirely, but is making illegal aliens pay a fee that citizens and legal aliens don't have to pay. Is that different enough from Plyler?\n\nI think the key is whether this fee is a barrier to education for illegal aliens, especially since many of them are likely to be low-income and unable to pay, like this mom. If the fee is too high and people can't afford it, it's functionally denying them education, which seems similar to what Plyler prohibited.\n\nAlso, the city says that since illegal aliens don't pay property taxes, which help fund schools, this fee is a way to make them contribute. But in Plyler, the Court considered the state's interest in saving money by not educating these children, and found it wasn't a compelling enough reason to justify denying education.\n\nMoreover, the city is using the fee to hire bilingual teachers, which suggests that there's a need to accommodate children who don't speak English well. That seems like a legitimate educational goal, but is making illegal aliens pay for it constitutional?\n\nLet me consider the levels of scrutiny for equal protection cases. Generally, when a law discriminates based on race or national origin, it's subject to strict scrutiny, meaning the government has to show that the law serves a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. For other kinds of classifications, like age or gender, it's intermediate scrutiny, and for everything else, it's rational basis review.\n\nIn this case, the classification is based on immigration status, which isn't a suspect classification like race or national origin, so it's probably rational basis review that applies. Under rational basis, the law just needs to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\n\nOption A says the ordinance is valid because it's necessary to further a compelling governmental interest. That sounds like strict scrutiny, but as I said, immigration status isn't a suspect classification, so strict scrutiny may not apply. Besides, in Plyler, the Court didn't find the state's interest in saving money to be compelling.\n\nOption B says it's valid because the fee is substantially related to a legitimate governmental interest. That sounds more like rational basis review. The city has a legitimate interest in funding its schools and ensuring that all children, including those from families who don't pay property taxes, contribute somehow. So, this might be a plausible argument.\n\nOption C says it's invalid because denying educational services to children of undocumented aliens isn't substantially related to an important governmental interest. This seems to be getting at the idea that the fee is a barrier to education, and in Plyler, the Court found that education was too important to deny based on immigration status.\n\nOption D says it's invalid because the cost of educating the children imposes an undue burden on the public school system, requiring the school board to hire additional bilingual teachers. I'm not sure about this one. The city is using the fee to hire bilingual teachers, which suggests they recognize the need, but is making illegal aliens pay for it an undue burden? Maybe, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking back, the city determined that over 15% of children in public schools are illegal aliens, and that most illegal aliens don't pay local property taxes. So, they're trying to make those who aren't paying property taxes contribute somehow to the cost of educating their children.\n\nBut in Plyler, the Court didn't accept the state's interest in saving money as compelling enough to deny education. Here, the city isn't denying education outright but is making illegal aliens pay a fee. However, if the fee is too high and people can't afford it, it's effectively denying education.\n\nMoreover, the fee is only for illegal aliens, not for citizens or legal aliens. So, it's treating similar situations differently based on immigration status.\n\nI think the better argument is that this violates equal protection because it's irrational to make only illegal aliens pay this fee while citizens and legal aliens don't have to. The city could argue that illegal aliens don't pay property taxes, but legal aliens who are renters also might not pay property taxes, yet they aren't required to pay the fee.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city could argue that illegal aliens are in the country unlawfully, so it's acceptable to make them pay extra. But that seems questionable, especially given Plyler's emphasis on the importance of education.\n\nFurthermore, if the city really needs to hire bilingual teachers, why should only the parents of children who need bilingual education be required to pay for it? It seems like the cost should be borne by all taxpayers through regular school funding.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the ordinance is invalid because it's not substantially related to a legitimate governmental interest. The city's interest in ensuring that those who benefit from public services contribute to their cost is legitimate, but singling out illegal aliens for this fee seems discriminatory, especially in light of Plyler.\n\nTherefore, I would advise the mother that the ordinance is likely invalid, and she should consider challenging it in court. Maybe there are local advocacy groups that could help her with this.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
