                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Cicero's views. So, the question is asking about a \"pernicious doctrine\" that Cicero thought was particularly harmful. The options are:\n\nA. the gods do not care what we do.\n\nB. a thing may be expedient without being morally right.\n\nC. moral rightness is relative to one's culture.\n\nD. it is sometimes permissible to lie.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Cicero believed about ethics and morality. Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman who was influenced by Greek Stoic and Platonic ideas. He was known for his emphasis on natural law and the idea that morality is universal and not relative to culture.\n\nOption A suggests that the gods don't care about human actions. Cicero was a religious man who believed in gods who were concerned with human affairs. He thought that the gods had set up a moral order in the universe, and that human beings should live in accordance with that order. So, if someone were to claim that the gods don't care what we do, that would go against Cicero's beliefs and could be considered a pernicious doctrine by him.\n\nOption B states that something can be useful or expedient without being morally right. Cicero would likely disagree with this because he believed that true expediency should align with moral righteousness. In other words, what is morally right is also truly expedient in the long run. So, separating expediency from morality could be seen as a harmful idea by him.\n\nOption C proposes that moral rightness is relative to one's culture. Cicero, as someone who believed in universal natural law, would reject moral relativism. He thought that moral truths are the same for all people, regardless of their cultural background. Therefore, the idea that morality is relative to culture would be against his views and could be considered pernicious.\n\nOption D suggests that lying is sometimes permissible. Cicero was known for his emphasis on honesty and integrity. He believed that lying was generally wrong, but like many moral philosophers, he might have allowed for exceptions in certain extreme circumstances, such as to save a life. However, making a general claim that lying is sometimes permissible might not align with his strict moral standards.\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these options Cicero would consider \"no more pernicious doctrine.\" Pernicious means harmful or destructive, so he's saying that this idea is extremely harmful.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Denying divine concern for human actions could lead people to disregard moral constraints, thinking that their actions have no consequences beyond this life.\n\nB. Separating expediency from morality could lead to justifying immoral actions for practical benefits, which Cicero would see as dangerous.\n\nC. Moral relativism could lead to accepting any behavior as moral, depending on cultural norms, which contradicts his belief in universal moral standards.\n\nD. Allowing for permissible lying could erode trust and honesty, which are foundational to social and political life.\n\nAll of these ideas could be considered harmful by Cicero, but I need to pick the one he thought was the most pernicious.\n\nOption A seems particularly problematic because it strikes at the heart of his belief in a divinely ordained moral order. If the gods don't care about human actions, then there might be no ultimate accountability for moral transgressions, which could lead to moral decay and societal breakdown.\n\nOption B is also serious because it could justify immoral actions in the name of practicality or usefulness.\n\nOption C is problematic because it undermines the idea of universal moral truths, which Cicero held dear.\n\nOption D, while important, might be seen as less pernicious compared to the others, as lying is already generally considered wrong, and allowing exceptions might be more acceptable.\n\nHowever, considering Cicero's strong emphasis on the role of the gods in moral governance, I think he would consider option A\u2014the idea that the gods don't care what we do\u2014as the most pernicious doctrine.\n\nBut let's double-check this. Maybe there's a specific passage where Cicero discusses this.\n\nUpon reviewing Cicero's writings, particularly in his philosophical works like \"De Officiis\" (On Duties), he does emphasize the importance of living in accordance with nature and the gods' will. He believes that the gods have established a moral order, and human actions have spiritual consequences.\n\nIn \"De Natura Deorum\" (On the Nature of the Gods), Cicero argues for the existence of gods who are concerned with human affairs. He sees religion and morality as intimately connected.\n\nTherefore, denying divine concern for human actions would undermine the foundation of his moral philosophy.\n\nMoreover, Cicero was a proponent of natural law, which holds that there are universal moral principles that should be followed regardless of human laws or cultural practices. This aligns with his rejection of moral relativism (option C).\n\nHowever, in the context of the question, which asks for the \"most pernicious doctrine,\" I need to determine which of these ideas he would find most harmful.\n\nGiven that the other options are also harmful, perhaps the answer is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phrase \"no more pernicious doctrine\" is being used in a specific way. Perhaps it means that there is no doctrine more pernicious than the one being considered, implying that the chosen option is the worst.\n\nIn that case, Cicero might consider multiple doctrines pernicious, but one stands out as the worst.\n\nConsidering the options again:\n\nA. Denying divine concern could lead to moral nihilism.\n\nB. Separating expediency from morality could lead to utilitarian abuses.\n\nC. Moral relativism could lead to acceptance of any behavior as moral.\n\nD. Permitting lying could destroy trust in society.\n\nAll of these are serious issues, but perhaps denying divine concern is the most foundational error, leading to all the others.\n\nAlternatively, moral relativism could be seen as equally destructive because it undermines the idea of universal morality.\n\nHowever, since Cicero was known for his religious beliefs and his integration of divine will into his moral philosophy, I think he would consider the denial of divine concern for human actions as the most pernicious doctrine.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. the gods do not care what we do.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
