                    "text": "I've got this chart showing literacy rates among Russian-speaking people from 1897 to 1955. The numbers are going up over time, which makes sense because education usually improves with time. But the question is asking which segment of the population probably benefited the most from this increase in literacy. The options are the rural peasantry, the Russian Orthodox clergy, the urban middle class, and officers in the armed forces.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what literacy means in this context. Literacy typically refers to the ability to read and write. So, higher literacy rates mean more people can read and write.\n\nLooking at the time period, from 1897 to 1955, Russia went through some major changes. In 1897, it was still the Russian Empire, and by 1917, there was the Russian Revolution, which led to the formation of the Soviet Union. So, there were significant social and political changes during this time.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nA. The rural peasantry: In imperial Russia, the peasantry was largely illiterate. Agriculture was the main occupation, and education was not a priority for the peasant class. However, after the revolution, the Soviet government placed a strong emphasis on education, including in rural areas. They introduced mass literacy campaigns to educate the peasantry. So, it's likely that the rural peasantry saw a significant improvement in literacy rates.\n\nB. Members of the Russian Orthodox clergy: The Orthodox Church had its own educational system, and clergy members were generally educated. In fact, before the revolution, the church played a role in education. However, after the revolution, the Soviet government was atheist and often clashed with the church. Many clergy members were persecuted, and their institutions were closed or seized. So, it's unlikely that the literacy rates among the clergy increased significantly during this period. In fact, it might have decreased due to persecution and the closure of church schools.\n\nC. The urban middle class: In imperial Russia, the urban middle class was relatively educated. They had access to schools and universities. After the revolution, the Soviet government also invested in education for the urban population. So, their literacy rates likely continued to be high, but since they were already fairly literate, the increase might not have been as dramatic as in other groups.\n\nD. Officers in the armed forces: Military officers were educated, as their positions required certain levels of education and training. The Soviet Union also continued to educate its military officers. However, like the urban middle class, they were likely already fairly literate, so the increase in literacy rates might not have impacted them as much as other groups.\n\nComparing these options, it seems that the rural peasantry would have benefited the most from the rising literacy rates. This is because they started from a lower base in terms of literacy and underwent significant educational improvements under the Soviet regime's efforts to educate the masses.\n\nAdditionally, the Soviet government had specific programs aimed at eradicating illiteracy, particularly in rural areas. They sent literacy workers to the countryside to teach people how to read and write. So, it makes sense that the peasantry would have seen the most significant gains in literacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the Russian Orthodox clergy likely saw their literacy rates stagnate or even decrease due to the antagonistic relationship between the Soviet state and the church.\n\nThe urban middle class and military officers were already relatively literate, so the increase in overall literacy rates might not have impacted them as much as the rural peasantry.\n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A. The rural peasantry.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
