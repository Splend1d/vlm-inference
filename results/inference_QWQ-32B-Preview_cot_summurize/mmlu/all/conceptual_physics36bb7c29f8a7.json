So, I need to figure out which of these properties are the same for all parts of a laser beam.\n\nFirst, I know that lasers are special because they produce light that's coherent and monochromatic. Monochromatic means it's all one color, which relates to frequency, right? So, probably, the frequency is the same across the beam.\n\nCoherent means that the light waves are in step with each other, which I think has to do with the phase. So, maybe the phase is also the same across the beam.\n\nThen, speed of light\u2014well, in a vacuum, light always travels at the speed of light, which is about 300,000 kilometers per second. But if the laser is passing through different media, like glass or something, the speed might change. But assuming it's in air or vacuum, the speed should be the same everywhere in the beam.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't specify the medium, so maybe I should assume it's in a vacuum or air, where the speed is constant.\n\nSo, if I consider all these points, it seems like all parts of the laser beam have the same frequency, phase, and speed.\n\nBut let me think again. In reality, even in a laser beam, while it's highly coherent and monochromatic, there might be some variations, especially over long distances or in different conditions.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of this question, which seems pretty basic, I think the expected answer is that all parts of the laser beam have the same frequency, phase, and speed.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. All of these.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should check each option individually.\n\nOption A: frequency. As I said, lasers are monochromatic, so frequency should be the same.\n\nOption B: phase. Lasers are coherent, meaning the phase is consistent across the beam.\n\nOption C: speed. In a given medium, the speed of light is constant.\n\nTherefore, all of these are true for a laser beam.\n\nI think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
