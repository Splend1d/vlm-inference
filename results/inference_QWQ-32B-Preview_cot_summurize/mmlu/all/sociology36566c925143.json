                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"A survey should avoid asking:\" and then it lists options A through D. Let's see what each one is.\n\nOption A is \"fixed-choice questions.\" Hmm, fixed-choice questions are like multiple-choice questions where respondents pick from a set of predefined options. Those are pretty common in surveys. I don't think surveys should avoid those entirely. They can be very useful for quantifying responses and making data analysis easier.\n\nOption B is \"short questions.\" Short questions are generally good because they're clear and concise. It's better to keep questions short to avoid confusing the respondents. So, avoiding short questions doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C is \"leading questions.\" Leading questions are those that suggest a particular answer or influence the respondent's answer in some way. For example, \"Don't you think that product X is the best on the market?\" That's leading because it's implying that product X is the best.\n\nOption D is \"funnelled questions.\" I think this might be a typo or maybe I don't know this term. Maybe it's \"funneled questions,\" which could refer to questions that start broad and then get more specific, like a funnel shape. That's actually a good technique in surveys to help guide respondents from general to more detailed answers.\n\nGiven these options, it seems like leading questions are the type that surveys should avoid. Leading questions can bias the responses, which isn't desirable in research or data collection. So, I think the answer is C. Leading questions.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about each option again.\n\n- Fixed-choice questions: Not necessarily bad; they have their place.\n\n- Short questions: Generally good.\n\n- Leading questions: Definitely something to avoid because of bias.\n\n- Funnelled questions: Seems like a good technique.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty confident with C as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
