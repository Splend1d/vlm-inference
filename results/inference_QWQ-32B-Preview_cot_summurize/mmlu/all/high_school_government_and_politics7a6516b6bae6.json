                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about Congress. I need to identify which statement is NOT true among the options provided. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"Only Congress can pass laws.\" Hmm, I know that Congress is the legislative branch of the U.S. government, and its primary function is to make laws. But I also recall that the President can issue executive orders, which have the force of law, but I think those are more like administrative directives rather than actual laws. So, I believe that only Congress can pass laws, making this statement true.\n\nOption B: \"A proposed amendment must be approved by two-thirds of the delegates in both houses of Congress.\" Now, I remember that amending the Constitution requires a supermajority. Specifically, to propose an amendment, both the House and the Senate need to pass it by a two-thirds vote. Then, it goes to the states for ratification, but the question is only about Congress's role here. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"Congress can override a presidential veto if two-thirds of the House and Senate agree to do so.\" Yeah, I know that if the President vetoes a bill, Congress can override that veto with a two-thirds majority in both houses. That's a fundamental check and balance. So, this statement appears to be accurate.\n\nOption D: \"Congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the president.\" Hmm, this one sounds a bit tricky. I know that the President is the chief executive and has a lot of influence over the bureaucracy, including appointing heads of agencies and departments. Congress, on the other hand, has oversight powers, can set budgets, and confirm appointments, but perhaps the President has more direct control. But I'm not entirely sure about this.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about it differently. The President appoints agency heads and can issue executive orders that guide the bureaucracy, whereas Congress's influence is more indirect through legislation and oversight. So, in terms of day-to-day management and control, the President probably does have more power over the bureaucracy than Congress does.\n\nBut let me double-check. Congress can influence the bureaucracy by writing laws that specify how agencies should operate, and through the power of the purse, controlling funding. However, the President has the executive authority to manage the bureaucracy directly. So, it seems reasonable to say that Congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the President.\n\nWait, but is that entirely accurate? Congress has significant power to shape the bureaucracy through legislation and oversight. For example, they can hold hearings, request information, and even impeach executive officials. So, while the President has direct control, Congress has its own set of tools to influence the bureaucracy.\n\nMaybe the statement is too absolute. Saying that Congressional power is \"less than\" the President's might not be entirely accurate, because it depends on the context and the specific powers being compared.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is true in the sense that the President has more direct control over the bureaucracy, while Congress's influence is more indirect.\n\nBut considering that Congress can fundamentally reshape the bureaucracy through legislation and funding, it's perhaps not accurate to say that their power is less. Maybe it's just different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is correct, and Congress does have less power over the bureaucracy compared to the President.\n\nI'm a bit unsure about this one.\n\nLet me consider the other options again. Options A, B, and C all seem to be correct statements about Congress. Therefore, by process of elimination, Option D might be the one that's not true.\n\nBut I want to make sure. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to think about this. Let's consider the roles:\n\n- The President appoints heads of agencies and can issue executive orders that direct the bureaucracy.\n\n- Congress can pass laws that create or modify agencies and set their mandates.\n\n- Congress can also hold hearings, request information, and conduct investigations to oversee the bureaucracy.\n\n- Additionally, Congress controls the budget, which is a significant lever of power over the bureaucracy.\n\nGiven all that, it's not clear that Congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the President. Maybe it's just different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in terms of day-to-day operations, the President has more direct control, but Congress has more long-term influence through legislation and funding.\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"less power\" is an accurate characterization.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Option D is the statement that's not entirely true, making it the correct answer to this question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is intended to be taken in a specific context where Congressional power is indeed less than the President's, but without that context, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that this is a question where I need to identify the statement that is NOT true, and assuming that the others are true, I would go with Option D as the exception.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
