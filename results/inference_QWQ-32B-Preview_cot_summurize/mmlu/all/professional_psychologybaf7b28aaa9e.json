The therapeutic alliance refers to the collaborative bond between the therapist and the client, characterized by mutual agreement on goals, tasks, and the bond itself. In a group setting, this extends to the relationships among group members and between the group leader and the members.\n\nIrvin Yalom, a prominent figure in group therapy, emphasizes the importance of interpersonal learning, where group members interact with each other, providing feedback, support, and understanding. The alliance in this context involves the group's cohesion, trust, and commitment to the therapeutic process, mirroring the trust and commitment seen in the therapist-client dyad in individual therapy.\n\nTherefore, option D, \"alliance,\" is the correct choice as it directly corresponds to the therapeutic relationship in individual therapy."
