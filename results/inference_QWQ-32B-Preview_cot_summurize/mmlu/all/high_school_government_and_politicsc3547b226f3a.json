The options are:\n\nA. a pardon lasts 10 years, while a reprieve lasts one year\n\nB. a reprieve grants a release from legal punishment, while a pardon postpones it\n\nC. a pardon grants a release from legal punishment while a reprieve postpones it\n\nD. only state governors can issue pardons\n\nI need to choose the correct statement here. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that both pardons and reprieves are related to criminal sentences, but they seem to have different purposes. I think a pardon is when a person's conviction is forgiven, or something like that, and a reprieve might be a delay in punishment.\n\nOption A says that a pardon lasts 10 years and a reprieve lasts one year. I'm not sure about that. It sounds like specific time periods are assigned to each, but I don't recall hearing about fixed durations for pardons and reprieves. Maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption B says that a reprieve grants a release from legal punishment, while a pardon postpones it. Hmm, that seems backwards to me. I thought a pardon was the one that releases someone from punishment, and a reprieve might delay it.\n\nOption C is the opposite of option B, saying that a pardon grants release from legal punishment while a reprieve postpones it. That aligns more with what I think I know.\n\nOption D says only state governors can issue pardons. I know that presidents can also issue pardons for federal offenses, so this seems incorrect.\n\nLet me look up the definitions to be sure.\n\nA pardon is an act of grace or clemency extended to a person convicted of a crime. It relieves the person from further punishment and may also restore rights that were confiscated due to the conviction.\n\nA reprieve, on the other hand, is a temporary suspension of a punishment, often to give the person time to seek a longer-term solution, like a pardon or a commutation of sentence.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that a pardon grants a release from legal punishment, while a reprieve postpones it. That matches option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because pardons and reprieves don't have set durations like 10 years and one year; their effects are more about whether they release or postpone punishment.\n\nOption B is wrong because it reverses the effects of pardon and reprieve.\n\nOption D is incorrect because both the president and state governors can issue pardons, depending on whether the crime is federal or state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
