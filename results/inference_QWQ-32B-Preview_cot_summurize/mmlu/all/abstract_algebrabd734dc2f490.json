                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** Some abelian group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some group theory basics. An abelian group is one where the group operation is commutative. The order of a group is the number of its elements. A subgroup is a subset of the group that is itself a group under the same operation.\n\nI know that by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any subgroup H of a finite group G divides the order of G. So, if G has order 45, any subgroup H must have an order that divides 45. The divisors of 45 are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45.\n\nWait a minute, 10 is not among these divisors. So, how can there be a subgroup of order 10 in a group of order 45? That seems impossible based on Lagrange's theorem.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm misremembering Lagrange's theorem. Let me state it clearly: the order of a subgroup H divides the order of the group G.\n\nYes, that's correct. Since 10 does not divide 45, there cannot be a subgroup of order 10 in any group of order 45, abelian or not.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.\n\nOkay, now let's think about normal subgroups. A subgroup H of G is normal if for every element g in G and every h in H, the element ghg\u207b\u00b9 is also in H. This is often written as gHg\u207b\u00b9 = H for all g in G.\n\nI also know that the set of left cosets of H in G forms a partition of G, and similarly for the right cosets. The number of left cosets is called the index of H in G, denoted [G : H], and similarly for the right cosets.\n\nIn general, the number of left cosets is equal to the number of right cosets, because there is a bijection between them given by L(gH) = Hg\u207b\u00b9, I think.\n\nWait, but in the case of normal subgroups, the left and right cosets coincide. That is, for a normal subgroup H, gH = Hg for all g in G.\n\nSo, if H is normal, then the left cosets and right cosets are the same, so their numbers are equal.\n\nBut the converse is what's being stated here: if the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets, then H is normal.\n\nIs that true?\n\nWell, in any group, the number of left cosets is equal to the number of right cosets, because both are equal to the index [G : H], which is |G| / |H| if G is finite.\n\nSo, in finite groups, the number of left cosets always equals the number of right cosets, regardless of whether H is normal or not.\n\nTherefore, the statement seems to be false, because the equality of the number of left and right cosets does not imply that H is normal.\n\nTo confirm, let's think of an example.\n\nTake the symmetric group S3, which has order 6.\n\nLet H be a subgroup of order 2, say H = {e, (12)}. This is not a normal subgroup of S3.\n\nThe number of left cosets is [S3 : H] = 3, and the number of right cosets is also 3.\n\nSo, even though H is not normal, the number of left cosets equals the number of right cosets.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\nSo, both statements are false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
