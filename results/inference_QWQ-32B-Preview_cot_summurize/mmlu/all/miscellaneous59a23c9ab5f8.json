                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about a metal device used by police to immobilize the wheels of repeat parking offenders. The options are: A. Brooklyn clamp, B. Denver boot, C. LoJack, and D. The Club. I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these options is. Let's start with the Brooklyn clamp. I'm not entirely sure what that is, but it sounds like some kind of device that might be used to clamp something, maybe a bike or a car wheel. Maybe it's similar to the Denver boot?\n\nNext, the Denver boot. I've heard of that before. I think it's a big boot-shaped device that police put over a car's wheel to prevent it from moving. It's used as a penalty for parking violations, especially for repeat offenders. So, that seems like a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nNow, LoJack. I know LoJack is a vehicle tracking system. It's installed in cars to help recover them if they're stolen. It's not something that immobilizes wheels; it's more about locating the vehicle. So, that probably isn't the right answer here.\n\nThen, there's The Club. I remember that's a visible car alarm system. It's a big, claw-like device that you lock onto the steering wheel or the gear shift to make it difficult to drive the car. It's more of a physical deterrent against theft rather than a wheel immobilizer. So, maybe not the right choice for this question.\n\nLet me think again. The question is about a metal device that immobilizes the wheels of repeat parking offenders. So, it has to be something that goes over or around the wheel to prevent the car from moving.\n\nThe Denver boot sounds exactly like that. I've seen pictures of it; it's a big, boot-shaped device that fits over the wheel and locks in place. Police use it to deter parking violations by making it impossible for the owner to drive away until it's removed, usually after paying a fine.\n\nThe Brooklyn clamp might be similar, but I'm not as familiar with it. Maybe it's another name for the same thing? Or perhaps it's a different type of clamp used for similar purposes.\n\nLoJack and The Club are both security systems, but they function differently. LoJack helps track the vehicle, and The Club makes it hard to drive by disabling the steering or shifting mechanisms. Neither directly immobilizes the wheels.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is the Denver boot. It's specifically designed to immobilize a car by preventing its wheels from moving, which fits the description in the question.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if the Brooklyn clamp is another name for the same thing or if it's different. A quick search would help, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to go with my best judgment.\n\nI recall that the Denver boot is widely used and is synonymous with wheel clamps used by law enforcement for parking violations. The Brooklyn clamp might be a regional variant or another type of clamp, but without more information, I'll stick with the Denver boot as the most likely correct answer.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Denver boot.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
