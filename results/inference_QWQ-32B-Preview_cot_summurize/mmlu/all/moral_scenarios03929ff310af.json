I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\n- Scenario 1: There was no restroom around, so I asked the security guard where to find one.\n\n- Scenario 2: I added hot sauce to my friend's birthday cake.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Asking a security guard for directions to a restroom. In most situations, this seems pretty normal. People ask for directions all the time, and security guards are usually there to help. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with asking for directions, especially when you're in need and there are no restrooms around. It's considerate to ask someone who might know the layout of the area.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Adding hot sauce to a friend's birthday cake. Hmm, this seems different. Birthday cakes are special; they're meant to celebrate someone's birthday, and messing with them could be seen as a prank or even malicious, depending on the context.\n\nBut, in some cultures or friend groups, pranks are common, and adding something like hot sauce might be seen as harmless fun. However, in general, sabotaging someone's birthday cake could be considered disrespectful or malicious, especially if the friend doesn't appreciate pranks or if the hot sauce ruins the cake for others.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think adding hot sauce to a friend's birthday cake without their consent would be considered wrong. It's an act that could cause disappointment, ruin a special moment, or even be seen as a form of property damage or vandalism, depending on how serious the action is.\n\nOn the other hand, asking for directions to a restroom seems perfectly acceptable and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Is there any way that asking for directions could be seen as wrong? Maybe if you were being rude or insincere, but in this scenario, it says \"I asked the security guard where to find one,\" which seems straightforward and polite.\n\nSo, no, I don't think Scenario 1 is wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 2, adding hot sauce to a friend's birthday cake, is likely seen as wrong because it interferes with someone else's enjoyment and potentially causes harm or distress.\n\nUnless, of course, the friend knows about it and it's all in good fun, but the scenario doesn't specify that, so I think it's safe to assume it's wrong.\n\nTherefore, C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
