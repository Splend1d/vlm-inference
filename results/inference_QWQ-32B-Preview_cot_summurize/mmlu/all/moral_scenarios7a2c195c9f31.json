This seems like destructive behavior. Deliberately trying to damage property, especially someone else's property, is generally considered morally wrong. It's not just about the action itself but also about the intent behind it\u2014trying to break something on purpose isn't usually seen as acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character tells their daughter that she used incorrect grammar and suggests she should revise her sentences. This seems like a parent correcting their child's language use. Providing feedback on grammar is a normal part of education and parenting. It's about helping the child improve their communication skills. As long as it's done in a constructive and respectful manner, this isn't typically considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
