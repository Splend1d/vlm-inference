The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40 g/mol.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{moles of NaOH} = \\frac{50 \\text{ g}}{40 \\text{ g/mol}} = 1.25 \\text{ moles}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of moles of water**: The molar mass of water (H\u2082O) is approximately 18 g/mol.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{moles of water} = \\frac{50 \\text{ g}}{18 \\text{ g/mol}} \\approx 2.778 \\text{ moles}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total number of moles in the solution**: This is the sum of the moles of NaOH and the moles of water.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{total moles} = 1.25 \\text{ moles} + 2.778 \\text{ moles} \\approx 4.028 \\text{ moles}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the mole fraction of NaOH**: The mole fraction is the number of moles of NaOH divided by the total number of moles in the solution.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{mole fraction of NaOH} = \\frac{1.25}{4.028} \\approx 0.310\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the mole fraction of sodium hydroxide is approximately 0.311.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.311} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe mole fraction of a component in a solution is the ratio of the number of moles of that component to the total number of moles of all components in the solution. By calculating the moles of NaOH and water from their respective masses and molar masses, and then finding their ratio to the total moles, we obtain the mole fraction of NaOH, which is approximately 0.311."
