                    "text": "So I've got these two statements here, and I need to determine whether they're true or false. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"f : X \u2192 Y is continuous and X is compact. f must be uniformly continuous.\"\n\nOkay, so first, I need to recall what it means for a function to be continuous and uniformly continuous, and what compactness implies.\n\nContinuity at a point means that for every \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that if the distance between x and c is less than \u03b4, then the distance between f(x) and f(c) is less than \u03b5. Uniform continuity is stronger; it requires that the \u03b4 can be chosen independently of the point c.\n\nCompactness in a metric space means that every sequence has a convergent subsequence, or equivalently, that every open cover has a finite subcover.\n\nI think that on a compact space, continuity implies uniform continuity. Is that right? Let me think about it.\n\nSuppose X is compact and f is continuous. Take any \u03b5 > 0. For each x in X, there exists a \u03b4_x such that if d(x, y) < \u03b4_x, then d(f(x), f(y)) < \u03b5/2. Now, the balls of radius \u03b4_x/2 around each x cover X, and since X is compact, finitely many of these balls cover X. Let's say x1, x2, ..., xn.\n\nNow, let \u03b4 be the minimum of \u03b4_xi / 2 for i = 1 to n. I think this \u03b4 works for uniform continuity.\n\nSuppose d(x, y) < \u03b4. Then x lies in one of the balls, say B(xk, \u03b4_xk/2). Then d(x, xk) < \u03b4_xk/2, and d(y, xk) \u2264 d(y, x) + d(x, xk) < \u03b4 + \u03b4_xk/2 \u2264 \u03b4_xk/2 + \u03b4_xk/2 = \u03b4_xk.\n\nTherefore, d(f(x), f(xk)) < \u03b5/2 and d(f(y), f(xk)) < \u03b5/2, so d(f(x), f(y)) \u2264 d(f(x), f(xk)) + d(f(xk), f(y)) < \u03b5/2 + \u03b5/2 = \u03b5.\n\nSo, yes, f is uniformly continuous on X if X is compact and f is continuous. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"If f(x), g(x) : R \u2192 R are everywhere differentiable, f(g(x)) must be everywhere differentiable.\"\n\nHmm, this seems intuitive at first glance because the composition of differentiable functions should be differentiable, right? But maybe there are some caveats here.\n\nLet's recall the chain rule. If g is differentiable at x, and f is differentiable at g(x), then f(g(x)) is differentiable at x, and its derivative is f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n\nSo, if f and g are both differentiable everywhere, then f(g(x)) should be differentiable everywhere, since for every x, g is differentiable at x and f is differentiable at g(x).\n\nWait, but is there any situation where f is differentiable everywhere, g is differentiable everywhere, but f(g(x)) is not differentiable somewhere?\n\nI can't think of such a case off the top of my head. Let's consider some examples.\n\nTake f(x) = x^2 and g(x) = x^3. Both are differentiable everywhere, and f(g(x)) = (x^3)^2 = x^6, which is also differentiable everywhere.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = sin(x), g(x) = cos(x). Both are differentiable everywhere, and f(g(x)) = sin(cos(x)), which is also differentiable everywhere.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nWait, but what if g(x) is differentiable everywhere, and f is differentiable everywhere, but g(x) has some points where its derivative is zero, and f has some issues at those points.\n\nFor instance, let's take g(x) = x^2, which is differentiable everywhere, and f(x) = x^{1/3}, which is differentiable everywhere except at x=0, where its derivative is undefined.\n\nBut wait, f is defined as f: R \u2192 R, and f(x) = x^{1/3} is differentiable everywhere, including at x=0, because f'(x) = (1/3)x^{-2/3}, which is defined for all x \u2260 0, and at x=0, the derivative is actually defined as the limit, which exists and is infinite.\n\nWait, but in real analysis, we say that f(x) = x^{1/3} is differentiable everywhere on R, even at x=0, because the derivative is defined as the limit of the difference quotient, which exists.\n\nSo, in this case, f(g(x)) = (x^2)^{1/3} = x^{2/3}, which is differentiable everywhere, including at x=0, where the derivative is zero.\n\nWait, no, the derivative of x^{2/3} at x=0 is actually not defined in the usual sense because the slope is vertical. Let me check.\n\nThe derivative of x^{2/3} is (2/3)x^{-1/3}, which approaches infinity as x approaches 0 from the right and negative infinity from the left. So, at x=0, the derivative does not exist in the real numbers.\n\nWait, but according to the definition, if the limit of the difference quotient is infinite, some texts consider the derivative to be undefined.\n\nSo, in this case, f(g(x)) = x^{2/3} is not differentiable at x=0, even though f and g are both differentiable everywhere.\n\nWait, but f(x) = x^{1/3} is differentiable everywhere, including at x=0, because the limit of the difference quotient exists and is finite.\n\nWait, no, the difference quotient for f(x) = x^{1/3} at x=0 is (h^{1/3} - 0)/h = h^{-2/3}, which approaches infinity as h approaches 0. So, actually, f(x) = x^{1/3} is not differentiable at x=0.\n\nWait, but I thought it was differentiable everywhere. Maybe I'm confusing it with x^{2/3}.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nFor f(x) = x^{1/3}, the derivative is f'(x) = (1/3)x^{-2/3}, which is undefined at x=0 because it involves division by zero. So, f(x) = x^{1/3} is not differentiable at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for f(g(x)) = x^{2/3}, the derivative is (2/3)x^{-1/3}, which is also undefined at x=0.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, I thought f(x) = x^{1/3} is differentiable everywhere, but apparently, it's not differentiable at x=0.\n\nSo, in this case, f and g are both differentiable everywhere, but f(g(x)) is not differentiable at x=0.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nWait, but in this case, f is not differentiable at x=0, which contradicts the assumption that f is differentiable everywhere.\n\nWait, no, in this example, f(x) = x^{1/3}, which is not differentiable at x=0, so this doesn't satisfy the hypothesis that f is differentiable everywhere.\n\nI need an example where both f and g are differentiable everywhere, but f(g(x)) is not differentiable somewhere.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose g(x) is differentiable everywhere, and f is differentiable everywhere, and their composition is differentiable everywhere.\n\nWait, but according to the chain rule, if f and g are both differentiable at the appropriate points, their composition should be differentiable.\n\nIs there any exception to this?\n\nMaybe if g is differentiable everywhere, and f is differentiable everywhere, then f(g(x)) is differentiable everywhere.\n\nWait, but perhaps if g is differentiable but g' is not continuous, and f depends on g' in some way.\n\nWait, no, the chain rule only requires that g is differentiable at x and f is differentiable at g(x).\n\nSo, perhaps there is no exception, and the statement is true.\n\nBut earlier, I thought of f(x) = x^{1/3} and g(x) = x^2, but f is not differentiable at x=0, so that doesn't apply.\n\nLet me consider f(x) = x^2 and g(x) = x^3. Both are differentiable everywhere, and f(g(x)) = x^6, which is differentiable everywhere.\n\nAnother example: f(x) = e^x and g(x) = sin(x). Both are differentiable everywhere, and f(g(x)) = e^{sin(x)}, which is also differentiable everywhere.\n\nI'm starting to think that the statement is true.\n\nWait, but maybe there are functions where g is differentiable everywhere, f is differentiable everywhere, but f(g(x)) is not differentiable somewhere.\n\nI can't think of any such functions. Perhaps the statement is true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider functions where g is differentiable but g' is not continuous, but that shouldn't affect the differentiability of f(g(x)).\n\nWait, but the chain rule only requires differentiability, not continuity of the derivatives.\n\nSo, I think Statement 2 is true.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was false, but now I'm thinking it's true.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nChain rule states that if g is differentiable at x and f is differentiable at g(x), then f(g(x)) is differentiable at x.\n\nSince f and g are differentiable everywhere, f(g(x)) should be differentiable everywhere.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of f(x) = x^{1/3}, which is not differentiable at x=0, but that doesn't apply because f is not differentiable everywhere in that case.\n\nSo, I think Statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut wait, in the first part, I concluded that Statement 1 is true, and in the second part, I also concluded that Statement 2 is true.\n\nBut earlier, I thought Statement 2 might be false, but upon further reflection, it seems true.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
