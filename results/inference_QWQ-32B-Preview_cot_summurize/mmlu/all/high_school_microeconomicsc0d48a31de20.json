                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option would most effectively help the government avoid a free rider problem. Let me first make sure I understand what a free rider problem is. It's when people benefit from a good or service without paying for it, right? So, in the case of public goods, for example, everyone can enjoy them whether they've contributed to their provision or not. That can lead to people not wanting to pay for them, thinking others will cover the cost.\n\nOkay, so the options are:\n\nA. Enact stricter antitrust legislation\n\nB. Provide more complete information about the relevant goods\n\nC. Supply public goods using tax dollars\n\nD. Tax those creating negative externalities\n\nLet's look at each one.\n\nOption A: Enact stricter antitrust legislation. Antitrust laws are meant to promote competition and prevent monopolies. While that's important for economic efficiency, I'm not sure how directly it relates to avoiding the free rider problem. The free rider problem is more about public goods and collective action, not necessarily about market competition. So, maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B: Provide more complete information about the relevant goods. Information is key in markets; it helps consumers make better decisions. But in the context of a free rider problem, where the issue is about people not paying for public goods they benefit from, I'm not sure if providing more information alone would solve that. People might still choose not to pay if they think others will cover the cost. So, perhaps this isn't the most effective approach.\n\nOption C: Supply public goods using tax dollars. This seems directly related to the free rider problem. Since public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning everyone can use them without preventing others from doing so, and it's hard to stop people from using them even if they don't pay, the government can step in and fund these goods through taxes. That way, everyone contributes to the cost based on their income, and everyone benefits from the public goods. This seems like a straightforward way to ensure that public goods are provided without relying on voluntary contributions, which often lead to free riding.\n\nOption D: Tax those creating negative externalities. Negative externalities are costs imposed on society by individual actions, like pollution. Taxing these activities can encourage people to reduce them, which is a way to internalize the external costs. While this is an important economic policy, it's more about correcting market failures due to externalities rather than directly addressing the free rider problem.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems that Option C, supplying public goods using tax dollars, is the most direct and effective way for the government to avoid the free rider problem. It ensures that the necessary funds are collected through taxation to provide public goods that benefit the entire society, without relying on voluntary contributions where some might free ride.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
