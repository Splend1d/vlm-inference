A tapestry is a type of textile art, usually a large wall hanging, that features scenes or patterns woven into it. So, the primary method for creating a tapestry is weaving. Weavers use a loom to interlace threads, creating the design and structure of the tapestry.\n\nSculpting involves shaping materials like clay or stone into three-dimensional forms, which isn't related to tapestries. Baking is associated with cooking and preparing food, obviously not relevant here. Singing is a form of vocal performance, completely unrelated to creating physical artifacts like tapestries.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Weaving.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
