As the hurricane season was approaching, she hired a carpenter to build storm windows for the star-shaped and deliver them to the four houses. Because of the unique shape of the windows, the carpenter had to do all work by hand. The carpenter and woman signed a contract under which the carpenter promised to build and deliver the storm windows to all four beach houses within 30 days, and the woman promised to pay $8,000 ($2,000 per beach house) within one week of completion of the job. Two weeks after the contract was signed, a fire destroyed the carpenter's workshop, where he was storing all the completed storm windows before delivery. The carpenter then sent a letter to the woman that read:\"The fire destroyed my equipment and inventory \u0080\u0094 including the storm windows, which had been completed and which were awaiting delivery.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this contract problem. So, there's a woman who owns four beach houses, and she hired a carpenter to build and deliver storm windows to protect against hurricanes. They agreed that the carpenter would do this within 30 days for $8,000, which is $2,000 per house. But then, two weeks into the contract, a fire destroys the carpenter's workshop, and along with it, the completed storm windows that were ready to be delivered.\n\nThe carpenter writes to the woman saying that because of the fire, he can't fulfill his part of the contract and that he's broke. The woman threatens to sue for specific performance, which means she wants the court to make the carpenter do what he promised in the contract: build and deliver the storm windows.\n\nNow, the question is, in a lawsuit for specific performance, is the woman likely to succeed? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nOption A says she will succeed because the carpenter's loss of the inventory doesn't excuse his duty to perform. Option B says she will succeed because the beach houses would suffer severe damage if a hurricane hits without the storm windows. Option C says she won't succeed because the fire was an act of God, which excuses the carpenter's performance. Option D says she won't succeed because the loss of inventory makes the carpenter's performance impossible.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what specific performance is and when it's granted. Specific performance is an equitable remedy where the court orders the party who breached the contract to perform their promise as specified in the contract. It's usually granted when the subject matter of the contract is unique and monetary damages aren't sufficient.\n\nIn this case, the storm windows are custom-made for the beach houses, so they might be considered unique. Also, if a hurricane hits and the windows aren't installed, the houses could suffer severe damage, which suggests that monetary damages might not be adequate to compensate for the breach.\n\nBut there's a problem here: the carpenter's workshop burned down, destroying the completed windows. So, the carpenter is saying he can't fulfill the contract because of this unforeseen event.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether this fire excuses the carpenter's performance. Was the fire an act of God? An act of God is an event that's beyond human control, like a natural disaster, and it's something that neither party could have anticipated or prevented.\n\nIn this case, a fire is usually considered an act of God unless it was caused by someone's negligence. But the problem doesn't mention anything about the cause of the fire, so I'll assume it was accidental and not due to the carpenter's negligence.\n\nIf it's an act of God, does that excuse the carpenter's performance? Well, in contract law, if an event occurs that makes performance impossible and that event is beyond the control of the party obligated to perform, and it wasn't anticipated in the contract, then that party may be excused from performing.\n\nIn this scenario, the fire destroyed the workshop and the completed windows, which were ready to be delivered. So, the carpenter has lost the ability to deliver what was promised because of this unforeseen event.\n\nBut wait, the carpenter is supposed to build and deliver the storm windows. Even if the completed windows were destroyed, could he still build new ones? It says that the fire destroyed his equipment and inventory, and he's dead broke. So, perhaps he can't rebuild the windows within the remaining time frame because his equipment is gone and he has no money to replace them.\n\nThis might mean that performance is impossible due to the fire. Alternatively, maybe it's just difficult and expensive for him to rebuild everything, but he still could do it with some effort and investment.\n\nIn contract law, if performance is made excessively difficult or expensive by an unforeseen event, but not strictly impossible, the obligation may still be excused, especially if the event is an act of God.\n\nGiven that, it seems like options C and D are more plausible because they suggest that the woman won't succeed in her claim for specific performance due to the fire being an act of God and making performance impossible.\n\nOption A says she will succeed because the loss of inventory doesn't excuse performance. But in this case, the loss is due to an act of God, which might be a valid excuse.\n\nOption B emphasizes the potential damage to the beach houses, but even if that's true, if the carpenter's performance is excused by the fire, then specific performance might not be granted.\n\nOption C says she won't succeed because the fire was an act of God, excusing the carpenter's performance. Option D says she won't succeed because the loss of inventory makes performance impossible.\n\nBetween C and D, I think D is a better answer because it specifically addresses the impossibility of performance due to the loss of inventory and equipment. While the fire is an act of God, the key point is that it made performance impossible.\n\nMoreover, in contract law, the concept of impossibility of performance is a defense to non-performance. If performing the contract has become impossible due to an event beyond the party's control, that party may be excused from their obligations.\n\nIn this case, the fire destroyed the workshop and equipment, and the carpenter is broke, suggesting that he can't rebuild the windows within the time frame required.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the court would find that performance is impossible due to the fire, and thus, the carpenter is excused from his obligation to deliver the storm windows.\n\nSo, the woman won't succeed in her action for specific performance.\n\nWait, but option C also says she won't succeed, but for the reason that it's an unforeseeable act of God.\n\nWhile act of God is a related concept, the more precise legal doctrine is impossibility of performance.\n\nTherefore, option D seems more accurate because it directly relates to the legal principle of impossibility due to the loss of inventory.\n\nAdditionally, in contract law, if performance is impossible, the obligor is generally excused from performing, regardless of whether the event was an act of God or not.\n\nIn this case, the fire destroying the workshop and equipment, coupled with the carpenter's financial\u72b6\u51b5, suggests that performance is indeed impossible.\n\nHence, the woman won't succeed in her action for specific performance because the carpenter's performance is impossible due to the loss of inventory and equipment.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
