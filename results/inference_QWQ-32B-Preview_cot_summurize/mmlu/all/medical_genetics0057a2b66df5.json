                    "text": "So I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to find out the genotype frequency of heterozygotes assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequencies of the two alleles are given as 0.6 and 0.4. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is. It's a principle that helps us understand how allele and genotype frequencies in a population stay constant from generation to generation unless acted upon by other evolutionary forces. There are certain conditions that need to be met for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium to hold, like no mutation, no migration, no selection, random mating, and a large population size.\n\nIn this problem, we're assuming that these conditions are met, so we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equations to find the genotype frequencies.\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg equation for genotype frequencies is:\n\np\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nWhere:\n\n- p\u00b2 is the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype\n\n- 2pq is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype\n\n- q\u00b2 is the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype\n\n- p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles, with p + q = 1\n\nGiven that the frequencies of the two alleles are 0.6 and 0.4, I need to identify which one is p and which one is q. It's conventional to denote the frequency of the dominant allele as p and the recessive allele as q, but the problem doesn't specify which allele is dominant or recessive. However, for the purpose of calculating the heterozygote frequency, it doesn't matter which one is p or q because the formula for heterozygotes is 2pq, which is symmetric.\n\nSo, let's assign p = 0.6 and q = 0.4. Let's check if p + q equals 1:\n\n0.6 + 0.4 = 1\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nNow, the frequency of heterozygotes is given by 2pq. So, plugging in the values:\n\n2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 2 * 0.24 = 0.48\n\nSo, the frequency of heterozygotes should be 0.48.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.8\n\nB. 0.64\n\nC. 0.48\n\nD. 0.32\n\nOption C matches our calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe I should confirm if p and q are correctly assigned. As I mentioned earlier, the assignment is conventional based on dominance, but since we're not given that information, it shouldn't affect the calculation of 2pq.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the Hardy-Weinberg equation. No, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1 is the standard equation, and 2pq indeed represents the heterozygote frequency.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the problem is trying to trick us in some way, but given that it straightforwardly asks for the heterozygote frequency under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with given allele frequencies, there shouldn't be any trickery involved.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 0.48, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
