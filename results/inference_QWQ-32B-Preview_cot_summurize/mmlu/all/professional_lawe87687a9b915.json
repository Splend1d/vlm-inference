                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these options won't terminate a contract by operation of law. So, I have to understand each option and see under what circumstances a contract might be terminated because of them.\n\nFirst, option A: Death or insanity of a party. I know that if one of the parties to a contract dies, especially if the contract is for personal services, the contract might be terminated because the person who was supposed to perform can no longer do so. Similarly, if someone becomes insane, they might not be able to perform their obligations. So, this seems like it would terminate the contract by operation of law.\n\nNext, option B: Partial performance. Hmm, partial performance is when one party has already done part of what they agreed to do in the contract. I think that if someone has partially performed, it might not necessarily terminate the contract. In fact, it could still be ongoing, and the other party might still have obligations to fulfill. So, maybe this is the one that doesn't terminate the contract by operation of law.\n\nOption C: Destruction of the subject matter of the contract. If the thing that the contract is about is destroyed, like a specific piece of art or a unique item, then the contract can't be performed because the subject matter no longer exists. So, that would probably terminate the contract by operation of law.\n\nOption D: Supervening illegality. This means that after the contract was made, something happens that makes the contract illegal to perform. For example, new laws are passed that make the contract's subject matter illegal. In that case, the contract can't be performed legally, so it would be terminated by operation of law.\n\nSo, comparing all these, option B, partial performance, seems different. While the other options involve events that make the contract impossible or illegal to perform, partial performance is more about one party having already done part of their job. That doesn't necessarily mean the contract is terminated; it might just mean that part of the contract has been fulfilled.\n\nI think the answer is B. Partial performance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
