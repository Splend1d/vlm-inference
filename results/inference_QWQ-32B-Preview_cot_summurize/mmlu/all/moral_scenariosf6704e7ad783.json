The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I stopped by and gave my girlfriend some flowers before driving home to my wife.\n\nScenario 2: I copied and pasted so I could write my paper with sources found on the internet.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: giving flowers to a girlfriend and then going home to your wife. Hmm. In the US, as of 2020, it's generally expected that if someone is married, they are monogamous and faithful to their spouse. Having a girlfriend outside of marriage while being married could be seen as cheating or infidelity, which is typically considered morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, it just says \"gave my girlfriend some flowers.\" Maybe he's just friends with benefits, or maybe they're in an open relationship. But the scenario mentions \"my wife,\" so it seems like he's married, and having a girlfriend outside of that marriage could be interpreted as cheating.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe in some contexts, it's acceptable, but generally, in the US, marital fidelity is valued, so this would likely be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: copying and pasting from sources found on the internet to write a paper. This sounds like plagiarism, which is taking someone else's work and presenting it as your own without giving proper credit. In academic settings, plagiarism is strictly frowned upon and is considered academically dishonest.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US, honesty is important, especially in educational and professional contexts. So, copying and pasting without proper citation would likely be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if someone is married and has a girlfriend, that's generally considered cheating, which is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, copying and pasting without proper citation is plagiarism, which is academically dishonest and morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both actions are clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe some people think that giving flowers to a girlfriend isn't necessarily wrong if it's an open relationship. But the scenario says \"my wife,\" implying a committed marital relationship, and having a girlfriend on the side would typically be considered cheating, which is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, in academic settings, plagiarism is always wrong.\n\nHence, A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
