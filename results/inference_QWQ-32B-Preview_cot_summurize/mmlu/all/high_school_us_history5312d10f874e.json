Also the congressional reports of about 1840 are full of abuse of English, Scotch, Welsh immigrants as paupers, criminals, and so forth. Old citizens in Detroit of Irish and German descent have told me of the fierce tirades and propaganda directed against the great waves of Irish and Germans who came over from 1840 on for a few decades to escape civil, racial, and religious persecution in their native lands. The \"Know-Nothings,\" lineal ancestors of the Ku-Klux Klan, bitterly denounced the Irish and Germans as mongrels, scum, foreigners, and a menace to our institutions, much as other great branches of the Caucasian race of glorious history and antecedents are berated to-day\u2026.But to-day it is the Italians, Spanish, Poles, Jews, Greeks, Russians, Balkanians, and so forth, who are the racial lepers\u2026..In this bill we find racial discrimination at its worst\u2014a deliberate attempt to go back 84 years in our census taken every 10 years so that a blow may be aimed at peoples of eastern and southern Europe, particularly at our recent allies in the Great War\u2014Poland and Italy.\"\nRobert H.

                    "text": "Let's see. This excerpt is talking about how different groups of people have been persecuted and complained about when they came to America over the years. It mentions that in the past, people from England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and Germany faced abuse and persecution when they immigrated to the U.S., and now it's people from Italy, Spain, Poland, Jews, Greece, Russia, and the Balkans who are being targeted.\n\nThe author seems to be criticizing the idea of racial discrimination and is particularly upset about a \"bill\" that wants to go back 84 years in census data to target these newer groups of immigrants, especially Poland and Italy, who were recent allies in World War I.\n\nSo, the question is: \"The excerpt above is most likely a response to\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. World War I patriotism\n\nB. immigration quotas\n\nC. labor strikes\n\nD. the Red Scare\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these options refers to:\n\nA. World War I patriotism: This would be about feelings of national pride and support for the war effort during World War I.\n\nB. Immigration quotas: These are limits on the number of immigrants allowed into a country, often based on nationality or country of origin.\n\nC. Labor strikes: These are when workers stop working to protest or demand better conditions, higher wages, etc.\n\nD. The Red Scare: This was a period of fear and persecution in the U.S., mainly in the 1920s, targeting people suspected of being communists or having radical left-wing ideas.\n\nNow, looking back at the excerpt, it's clearly discussing immigration and the treatment of different immigrant groups over time. It mentions specific groups that were targeted in the past and now, and it's critiquing a bill that seems to be aiming to restrict immigration from certain countries, particularly Eastern and Southern Europe.\n\nThe mention of going back 84 years in census data suggests that there's a legislative effort to change immigration policies based on historical data, likely to limit immigration from certain regions.\n\nGiven this context, it seems that the excerpt is responding to immigration quotas\u2014specifically, to a bill that proposes restricting immigration from certain European countries.\n\nOption A, World War I patriotism, doesn't seem directly related to the content of the excerpt, which is more about immigration and discrimination.\n\nOption C, labor strikes, isn't mentioned or implied in the text.\n\nOption D, the Red Scare, while it was a period of persecution based on political beliefs, doesn't align with the focus on immigration and the specific targeting of certain ethnic groups mentioned in the excerpt.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is B, immigration quotas.\n\nTo further confirm this, I should consider the time period mentioned. The excerpt refers to a congressional record from the 68th Congress, 1st Session, in 1924. This was indeed a period when the U.S. was enacting significant immigration legislation.\n\nIn 1924, the Johnson-Reed Act, also known as the Immigration Act of 1924, was passed. This act introduced national origin quotas, which severely limited immigration from certain countries, particularly those in Eastern and Southern Europe, as well as Asia.\n\nGiven that the excerpt mentions a bill that aims to discriminate against peoples from Eastern and Southern Europe, particularly Poland and Italy, it's very plausible that this is a response to the Immigration Act of 1924 or similar legislation.\n\nMoreover, the author seems to be arguing against this discrimination, pointing out the hypocrisy of persecuting new immigrant groups just as previous groups were persecuted, and noting that some of these new immigrants were recent allies in World War I.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the excerpt is most likely a response to immigration quotas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
