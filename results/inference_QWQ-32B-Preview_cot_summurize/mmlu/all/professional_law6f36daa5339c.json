They lived together as husband and wife, and they bought a house together as tenants by the entirety. Then, he was accused and convicted of killing his second wife, and now there\u2019s a court case about the house.\n\nThe estate of the deceased wife is trying to get the house, saying that the murderer shouldn\u2019t benefit from his crime. The trial court agreed and gave the house to the estate, and now the man is appealing from prison.\n\nThe question is, under common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court\u2019s decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n\nB. Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n\nC. No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer\u2019s pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\n\nD. No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what \u201ctenants by the entirety\u201d means. From my real estate law class, I remember that it\u2019s a form of joint ownership available only to married couples, and it includes rights like right of survivorship, meaning that when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse automatically owns the entire property.\n\nBut in this case, the man was separated from his first wife but not divorced, and then he married another woman. So, was this second marriage valid? Well, if he wasn\u2019t legally divorced from the first wife, then the second marriage might be bigamous, which is illegal.\n\nSo, if the second marriage is invalid, does that affect the ownership of the property? If they bought the house as tenants by the entirety, but the marriage is invalid, maybe that affects the title.\n\nLet me think about option B first. It says yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. If the second marriage is invalid due to bigamy, then the man couldn\u2019t have validly taken title as tenants by the entirety. So, perhaps the property would be owned solely by the decedent from the beginning.\n\nBut wait, if the marriage is invalid, does that mean the ownership arrangement is invalid too? Maybe it would be treated as if they owned the property as tenants in common, each with a half interest.\n\nOption C suggests that the court would recognize the murderer\u2019s pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common. So, perhaps if the marriage is invalid, they are just tenants in common, and he still has a half interest.\n\nBut the estate is arguing that the murderer shouldn\u2019t benefit from his crime, so maybe the court would strip him of any interest in the property.\n\nOption A says yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing. That seems fair, but is there actually a legal rule that supports that?\n\nI think there is a concept called \u201cforfeiture\u201d where a person who commits a wrongful act that causes them to acquire property might be barred from retaining that property. For example, in some jurisdictions, there are laws that forfeit a murderer\u2019s interest in the victim\u2019s estate.\n\nBut in this case, it\u2019s not about the victim\u2019s estate; it\u2019s about property that was jointly owned.\n\nLet me consider option D: No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.\n\nWell, under standard property law, if two people own property as tenants by the entirety, and one dies, the surviving spouse gets the whole property. But in this case, the marriage might be invalid, so maybe it\u2019s not tenants by the entirety.\n\nAlternatively, if the marriage is invalid, perhaps the ownership is treated as tenants in common, and each owns a half interest.\n\nBut the estate is arguing that the murderer shouldn\u2019t benefit from his crime, so maybe the court would say that he can\u2019t keep his interest.\n\nI need to think about public policy here. It doesn\u2019t seem right that a murderer should be able to keep property that was jointly owned with the victim.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the estate should get the property, or perhaps the interests should be divided.\n\nOption C suggests recognizing the murderer\u2019s pre-slaying right to one-half as a tenant in common. But again, it doesn\u2019t seem fair to allow the murderer to keep that interest after killing the other owner.\n\nMoreover, if the marriage is invalid due to bigamy, then perhaps the ownership was never valid as tenants by the entirety, and it should be treated as tenants in common from the start.\n\nBut the estate is seeking to have the property entirely forfeited to them.\n\nI think the key here is whether there\u2019s a legal principle that prevents a murderer from benefiting from his crime in terms of property ownership.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, there are forfeiture statutes that prevent a person from profiting from their own wrongdoing. This is sometimes applied in cases where someone commits a tort or a crime and thereby acquires property.\n\nFor example, if someone steals something and then tries to sell it, the original owner can recover the property.\n\nSimilarly, if someone kills another person to inherit their estate, that\u2019s called \u201cslayer\u2019s rule,\u201d and in many jurisdictions, the slayer is barred from inheriting from the victim.\n\nSo, perhaps there\u2019s a similar principle here.\n\nIn this case, the man is accused of killing his second wife, with whom he owned property.\n\nIf they owned the property as tenants by the entirety, and now one has died, normally the surviving spouse would get the whole property.\n\nBut since he\u2019s accused of murder, maybe he can\u2019t claim that right.\n\nAlternatively, if the marriage is invalid due to bigamy, then perhaps the ownership was always just as tenants in common, and he has a half interest.\n\nBut again, it seems unfair for him to keep that half interest after killing the other owner.\n\nI think the court would likely apply a forfeiture principle here and strip him of any interest in the property.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct: yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n\nOption B also suggests yes, but based on the bigamy aspect.\n\nWhile bigamy might make the marriage invalid, and thus affect the ownership, I think the forfeiture principle is more directly applicable here.\n\nOption C is unlikely because recognizing the murderer\u2019s half interest seems contrary to public policy.\n\nOption D says there\u2019s no rule of law giving the estate additional rights, but I think the forfeiture principle does provide such a rule.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
