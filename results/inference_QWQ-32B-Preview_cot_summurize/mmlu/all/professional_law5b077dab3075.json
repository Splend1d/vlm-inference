                    "text": "So, I've got this scenario here about a medical malpractice case. A patient is suing a hospital because they claim the hospital staff didn't diagnose their cancer properly based on an X-ray that was taken there. Six months later, when the patient got a second opinion, the cancer was diagnosed, but by then, it had spread. Now, the hospital is asking for summary judgment, which means they're trying to get the case dismissed before it even goes to trial, based on the materials they've submitted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what summary judgment is. It's a legal mechanism that allows a court to decide a case without going to trial if there are no genuine disputes about the material facts. So, if the hospital can show that there's no dispute about the key facts, and based on those facts, they should win, then the court might grant summary judgment in their favor.\n\nThe hospital has submitted a memorandum outlining facts they say aren't in dispute, and they've attached supporting exhibits, including a report from their radiologist who says there were no signs of cancer on the X-ray. So, the hospital is probably arguing that since their radiologist didn't see any cancer, and the patient didn't have a diagnosis at that time, there was no malpractice.\n\nNow, the patient needs to raise a genuine dispute about a material fact to prevent summary judgment. That means the patient needs to show that there is at least one key fact that's in dispute, which could affect the outcome of the case.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Submit a report from the patient's expert radiologist contradicting the findings in the report of the hospital's radiologist.\n\nB. Submit an affidavit from the patient's attorney detailing his conversations with the patient's expert radiologist.\n\nC. Submit an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist with findings that contradict the report of the hospital's radiologist.\n\nD. Submit the patient's medical records showing the patient's current cancer diagnosis.\n\nOption A is about submitting a report from the patient's expert radiologist that contradicts the hospital's radiologist's report. This could be effective because it directly challenges the hospital's evidence with an expert's opinion.\n\nOption B is about the patient's attorney submitting an affidavit detailing conversations with the patient's expert radiologist. This seems less direct because it's secondhand information. The attorney's affidavit might not carry the same weight as a direct statement from the expert.\n\nOption C is similar to option A but specifies that it's an affidavit from the patient's expert radiologist. An affidavit is a written statement under oath, which can be used in court proceedings. This seems like a strong way to present the expert's opinion.\n\nOption D is about submitting the patient's medical records that show the current cancer diagnosis. While this is relevant, it might not directly address the issue of whether the hospital's radiologist should have diagnosed the cancer earlier based on the initial X-ray.\n\nComparing options A and C, both involve the patient's expert radiologist contradicting the hospital's radiologist, but option C specifies that it's an affidavit. In legal proceedings, affidavits are commonly used to present factual testimony in writing, and they are often required for summary judgment motions because they provide sworn testimony that can be considered by the court without live testimony.\n\nOption A just says \"report,\" which might be acceptable, but an affidavit is specifically sworn testimony and might be more directly admissible in the context of a summary judgment motion.\n\nOption B, the attorney's affidavit about conversations with the expert, isn't as strong because it's hearsay\u2014the attorney is relaying what the expert told them, rather than the expert speaking directly.\n\nOption D, the medical records, while important, might not directly speak to whether the hospital's radiologist should have diagnosed the cancer earlier based on the initial X-ray.\n\nTherefore, the best way for the patient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact would be to submit an affidavit from their expert radiologist that contradicts the hospital's radiologist's report. This directly addresses the hospital's evidence with expert opinion and is presented in a format suitable for summary judgment proceedings.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
