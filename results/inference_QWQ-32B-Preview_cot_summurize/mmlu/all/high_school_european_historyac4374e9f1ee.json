Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage by Edward A. Freeman. It's a bit dense, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Freeman is talking about the unification of Italy in his time, which he sees as a recent event. He's happy about Italy being united but expresses some reservations about how quickly and thoroughly it happened. Specifically, he mentions Sicily, saying that its identity seems to have been overshadowed by the mainland. It's interesting that he notes how Ireland is still recognized in the royal title, but Sicily isn't even mentioned geographically anymore. So, there's a sense of loss of individual identity here.\n\nThen, he shifts to Rome and its role in the newly unified Italy. He seems to have mixed feelings about Rome becoming the capital of Italy. On one hand, he's glad because it's a symbol of unity, but on the other hand, he's sad because it marks the end of Rome's universal or ecumenical position in Europe. The term \"\u0153cumenical\" here likely refers to Rome's historical role as a universal center, perhaps religiously and politically.\n\nFreeman mentions that Rome has become less than it was by becoming the head of an Italian kingdom. He says that by willingly becoming the capital, Rome has formally set aside its imperial traditions, which weren't abandoned even when it was made a part of a French department by brute force. This suggests that the voluntary submission to being part of Italy has had a more significant impact on Rome's identity than previous external impositions.\n\nNow, the question is asking about which Roman traditions the author laments the loss of. The options are lingual, religious, economic, and artistic.\n\nFrom the passage, it seems like Freeman is primarily concerned with Rome's political and perhaps religious traditions. He mentions the \"\u0153cumenical position and traditions\" of Rome, which could encompass both religious and political aspects, given Rome's history as the center of the Catholic Church and the former Roman Empire.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about which traditions the author laments the loss of, and we have to choose among lingual, religious, economic, and artistic.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Lingual: There's no mention of language in the passage. Freeman doesn't discuss any changes in language or linguistic traditions resulting from Italian unification.\n\nB. Religious: Given that Rome is the center of the Catholic Church, and its \"\u0153cumenical\" status might relate to its religious authority, this could be a candidate. But the passage doesn't explicitly discuss religious traditions being lost.\n\nC. Economic: There's no discussion of economic traditions or changes in the economy due to unification.\n\nD. Artistic: Similarly, there's no mention of artistic traditions.\n\nGiven that, it seems like none of these options perfectly fit, but perhaps the closest is B. Religious, because of the reference to Rome's \u0153cumenical position, which has religious connotations.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the question is misaligned with the passage, or that there's more context elsewhere in the book that would make the answer clearer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Freeman is referring to political traditions, but that option isn't listed. In that case, we might have to choose the closest match, which would be religious, as the Catholic Church has been intimately connected with Rome's political history.\n\nAnother angle to consider is that by becoming part of Italy, Rome may have lost some of its unique religious authority or at least its universal claim, as it's now tied to a national state. But again, this is inferential.\n\nIn conclusion, while the passage is rich in historical and political commentary, the specific question about which traditions Freeman laments seems a bit leading, especially since the options don't directly correspond to the main themes in the text. If I had to choose, I'd select B. Religious, but with the caveat that the passage is more about political and historical identity than specific religious practices or beliefs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
