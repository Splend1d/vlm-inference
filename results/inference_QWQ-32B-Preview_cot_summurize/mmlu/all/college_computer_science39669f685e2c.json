                    "text": "So I've got this question here about hash tables and their efficiency in solving different problems. It says that hash tables can contribute to an efficient average-case solution for all of the problems described below EXCEPT one of them. And I need to figure out which one that is.\n\nLet's list out the options again to keep them fresh in my mind:\n\nA. Counting distinct values: Given a set of n keys, determine the number of distinct key values.\n\nB. Dynamic dictionary: Support the operations of insert, delete, and search in a dictionary.\n\nC. Range search: Given values a and b, find all the records whose key value is in the range a, b.\n\nD. Symbol table lookup: Given a program identifier, find its type and address.\n\nOkay, so hash tables are known for their efficiency in handling operations like insert, delete, and search in average case scenarios. They typically offer O(1) time complexity for these operations, which is pretty darn efficient.\n\nLet's start by looking at option A: Counting distinct values. If I have a set of n keys and I want to find out how many unique values there are, using a hash table makes sense. I can insert all the keys into a hash table, and since hash tables only store unique keys, the number of entries in the hash table would give me the count of distinct values. This seems efficient.\n\nOption B is about a dynamic dictionary, supporting insert, delete, and search operations. As I mentioned earlier, hash tables are perfectly suited for this, providing efficient average-case times for all these operations.\n\nOption D is symbol table lookup, where given a program identifier, I need to find its type and address. Again, this is a classic use case for hash tables. Compilers often use hash tables for symbol tables to quickly look up variables and their attributes.\n\nNow, option C is range search: given values a and b, find all records whose key values are within that range. This seems a bit different from the other operations. With hash tables, keys are distributed based on their hash values, which don't preserve any order. So, if I have a range [a, b], how do I efficiently find all keys within that range using a hash table?\n\nHmm, in a hash table, keys are scattered based on their hash codes, so there's no inherent ordering. That means, to perform a range search, I'd probably have to iterate through all the keys and check if they fall within the range [a, b]. That would be O(n) time, which isn't very efficient, especially compared to the O(1) operations hash tables are known for.\n\nIn contrast, if I were using a balanced search tree, like an AVL tree or a red-black tree, range search can be done efficiently because these data structures maintain order. I could find all keys in a range by traversing the tree in order within the range limits, which would be O(log n + k), where k is the number of keys in the range.\n\nSo, it seems like hash tables aren't the best choice for range search operations. In fact, they don't provide an efficient way to perform range searches compared to other data structures like balanced trees or interval trees.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C: Range search.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check this. Maybe there's a way to optimize range searches with hash tables that I'm not thinking about.\n\nOne approach could be to use a hash table in conjunction with another data structure that supports range queries, like a binary search tree or an array of keys. For example, I could maintain a separate sorted array of keys alongside the hash table. Then, for range searches, I could perform a binary search on the array to find the starting and ending positions of the range and retrieve the keys within that range.\n\nHowever, this would require maintaining two data structures, which adds complexity and could negate the efficiency benefits of using a hash table in the first place.\n\nAnother idea is to use a hash table where the keys are binned into buckets based on ranges, but that might not give me the exact range I'm looking for without some adjustments.\n\nOverall, it seems like hash tables aren't naturally suited for range searches, and other data structures provide more efficient solutions for this specific problem.\n\nSo, going back to the question, hash tables can contribute to an efficient average-case solution for all of the problems described below EXCEPT one, and that exception is C. Range search.\n\nI think that makes sense. The other options\u2014counting distinct values, dynamic dictionary operations, and symbol table lookup\u2014are all tasks where hash tables excel, providing efficient average-case performance. Range search, on the other hand, is not a strength of hash tables and is better handled by other data structures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
