                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about Pence's article \"Will Cloning Harm People?\" The question is asking about his main objective in the article. There are four options:\n\nA. to use consequentialist arguments to show that cloning is immoral\n\nB. to object to consequentialist arguments against cloning\n\nC. to use Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is immoral\n\nD. to use Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is morally acceptable\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Pence's article is about. I remember that it deals with the ethics of cloning and that he criticizes certain arguments against cloning. So, perhaps option B is correct, where he is objecting to consequentialist arguments against cloning.\n\nConsequentialist arguments are those that focus on the outcomes or consequences of actions to determine their morality. So, if someone argues that cloning is wrong because of the potential bad outcomes it could lead to, that would be a consequentialist argument.\n\nPence, in his article, seems to be critiquing these types of arguments, suggesting that they are not sufficient to condemn cloning as immoral. Maybe he is arguing that even if cloning has bad consequences, that doesn't necessarily make it immoral, or something like that.\n\nOption A is the opposite: using consequentialist arguments to show cloning is immoral. But I think Pence is actually\u53cd\u5bf9 these arguments, so A might not be right.\n\nOption C mentions using Kant's humanity formulation to show cloning is immoral. Kant's humanity formulation is part of his categorical imperative, which states that we should act in ways that treat humanity, whether in oneself or in others, always as an end and never merely as a means to an end.\n\nIf Pence is using this principle to argue that cloning is immoral, then maybe C is the correct answer. But I need to remember what his actual argument was.\n\nOption D is similar but says he uses Kant's humanity formulation to show cloning is morally acceptable. This seems less likely to me, but I need to consider it.\n\nLet me think back to the article. Pence was discussing the ethical implications of cloning and was particularly critiquing arguments that base the immorality of cloning solely on its consequences. He likely argued that such approaches are insufficient and that we need to look at the act itself and its compliance with moral principles.\n\nGiven that, option B seems more accurate: he is objecting to consequentialist arguments against cloning.\n\nBut perhaps he is also incorporating Kant's ideas to make his point. Maybe he is saying that even if cloning has bad consequences, it may still be moral if it treats persons as ends in themselves, according to Kant's formulation.\n\nWait, maybe he is using Kant's humanity formulation to argue that cloning is immoral. For example, if cloning treats the clone as a means to an end, say to fulfill the parents' desires or for scientific research, then it would be immoral according to Kant.\n\nAlternatively, he might argue that cloning can be done in a way that respects the dignity of the clone, thus making it morally acceptable.\n\nI need to recall the specifics of Pence's argument.\n\nI think Pence primarily criticizes consequentialist arguments against cloning, arguing that they are not decisive in determining the morality of cloning. He might be suggesting that even if cloning leads to bad outcomes, it could still be moral if it adheres to certain deontological principles, like Kant's humanity formulation.\n\nSo, perhaps he is using Kant's humanity formulation to argue that cloning can be moral if it treats the clone as an end in itself, not just as a means to an end.\n\nBut looking back at the options, that would correspond to option D: to use Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is morally acceptable.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure if that's Pence's main objective. Maybe he is using Kant's formulation to critique consequentialist arguments.\n\nWait, perhaps his main objective is to object to consequentialist arguments against cloning and to propose a deontological approach instead.\n\nIn that case, option B seems most accurate: to object to consequentialist arguments against cloning.\n\nBut the question is asking for his main objective in the article, and the options are more specific about whether he is using consequentialist arguments or Kant's humanity formulation, and whether he is showing cloning is immoral or acceptable.\n\nI need to make a decision based on my recall of the article.\n\nI think Pence's main objective is to object to consequentialist arguments against cloning and to suggest that cloning can be morally acceptable if it complies with deontological principles, such as Kant's humanity formulation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer might be D: to use Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is morally acceptable.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because I don't clearly remember if Pence endorses cloning or criticizes it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe his main objective is to show that cloning is immoral using Kant's humanity formulation, which would be option C.\n\nI need to think carefully.\n\nIf he is using Kant's humanity formulation to argue that cloning is immoral, then C would be correct.\n\nBut if he is using it to argue that cloning can be moral, then D would be correct.\n\nI think Pence is arguing that cloning is immoral using Kant's humanity formulation, criticizing those who only use consequentialist arguments against cloning.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the right answer.\n\nBut I need to be careful because I might be misremembering.\n\nAlternatively, maybe his main objective is to object to consequentialist arguments against cloning without necessarily endorsing Kant's view on cloning.\n\nIn that case, B could be the correct answer.\n\nGiven the options, I think the best answer is C: to use Kant's humanity formulation to show that cloning is immoral.\n\nThis seems to align with Pence's likely argument that cloning is immoral because it treats the clone as a means to an end, which violates Kant's humanity formulation.\n\nTherefore, I will go with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
