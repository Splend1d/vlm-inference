So, the correct answer is C. Three.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that in some leagues or levels of play, the length of periods or the number of periods might be adjusted. For example, in some youth leagues, periods might be shorter to accommodate the players' age and skill level. But in standard professional and international ice hockey games, there are three 20-minute periods.\n\nAdditionally, if a game is tied at the end of the third period, overtime may be played. In the NHL, for example, overtime is a five-minute period played with three skaters per team (plus a goalie), and the first team to score wins. If neither team scores in overtime, the game may proceed to a shootout.\n\nBut to directly answer your question: In a standard ice hockey game, there are three periods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
