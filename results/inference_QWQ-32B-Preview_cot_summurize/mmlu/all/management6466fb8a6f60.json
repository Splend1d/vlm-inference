                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what a normative perspective is. There are four options here: A, B, C, and D. Let's see what each one means.\n\nOption A says \"The way things are.\" That sounds like describing the current state of things, maybe how society is now or how things currently operate. But I think a normative perspective is more about how things ought to be, not necessarily how they are.\n\nOption B is \"The way things are going to be.\" That seems like a predictive or futuristic perspective, anticipating what will happen in the future. Again, that's different from a normative view, which I believe is about what should be, not what will be.\n\nOption C says \"The way things should be.\" This sounds promising. A normative perspective is often about prescribing how things ought to be, based on certain values or principles. It's about setting standards or ideals for behavior or society.\n\nOption D is \"The way things were.\" That seems like a historical perspective, looking back at past conditions or states. While history can inform normative views, they are not the same thing.\n\nSo, considering these options, I think the best answer is C: \"The way things should be.\" A normative perspective is concerned with what ought to be the case, based on certain norms, values, or ideals, rather than describing what is, what will be, or what was.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that in philosophy and social sciences, a normative statement expresses what should be, as opposed to a positive statement, which describes what is. So, in that context, option C aligns with the definition of a normative perspective.\n\nLet me also think about an example. For instance, if someone says, \"Speed limits should be higher on highways because it would save time,\" that's a normative statement because it's proposing how things should be based on a particular benefit. On the other hand, \"The current speed limit on highways is 65 mph\" is a positive statement describing the existing condition.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
