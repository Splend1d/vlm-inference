                    "text": "So I've got this problem about the water level in a bay changing sinusoidally with the tides. It says that at high tide today at 8 A.M., the water level was 15 feet, and then at low tide 6 hours later at 2 P.M., it was 3 feet. I need to find out how fast the water level was dropping at noon today, which is at 12 P.M. The options are given in feet per hour.\n\nOkay, first, I need to model the water level as a sinusoidal function. Since it's varying sinusoidally, I can probably use a sine or cosine function to represent the water level over time. Let's see.\n\nI know that the general form of a sinusoidal function is:\n\nh(t) = A * sin(B(t - C)) + D\n\nor\n\nh(t) = A * cos(B(t - C)) + D\n\nwhere:\n\n- A is the amplitude,\n\n- B relates to the period,\n\n- C is the phase shift,\n\n- D is the vertical shift.\n\nGiven that it's high tide at 8 A.M. and low tide at 2 P.M., with a time difference of 6 hours, I can figure out the period of the function. Since the tide goes from high to low in 6 hours, the full period would be twice that, which is 12 hours. So, the period T is 12 hours.\n\nNow, the period of a sine or cosine function is given by T = 2\u03c0 / B, so I can solve for B:\n\nB = 2\u03c0 / T = 2\u03c0 / 12 = \u03c0 / 6\n\nNext, I need to determine the amplitude A. The amplitude is half the difference between the high tide and low tide levels. The high tide is 15 feet and low tide is 3 feet, so the difference is 12 feet, and half of that is 6 feet. So, A = 6.\n\nNow, for the vertical shift D. The vertical shift is the average of the high and low tide levels. So, D = (15 + 3) / 2 = 9 feet.\n\nNow, I need to decide whether to use sine or cosine. Since the high tide is at 8 A.M., and I might want to set t = 0 at 8 A.M., using cosine might be more straightforward because cosine functions have their maximum at t = 0.\n\nSo, let's set t = 0 at 8 A.M. Then, at t = 0, h(t) should be 15 feet, which is the high tide.\n\nSo, h(t) = A * cos(B(t - C)) + D\n\nBut since I'm setting t = 0 at 8 A.M., and high tide is at that time, the phase shift C should be 0.\n\nSo, h(t) = 6 * cos((\u03c0/6)t) + 9\n\nWait a minute, let's check if that makes sense. At t = 0, h(0) = 6 * cos(0) + 9 = 6 * 1 + 9 = 15 feet, which matches the high tide at 8 A.M.\n\nAt t = 6 hours (2 P.M.), h(6) = 6 * cos((\u03c0/6)*6) + 9 = 6 * cos(\u03c0) + 9 = 6 * (-1) + 9 = 3 feet, which matches the low tide at 2 P.M.\n\nGreat, so the function h(t) = 6 * cos((\u03c0/6)t) + 9 represents the water level in feet, with t in hours since 8 A.M.\n\nNow, I need to find how fast the water level was dropping at noon today. Noon is 12 P.M., which is 4 hours after 8 A.M. So, t = 4.\n\nBut actually, 8 A.M. is t = 0, 9 A.M. is t = 1, 10 A.M. is t = 2, 11 A.M. is t = 3, and 12 P.M. (noon) is t = 4.\n\nSo, I need to find the rate of change of h(t) at t = 4 hours.\n\nTo find the rate of change, I need to find the derivative of h(t) with respect to t.\n\nh(t) = 6 * cos((\u03c0/6)t) + 9\n\nSo, h'(t) = 6 * (-sin((\u03c0/6)t)) * (\u03c0/6) = -\u03c0 * sin((\u03c0/6)t)\n\nTherefore, h'(t) = -\u03c0 * sin((\u03c0/6)t)\n\nNow, evaluate h'(4):\n\nh'(4) = -\u03c0 * sin((\u03c0/6)*4) = -\u03c0 * sin(2\u03c0/6) = -\u03c0 * sin(\u03c0/3)\n\nI know that sin(\u03c0/3) = \u221a3/2\n\nSo, h'(4) = -\u03c0 * (\u221a3/2) = -\u03c0\u221a3 / 2\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the water level is dropping.\n\nThe question asks for the rate in feet per hour, so the magnitude is \u03c0\u221a3 / 2 feet per hour.\n\nBut looking at the options, option B is \u03c0\u221a3 / 2, which matches what I got.\n\nWait, but the question says \"how fast was the water level dropping,\" and it gives options including numerical values like 3 and 3\u221a3, and \u03c0\u221a3 and \u03c0\u221a3 / 2.\n\nI need to see if \u03c0\u221a3 / 2 is one of the options.\n\nLooking back, option B is \u03c0\u221a3 / 2, so that seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I need to consider units or something else.\n\nWait, the problem says the water level was dropping at noon today, and I need to find the rate in feet per hour.\n\nI derived h'(t) = -\u03c0 * sin((\u03c0/6)t), and at t = 4, h'(4) = -\u03c0\u221a3 / 2.\n\nSince the question is about how fast the water level was dropping, it's asking for the absolute value of the rate, which is \u03c0\u221a3 / 2 feet per hour.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option B.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using sine instead of cosine.\n\nSuppose I use a sine function instead.\n\nIf I set t = 0 at 8 A.M., which is high tide, and sine has a maximum at \u03c0/2, I could set the function accordingly.\n\nSo, perhaps h(t) = A * sin(B(t - C)) + D\n\nTo have a maximum at t = 0, I need sin(B*(-C)) = 1, which would require B*(-C) = \u03c0/2.\n\nBut this seems more complicated than using cosine.\n\nGiven that my cosine function worked fine and gave me the correct answer, I think sticking with that is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the general sinusoidal function h(t) = A * cos(Bt - C) + D.\n\nBut again, since I set t = 0 at 8 A.M., and it's high tide, C = 0 as I did before.\n\nSo, I think my approach was correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B: \u03c0\u221a3 / 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi \\sqrt{3}}{2}} \\]"
