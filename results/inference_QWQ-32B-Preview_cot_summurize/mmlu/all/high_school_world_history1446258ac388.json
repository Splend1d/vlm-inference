                    "text": "So I've got this poem to look at, and it's about something that happened in Sharpeville, South Africa, back in 1960. From what I can gather, there was a protest where black South Africans didn't carry their identity and residence papers as required, and they gathered in front of police stations without them. In most places, these protests were peaceful, but in Sharpeville, the police opened fire on the crowd.\n\nThe poem seems to be remembering this event and highlighting its significance. It mentions that what's important about Sharpeville isn't just the number of people who died\u2014seventy\u2014but also the way they were shot in the back while retreating, unarmed and defenseless. It even describes a particularly tragic scene where a bullet went through a mother's back and killed the child in her arms.\n\nThe poem then goes on to say that Sharpeville is important because it epitomized oppression and clearly defined the racial dominance and the will to oppress in South African society. It seems like the poet is using this event to draw attention to the broader system of discrimination that was in place.\n\nAt the end, there's a mention of \"apartheid,\" which is described with \"snarling guns,\" and there's a reference to \"the blood the rich lust after\" and \"South Africa spills dust.\" The poem concludes by urging readers to remember Sharpeville, remember the \"bullet-in-the-back day,\" and to remember the unquenchable will for freedom, the dead, and to be glad.\n\nNow, the question is asking about a discriminatory system referred to in the poem, and the options are:\n\nA. Jim Crow.\n\nB. spheres of influence.\n\nC. Boer division.\n\nD. apartheid.\n\nFrom reading the poem, it's clear that the system being referred to is apartheid, especially since it's explicitly mentioned in the poem. Apartheid was the system of racial segregation and discrimination that was enforced in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s. It privileged white South Africans and oppressed people of color, particularly blacks, in various aspects of life, including housing, education, employment, and movement.\n\nJim Crow, on the other hand, refers to the laws and customs in the United States that enforced racial segregation, primarily in the southern states, from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. Spheres of influence typically refer to areas where a foreign power has considerable control or influence, often through economic or political means. Boer division isn't a term I'm familiar with, but \"Boer\" refers to the descendants of the Dutch settlers in South Africa, and there were conflicts between the Boers and the British, as well as between the Boers and the native African populations.\n\nGiven that the poem is specifically about an event in South Africa and mentions apartheid directly, the correct answer is undoubtedly D. apartheid.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the poem is using Sharpeville as a symbol of the broader apartheid regime's oppression. The event at Sharpeville was a turning point in the history of apartheid, as it led to the banning of the Pan-Africanist Congress and the African National Congress, and it internationalized the struggle against apartheid.\n\nThe poem seems to be encouraging remembrance of the sacrifices made by those who protested against apartheid and the ongoing struggle for freedom. It's a call to not forget the violence and injustice of the past while recognizing the resilience and determination of those who fought for equality.\n\nIn conclusion, the discriminatory system referred to in the poem is apartheid, which was the official policy of racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
