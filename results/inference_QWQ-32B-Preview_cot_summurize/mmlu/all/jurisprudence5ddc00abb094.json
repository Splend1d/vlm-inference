                    "text": "Dworkin supports liberal egalitarianism primarily because it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck. This aligns with his philosophical views on equality and justice.\n\nIn his work, Dworkin argues that a just society should ensure that individual life outcomes are not determined by factors beyond a person's control, such as their social status at birth or natural endowments. Instead, he believes that people should be held responsible for the choices they make.\n\nLiberal egalitarianism seeks to level the playing field by compensating for these unchosen circumstances, allowing individuals to shape their lives according to their own values and preferences. This is why option A is the correct answer.\n\nOption B, \"Because liberty is more important than equality,\" doesn't accurately capture Dworkin's position. While Dworkin values liberty, he doesn't prioritize it over equality. Instead, he tries to reconcile both values in a way that respects individual autonomy and ensures fair equality of opportunity.\n\nOption C, \"Because a market economy is just,\" is also incorrect. Dworkin is critical of unfettered market economies because they can lead to inequalities based on luck rather than merit or effort. He argues for a more regulated approach to ensure that economic advantages are distributed justly.\n\nOption D, \"Because the state is the best arbiter of equality between individuals,\" is too vague. While Dworkin believes the state has a role in promoting equality, his support for liberal egalitarianism is based on principled reasons related to fairness and personal responsibility, not merely on the state's authority.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate reason why Dworkin supports liberal egalitarianism is that it attempts to give effect to personal choice over individual luck, which is option A."
