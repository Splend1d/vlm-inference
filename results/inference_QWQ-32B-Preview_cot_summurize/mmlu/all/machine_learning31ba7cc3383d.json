                    "text": "Let's dive into these statements about Support Vector Machines (SVMs). I'll go through each one and see what's true and what's not.\n\n**Statement A: For two-dimensional data points, the separating hyperplane learnt by a linear SVM will be a straight line.**\n\nHmm, in two dimensions, a hyperplane is indeed a straight line. SVMs aim to find the hyperplane that best separates the classes with the maximum margin. So, for linearly separable data in two dimensions, the separator should be a straight line. That sounds correct.\n\n**Statement B: In theory, a Gaussian kernel SVM cannot model any complex separating hyperplane.**\n\nNow, Gaussian kernels are known for their ability to handle non-linearly separable data by mapping inputs into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separator can be found. The Gaussian kernel, also known as the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, is very flexible and can model complex decision boundaries. So, this statement seems false because Gaussian kernel SVMs can model complex separating hyperplanes.\n\n**Statement C: For every kernel function used in a SVM, one can obtain an equivalent closed-form basis expansion.**\n\nThis is an interesting one. Kernel functions in SVMs allow us to compute the dot product in high-dimensional space without explicitly performing the transformation. Not all kernel functions have a known closed-form basis expansion. For example, the Gaussian kernel corresponds to an infinite-dimensional feature space, so there isn't a finite closed-form basis expansion for it. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Statement D: Overfitting in an SVM is not a function of the number of support vectors.**\n\nOverfitting in SVMs can be influenced by several factors, including the choice of kernel, the regularization parameter C, and the kernel parameters. The number of support vectors can be indicative of model complexity; generally, a larger number of support vectors might suggest a more complex model, which could lead to overfitting. However, it's not a direct function, and other factors play a role as well. So, this statement is a bit tricky, but I think it's false because the number of support vectors can be related to overfitting.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- A: True\n\n- B: False\n\n- C: False\n\n- D: False\n\nSo, only statement A is true regarding SVMs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
