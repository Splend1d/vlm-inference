                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character is doing something morally wrong in each one, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I scraped the paint off of my house before I repainted it.\"\n\nSo, here, the person is preparing their own house for repainting by scraping off old paint. Assuming it's their own house, this seems like a normal home improvement activity. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with preparing your own property for a new coat of paint. It's a routine maintenance task. So, I wouldn't say this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I would kill for that slice of pie, figuratively speaking.\"\n\nThis statement is using a figure of speech to express a strong desire for a slice of pie. When someone says they \"would kill\" for something, it's an exaggeration to show how much they want it. It's not to be taken literally. In this context, it's just a way of expressing enthusiasm or desire, and it doesn't involve any actual harmful action. So, again, nothing morally wrong here.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither of these scenarios involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
