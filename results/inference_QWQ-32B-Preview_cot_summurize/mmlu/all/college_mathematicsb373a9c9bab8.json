                    "text": "So I've got this problem about a ladder sliding down a wall. The ladder is 9 meters long, leaning against a vertical wall on level ground. The bottom end of the ladder is being moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, and I need to find out how fast the top end is sliding downward when it's 3 meters above the ground.\n\nOkay, first things first. This seems like a related rates problem in calculus, where two things are changing with respect to time, and they're related to each other through some equation. Here, the two things are the distance of the bottom of the ladder from the wall (let's call that x) and the height of the top of the ladder on the wall (let's call that y). The ladder's length is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the wall, ground, and ladder, so it's a constant 9 meters.\n\nSo, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate x and y:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 9^2\n\nThat is,\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 81\n\nNow, both x and y are functions of time t, so I can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to t to find the rates of change:\n\n2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nSimplifying,\n\nx(dx/dt) + y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nI need to find dy/dt when y = 3 meters, and I know that dx/dt = 2 m/s (since the bottom is being moved away at 2 m/s).\n\nSo, plugging in the known values:\n\nx*(2) + 3*(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, I need to find x when y = 3. I can use the Pythagorean theorem again:\n\nx^2 + 3^2 = 81\n\nx^2 + 9 = 81\n\nx^2 = 72\n\nx = sqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2)\n\nSo, x = 6*sqrt(2) meters when y = 3 meters.\n\nNow, plug x back into the differentiated equation:\n\n(6*sqrt(2))*(2) + 3*(dy/dt) = 0\n\n12*sqrt(2) + 3*(dy/dt) = 0\n\nNow, solve for dy/dt:\n\n3*(dy/dt) = -12*sqrt(2)\n\ndy/dt = -12*sqrt(2)/3\n\ndy/dt = -4*sqrt(2) m/s\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the height is decreasing, which makes sense since the ladder is sliding down. So, the speed at which the top is sliding downward is 4*sqrt(2) m/s.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 12*sqrt(2)\n\nB. 6*sqrt(2)\n\nC. 4*sqrt(2)\n\nD. 1/(2*sqrt(2))\n\nOption C matches the answer I got.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with x^2 + y^2 = 81\n\nDifferentiate: 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nSimplify: x(dx/dt) + y(dy/dt) = 0\n\nGiven: dx/dt = 2 m/s, y = 3 m\n\nFind x when y = 3:\n\nx^2 + 9 = 81\n\nx^2 = 72\n\nx = 6*sqrt(2)\n\nPlug into the equation:\n\n(6*sqrt(2))*(2) + 3*(dy/dt) = 0\n\n12*sqrt(2) + 3*(dy/dt) = 0\n\n3*(dy/dt) = -12*sqrt(2)\n\ndy/dt = -4*sqrt(2) m/s\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the ratio of the rates. Since the ladder, wall, and ground form a right triangle, and the ladder is moving at a constant rate horizontally, the vertical speed should be related through the trigonometric functions, but I think the Pythagorean theorem is the straightforward approach here.\n\nI don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is 4*sqrt(2) m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}} \\]"
