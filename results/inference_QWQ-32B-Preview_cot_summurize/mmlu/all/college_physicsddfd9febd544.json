                    "text": "So I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nFirst, there's a proton that starts at rest and is accelerated through a potential difference V. That means it gains some kinetic energy from that potential difference. I remember that the kinetic energy gained by a particle when accelerated through a potential difference V is given by KE = qV, where q is the charge of the particle. Since it's a proton, q is positive, so the kinetic energy is positive, meaning the proton speeds up.\n\nAfter being accelerated, the proton moves in the +z-direction. So, its velocity is in the +z-direction.\n\nThen, it passes through a region where there are both a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction. The problem says that in this setup, the proton's trajectory is not affected. That means that the net force on the proton in this region is zero, so it continues moving in a straight line with constant velocity.\n\nOkay, so in this first scenario, the electric and magnetic fields are set up in such a way that their combined force on the proton cancels out, leaving no deflection.\n\nNow, the experiment is repeated, but with a potential difference of 2V instead of V. So, the proton is accelerated through a larger potential difference, which means it gains more kinetic energy and thus has a higher speed in the +z-direction.\n\nThe question is, in this second scenario, how is the proton deflected?\n\nI need to figure out what happens to the proton when it's moving faster through the same electric and magnetic fields, and why its trajectory is deflected in a particular direction.\n\nFirst, let's recall the forces involved.\n\nThe electric force on the proton is given by F_e = qE, where E is the electric field. Since E is in the +x-direction and q is positive, the electric force is in the +x-direction.\n\nThe magnetic force on the proton is given by F_b = qv \u00d7 B, where v is the velocity of the proton and B is the magnetic field. The velocity is in the +z-direction, and B is in the +y-direction. So, using the right-hand rule for the cross product, v \u00d7 B would be in the +x-direction.\n\nWait, let's double-check that. Point your right hand in the direction of v (thumb in +z), then curl your fingers in the direction of B (+y). Your palm should face in the direction of v \u00d7 B. So, if thumb is up (+z), and fingers point to the right (+y), then the palm faces forward, which is +x direction. So, yes, F_b is in the +x-direction.\n\nIn the first scenario, both F_e and F_b are in the +x-direction. But the problem says that the proton's trajectory is not affected, meaning the net force is zero. That can only happen if the electric and magnetic forces cancel each other out. But both are in the +x-direction, so they can't cancel unless one of them is zero, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the magnetic force is in the -x-direction. Let me check again. Using the right-hand rule: thumb in +z, fingers in +y, palm faces forward, which is +x. So, it's still +x. But if the magnetic force is in +x and electric force is in +x, they can't cancel unless one is negative, which doesn't make sense because q and E are both positive.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the signs more carefully. The electric field is in +x, and q is positive, so F_e is in +x. The velocity is in +z, magnetic field in +y, so v \u00d7 B is in +x, so F_b is in +x.\n\nBut the problem says that in the first scenario, with potential difference V, the proton's trajectory is not affected. That means net force is zero. But both forces are in +x, so they can't cancel unless maybe the magnetic force is adjusted to be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the electric force.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation here. Maybe the magnetic force is actually in the -x direction.\n\nLet me try again. Velocity is in +z, magnetic field in +y. Using the right-hand rule: thumb in +z, fingers in +y, palm faces forward, which is +x. So, F_b is in +x.\n\nBut if the magnetic force is in +x and electric force is in +x, they can't cancel unless one is negative. Maybe there's a mistake in assuming the direction of the magnetic force.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the magnetic field is in -y direction, not +y. Let me check the problem again.\n\n\" a uniform electric field E in the +x-direction and a uniform magnetic field B in the +y-direction\"\n\nNo, it's definitely +y. So, perhaps I need to consider the signs differently.\n\nWait, maybe the proton is being deflected in such a way that the forces cancel, but perhaps in the second scenario, with higher speed, the forces no longer cancel.\n\nLet's think about it differently. In the first scenario, with potential difference V, the proton's speed is v, and the forces are F_e = qE and F_b = qvB.\n\nFor the trajectory to be unaffected, F_e + F_b = 0.\n\nBut both F_e and F_b are in +x direction, so F_e + F_b = qE + qvB = q(E + vB) = 0.\n\nSince q is positive and not zero, E + vB = 0.\n\nSo, E + vB = 0, which implies E = -vB.\n\nBut E is in +x and vB is in +x, so their sum can't be zero unless B is in the opposite direction, but the problem says B is in +y.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the direction of the magnetic force.\n\nLet me try using the right-hand rule again. Velocity is in +z, magnetic field in +y, so v \u00d7 B should be in +x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the cross product.\n\nv = (0, 0, v_z)\n\nB = (0, B_y, 0)\n\nv \u00d7 B = (v_z * 0 - 0 * B_y, 0 * 0 - v_z * 0, v_z * B_y - 0 * 0) = (0, 0, v_z B_y)\n\nWait, in Cartesian coordinates, v \u00d7 B = (v_y B_z - v_z B_y, v_z B_x - v_x B_z, v_x B_y - v_y B_x)\n\nGiven v = (0, 0, v_z), B = (0, B_y, 0)\n\nSo, v \u00d7 B = (0 * 0 - v_z * B_y, v_z * 0 - 0 * 0, 0 * B_y - 0 * 0) = ( -v_z B_y, 0, 0 )\n\nSo, F_b = q v \u00d7 B = q ( -v_z B_y, 0, 0 ) = ( -q v_z B_y, 0, 0 )\n\nTherefore, the magnetic force is in the -x direction.\n\nAh, that's my mistake earlier. Using the right-hand rule correctly, the magnetic force is in the -x direction, not +x.\n\nSo, F_e = qE in +x direction, F_b = -q v B in -x direction.\n\nIn the first scenario, F_e + F_b = qE - q v B = 0, which implies E = v B.\n\nSo, in the first scenario, E = v B, where v is the speed of the proton after being accelerated through V.\n\nNow, in the second scenario, the proton is accelerated through 2V, so its kinetic energy is KE = q * 2V.\n\nSince KE = (1/2) m v^2, we have (1/2) m v^2 = q * 2V, so v^2 = (4 q V) / m, meaning v is sqrt(4 q V / m) = 2 sqrt(q V / m).\n\nIn the first scenario, v = sqrt(2 q V / m), so in the second scenario, v is doubled.\n\nNow, in the second scenario, E is still E, B is still B, but v is doubled.\n\nSo, F_e = q E (in +x direction)\n\nF_b = q v B (in -x direction)\n\nNet force F_net = F_e + F_b = q E - q (2 v) B\n\nBut from the first scenario, E = v B, so F_net = q v B - q 2 v B = - q v B\n\nSo, F_net = - q v B, which is in the -x direction.\n\nTherefore, the proton would be deflected in the -x direction.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this.\n\nGiven that in the first scenario, E = v B, where v is the speed from V.\n\nIn the second scenario, v' = sqrt(4 q V / m) = 2 sqrt(q V / m) = 2 v\n\nSo, E = v B, but now v' = 2 v.\n\nTherefore, F_b' = q v' B = q (2 v) B = 2 q v B\n\nF_e = q E = q v B\n\nSo, F_net = F_e - F_b' = q v B - 2 q v B = - q v B, which is in the -x direction.\n\nTherefore, the proton is deflected in the -x direction.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. deflected in the -x-direction.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the Lorentz force law more carefully.\n\nThe Lorentz force is F = q (E + v \u00d7 B)\n\nIn the first scenario, E + v \u00d7 B = 0, so trajectory is unaffected.\n\nIn the second scenario, with v' = 2 v, F = q (E + v' \u00d7 B) = q (E + 2 v \u00d7 B) = q (E + 2 (-B_y v_z, 0, 0 )) = q (E - 2 B_y v_z, 0, 0 )\n\nFrom the first scenario, E + v \u00d7 B = 0, so E + (-B_y v_z, 0, 0 ) = 0, which implies E = B_y v_z in the -x direction.\n\nWait, no. Earlier calculation shows E = v B, with E in +x and v B in +x, but according to the correct direction of F_b, it's in -x.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to be careful with signs.\n\nFrom the first scenario:\n\nE is in +x, v \u00d7 B is in -x, and they cancel, so E = v B in magnitude, with E in +x and v \u00d7 B in -x.\n\nThen, in the second scenario, v is doubled, so v' = 2 v.\n\nTherefore, F_b' = q v' \u00d7 B = 2 q v \u00d7 B = -2 q v B in +x.\n\nWait, no, v \u00d7 B is in -x, so F_b' = -2 q v B in -x.\n\nF_e = q E in +x.\n\nSo, F_net = F_e + F_b' = q E - 2 q v B.\n\nFrom the first scenario, E = v B, so F_net = q v B - 2 q v B = - q v B, in -x direction.\n\nYes, this confirms the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the proton is deflected in the -x direction.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. deflected in the -x-direction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
