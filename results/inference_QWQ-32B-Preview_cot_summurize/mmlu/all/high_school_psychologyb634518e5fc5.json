But in reality, seven girls in the class also got perfect scores, and only two boys did. So, Shafi is ignoring the bigger picture and focusing only on examples that confirm his preconceived notion.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Hindsight bias - that's when people believe they knew something was going to happen after it actually did. Doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nB. Confirmation bias - that's when people favor information that confirms their beliefs and ignore evidence that contradicts them. This seems pretty relevant because Shafi is only paying attention to the boys' perfect scores and ignoring the girls'.\n\nC. Functional fixedness - that's when people can't think of new ways to use an object beyond its usual function. Doesn't apply here.\n\nD. Proactive interference - that's when older memories interfere with the recall of new information. Doesn't seem related to this scenario.\n\nSo, based on this, I think confirmation bias is the best answer. Shafi is confirming his belief that boys are better at math by focusing on the boys' perfect scores and ignoring the larger number of girls who also achieved perfect scores.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Is there any hint of hindsight bias here? Well, Shafi is making an argument after the test scores are known, but it's not about predicting the outcomes beforehand. So, probably not hindsight bias.\n\nFunctional fixedness doesn't apply because there are no objects being used in a rigid way.\n\nProactive interference also doesn't seem relevant here, as there's no mention of memory recall issues.\n\nTherefore, confirmation bias seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
