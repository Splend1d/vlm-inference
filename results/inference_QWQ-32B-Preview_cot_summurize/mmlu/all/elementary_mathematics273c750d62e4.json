                    "text": "So I have this problem here. A teacher buys some folders: 5 boxes of red folders, each containing 36 folders, and 6 boxes of blue folders, each containing 32 folders. I need to find out the total number of folders and see which option is closest: A. 275, B. 380, C. 440, or D. 550.\n\nFirst, I think I should calculate the total number of red folders and the total number of blue folders separately, and then add them together to get the overall total.\n\nStarting with the red folders: there are 5 boxes, each with 36 folders. So, 5 times 36 should give me the total number of red folders.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 5 times 36. Well, 5 times 30 is 150, and 5 times 6 is 30. So, 150 plus 30 is 180. So, there are 180 red folders.\n\nNext, the blue folders: 6 boxes, each with 32 folders. So, 6 times 32 should give me the total number of blue folders.\n\n6 times 32: I can think of it as 6 times 30 is 180, and 6 times 2 is 12. So, 180 plus 12 is 192. So, there are 192 blue folders.\n\nNow, I need to add the red and blue folders together: 180 plus 192.\n\nLet's add those up: 180 plus 190 is 370, and then plus 2 more is 372. So, the total number of folders is 372.\n\nNow, I need to see which option is closest to 372. Looking at the choices:\n\nA. 275 - that's way below 372.\n\nB. 380 - that's just a bit above 372.\n\nC. 440 - that's quite a bit above 372.\n\nD. 550 - that's even further above.\n\nSo, between 380 and 440, 372 is closer to 380 because 380 minus 372 is 8, whereas 440 minus 372 is 68. So, 8 is less than 68, meaning 372 is closer to 380.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, red folders: 5 times 36. Yes, 5 times 30 is 150, plus 5 times 6 is 30, totaling 180. That seems correct.\n\nBlue folders: 6 times 32. 6 times 30 is 180, plus 6 times 2 is 12, totaling 192. That also seems correct.\n\nAdding 180 and 192: 180 plus 190 is 370, plus 2 more is indeed 372.\n\nNow, looking at the options, 372 is closer to 380 than to 440.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the differences:\n\n- 372 minus 275 is 97.\n\n- 380 minus 372 is 8.\n\n- 440 minus 372 is 68.\n\n- 550 minus 372 is 178.\n\nSo, the smallest difference is 8, which is between 372 and 380.\n\nTherefore, the closest number to the total number of folders is 380.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if 372 is closer to 380 or to 440. Let's see the mid-point between 380 and 440 is 410. Since 372 is below 410, it's closer to 380.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 380.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\n- Calculated the total number of red folders: \\(5 \\times 36 = 180\\)\n- Calculated the total number of blue folders: \\(6 \\times 32 = 192\\)\n- Found the sum of red and blue folders: \\(180 + 192 = 372\\)\n- Determined that 372 is closest to 380 among the given options."
