                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: The set of integers Z with the binary operation \"*\" defined as a*b = a + b + 1 for a, b in Z, is a group. I need to find the identity element of this group. The options are A. 0, B. 1, C. -1, D. 12.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall what an identity element is in the context of a group. An identity element, let's call it e, is an element such that for any element a in the group, a*e = e*a = a. So, in this case, using the operation defined, a*e = a + e + 1 should equal a, and similarly e*a = e + a + 1 should equal a.\n\nSince the operation is commutative (because addition is commutative), I only need to worry about one of these equations. Let's go with a*e = a + e + 1 = a.\n\nSo, a + e + 1 = a.\n\nNow, I need to solve for e in terms of a.\n\nSubtracting a from both sides, I get e + 1 = 0.\n\nThen, subtracting 1 from both sides, e = -1.\n\nWait, that was straightforward. So, the identity element is -1.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure.\n\nIf e = -1, then a*(-1) = a + (-1) + 1 = a - 1 + 1 = a, which is what I want.\n\nSimilarly, (-1)*a = -1 + a + 1 = a.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, C. -1 is the correct choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see what happens if I pick some of the other options.\n\nLet's try A. 0.\n\nIf e = 0, then a*0 = a + 0 + 1 = a + 1, which is not equal to a unless a = -1. But for all a in Z, this isn't true. So, 0 is not the identity.\n\nOption B. 1.\n\na*1 = a + 1 + 1 = a + 2, which is not equal to a. So, 1 is not the identity.\n\nOption D. 12.\n\na*12 = a + 12 + 1 = a + 13, which is not equal to a. So, 12 is not the identity.\n\nTherefore, the only correct choice is C. -1.\n\nJust to make sure there's no trick here, let's confirm if -1 satisfies the condition for all a in Z.\n\nTake a = 5, 5*(-1) = 5 + (-1) + 1 = 5, which is correct.\n\nTake a = -3, (-3)*(-1) = -3 + (-1) + 1 = -3, which is correct.\n\nTake a = 0, 0*(-1) = 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0, which is correct.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer is C. -1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
