                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a resort owner and an electrician. Let's break it down step by step to understand what's going on and determine the electrician's proper measure of recovery if the owner was legally justified in discharging him.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between the resort owner and the electrician for installing lighting fixtures on the resort property. The contract specifies that the work must be completed by December 1, which is the resort's opening date, and the electrician is to be paid $5,000 upon completion.\n\nBefore starting the job, the electrician inspected the property and determined that 500 lighting fixtures were needed. By November 15, he had installed 150 fixtures. That same evening, the owner inspected the property and found that the installed fixtures didn't provide adequate lighting. The next day, the owner discharged the electrician and hired a lighting specialist to finish the job, who installed the remaining 350 fixtures and completed the work on December 1.\n\nNow, the electrician is suing the owner, and we need to figure out what the electrician is entitled to recover if the owner was legally justified in discharging him.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. $7,000.00\n\nB. $3,500.00\n\nC. Quantum meruit for the reasonable value of his services rendered in installing the 150 fixtures.\n\nD. Nothing, because the electrician did not complete performance of the entire job.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the legal principles at play here. The owner discharged the electrician, and it's being determined whether this discharge was legally justified. If it was justified, that means the owner had a valid reason to terminate the contract, perhaps due to the electrician's breach of contract or failure to perform as agreed.\n\nIn contract law, if a party breaches the contract, the other party may be entitled to damages. In this case, the electrician didn't complete the job, so the owner hired someone else to finish it.\n\nOption D suggests that the electrician gets nothing because he didn't complete the entire job. However, in contract law, even if a party doesn't complete the job, they might still be entitled to compensation for the work they've already done, especially if they were wrongfully terminated.\n\nOption C mentions quantum meruit, which is a legal doctrine that allows for recovery based on the reasonable value of services rendered when no contract exists or when the contract is void or rescinded. However, in this case, there is a contract, so quantum meruit might not be the applicable measure of recovery.\n\nOption A proposes $7,000, which seems higher than the contract price of $5,000, so that might not make sense.\n\nOption B suggests $3,500, which is half of $7,000, but again, without a clear basis.\n\nWait a minute. Maybe the $7,000 comes from the $5,000 contract price plus some additional costs, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet's consider the concept of quantum meruit again. Quantum meruit is typically used when there's no contract or when the contract doesn't cover the services provided. But here, there is a contract, so the electrician might be entitled to damages for breach of contract rather than quantum meruit.\n\nIf the owner discharged the electrician without justification, the electrician could sue for breach of contract and seek the contract price minus any damages caused by his own breach. However, in this scenario, it's being determined that the owner was legally justified in discharging the electrician, which suggests that the electrician breached the contract.\n\nSo, if the electrician breached the contract, the owner can terminate the contract and is only required to pay for the work done up to the point of termination, minus any damages caused by the breach.\n\nIn this case, the electrician installed 150 fixtures, but the owner found that the lighting was inadequate. So, the electrician might not be entitled to the full contract price.\n\nAlternatively, if the electrician's work was defective or inadequate, the owner might be entitled to deduct the cost of correcting the\u7f3a\u9677 from the amount owed to the electrician.\n\nBut the question is asking for the electrician's proper measure of recovery, assuming the owner was legally justified in discharging him.\n\nGiven that, it's likely that the electrician is entitled to compensation for the work he's already done, which is the 150 fixtures, but perhaps at a reduced rate due to the inadequate lighting.\n\nHowever, quantum meruit is probably not the correct term here because there is an existing contract. Instead, the electrician might be entitled to damages for partial performance.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is C, quantum meruit, because the contract is terminated due to the electrician's breach, and the owner is only required to pay for the value of the work done.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because quantum meruit is usually applied in the absence of a contract or when the contract doesn't cover the services.\n\nMaybe I need to look up the definition of quantum meruit in this context.\n\nQuantum meruit means \"as much as he has earned\" and is used to prevent unjust enrichment when one party has conferred a benefit on another without a formal contract.\n\nIn this case, even though there's a contract, if the contract is terminated due to breach, the non-breaching party may still owe the breaching party for the value of the work already performed.\n\nSo, perhaps quantum meruit applies here as a measure of recovery for the electrician's services rendered up to the point of termination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the electrician is entitled to nothing because he breached the contract by providing inadequate lighting, and the owner was justified in terminating him.\n\nBut that seems harsh, as the electrician did perform some work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the electrician is entitled to the contract price minus the cost to complete the job.\n\nWait, that sounds like the general rule for damages in case of breach where the other party completes the performance.\n\nIn contract law, if a party breaches the contract, and the other party completes the performance, the non-breaching party can recover the contract price minus the cost to complete.\n\nBut in this case, the owner completed the performance by hiring someone else.\n\nSo, perhaps the electrician would be entitled to the contract price minus the cost to complete.\n\nThe contract price is $5,000, and the lighting specialist was hired at $20 per fixture for 350 fixtures, which is $7,000.\n\nWait, $20 times 350 is $7,000, but the original contract was only $5,000.\n\nThat seems unusual; perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, $20 times 350 is indeed $7,000, which is more than the original contract price.\n\nSo, if the owner had to pay $7,000 to complete the job that was contracted for $5,000, that suggests that the lighting specialist charged more than the original contract price.\n\nIn such a case, the owner's damages would be the contract price plus the cost to complete minus the contract price, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the owner can only recover the difference between the contract price and the cost to complete, if the cost to complete is higher.\n\nBut in this case, the owner already paid the electrician nothing (since he was discharged), and then paid $7,000 to the lighting specialist.\n\nSo, the owner's total cost is $7,000, whereas under the original contract, it should have been $5,000.\n\nTherefore, the owner has incurred an extra $2,000 due to the electrician's breach.\n\nSo, if the electrician is sued by the owner, the owner might seek damages for the extra cost incurred.\n\nBut the question is about the electrician's recovery against the owner.\n\nGiven that the owner discharged the electrician and hired someone else, and the electrician is suing for recovery, we need to determine what the electrician is entitled to.\n\nIf the owner was justified in discharging the electrician due to breach, then the electrician is entitled to the value of the work performed up to the point of termination, minus any damages caused by the breach.\n\nSo, the electrician installed 150 fixtures, but the lighting was inadequate.\n\nPerhaps the electrician is entitled to payment proportional to the work done.\n\nThe contract was for 500 fixtures at $5,000, so $10 per fixture ($5,000 divided by 500 fixtures).\n\nSo, for 150 fixtures, that would be $1,500.\n\nBut option C mentions quantum meruit for the reasonable value of his services rendered in installing the 150 fixtures.\n\nSo, perhaps quantum meruit would consider not just the number of fixtures but also the quality of the work.\n\nSince the lighting was inadequate, the value of the work might be less than $1,500.\n\nAlternatively, if the electrician is entitled to quantum meruit, the court would determine the reasonable value of the services provided.\n\nBut again, given that the work was inadequate, that value might be reduced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the electrician is entitled to nothing because he breached the contract by providing inadequate lighting, and the owner was justified in terminating him.\n\nBut that seems harsh, as the electrician did perform some work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the electrician is entitled to the contract price pro rata for the work done, which is 150 out of 500 fixtures, so 30% of $5,000, which is $1,500.\n\nBut that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, option B is $3,500, which is 70% of $5,000, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps the electrician is entitled to the contract price minus the cost to complete.\n\nThe contract price is $5,000, and the cost to complete was $7,000, so $5,000 minus $7,000 is negative $2,000, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the owner can only recover the difference between the contract price and the cost to complete, which is $7,000 minus $5,000, or $2,000, if the cost to complete exceeds the contract price.\n\nBut in terms of the electrician's recovery, it's unclear.\n\nPerhaps the electrician is entitled to quantum meruit, which would be the reasonable value of the services rendered, considering the inadequacy of the lighting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the electrician is entitled to nothing because he didn't complete the job, and the owner was justified in discharging him due to breach.\n\nBut again, that seems harsh.\n\nWait, maybe the electrician is entitled to quantum meruit only to the extent that his services benefited the owner.\n\nIf the installed fixtures, even if inadequate, still provided some benefit, then the electrician could recover that value.\n\nAlternatively, if the fixtures were entirely useless due to inadequate lighting, then the electrician might recover nothing.\n\nBut it's unlikely that 150 fixtures provide no benefit at all.\n\nSo, perhaps quantum meruit is the correct measure of recovery.\n\nTherefore, option C seems most appropriate.\n\nBut let's consider option A, $7,000, which is the amount the owner paid to the lighting specialist.\n\nIt's unlikely that the electrician would be entitled to that amount, especially since he only installed 150 fixtures.\n\nOption B, $3,500, is half of $7,000, but again, without a clear basis.\n\nOption D, nothing, because he didn't complete the job, but as we've discussed, that seems too harsh and may not align with legal principles.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C, quantum meruit for the reasonable value of his services rendered in installing the 150 fixtures.\n\nThis allows the court to assess the value of the work done, taking into account any deficiencies in the work.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
