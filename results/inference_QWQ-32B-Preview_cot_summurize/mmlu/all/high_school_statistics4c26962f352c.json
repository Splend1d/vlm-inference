                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the weights of NFL players. It says that on average, they weigh about 248 pounds with a standard deviation of about 47 pounds. If I select four players at random, I need to find the expected value and the standard deviation of the total combined weight of these four players.\n\nFirst, the expected value part seems straightforward. If each player averages 248 pounds, then for four players, the total expected weight would just be 4 times 248, right? Let me calculate that: 4 * 248 = 992 pounds. So, the expected value of W is 992 pounds, as stated.\n\nNow, for the standard deviation of W. I know that when you add random variables, their variances add up, provided they're independent. In this case, assuming the weights of the players are independent, the variance of the total weight W should be the sum of the variances of the individual weights.\n\nSo, the variance of each player's weight is the standard deviation squared. That would be 47^2 = 2209 pounds squared.\n\nSince there are four players, the total variance would be 4 * 2209 = 8836 pounds squared.\n\nThen, the standard deviation of W is the square root of the total variance, which is sqrt(8836). Let me calculate that: sqrt(8836) = 94 pounds.\n\nSo, the standard deviation of W is approximately 94 pounds.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 47 pounds\n\nB. 67 pounds\n\nC. 94 pounds\n\nD. 141 pounds\n\nIt looks like option C is 94 pounds, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nIs the assumption of independence valid here? If the players are selected at random, and there's no reason to think that one player's weight affects another's, then independence seems reasonable.\n\nAlso, is there any need to consider the sample mean or anything like that? No, because we're dealing with the total combined weight, not the average weight.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the standard deviation of the sum of random variables is the square root of the sum of their variances, again assuming independence.\n\nSo, SD(W) = sqrt(var(W)) = sqrt(var(X1) + var(X2) + var(X3) + var(X4)) = sqrt(4 * var(X)) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(var(X)) = 2 * SD(X) = 2 * 47 = 94 pounds.\n\nYeah, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if the question was about the sample mean, then the standard deviation of the mean would be SD(X)/sqrt(n) = 47/sqrt(4) = 23.5 pounds, but that's not the case here. We're dealing with the total weight, not the average.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. 94 pounds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
