                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a rectangle where the length is 3x inches and the width is x + 5 inches. Apparently, the area and the perimeter of this rectangle are equal, and I need to find the value of x. The options are 1, 5, 10/3, and 3/10. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formulas for the area and the perimeter of a rectangle. The area is length times width, right? So that would be 3x multiplied by x + 5. And the perimeter is twice the sum of the length and width, so that's 2 times (3x + x + 5). I think.\n\nWait, let me write that down to make sure I get it right.\n\nArea = length \u00d7 width = 3x \u00d7 (x + 5)\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width) = 2 \u00d7 (3x + x + 5)\n\nSimplifying that, perimeter = 2 \u00d7 (4x + 5) = 8x + 10\n\nNow, the problem says that the area and the perimeter are equal, so I can set them equal to each other:\n\n3x(x + 5) = 8x + 10\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for x. First, I'll expand the left side:\n\n3x times x is 3x\u00b2, and 3x times 5 is 15x. So:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 15x = 8x + 10\n\nNow, I'll move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 15x - 8x - 10 = 0\n\nSimplify the like terms:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 7x - 10 = 0\n\nOkay, now I have a quadratic equation: 3x\u00b2 + 7x - 10 = 0. I need to solve for x. I can either factor this, complete the square, or use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first.\n\nI'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 3 times -10, which is -30, and add up to 7. Hmm, let's see... how about 10 and -3? 10 times -3 is -30, and 10 plus (-3) is 7. Yeah, that works.\n\nSo, I can rewrite the middle term using these numbers:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 10x - 3x - 10 = 0\n\nNow, group the terms:\n\n(3x\u00b2 + 10x) + (-3x - 10) = 0\n\nFactor out the common factors:\n\nx(3x + 10) -1(3x + 10) = 0\n\nNow, factor out (3x + 10):\n\n(3x + 10)(x - 1) = 0\n\nSet each factor equal to zero:\n\n3x + 10 = 0 \u2192 x = -10/3\n\nx - 1 = 0 \u2192 x = 1\n\nNow, x = -10/3 doesn't make sense in this context because lengths can't be negative. So, x = 1 is the only feasible solution.\n\nBut wait, let me check if x = 1 actually satisfies the original equation. Sometimes, especially with word problems, the solution might not make sense in the real world.\n\nIf x = 1, then length = 3(1) = 3 inches, and width = 1 + 5 = 6 inches.\n\nArea = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 square inches\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (3 + 6) = 2 \u00d7 9 = 18 inches\n\nOkay, perfect, area and perimeter are equal when x = 1.\n\nBut let's just double-check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption B is x = 5.\n\nLength = 3(5) = 15 inches, width = 5 + 5 = 10 inches.\n\nArea = 15 \u00d7 10 = 150 square inches\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (15 + 10) = 2 \u00d7 25 = 50 inches\n\n150 \u2260 50, so not equal.\n\nOption C is x = 10/3.\n\nLength = 3*(10/3) = 10 inches, width = 10/3 + 5 = 10/3 + 15/3 = 25/3 inches.\n\nArea = 10 * 25/3 = 250/3 \u2248 83.33 square inches\n\nPerimeter = 2*(10 + 25/3) = 2*(30/3 + 25/3) = 2*(55/3) = 110/3 \u2248 36.67 inches\n\nNot equal.\n\nOption D is x = 3/10.\n\nLength = 3*(3/10) = 9/10 inches, width = 3/10 + 5 = 3/10 + 50/10 = 53/10 inches.\n\nArea = (9/10)*(53/10) = 477/100 = 4.77 square inches\n\nPerimeter = 2*(9/10 + 53/10) = 2*(62/10) = 124/10 = 12.4 inches\n\nNot equal.\n\nSo, indeed, only x = 1 makes the area and perimeter equal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]"
