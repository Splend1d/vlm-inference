                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a plaintiff who had a respiratory infection and was prescribed a drug by his doctor. This drug was made by a pharmaceutical company, and with every prescription, the company included a written warning that said, \"Use of this drug may cause dizziness.\" The plaintiff got a four-day supply from his pharmacy, which gave him the warning. He took the medicine as prescribed, but after finishing the course, he had an accident while driving, crashed into a tree, and got hurt. Now, he's suing the pharmaceutical company for negligence and strict liability.\n\nAt trial, his attorney wants to introduce evidence that after this accident, the company changed its warning to say, \"Use of this drug may cause dizziness. Do not drive for five hours after use.\" The question is whether this evidence is admissible and for what purpose.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Admissible as an indication that the company did not use due care in wording its original warning.\n\nB. Admissible as a declaration against interest, to prove the possibility of alternate warnings.\n\nC. Inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the subsequent warning is not relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this evidence is supposed to prove. The plaintiff is trying to show that the company was negligent in its original warning because they later added, \"Do not drive for five hours after use.\" So, perhaps the original warning was insufficient, and the company knew or should have known about the risk of dizziness affecting driving.\n\nIn legal terms, evidence of subsequent remedial measures is generally not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. This is based on the idea that encouraging parties to make improvements for safety shouldn't be penalized by allowing that evidence to be used against them in court. However, there are exceptions, and it seems like this might be one of them.\n\nOption A suggests that the evidence is admissible to show the company didn't use due care in the original warning. But, given the general rule about subsequent remedial measures, this might not be admissible.\n\nOption B mentions admissible as a declaration against interest. A declaration against interest is a statement that is contrary to the declarant's own interest, and it can be an exception to the hearsay rule, making it admissible. However, in this case, the subsequent warning is being offered not for the truth of the matter asserted but to show that the company recognized a need for a better warning after the accident. So, it might not fit perfectly into the declaration against interest category.\n\nOption C says the evidence is inadmissible to show negligence in the original warning. This aligns with the general rule that subsequent remedial measures aren't admissible to prove negligence.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible because it's not relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning. But, if the company changed the warning, it might suggest that the original warning was inadequate, which could be relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning at the time of the accident.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's think differently. Maybe the evidence is being offered to show notice or knowledge on the part of the company about the risks associated with the drug. If they changed the warning after the accident, it might indicate that they became aware of additional risks or the need for a clearer warning.\n\nBut, again, introducing subsequent conduct to prove prior knowledge or negligence is typically not allowed because it can lead to unfair prejudice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the evidence is being offered to show the standard of care at the time of the accident. If the company later adopted a different warning, it might suggest that the original warning didn't meet the standard of care.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some jurisdictions, evidence of subsequent measures can be admitted for purposes other than proving negligence, such as ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures.\n\nIn this case, option D mentions feasibility of a modified warning. If the evidence is being offered to show that it was feasible for the company to provide a more detailed warning at the time of the accident, then it might be admissible for that purpose, not to prove negligence, but to show that it was possible to have a better warning.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA suggests admissibility to prove lack of due care, which aligns with proving negligence, which is generally not allowed.\n\nB suggests admissibility as a declaration against interest, which might not fit here because the warning is not being offered for the truth of its content but for what it indicates about the company's knowledge or the standard of care.\n\nC says inadmissible to show negligence, which seems correct based on the general rule.\n\nD says inadmissible because not relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning. But this seems contrary to what I'm thinking, which is that the subsequent warning could show that a modified warning was feasible at the time of the accident.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the specific context of strict liability. In a strict liability claim, the focus might be on whether the product was defective, and whether a better warning could have prevented the injury. In that case, evidence of a subsequent warning might be relevant to show that a better warning was possible.\n\nBut, generally, subsequent measures are still not admissible to prove defectiveness.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the purpose for which the evidence is being offered. If it's to show that the company could have provided a better warning (feasibility), then it might be admissible for that limited purpose, not to prove that the original warning was inadequate or negligent, but simply to establish what was feasible.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 407, which deals with subsequent remedial measures.\n\nRule 407 states that evidence of measures taken after an event may not be used to prove negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event. However, it can be admissible for other purposes, such as proving ownership or control, or for providing notice of a condition.\n\nIn this case, the modified warning could be offered to show that the company had control over the warning labels and could modify them, which might be relevant to the issue of feasibility in a design defect claim.\n\nBut, according to Rule 407, even if admitted for a permissible purpose, the court must instruct the jury not to consider the evidence as bearing on negligence.\n\nGiven that, option C says inadmissible to show negligence, which is correct, but the question is about admissibility, not just for the purpose of showing negligence.\n\nOption A suggests admissible to indicate lack of due care, which is similar to proving negligence, which generally isn't allowed.\n\nOption B, admissible as a declaration against interest, might not apply here because the warning is not a statement against interest in the context it's being offered.\n\nOption D says inadmissible because not relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning. But, as I was thinking earlier, it might be relevant to show feasibility.\n\nWait, maybe I misread option D. It says, \"inadmissible, because the subsequent warning is not relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning.\" But, if the company later modified the warning, that could suggest that it was feasible to provide a more detailed warning at the time of the accident.\n\nTherefore, option D seems incorrect because the subsequent warning could be relevant to feasibility.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is C: inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning. This aligns with the general rule that subsequent remedial measures can't be used to prove negligence.\n\nHowever, the question is about whether the evidence is admissible, and for what purpose. The plaintiff's attorney is trying to introduce the evidence, and the question is whether it's admissible and, if so, for what reason.\n\nGiven that, option A suggests it's admissible to indicate lack of due care, which is similar to proving negligence, which generally isn't allowed.\n\nOption B suggests it's admissible as a declaration against interest, which might not fit here.\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible to show negligence, which is correct, but that doesn't fully answer whether it's admissible for another purpose.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible because it's not relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning, but as I thought earlier, it might be relevant to feasibility.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is C, emphasizing that the evidence can't be used to prove negligence, but doesn't preclude its admissibility for another purpose, like showing feasibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the evidence is inadmissible altogether, but that doesn't seem right because, in some contexts, subsequent measures can be admitted for purposes other than proving negligence.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the modified warning could be relevant to show the company's state of mind or knowledge at the time of the accident.\n\nBut, introducing subsequent conduct to impute knowledge back to the time of the accident could be problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the modified warning shows that the company recognized a need for a better warning, which could be relevant to whether the original warning was adequate.\n\nHowever, this starts to border on using the subsequent action to prove negligence.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look at case law or legal interpretations related to this issue.\n\nIn products liability cases, evidence of subsequent remedial measures is often excluded to prevent discouraging companies from making improvements to their products or warnings.\n\nBut, there are exceptions. For example, such evidence can be admitted to show the feasibility of a safety measure, provided that the issue of feasibility is at play in the case.\n\nIn this scenario, if the plaintiff is arguing that the warning was defective and that a better warning was feasible, then the subsequent modification could be relevant to show that a better warning was, in fact, feasible.\n\nHowever, to admit such evidence, the court would likely need to give a limiting instruction to the jury, specifying that the evidence can't be considered as proof of negligence or defectiveness, but only for the limited purpose of showing feasibility.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the evidence is admissible, but only for the purpose of showing feasibility, not for proving negligence.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Admissible as an indication that the company did not use due care in wording its original warning.\n\nThis suggests admissibility to prove negligence, which is generally not allowed.\n\nB. Admissible as a declaration against interest, to prove the possibility of alternate warnings.\n\nThis might not be directly applicable because the warning is not being offered for the truth of its content but for what it indicates about the company's knowledge or actions.\n\nC. Inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning.\n\nThis is correct, as subsequent measures can't be used to prove negligence.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the subsequent warning is not relevant to the feasibility of a modified warning.\n\nThis seems incorrect because the subsequent warning could be relevant to show that a modified warning was feasible at the time of the accident.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the best answer is C, emphasizing that the evidence is inadmissible to prove negligence, but it might be admissible for other purposes, such as showing feasibility.\n\nHowever, since the question is phrased as \"such evidence is,\" and option C says \"inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning,\" that seems accurate.\n\nBut, to fully answer the question, one might need to consider whether the evidence is admissible for other purposes, which isn't directly addressed in the options.\n\nGiven the options provided, I think C is the correct answer: the evidence is inadmissible to show that the company was negligent in wording its original warning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
