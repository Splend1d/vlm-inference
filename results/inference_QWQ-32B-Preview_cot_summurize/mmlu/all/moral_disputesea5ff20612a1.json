                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which moral theory Locke's philosophy aligns with. The options are natural law, Kantian theory, utilitarianism, or virtue ethics. I think Locke is often associated with natural law, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look into what each of these theories entails and see which one fits Locke's ideas best.\n\nFirst, natural law conception of morality is based on the idea that moral principles are derived from nature and are universal. It suggests that there are inherent rights and duties that apply to all humans. Locke did write about natural rights, like life, liberty, and property, so that seems relevant.\n\nKantian theory, on the other hand, is deontological, meaning it focuses on duties and rules rather than consequences. Kant's categorical imperative is a central concept, which dictates that one should act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. I don't recall Locke discussing anything like that.\n\nUtilitarianism is about maximizing happiness or utility for the greatest number of people. Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill are more associated with this theory, not Locke.\n\nVirtue ethics emphasizes the role of character and virtue in moral philosophy rather than rules or consequences. Aristotle is a key figure in virtue ethics, but again, Locke doesn't seem to fit there.\n\nGiven that Locke talked about natural rights and the social contract, it seems like his moral theory is closer to natural law. Natural law theorists like Thomas Aquinas and Hugo Grotius influenced Locke, and he built upon their ideas.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. natural law conception of morality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
