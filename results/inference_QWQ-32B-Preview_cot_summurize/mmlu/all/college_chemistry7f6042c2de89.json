                    "text": "Let's tackle this NMR problem step by step. So, we've got a 13C nucleus in a 600 MHz spectrometer, and it's initially 100% polarized, meaning p(0) = 1. The relaxation time T1 is 5.0 seconds, and we need to find out how long it takes for the polarization p(t) to reach twice the thermal equilibrium polarization at 298 K.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the equation that describes the relaxation of nuclear polarization over time. From option A, it's given as:\n\np(t) = [p(0) - p_eq] * exp(-t/T1) + p_eq\n\nwhere:\n\n- p(t) is the polarization at time t,\n\n- p(0) is the initial polarization (1 in this case),\n\n- p_eq is the thermal equilibrium polarization,\n\n- T1 is the relaxation time (5.0 s),\n\n- t is the time we're trying to find.\n\nOur goal is to find t when p(t) = 2 * p_eq.\n\nSo, setting up the equation:\n\n2 * p_eq = [1 - p_eq] * exp(-t/5.0) + p_eq\n\nI need to solve for t.\n\nFirst, let's isolate the exponential term.\n\nSubtract p_eq from both sides:\n\n2 * p_eq - p_eq = [1 - p_eq] * exp(-t/5.0)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\np_eq = [1 - p_eq] * exp(-t/5.0)\n\nNow, divide both sides by [1 - p_eq]:\n\np_eq / [1 - p_eq] = exp(-t/5.0)\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(p_eq / [1 - p_eq]) = -t / 5.0\n\nNow, solve for t:\n\nt = -5.0 * ln(p_eq / [1 - p_eq])\n\nSo, to find t, I need to know p_eq, the thermal equilibrium polarization at 298 K.\n\nHow do I calculate p_eq for a 13C nucleus in a 600 MHz spectrometer at 298 K?\n\nI recall that the thermal polarization p_eq is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n\np_eq = (N_\u03b1 - N_\u03b2) / (N_\u03b1 + N_\u03b2)\n\nwhere N_\u03b1 and N_\u03b2 are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, respectively.\n\nThe energy difference between the nuclear spin states in a magnetic field is given by:\n\n\u0394E = \u03b3 * h * B0\n\nwhere:\n\n- \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio,\n\n- h is Planck's constant,\n\n- B0 is the magnetic field strength.\n\nThe magnetic field strength B0 can be related to the spectrometer frequency f through:\n\nf = \u03b3 * B0 / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nGiven that this is a 600 MHz spectrometer, f = 600 MHz.\n\nBut wait, 600 MHz is typically for 1H, not 13C. For 13C, the Larmor frequency is different because it has a different gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nI need to find the Larmor frequency for 13C at the same magnetic field strength.\n\nThe gyromagnetic ratio for 1H (proton) is approximately 42.58 MHz/Tesla.\n\nFor 13C, it's about 10.71 MHz/Tesla.\n\nGiven that it's a 600 MHz spectrometer for protons, I can find B0:\n\nf_H = \u03b3_H * B0 / (2 * \u03c0)\n\n600 * 10^6 Hz = 42.58 * 10^6 rad/s * B0\n\nWait, gyromagnetic ratios are usually given in MHz per Tesla, but to be precise, I should use radians.\n\nActually, \u03b3_H = 42.58 MHz/Tesla corresponds to angular frequency \u03c9_H = \u03b3_H * 2 * \u03c0 * B0.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the gyromagnetic ratios in radians per second per Tesla.\n\nBut to make it simpler, perhaps I can find the magnetic field strength B0 corresponding to 600 MHz for protons.\n\nGiven that f_H = \u03b3_H * B0 / (2 * \u03c0), and \u03b3_H is approximately 42.58 MHz/Tesla, then:\n\nB0 = (f_H * 2 * \u03c0) / \u03b3_H\n\nBut since \u03b3_H is in MHz/T, and f_H is in MHz, perhaps it's better to keep consistent units.\n\nLet me look up the gyromagnetic ratios.\n\nGyromagnetic ratio for proton (1H): \u03b3_H \u2248 42.58 MHz/T\n\nGyromagnetic ratio for 13C: \u03b3_C \u2248 10.71 MHz/T\n\nSo, for a 600 MHz spectrometer for protons:\n\nB0 = f_H / (\u03b3_H / (2 * \u03c0))\n\nWait, no. Since f_H = \u03b3_H * B0 / (2 * \u03c0), then B0 = (f_H * 2 * \u03c0) / \u03b3_H\n\nBut \u03b3_H is in MHz/T, and f_H is in MHz, so B0 would be in Tesla.\n\nBut to avoid confusion with units, perhaps I can consider the ratio of the gyromagnetic ratios.\n\nThe Larmor frequency for 13C, f_C = \u03b3_C * B0 / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nGiven that B0 is the same magnetic field strength, I can express f_C in terms of f_H.\n\nf_C = (\u03b3_C / \u03b3_H) * f_H\n\nSo, f_C = (10.71 / 42.58) * 600 MHz \u2248 153.7 MHz\n\nSo, the Larmor frequency for 13C at this field strength is approximately 153.7 MHz.\n\nNow, back to thermal equilibrium polarization.\n\nThe thermal polarization p_eq is given by:\n\np_eq = (e^(-\u0394E / kT) - e^(\u0394E / kT)) / (e^(-\u0394E / kT) + e^(\u0394E / kT)) = -tanh(\u0394E / (2 * kT))\n\nWait, actually, for nuclear spins, the thermal polarization is usually very small and can be approximated by the Boltzmann factor:\n\np_eq \u2248 (\u0394E) / (k * T)\n\nwhere:\n\n- \u0394E is the energy difference between spin states,\n\n- k is the Boltzmann constant,\n\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nBut more accurately, p_eq = (N_\u03b1 - N_\u03b2) / (N_\u03b1 + N_\u03b2) = (e^(-E_\u03b1 / kT) - e^(-E_\u03b2 / kT)) / (e^(-E_\u03b1 / kT) + e^(-E_\u03b2 / kT)) = (e^(E_\u03b2 / kT) - 1) / (e^(E_\u03b2 / kT) + 1) = -tanh(\u0394E / (2 * kT))\n\nWait, actually, for small \u0394E compared to kT, p_eq \u2248 \u0394E / (k * T)\n\nBut let's use the tanh expression for accuracy.\n\nSo, p_eq = -tanh(\u0394E / (2 * kT))\n\nNow, \u0394E = \u03b3 * h * B0\n\nWait, \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, and the energy difference is \u0394E = h * \u03bd = h * (\u03b3 * B0 / (2 * \u03c0)) = h * \u03b3 * B0 / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nSo, p_eq = -tanh( h * \u03b3 * B0 / (4 * \u03c0 * k * T) )\n\nAlternatively, since h * \u03bd / kT is often expressed in terms of the dimensionless quantity \u03b7 = h * \u03bd / (k * T), then p_eq = -tanh(\u03b7 / 2)\n\nAt room temperature, \u03b7 is very small for nuclear spins, so p_eq is approximately \u03b7 / 2.\n\nGiven that \u03b7 = h * \u03bd / (k * T), and h * \u03bd = E, the energy difference.\n\nSo, p_eq \u2248 (h * \u03bd) / (2 * k * T)\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers.\n\nFirst, find B0 from the proton Larmor frequency.\n\nf_H = 600 MHz = 600 * 10^6 Hz\n\n\u03b3_H = 42.58 MHz/T = 42.58 * 10^6 Hz/T\n\nSo, B0 = f_H / (\u03b3_H / (2 * \u03c0)) = (600 * 10^6) / (42.58 * 10^6 / (2 * \u03c0)) = (600) / (42.58 / (2 * \u03c0)) = (600 * 2 * \u03c0) / 42.58 \u2248 87.5 Tesla\n\nWait, that seems too high. I think I messed up the units.\n\nWait, actually, \u03b3_H is 42.58 MHz/T, and f_H = \u03b3_H * B0\n\nSo, B0 = f_H / \u03b3_H = 600 / 42.58 \u2248 14.1 Teslas\n\nOkay, that's more reasonable.\n\nNow, for 13C, f_C = \u03b3_C * B0 = 10.71 MHz/T * 14.1 T \u2248 151 MHz, which matches my earlier approximation.\n\nNow, calculate \u03b7 for 13C:\n\n\u03b7 = h * \u03bd_C / (k * T)\n\nWhere:\n\n- h is Planck's constant \u2248 6.626 * 10^-34 J*s\n\n- \u03bd_C = 151 * 10^6 Hz\n\n- k is Boltzmann's constant \u2248 1.381 * 10^-23 J/K\n\n- T = 298 K\n\nSo, \u03b7 = (6.626 * 10^-34 * 151 * 10^6) / (1.381 * 10^-23 * 298) \u2248 (9.997 * 10^-26) / (4.121 * 10^-21) \u2248 2.43 * 10^-5\n\nThis is a very small number, so p_eq \u2248 \u03b7 / 2 \u2248 1.215 * 10^-5\n\nNow, going back to the equation:\n\nt = -5.0 * ln(p_eq / [1 - p_eq])\n\nPlug in p_eq \u2248 1.215 * 10^-5\n\nSo, p_eq / [1 - p_eq] \u2248 1.215 * 10^-5 / (1 - 1.215 * 10^-5) \u2248 1.215 * 10^-5 (since p_eq is very small)\n\nThen, t = -5.0 * ln(1.215 * 10^-5)\n\nCalculate ln(1.215 * 10^-5):\n\nln(1.215 * 10^-5) \u2248 ln(1.215) + ln(10^-5) \u2248 0.2 - 11.513 \u2248 -11.313\n\nThen, t = -5.0 * (-11.313) \u2248 56.565 seconds\n\nSo, t \u2248 56.6 seconds\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nB. 72.0 s\n\nC. 56.6 s\n\nD. 12.7 s\n\nIt seems that C. 56.6 s is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's double-check the calculation.\n\nGiven p(t) = [p(0) - p_eq] * exp(-t/T1) + p_eq\n\nWe set p(t) = 2 * p_eq\n\nSo:\n\n2 * p_eq = [1 - p_eq] * exp(-t/5.0) + p_eq\n\nSubtract p_eq from both sides:\n\n2 * p_eq - p_eq = [1 - p_eq] * exp(-t/5.0)\n\np_eq = [1 - p_eq] * exp(-t/5.0)\n\nDivide both sides by [1 - p_eq]:\n\np_eq / (1 - p_eq) = exp(-t/5.0)\n\nTake natural log:\n\nln(p_eq / (1 - p_eq)) = -t / 5.0\n\nSo, t = -5.0 * ln(p_eq / (1 - p_eq))\n\nNow, p_eq \u2248 1.215 * 10^-5\n\nSo, p_eq / (1 - p_eq) \u2248 1.215 * 10^-5 / (1 - 1.215 * 10^-5) \u2248 1.215 * 10^-5\n\nThen, t = -5.0 * ln(1.215 * 10^-5)\n\nCalculate ln(1.215 * 10^-5):\n\nln(1.215) + ln(10^-5) \u2248 0.2 - 11.513 \u2248 -11.313\n\nThus, t \u2248 -5.0 * (-11.313) \u2248 56.565 s\n\nYes, 56.6 s seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 56.6 s\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{56.6\\ \\text{s}} \\]"
