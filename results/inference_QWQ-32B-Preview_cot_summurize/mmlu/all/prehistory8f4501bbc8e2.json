                    "text": "Let's see. I remember that Stonehenge is this ancient monument made of big stones arranged in a circle. There are these tall stones standing up, and then there are stones on top of them, like a sort of roof. So, the upright ones are probably called something like \"uprights,\" and the horizontal ones are maybe called \"lintels.\" But I'm not sure about the exact terms.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. legumes, sarsens - Legumes sound like plants, not stones, so that probably doesn't make sense here.\n\nB. lintels, stelae - Lintels are horizontal pieces, and stelae are upright stones, like monuments. So, this might be partially correct, but I think there's a better option.\n\nC. sarsens, lintels - Sarsens are a type of sandstone used in Stonehenge, and lintels are the horizontal stones. This seems plausible.\n\nD. trilithon, tholoi - Trilithon is a pair of upright stones with a lintel on top, and tholos (plural tholoi) is a beehive-shaped tomb. These terms are related to Stonehenge, but they don't specifically refer to the upright and horizontal stones.\n\nHmm, between options B and C, I think C is better because sarsens are indeed the type of stone used for the uprights at Stonehenge, and lintels are the horizontal stones. In option B, stelae are upright stones, but \"sarsens\" is more specific to Stonehenge.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. sarsens, lintels.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
