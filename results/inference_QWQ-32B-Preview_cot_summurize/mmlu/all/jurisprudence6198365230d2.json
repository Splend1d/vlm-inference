So first, I need to understand what the felicific calculus is. It's a method developed by Jeremy Bentham to calculate the happiness or utility that an action will produce. It's part of utilitarianism, which says that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness.\n\nNow, I have four options to choose from, and I need to pick the one that most effectively refutes this idea. Let's look at each one:\n\nOption A says, \"Happiness is less important than economic prosperity.\" Hmm, this seems to be comparing happiness to economic prosperity, suggesting that maybe we should focus more on economics than on happiness. But Bentham's calculus is about maximizing happiness, not necessarily about economic prosperity. So, this option is questioning the priority of happiness over economics, but it doesn't directly attack the idea of calculating happiness. It might be a relevant point, but it doesn't seem to be the strongest refutation of the calculus itself.\n\nOption B says, \"It is impossible to calculate all the consequences of one's acts.\" This seems more directly related to the felicific calculus because the calculus aims to calculate the outcomes of actions in terms of happiness. If it's impossible to calculate all the consequences, that would be a significant problem for the calculus. It suggests that the method is flawed because it's not feasible to gather all the necessary information to make an accurate calculation. This could be a strong refutation.\n\nOption C states, \"Pain and pleasure are inevitable features of life.\" This seems to be acknowledging that pain and pleasure are part of human experience, which is something that utilitarianism would probably accept. Bentham's calculus is about maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain, so this option doesn't really refute the calculus; it seems to accept it as a given.\n\nOption D says, \"Utilitarianism fails to take account of differences in social background.\" This is pointing out that utilitarianism might not consider individual circumstances or social inequalities adequately. While this is a valid criticism of utilitarianism in general, it's not specifically targeting the felicific calculus. The calculus is a tool for calculating happiness, but this option is more about the ethical theory's consideration of social factors.\n\nComparing these options, option B seems to be the most direct challenge to the felicific calculus because it questions the feasibility of the calculation process itself. If it's impossible to calculate all the consequences, then the entire method becomes impractical and perhaps even invalid.\n\nOption A is about prioritizing economic prosperity over happiness, which is a different debate. Option C accepts pain and pleasure as part of life, which is in line with utilitarianism. Option D criticizes utilitarianism for not considering social backgrounds, which is a separate issue from the calculus.\n\nTherefore, I think option B is the most powerful refutation of Bentham's felicific calculus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
