Now, morally speaking, feeding a dog chocolate is considered wrong because chocolate is toxic to dogs. It can make them very sick or even kill them. So, giving chocolate to a dog is not just a minor mistake; it's harmful and negligent.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character pawns their wedding ring to pay for their wife's life-saving drugs. This seems like a difficult decision, but it appears to be motivated by love and a desire to save their wife's life. In this case, the action might be seen as morally acceptable or even praiseworthy because it's done to help someone in need, especially a spouse.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
