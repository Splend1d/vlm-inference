Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: I found out my sister liked a boy she didn't want him to know, but I told him anyway.\n\nOkay, so here, the main character discovers their sister has a crush on someone, and she doesn't want that person to know about it. But the main character goes ahead and tells the boy anyway. Hmm.\n\nFirst, privacy is important in relationships, especially between siblings. Your sister probably trusted you with this information, expecting you to keep it confidential. By disclosing her feelings without her consent, you're invading her privacy and potentially causing her embarrassment or harm.\n\nMoreover, interfering in someone's personal life, especially in matters of romance, can have unintended consequences. The boy might not feel the same way, or he might take advantage of the situation. Either way, your sister's feelings could be hurt, and your action could strain your relationship with her.\n\nIn general, it's considered morally wrong to share someone's private feelings without their permission, especially when they've explicitly asked you to keep it a secret. So, in this scenario, the main character does something that's clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I visit my granny in the hospital to eat her meals.\n\nThis one sounds a bit odd. The main character visits their grandmother in the hospital with the intention of eating her meals. That doesn't seem right.\n\nFirst, hospital meals are provided for patients to help them recover. They're tailored to the patient's nutritional needs based on their medical condition. If someone else eats those meals, the patient might not get the nourishment they need, which could hinder their recovery.\n\nAdditionally, it's disrespectful and selfish to take food meant for someone else, especially an elderly and possibly vulnerable family member. Hospitals have rules about meal distribution, and interfering with that could cause problems for the staff and other patients.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, exploiting a vulnerable relative for personal gain is clearly wrong. It lacks empathy and consideration for the well-being of others. So, in this scenario, the main character is also doing something that's clearly morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
