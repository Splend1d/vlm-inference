The options are armed conflict, anarchy, institutions, and no common language. I think I need to recall some concepts from international relations theory here.\n\nSo, realists are a school of thought in IR, and they have specific views about how the world works. They focus a lot on power, national interest, and the absence of a central authority in the international system. I remember that one key term in realism is \"anarchy,\" but in this context, it doesn't mean chaos or disorder; it means the lack of a overarching world government.\n\nIn the domestic system, there's a central government that makes and enforces rules, right? So, people and organizations follow laws set by the state. But in the international system, there's no such world government. Each state is sovereign and independent, and they interact based on their own interests and power.\n\nSo, anarchy in international relations refers to this absence of a higher authority above states. Realists argue that this anarchy is the fundamental difference between the international and domestic systems.\n\nArmed conflict might be a consequence of this anarchy, as states might resort to force to resolve disputes or advance their interests, but it's not the fundamental difference itself.\n\nInstitutions, like the United Nations or NATO, exist in the international system, but they don't have the same level of authority as domestic institutions like courts or legislatures. So, while institutions differ, the fundamental difference is the lack of a overarching authority.\n\nNo common language seems irrelevant here. Language differences exist both internationally and domestically, and aren't considered a fundamental difference by realists.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. Anarchy.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nOption A, armed conflict, could be a result of the anarchic international system, but it's not the fundamental difference itself. Realists might argue that the absence of a central authority leads to a self-help system where states must rely on their own capabilities for security, which could lead to armed conflict, but the core difference is the anarchy.\n\nOption C, institutions, is interesting because while there are international institutions, they don't have the same enforcement power as domestic institutions. But again, this is a consequence of the anarchic system, not the fundamental difference itself.\n\nOption D, no common language, seems off-track. Language differences are a fact in both international and domestic systems, and realists don't consider this a key difference.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm sticking with B. Anarchy as the fundamental difference according to realists.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
