                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about perfectly competitive firms. I need to figure out which statement is accurate. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Demand is downward-sloping.\" Hmm, in a perfectly competitive market, there are many firms and each firm is a price taker. That means each firm accepts the market price as given. The demand curve for an individual firm is actually horizontal, or perfectly elastic, at the market price. So, demand isn't downward-sloping for a single firm in perfect competition. It's the market demand that's downward-sloping, but not the demand for an individual firm. So, I think A is incorrect.\n\nOption B: \"The demand curve lies above the marginal revenue curve.\" In perfect competition, the demand curve for an individual firm is equal to the marginal revenue curve. They coincide because each additional unit sold adds exactly the market price to the firm's revenue. So, the demand curve doesn't lie above the marginal revenue curve; they are the same. That means B is not accurate.\n\nOption C: \"Price is determined by the equilibrium in the entire market.\" This sounds familiar. In perfect competition, the market price is determined by the intersection of the market demand and market supply. Individual firms have to accept this price because they're price takers. So, price is indeed determined by the equilibrium in the entire market. This seems accurate.\n\nOption D: \"Average revenue differs from price.\" Average revenue is total revenue divided by quantity, which in perfect competition is price (since TR = P x Q). So, average revenue should equal price. Therefore, D is not accurate.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that option C is the accurate statement regarding a perfectly competitive firm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
