                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Cicero's views on immorality and expediency. The options are a bit confusing, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Cicero believed about morality and what is expedient. Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman who was influenced by Greek Stoicism. Stoics had specific views on what is natural and in accord with nature, which they considered to be morally good.\n\nSo, immorality would be against what is natural, right? Because Stoics believe that virtue is in living in accordance with nature. Therefore, immorality would be repugnant to nature.\n\nNow, expediency\u2014this refers to what is convenient or practical, sometimes at the expense of morality. I think Cicero would say that expediency, if it goes against morality, is also repugnant to nature. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me look up some information about Cicero's views on morality and expediency.\n\nOkay, I found that Cicero emphasized the importance of moral integrity and argued that true expediency should align with moral goodness. He believed that what is morally right is also truly expedient in the long run.\n\nSo, according to Cicero, immorality is repugnant to nature, and expediency, when it is true expediency, is in accord with nature.\n\nWait, but the options have both immorality and expediency as either repugnant or in accord with nature.\n\nGiven what I just read, immorality is repugnant to nature, and true expediency is in accord with nature.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option C: immorality is repugnant to nature, and expediency is in accord with nature.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Maybe I should look at the context where Cicero discusses this.\n\nIn his work \"De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (On the Ends of Good and Evil), Cicero explores different philosophical schools' views on ethics. He seems to align himself with the Stoics, who hold that virtue is the only good and that it is in accord with nature.\n\nTherefore, immorality, being contrary to virtue, would be repugnant to nature.\n\nExpediency, if it means choosing what is pragmatically best, should align with virtue for Cicero, meaning it is in accord with nature.\n\nSo, option C makes the most sense.\n\nWait, but I remember that sometimes expediency can lead people to act immorally because it seems more practical in the short term. Maybe Cicero would distinguish between true expediency and apparent expediency.\n\nIf that's the case, then true expediency is in accord with nature, while apparent expediency that leads to immorality is repugnant to nature.\n\nBut the question seems to be about expediency in general, not distinguishing between true and apparent expediency.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nGiven the options, C seems to be the correct answer: immorality is repugnant to nature, and expediency is in accord with nature.\n\nI think I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
