I need to simplify this and find out which option is correct: A. 7, B. 16, C. 30, or D. 33.\n\nFirst, I should remember the order of operations, often abbreviated as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). So, I need to handle what's inside the parentheses first.\n\nInside the parentheses, it's 2 + 5, which equals 7. So, the expression now becomes 7^2 \u2212 42.\n\nNext, I need to handle the exponent. 7 squared is 49. Now, the expression is 49 \u2212 42.\n\nFinally, subtracting 42 from 49 gives me 7.\n\nSo, the simplified result is 7, which corresponds to option A.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't miss anything. The expression was (2 + 5)^2 \u2212 42.\n\n- First, parentheses: 2 + 5 = 7.\n\n- Then, exponent: 7^2 = 49.\n\n- Finally, subtraction: 49 \u2212 42 = 7.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think there's any other way to interpret this expression according to the standard order of operations.\n\nI should also consider if there might be any trick here, like different interpretations of the expression, but it seems pretty straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
