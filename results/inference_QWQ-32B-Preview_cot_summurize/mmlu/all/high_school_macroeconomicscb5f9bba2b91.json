                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about money and financial markets. There are four options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"As the demand for bonds increases, the interest rate increases.\" Hmm, I think I need to recall how bond markets work. When people demand more bonds, they're essentially buying more of them. In the bond market, when demand increases, the price of bonds goes up. Now, there's an inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates. So, if bond prices go up, interest rates actually go down. Wait, that seems opposite to what option A is saying. So, I think option A is incorrect.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"For a given money supply, if nominal GDP increases, the velocity of money decreases.\" Okay, velocity of money is how quickly money circulates in the economy. There's an equation that relates money supply (M), velocity (V), price level (P), and output (Y): MV = PY. Nominal GDP is P times Y, so if M is constant and nominal GDP increases, then V must increase to keep the equation balanced. So, if nominal GDP increases with a given money supply, velocity should increase, not decrease. Therefore, option B seems wrong.\n\nOption C states: \"When demand for stocks and bonds increases, the asset demand for money falls.\" Alright, asset demand for money refers to people holding money as an asset instead of investing in other assets like stocks and bonds. If people are demanding more stocks and bonds, that means they're shifting their holdings from money to these other assets. So, yes, if demand for stocks and bonds goes up, the demand to hold money as an asset would likely fall. That makes sense. So, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let me check option D just to be sure: \"A macroeconomic recession increases the demand for loanable funds.\" During a recession, economic activity slows down, and businesses and individuals may need less borrowing. Also, interest rates might be lowered by central banks to stimulate the economy, which could affect the demand for loanable funds. But generally, in a recession, the demand for loanable funds might decrease because of lower investment and consumption. So, option D seems incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C appears to be the correct statement among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
