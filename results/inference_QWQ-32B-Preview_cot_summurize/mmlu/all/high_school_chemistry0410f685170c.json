I think I remember that oxygen is in compounds like alcohols and ethers, but not sure about aldehydes and alkanes.\n\nFirst, let's think about alkanes. Alkanes are like methane, ethane, propane, and so on. Their general formula is CnH2n+2. So, they only have carbon and hydrogen atoms. No oxygen there, right?\n\nNow, aldehydes. I think aldehydes have a carbonyl group, which is C=O. So, that means they have oxygen.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me recall. A carbonyl group is indeed C=O, which has oxygen. So, aldehydes do have oxygen.\n\nNext, alcohols. Alcohols have an -OH group, which definitely has oxygen.\n\nAnd ethers have an ether linkage, which is O connected to two carbons, like R-O-R'. So, ethers also have oxygen.\n\nSo, if alkanes are CnH2n+2, with no oxygen, and the others all have oxygen in their functional groups, then the answer should be alkane.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nIs there any alkane that has oxygen? I don't think so. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, only carbon and hydrogen.\n\nAldehydes have the carbonyl group, which is oxygen.\n\nAlcohols have the hydroxyl group, which is oxygen.\n\nEthers have the ether linkage with oxygen.\n\nSo, it seems straightforward. The one without oxygen is alkane.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I'm misremembering something.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\nA. An aldehyde \u2013 contains C=O, so oxygen is present.\n\nB. An alkane \u2013 CnH2n+2, no oxygen.\n\nC. An alcohol \u2013 has -OH, oxygen present.\n\nD. An ether \u2013 has R-O-R', oxygen present.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. An alkane.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
