                    "text": "An elevator company installed an elevator in an apartment building. Under the terms of its contract with the owner of the apartment building, the company agreed to carry out regular monthly inspections of the elevator and to make all necessary repairs. The elevator was installed in the apartment complex in January. For the next 10 months, the company made regular inspections. However, starting in November, the company began to have some difficulties with its employees and failed to send inspectors out for three successive months. On February 20, a woman went to visit her friend, who was a tenant on the 20th floor of the building. The woman used the intercom to call up to the friend, who buzzed to unlock the front door so that the woman could enter the building. The woman headed to the elevator. When the doors opened, several people were already inside the elevator, apparently having entered the elevator from the parking garage below the building. One of the people in the elevator was a man who acted shifty and nervous. By the 12th floor, only four persons were left, including the woman and the man. At that floor, the other two people left, leaving the woman and the man alone on the elevator. Apprehensive at finding herself alone with such an unkempt stranger, the woman pressed the 13th floor button, intending to step out and hoping to find other persons on that floor. Unfortunately, the elevator stalled, and came to a stop between the 12th and 13th floors. The woman's fears were justified, as the man suddenly grabbed at her purse. When the woman resisted, the man struck her, and she fell unconscious. When the woman recovered consciousness, she found herself in a hospital with a concussion and multiple contusions on her body. She later learned that the elevator had remained stalled for 50 minutes. Thereafter, it moved to the 20th floor, where she was found by her friend, who took her to the hospital. Two weeks later, the police arrested the man and found the woman's purse in his possession. This was the first assault that had occurred in the apartment building. The elevator's stalling was caused by a defective cable that a routine inspection would have discovered. If the woman brings suit against the owner of the apartment building for negligence, she will most likely\n\nA. recover, because she was an invitee of a tenant in the building.\nB. recover, because the owner would be vicariously liable for the company's failure to inspect the elevator.\nC. not recover, because the woman was negligent in failing to exit the elevator on the 12th floor when the other occupants exited the elevator.\nD. not recover, because there had been no previous assaults in the apartment building.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this law problem. It's about a woman who got assaulted in an elevator in an apartment building, and now she's suing the owner of the building for negligence. There are four options for what might happen, and I need to choose the most likely outcome.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The elevator company installed an elevator and agreed to do regular inspections and repairs. They did inspections for 10 months but then missed three months starting in November. The assault happened in February, so that's after they missed those inspections.\n\nThe woman was visiting her friend on the 20th floor. She used the intercom to get in, and when she took the elevator, there was this suspicious man and a few others. By the 12th floor, only four people were left, including her and the man. When the elevator stalled between the 12th and 13th floors, the man attacked her.\n\nShe ended up in the hospital with injuries, and the elevator was stuck for 50 minutes before it moved to the 20th floor, where her friend found her.\n\nThe police caught the man, and he had her purse. It was the first assault in the building.\n\nNow, the elevator stalled because of a defective cable that regular inspections should have caught.\n\nSo, she's suing the building owner for negligence. I need to see which option is most likely correct.\n\nOption A says she will recover because she was an invitee of a tenant in the building.\n\nI think an invitee is someone who is invited onto the property for the mutual benefit of the invitee and the inviter. Here, she was invited by her friend who lives in the building. So, she's an invitee.\n\nIn property law, owners have a duty of care to invitees, meaning they need to keep the premises safe and fix any known dangers.\n\nSo, if the elevator was defective due to neglected inspections, that could be a breach of that duty.\n\nOption B says she will recover because the owner is vicariously liable for the company's failure to inspect the elevator.\n\nVicarious liability means the owner is responsible for the actions of another party, in this case, the elevator company.\n\nBut the owner contracted the elevator company to do inspections and repairs. So, maybe the owner can be held responsible for the company's negligence.\n\nOption C says she won't recover because she was negligent in failing to exit the elevator on the 12th floor when the other occupants exited.\n\nSo, this is about contributory negligence, where the plaintiff is also at fault and therefore can't recover damages.\n\nBut in this case, she pressed the 13th floor button, intending to step out on the 13th floor, not the 12th. The elevator stalled before reaching the 13th floor.\n\nSo, maybe she didn't have a chance to exit on the 13th floor because the elevator stalled.\n\nAlso, she was apprehensive about being alone with the man, which is why she wanted to exit on the 13th floor.\n\nSo, it's not clear that her failure to exit on the 12th floor was negligent.\n\nOption D says she won't recover because there had been no previous assaults in the building.\n\nThis might be related to the concept of foreseeability in negligence cases.\n\nIf there's no history of similar incidents, it might be harder to prove that the owner should have foreseen the risk of an assault in the elevator.\n\nBut in this case, the issue seems to be more about the elevator's mechanical failure leading to her being trapped with the assailant, rather than the assault itself.\n\nSo, maybe not directly relevant.\n\nLooking back, option A seems strong because she was an invitee, and the owner has a duty to keep the premises safe.\n\nThe elevator was defective due to missed inspections, which is a breach of that duty.\n\nMoreover, the defect directly contributed to the situation where she was trapped with the assailant.\n\nSo, it seems like the owner could be liable for negligence.\n\nOption B about vicarious liability is also plausible, but I think option A is more directly related to the principles of negligence.\n\nOption C about contributory negligence might not apply here because she couldn't exit the elevator once it stalled.\n\nAnd option D about no previous assaults might not be relevant, as the issue is more about the elevator's safety than the foreseeability of assaults.\n\nTherefore, I think the most likely outcome is that she will recover, because she was an invitee of a tenant in the building.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
