                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about setting a target selling price for a new product called Duct. The target contribution margin is 20%, and there are some unit costs listed: manufacturing costs that are variable at $12 and fixed at $8, and selling and administrative costs that are variable at $3 and fixed at $5. I need to find out what the target selling price should be.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a contribution margin is. I think it's the difference between the selling price and the variable costs, and it contributes to covering the fixed costs and generating profit. So, if the target contribution margin is 20%, that means that 20% of the selling price should cover the fixed costs and profit, after variable costs are deducted.\n\nLet me list out the costs again to make sure I have them straight:\n\n- Variable manufacturing costs: $12\n\n- Fixed manufacturing costs: $8\n\n- Variable selling & admin costs: $3\n\n- Fixed selling & admin costs: $5\n\nTotal variable costs per unit would be the sum of variable manufacturing and variable selling & admin costs, right? So that's $12 + $3 = $15.\n\nTotal fixed costs per unit would be fixed manufacturing plus fixed selling & admin, which is $8 + $5 = $13.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I should be looking at fixed costs per unit when setting the selling price. I think the contribution margin approach focuses on covering variable costs first, and then the contribution covers fixed costs and profit.\n\nSo, if the target contribution margin is 20%, that means that the contribution margin per unit divided by the selling price should equal 20%. In other words:\n\nContribution Margin / Selling Price = 20%\n\nAnd Contribution Margin = Selling Price - Total Variable Costs\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n(Selling Price - $15) / Selling Price = 0.20\n\nNow, I can solve for the Selling Price.\n\nLet's denote Selling Price as SP.\n\n(SP - 15) / SP = 0.20\n\nMultiply both sides by SP:\n\nSP - 15 = 0.20 * SP\n\nNow, bring all terms involving SP to one side:\n\nSP - 0.20 * SP = 15\n\nFactor out SP:\n\n(1 - 0.20) * SP = 15\n\n0.80 * SP = 15\n\nNow, divide both sides by 0.80:\n\nSP = 15 / 0.80\n\nSP = 18.75\n\nSo, the target selling price should be $18.75.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that in some costing methods, we also need to consider fixed costs when setting the selling price to ensure that all costs are covered. In that case, perhaps I should be using a different approach.\n\nLet me think about another method. Maybe the cost-plus pricing method, where you add a certain percentage markup to the total cost to determine the selling price.\n\nTotal cost per unit would be total variable costs plus total fixed costs, which is $15 + $13 = $28.\n\nBut that seems too high, and it doesn't align with the contribution margin approach I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should be using the contribution margin approach but ensuring that the total contribution covers both fixed costs and the desired profit.\n\nBut the problem mentions a target contribution margin percentage, which I think is already incorporating the desired profit margin.\n\nLet me check the multiple-choice options:\n\nA. $18.00\n\nB. $18.75\n\nC. $25.00\n\nD. $33.60\n\nMy calculation gave me $18.75, which is option B.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because I feel like I might be missing something regarding fixed costs. shouldn't the selling price also cover the fixed costs?\n\nIn the contribution margin approach, the total contribution margin from all units sold should cover both fixed costs and profit. So, per unit, the contribution margin is selling price minus variable costs, and across all units, this should cover fixed costs and profit.\n\nBut in setting the target selling price per unit, based on the desired contribution margin percentage, the approach I used seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the contribution margin ratio formula:\n\nContribution Margin Ratio = (Selling Price - Variable Costs) / Selling Price = Target Contribution Margin Percentage\n\nWhich is what I used earlier.\n\nSo, SP - VC = CM\n\nCM / SP = Target CM Percentage\n\nSo, SP - VC = SP * Target CM Percentage\n\nThen, SP - SP * Target CM Percentage = VC\n\nSP (1 - Target CM Percentage) = VC\n\nTherefore, SP = VC / (1 - Target CM Percentage)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nSP = $15 / (1 - 0.20) = $15 / 0.80 = $18.75\n\nOkay, this confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nBut to double-check, let's consider if fixed costs should be included in some way in the selling price.\n\nIf I were using a full-costing approach, I might add fixed costs to the variable costs and then apply a markup to achieve the desired profit margin. However, the problem specifies a target contribution margin, which is different from a profit margin.\n\nContributing margin focuses on covering fixed costs and generating profit through the contribution of each unit sold, beyond covering its variable costs.\n\nSo, in this case, setting the selling price based on the variable costs and the desired contribution margin percentage seems appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the target selling price should be $18.75, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option D is $33.60, which seems way higher. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider if the fixed costs should be allocated per unit and added to the variable costs.\n\nFor example, if we have total fixed costs of $8 (manufacturing) + $5 (selling & admin) = $13 per unit.\n\nIf we add this to the variable costs of $15, total cost per unit is $28.\n\nThen, if we want a 20% contribution margin, perhaps we should calculate the selling price based on covering total costs and adding 20% on top.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because contribution margin is not the same as a markup on total costs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should be using the formula:\n\nSelling Price = Variable Costs + (Fixed Costs + Desired Profit) / Number of Units\n\nBut I don't have the number of units in this problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the target contribution margin percentage is based on achieving a certain return on sales.\n\nBut without more information, I think sticking with the initial approach is best.\n\nSo, I'll go with SP = VC / (1 - Target CM Percentage) = $15 / 0.80 = $18.75\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $18.75\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B.\\ \\$18.75} \\]"
