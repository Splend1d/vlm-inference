                    "text": "So I've got this question here about entropy and helium gas being transferred from a smaller flask to a larger one while keeping the temperature constant. I need to figure out what happens to the entropy of the helium in this process. Let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what entropy is. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. The higher the entropy, the more disordered the system is. So, in this case, we're dealing with a gas, helium, which is being moved from a 2.0-liter flask to a larger container.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n1. The temperature is held constant.\n\n2. The helium is being evacuated into a larger container.\n\nSince temperature is constant, that means the kinetic energy of the helium molecules isn't changing. They're not getting faster or slower; they're just moving into a bigger space.\n\nNow, when a gas expands into a larger volume, what happens to its entropy? I think that the entropy should increase because the gas molecules have more space to move around in. They become more dispersed, which means there are more possible arrangements for the molecules, leading to higher randomness or disorder.\n\nLet me think about option A: \"It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.\" Well, the number of molecules isn't changing, but they're spreading out into a larger volume. So, even though there are the same number of molecules, their possible positions increase, which should increase entropy. So, I don't think this is correct.\n\nOption B says, \"It will decrease as the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask.\" That doesn't make sense to me. Usually, when particles have more space, they become less ordered, not more ordered. So, I think this is incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"It will decrease because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask less often than they did in the smaller flask.\" Hmm, it's true that in a larger container, the molecules will collide with the walls less frequently because the walls are farther apart. But does that mean the entropy decreases? I don't think so. Entropy is related to the number of microstates available to the system, not just the frequency of collisions with the walls.\n\nOption D: \"It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.\" This aligns with what I was thinking earlier. More space means more dispersion, more possible positions for the molecules, leading to higher entropy.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that entropy change for an ideal gas expanding into a vacuum at constant temperature is given by Delta S = nR ln(Vf/Vi), where n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, Vf is the final volume, and Vi is the initial volume. Since the volume is increasing (Vf > Vi), ln(Vf/Vi) is positive, so Delta S is positive. That means entropy increases.\n\nBut in this case, it's not necessarily expanding into a vacuum, but being evacuated into a larger container. Does that make a difference? I think as long as the expansion is isothermal (constant temperature), the entropy change should still be positive.\n\nLet me double-check. Helium is being evacuated from the smaller flask to the larger container. Evacuated usually means removing gas from a space to create a vacuum, but in this context, it probably means transferring the helium into the larger container, and the larger container might already have some gas or be partially evacuated.\n\nBut the question says \"evacuated into a larger container,\" which might imply that the larger container has lower pressure or is evacuated to some extent. However, the key point is that the helium is expanding into a larger volume at constant temperature.\n\nGiven that, I think the entropy should increase because the gas is becoming more dispersed.\n\nLet me consider if there's any reason why entropy might decrease. If the gas was being compressed, entropy would decrease, but here it's expanding, so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nOption B suggests that the gas becomes more ordered in the larger flask, but that seems counterintuitive. More space should lead to more disorder, not less.\n\nOption C mentions that molecules collide with the sides less often, but again, that doesn't directly relate to entropy. Entropy is more about the number of possible arrangements of the molecules, not the frequency of collisions.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D: \"It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.\"\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about real gases versus ideal gases. Helium is a monatomic gas and behaves very similarly to an ideal gas. So, using the ideal gas approximation should be fine here.\n\nAlso, since the temperature is constant, there's no change in the internal energy due to temperature changes, which simplifies things.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the entropy of the helium will increase when it is evacuated into a larger container at constant temperature because the gas molecules become more dispersed in the larger volume, leading to a higher number of possible microstates and thus higher entropy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
