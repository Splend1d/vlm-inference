I answer: Out of local conditions and the necessities of the case methods of government will grow. If England can govern foreign lands, so can America. If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day.\nWill you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result? Will you affirm by your vote that you are an infidel to American power and practical sense? Or will you say that ours is the blood of government; ours the heart of dominion; ours the brain and genius of administration? Will you remember that we do but what our fathers did\u2014we but pitch the tents of liberty farther westward, farther southward\u2014we only continue the march of the flag?\n\u2014Albert Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" Indianapolis, September 16, 1898\nThe theme of Beveridge's speech can most directly be compared to which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this speech by Albert Beveridge from 1898, and he's talking about how America should govern these new possessions, probably referring to places like Hawaii and the Philippines, which the U.S. had acquired around that time. He's basically saying that if other countries like England and Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. He compares governing these new territories to how the U.S. governed places like New Mexico and California when they were incorporated into the Union, even though those places had alien and savage populations and were remote.\n\nBeveridge seems to be arguing that American ability to govern has not decayed and that the U.S. has the experience and practical sense to administer these new territories. He even invokes the idea that it's in America's blood to govern and that the country has a sort of destiny to expand and spread liberty, likening it to the westward expansion and the idea of the \"march of the flag.\"\n\nNow, the question is asking me to compare the theme of this speech to one of the options provided: The Monroe Doctrine, Containment, Manifest Destiny, or the ideology of states' rights. I need to figure out which one this speech most directly relates to.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. The Monroe Doctrine: That was established in 1823 by President James Monroe, and it essentially said that Europe should not colonize any more territories in the Americas and that the U.S. would not get involved in European affairs. It's more about keeping European powers out of the Americas and asserting U.S. influence in the Western Hemisphere. While it does involve foreign policy and influence, it's not directly about expanding U.S. territory or governing new possessions.\n\nB. Containment: This is a policy that became prominent after World War II, especially during the Cold War, where the U.S. sought to contain the spread of communism, particularly by the Soviet Union. It's about preventing the expansion of communist ideology and influence. This seems way too far in the future from Beveridge's speech in 1898, and it's more about ideology than territorial expansion.\n\nC. Manifest Destiny: This was a belief that was prominent in the 19th century, especially in the mid-1800s, that the U.S. was destined to expand across the North American continent, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. It was used to justify westward expansion and the acquisition of new territories, often at the expense of Native American lands and even through war with Mexico. The idea was that it was the U.S.'s divine right and mission to expand its territory and spread democracy.\n\nD. The ideology of states' rights: This is more about the balance of power between the federal government and individual states within the U.S. It's a political philosophy that advocates for limiting the power of the central government and preserving the rights and powers of individual states. It's not directly related to foreign policy or territorial expansion.\n\nComparing these options to Beveridge's speech, it seems like Manifest Destiny is the most directly comparable theme. Both involve the idea of expanding U.S. territory and influence, with a sense of mission or destiny to spread American values and governance. Beveridge is essentially extending the concept of Manifest Destiny beyond the North American continent to include overseas territories like Hawaii and the Philippines.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine is more about preventing European colonization in the Americas, not about expanding U.S. territory beyond its existing borders. Containment is a much later concept related to the Cold War and combating communism, which isn't relevant to Beveridge's speech. States' rights is entirely different, focusing on domestic political structures rather than expansionism.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Manifest Destiny.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
