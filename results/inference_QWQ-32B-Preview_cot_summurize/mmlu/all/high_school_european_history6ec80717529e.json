This question is about Queen Victoria and her schedule, and then it asks about a similar fondness for entertainment among the nobility in a different era and place. The options are sixteenth-century Spain, seventeenth-century Netherlands, eighteenth-century France, and nineteenth-century Prussia.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the letter is saying. Queen Victoria seems to be feeling overwhelmed by her social obligations. She's got parties, concerts, and balls to attend, and she's worried about getting too tired. She's asking Lord Melbourne if it's okay for her to skip one of these events, specifically the Ancient Concert on Wednesday. She also mentions that negotiations with the Tories have ended and that Lord Melbourne is invited to dine with her on Sunday.\n\nSo, she's dealing with a lot of social events, which seem to be a big part of her life as queen. She's balancing these events with her political responsibilities, like dealing with the Tories.\n\nNow, the question is asking about a similar fondness for entertainment among the nobility in another time and place. So, I need to think about which of these options\u2014sixteenth-century Spain, seventeenth-century Netherlands, eighteenth-century France, or nineteenth-century Prussia\u2014was known for having a nobility that really loved entertainment, maybe even more so than in Queen Victoria's time.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Sixteenth-century Spain: Spain in the sixteenth century was a time of the Habsburgs, with rulers like Charles V and Philip II. While the Spanish court was known for its opulence and elaborate ceremonies, I don't recall it being particularly known for excessive entertainment compared to other periods.\n\nB. Seventeenth-century Netherlands: This was the time of the Dutch Golden Age, known for its art, trade, and cultural achievements. However, the Netherlands was a republic, not a monarchy, so the concept of a nobility might be different there. I'm not sure if the nobility in seventeenth-century Netherlands was particularly known for their love of entertainment.\n\nC. Eighteenth-century France: This seems promising. The eighteenth century in France was the age of the Enlightenment, but also a time when the French monarchy and nobility were known for their lavish courts, especially at Versailles under Louis XIV. The Sun King was famous for his opulent lifestyle and the elaborate entertainment he provided, including ballets, operas, and grand festivals. Even after Louis XIV, the court continued to be a center of cultural and social activities.\n\nD. Nineteenth-century Prussia: Prussia in the nineteenth century was known for its military traditions and its role in the unification of Germany. While there might have been a certain level of social entertainment among the nobility, I don't think it was particularly renowned for excessive entertainment compared to other options.\n\nConsidering these points, eighteenth-century France seems to be the era and place where the nobility had a similar, if not more pronounced, fondness for entertainment as Queen Victoria's court in the nineteenth century.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. Eighteenth-century France.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
