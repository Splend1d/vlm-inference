                    "text": "Let's break down this scenario step by step to understand what's happening and who might be responsible for the mortgage.\n\nFirst, there are four people who own a property together. They decide to convey (transfer ownership) of this property to an adult child of one of them. This conveyance is done through a deed in fee simple, which means the adult child now owns the property outright.\n\nNow, there's a purchase-money mortgage on the property, meaning the loan was taken out to buy the property, and the four original owners signed a promissory note as security for this loan. Importantly, this loan wasn't paid off at the time of the conveyance to the adult child.\n\nThe adult child then takes over making the mortgage payments. But later, the adult child stops making these payments and conveys (sells) the property to a bona fide purchaser (someone who buys it in good faith, without knowing about any existing claims or problems) who doesn't do a title search.\n\nThe purchaser now sues his grantor (the adult child) to get an order compelling him to pay the mortgage and remove the lien from the property.\n\nThe question is whether the court is more likely to grant a motion to dismiss made by the defendants ( likely the adult child and possibly the original four owners).\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, that is the risk the purchaser took; he cannot go to closing without a title search and a title company making arrangements for payment of the outstanding mortgage by the seller at closing.\n\nThis option suggests that the purchaser assumed the risk by not doing a title search. In many jurisdictions, a purchaser is expected to perform due diligence, including a title search, to ensure there are no liens or other encumbrances on the property. If they choose not to do so, they might bear the consequences.\n\nB. Yes, because the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.\n\nThis option implies that only the original four owners are liable for the mortgage since they signed the promissory note. The adult child, as the new owner, might not be legally bound to pay the mortgage, especially if the original owners remain liable.\n\nC. No, the court will order the original four owners to come into court and defend on behalf of the adult child, who has no legal responsibility for the mortgage.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. It suggests that the original owners would have to defend the adult child, but it's unclear why or how. The adult child might not have legal responsibility for the mortgage, but the original owners do since they signed the promissory note.\n\nD. No, the court will order the adult child to resume paying on the mortgage and to obtain a loan to pay it off within a reasonable time.\n\nThis option suggests that the court would hold the adult child responsible for the mortgage, even though they might not be legally bound to it.\n\nTo better understand this, we need to consider the nature of the mortgage and the promissory note.\n\n\u4e00\u822c\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u662f\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u8d22\u4ea7\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u800c promissory note \u662f\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u627f\u8bfa\u8fd8\u6b3e\u7684\u4e66\u9762\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u5728 this case, the original four owners signed the promissory note, making them liable for the debt.\n\nWhen the property was conveyed to the adult child, the mortgage remained in place because the loan wasn't paid off. The adult child took over the payments, but stopping payments and then selling the property complicates things.\n\nThe purchaser, who bought the property without doing a title search, is now facing a mortgage lien on the property.\n\nNow, who is responsible for paying off this mortgage?\n\nThe original four owners are still liable for the mortgage because they signed the promissory note. The adult child might not be legally bound to pay the mortgage unless there was a specific agreement making them responsible.\n\nThe purchaser, who bought the property without discovering the lien, might have a claim against the adult child for selling a property with an existing lien, which could be considered a breach of warranty of title.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the purchaser is suing the grantor (the adult child) to compel payment of the mortgage and removal of the lien.\n\nGiven that the original four owners are the ones who signed the promissory note, it's possible that only they can be legally compelled to pay off the mortgage.\n\nTherefore, option B seems plausible: the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.\n\nOption A also has merit because the purchaser assumed the risk by not performing a title search. In many jurisdictions, purchasers are expected to conduct due diligence to ensure there are no liens on the property.\n\nOption C is unclear and seems less likely, while option D might not hold because the adult child might not have legal responsibility for the mortgage.\n\nConsidering these points, the court is more likely to grant the motion to dismiss made by the defendants, either because the purchaser assumed the risk or because only the original owners are liable for the mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A or B.\n\nBut to be more precise, let's consider the legal principles involved.\n\nFirst, mortgages generally run with the land, meaning that even if the property is sold, the mortgage remains attached to the property.\n\nHowever, the liability for the mortgage payments typically rests with the parties who signed the promissory note.\n\nIn this case, the original four owners signed the promissory note, so they remain liable for the mortgage debt.\n\nThe adult child, as the new owner, might not be personally liable for the mortgage unless there was an assumption of the mortgage or a novation that transferred liability to them.\n\nTherefore, the court might hold that only the original owners can be compelled to pay off the mortgage.\n\nAdditionally, the purchaser's decision not to perform a title search could be seen as negligence, and they might bear some responsibility for not discovering the lien.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, a purchaser who buys property without notice of existing liens may have remedies against the seller (the adult child) for breach of warranty of title.\n\nBut in this specific scenario, the purchaser is suing the grantor (adult child) to compel payment of the mortgage and removal of the lien.\n\nGiven that the adult child is not necessarily liable for the mortgage, the court might dismiss the lawsuit, as the adult child cannot be compelled to pay a debt they are not legally obligated to pay.\n\nTherefore, the court is more likely to grant the motion to dismiss, and the answer is A or B.\n\nBetween A and B, option B seems more accurate because it specifies that only the original four owners are liable for the mortgage.\n\nSo, the answer is B: Yes, because the court can only force the original four owners to clear the mortgage by paying it in full.\n\nThis makes sense because they are the ones who signed the promissory note and are thus legally bound to repay the loan.\n\nThe adult child, as the new owner, might have obligations to the purchaser regarding the condition of title, but not necessarily to pay the mortgage unless there was an assumption of the debt.\n\nTherefore, the court cannot compel the adult child to pay the mortgage, and the motion to dismiss should be granted.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
