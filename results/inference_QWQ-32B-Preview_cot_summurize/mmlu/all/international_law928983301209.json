There is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law.\n\nB. Treaties supersede custom.\n\nC. Custom supersedes treaties.\n\nD. General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the formal sources of international law are. I think they are treaties, custom, and general principles of law. These are the primary sources recognized by international law.\n\nNow, the question is about the relationship between these sources, specifically whether there is a hierarchy among them.\n\nOption A says there is no hierarchy between these sources. Option B suggests that treaties are superior to custom, Option C that custom is superior to treaties, and Option D that general principles of law are superior to both treaties and custom.\n\nI need to think about how these sources interact and which one takes precedence when there is a conflict.\n\nI remember that treaties are agreements between states and are considered binding under international law. Custom, on the other hand, arises from the consistent practice of states out of a sense of legal obligation. General principles of law are those principles common to major legal systems.\n\nIn terms of hierarchy, I think that treaties and custom are both primary sources, but custom might be seen as more fundamental because it reflects the actual practices and consent of states over time.\n\nHowever, I also recall that treaties can modify customary international law. So, if states enter into a treaty that contradicts existing custom, the treaty would take precedence for the parties to the treaty.\n\nBut in general, for states not party to the treaty, custom would still apply.\n\nWait, but the question is about the formal sources and their relationship, not specifically about how they apply to different states.\n\nI think the key here is understanding that in international law, there isn't a fixed hierarchy among these sources. Each source is important and their application depends on the specific circumstances and the consent of states.\n\nFor example, a treaty will govern the relationship between its parties, superseding any conflicting custom between them. But for states not party to the treaty, custom would still apply.\n\nSimilarly, general principles of law fill in gaps where treaties and custom are silent.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is correct: there is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law.\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nIf I consider the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which regulates treaties, it does mention that a treaty cannot derogate from the rules of international peremptory norms (jus cogens). So, in that sense, some norms might be considered higher than treaty law.\n\nBut in general, for ordinary treaties and custom, it's not straightforward which one supersedes the other.\n\nMoreover, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) often has to adjudicate disputes where there are conflicting sources, and it considers the specific context, the intent of the states, and the evolution of international law.\n\nTherefore, it seems that there isn't a rigid hierarchy among the sources, and each case is analyzed based on its merits and the specific sources involved.\n\nSo, I would go with option A: there is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B: Treaties supersede custom.\n\nWhile treaties can supersede custom between the parties to the treaty, this isn't universally true in all cases. Sometimes, custom may still prevail if the treaty is seen as inconsistent with a peremptory norm.\n\nOption C: Custom supersedes treaties.\n\nThis could be the case in some situations, especially if a new custom emerges that overrides an existing treaty provision.\n\nOption D: General Principles of Law supersede both custom and treaties.\n\nThis seems unlikely because general principles usually come into play where there is no treaty or custom governing a particular issue.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that option A is the correct answer: there is no hierarchy between the formal sources of international law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
