                    "text": "To determine which of these molecules has the highest normal boiling point, we need to consider the intermolecular forces present in each substance. The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point will be.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. CH3CH2CH2CH3: This is butane, a straight-chain alkane. Alkanes have only London dispersion forces (LDFs) between their molecules, which are relatively weak intermolecular forces.\n\nB. CH3CH2CH2CH2OH: This is butanol, which has a hydroxyl group (-OH). This allows for hydrogen bonding between molecules, which is a much stronger intermolecular force compared to LDFs.\n\nC. CH3CH2CH2CH2Cl: This is 1-chlorobutane, which has a chlorine atom attached to the carbon chain. Chlorine is more electronegative than carbon, so there is a dipole-dipole interaction in addition to LDFs.\n\nD. CH3CH2CH2CH2Br: This is 1-bromobutane, which has a bromine atom attached to the carbon chain. Bromine is more electronegative than carbon, similar to chlorine, so it also has dipole-dipole interactions along with LDFs.\n\nNow, comparing these:\n\n- Option A has only LDFs.\n\n- Option B has hydrogen bonding.\n\n- Options C and D have dipole-dipole interactions and LDFs.\n\nHydrogen bonding is generally stronger than dipole-dipole interactions, which in turn are stronger than LDFs. Therefore, butanol (option B) should have a higher boiling point than the other options due to hydrogen bonding.\n\nHowever, let's consider the molecular weights as well, since LDFs increase with molecular weight.\n\n- Butane (A) has a molecular weight of approximately 58 g/mol.\n\n- Butanol (B) has a molecular weight of approximately 74 g/mol.\n\n- 1-Chlorobutane (C) has a molecular weight of approximately 94.5 g/mol.\n\n- 1-Bromobutane (D) has a molecular weight of approximately 127.9 g/mol.\n\nSo, options C and D have higher molecular weights, which would increase their LDFs and thus their boiling points. But compared to hydrogen bonding, the effect of increased molecular weight might not be sufficient to surpass the boiling point of butanol.\n\nWait a minute, but in practice, haloalkanes like chlorobutane and bromobutane can have boiling points higher than alcohols due to the strength of dipole-dipole interactions combined with higher molecular weights.\n\nLet me check the actual boiling points:\n\n- Butane (A): Around -0.5\u00b0C\n\n- Butanol (B): Around 117.2\u00b0C\n\n- 1-Chlorobutane (C): Around 71.7\u00b0C\n\n- 1-Bromobutane (D): Around 101.6\u00b0C\n\nFrom these values, butanol has the highest boiling point, followed by 1-bromobutane, then 1-chlorobutane, and finally butane.\n\nBut according to the options, D (1-bromobutane) has a higher boiling point than C (1-chlorobutane), which makes sense because bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, leading to stronger LDFs.\n\nHowever, the question is which has the highest boiling point, and according to the actual data, it's butanol (B).\n\nBut perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let's think about it again.\n\nIn general, hydrogen bonding is stronger than dipole-dipole interactions, so alcohols have higher boiling points than haloalkanes of similar molecular weight.\n\nBut in this case, 1-bromobutane has a higher molecular weight than butanol, which might make its boiling point higher due to stronger LDFs.\n\nWait, but according to the data, butanol still has a higher boiling point than 1-bromobutane.\n\nSo perhaps the hydrogen bonding in butanol overcomes the higher molecular weight of 1-bromobutane.\n\nBut to generalize, for molecules with similar structures, increasing molecular weight increases boiling points due to stronger LDFs.\n\nHowever, when comparing different types of intermolecular forces, hydrogen bonding typically results in significantly higher boiling points compared to just dipole-dipole interactions or LDFs.\n\nSo in this case, even though 1-bromobutane has a higher molecular weight, the hydrogen bonding in butanol leads to a higher boiling point.\n\nTherefore, the expected order of boiling points should be:\n\n1. Butanol (B)\n\n2. 1-Bromobutane (D)\n\n3. 1-Chlorobutane (C)\n\n4. Butane (A)\n\nHence, the molecule expected to have the highest normal boiling point is butanol (B).\n\nBut wait, the question includes options C and D, which are chlorobutane and bromobutane, respectively.\n\nGiven that bromine is larger than chlorine, 1-bromobutane should have stronger LDFs and thus a higher boiling point than 1-chlorobutane.\n\nHowever, compared to butanol, which has hydrogen bonding, its boiling point should still be lower.\n\nBut according to the actual data, butanol has a boiling point of around 117\u00b0C, while 1-bromobutane has around 102\u00b0C.\n\nSo butanol > 1-bromobutane > 1-chlorobutane > butane.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B, but let's consider if there's any other factor.\n\nPerhaps the presence of a halogen atom increases the polarity and thus the boiling point compared to a hydrocarbon or an alcohol.\n\nBut in reality, the hydrogen bonding in alcohols dominates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to consider the influence of the halogen's electronegativity.\n\nChlorine and bromine are more electronegative than carbon, leading to dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nBut again, hydrogen bonding is stronger.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding that heavier halogens lead to higher boiling points due to stronger LDFs.\n\nIn that case, 1-bromobutane would have a higher boiling point than 1-chlorobutane.\n\nBut compared to butanol, hydrogen bonding should still result in a higher boiling point.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, D is 1-bromobutane, which has a higher molecular weight and thus stronger LDFs, but its boiling point is still lower than butanol's due to the stronger hydrogen bonding.\n\nTherefore, butanol should have the highest boiling point among the given options.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the boiling points again:\n\n- Butane: -0.5\u00b0C\n\n- Butanol: 117.2\u00b0C\n\n- 1-Chlorobutane: 71.7\u00b0C\n\n- 1-Bromobutane: 101.6\u00b0C\n\nSo, butanol has the highest boiling point.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.\n\nHowever, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the understanding that bromine, being larger than chlorine, chlorine being larger than hydrogen, leads to stronger LDFs and thus higher boiling points.\n\nBut in reality, hydrogen bonding is a much stronger force.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider that bromine has a higher atomic number and thus stronger LDFs.\n\nBut again, hydrogen bonding is dominant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is misinterpreted, and the answer is D because bromine has the highest atomic number and thus the strongest LDFs.\n\nBut according to actual data, butanol has a higher boiling point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the context of the question, D is the correct answer, but according to actual chemical principles and data, B is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the options or the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the influence of the halogen on the boiling point.\n\nBut in any case, based on standard chemical principles and known boiling points, butanol (B) should have the highest boiling point among the given options.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
