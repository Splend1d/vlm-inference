The contract included this provision: \"Terms: Cash upon delivery \u0080\u0094 deliveries to be made at least twice per month.\" The deliveries went as scheduled. At the beginning of the fifth month, the orchard sent notice to the retailer that a load of cherries was ready for pick up. The truck driver, however, forgot to take the retailer's check with him. The orchard turned over the cherries but advised the retailer to pay within three days. The retailer sent the check by mail but it arrived late by two days. The orchard refused to deliver any more cherries. The retailer sued the orchard for breach of the installment contract and demanded the difference in price between the cherries on the open market and what he would have paid under the contract. The orchard claimed that the delayed payment impaired the value of the contract and moved to dismiss. Will the court grant the orchard's motion to dismiss?\n\nA. Yes, the agreement called for cash at delivery, which was not done when the driver forgot to deliver the check.\nB. Yes, the failure to make an installment on time was a breach because time is of the essence in all installment agreements.\nC.

                    "text": "This question is about a contract between a retailer and an orchard for the purchase of cherries over a 12-month period. The contract specifies \"cash upon delivery\" and requires deliveries at least twice a month. In the fifth month, there was an issue with payment timing, and the orchard stopped delivering cherries, leading the retailer to sue for breach of contract.\n\nLet's break down the situation:\n\n1. **Contract Terms**: The contract requires \"cash upon delivery\" and deliveries at least twice a month.\n\n2. **Incident**: In the fifth month, the orchard notified the retailer that a load of cherries was ready for pickup. The truck driver forgot to take the retailer's check, but the orchard still handed over the cherries, advising the retailer to pay within three days. The retailer sent the check by mail, but it arrived two days late.\n\n3. **Orchard's Action**: The orchard refused to deliver any more cherries after this incident.\n\n4. **Legal Action**: The retailer sued for breach of the installment contract, seeking the difference in price between the open market and the contract price. The orchard moved to dismiss, claiming that the delayed payment impaired the value of the contract.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether the court will grant the orchard's motion to dismiss based on the options provided.\n\n**Option A**: Yes, the agreement called for cash at delivery, which was not done when the driver forgot to deliver the check.\n\n- This option suggests that since the contract required cash upon delivery and the retailer didn't provide it at that time, they breached the contract.\n\n**Option B**: Yes, the failure to make an installment on time was a breach because time is of the essence in all installment agreements.\n\n- This option asserts that in all installment contracts, time is of the essence, meaning that timely payments are crucial, and any delay constitutes a breach.\n\n**Option C**: No, there is always a grace period of ten days for any single payment pertaining to an installment contract.\n\n- This option proposes that there is a standard grace period of ten days for payments in installment contracts, so a two-day delay wouldn't constitute a breach.\n\n**Option D**: No, the delay in one payment under these facts was not enough to impair the value of the contract under the Uniform Commercial Code.\n\n- This option suggests that under the UCC, a single late payment doesn't impair the contract's value, hence doesn't justify termination.\n\nTo make an informed decision, we need to consider the relevant legal principles, particularly those from the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs sales of goods.\n\n**Relevant UCC Provisions**:\n\n- **UCC 2-609**: This section deals with partial breaches in installment contracts. It provides that if a party commits a partial breach, the other party can recover damages but cannot avoid the contract unless the breach goes to the root of the contract or impairs its value.\n\n- **UCC 2-612**: This section addresses the right to adequate assurance of performance. If a party has reasonable grounds for insecurity about the other party's performance, they can demand adequate assurance.\n\n- **UCC 2-308**: This section deals with payment provisions, including the time and place of payment.\n\nGiven these provisions, let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Cash Upon Delivery**: The contract specifies \"cash upon delivery,\" which means payment is due at the time of delivery.\n\n2. **Delivery and Payment Incident**: The retailer didn't have the check at the time of delivery, but the orchard still delivered the cherries and allowed a three-day payment window.\n\n3. **Late Payment**: The retailer's check arrived two days late.\n\n4. **Orchard's Reaction**: The orchard refused further deliveries, claiming breach.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n- **Breach of Contract**: The retailer failed to make payment at the time of delivery, as per the contract. However, the orchard still delivered the goods and allowed an extension of three days for payment.\n\n- **Material Breach**: The question is whether this single late payment constitutes a material breach that allows the orchard to terminate the contract.\n\n- **UCC 2-609**: Under this section, a partial breach doesn't allow termination unless it goes to the root of the contract or impairs its value. In this case, the orchard received payment eventually and there's no indication that the late payment caused significant harm.\n\n- **Commercial Reasonableness**: The orchard allowed a three-day extension, suggesting that strict adherence to the \"cash upon delivery\" term wasn't enforced rigidly.\n\n- **Proportionality**: The retailer's breach was a minor delay in payment, and the orchard's remedy was to refuse all further deliveries, which seems disproportionate.\n\nGiven these points, it's likely that the court would not grant the orchard's motion to dismiss because the retailer's delay in payment didn't substantially impair the contract's value. Therefore, option D seems most appropriate.\n\nHowever, let's consider the other options:\n\n**Option A**: While the retailer did not provide cash upon delivery, the orchard still delivered the goods and allowed extra time for payment. This suggests that the orchard was willing to be flexible on the payment terms.\n\n**Option B**: This option is too broad. It states that time is of the essence in all installment agreements, which isn't accurate. Whether time is of the essence depends on the specific contract terms and circumstances.\n\n**Option C**: There is no universal grace period of ten days in installment contracts. Grace periods depend on the contract terms or applicable law.\n\n**Option D**: This aligns with the UCC's approach, which generally requires that a breach be material to justify termination. A single late payment, especially with no significant harm, may not be material.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer is **D. No, the delay in one payment under these facts was not enough to impair the value of the contract under the Uniform Commercial Code.**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD."
