Both SRAM and DRAM, D. None.\" Hmm, I need to recall how SRAM and DRAM are constructed at a basic level.\n\nFirst, I know that SRAM stands for Static Random Access Memory, and DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. They are both types of volatile memory, meaning they lose their data when the power is turned off.\n\nNow, SRAM is called \"static\" because it doesn't need to be refreshed regularly to maintain its data. It uses flip-flops to store each bit of data, and each flip-flop is made up of four to six transistors. So, for SRAM, it's multiple transistors per bit.\n\nOn the other hand, DRAM is called \"dynamic\" because it needs to be refreshed periodically. It uses a capacitor to store each bit of data, and this capacitor needs to be refreshed every few milliseconds to prevent the charge from leaking away. To control the charging and discharging of this capacitor, a transistor is used. So, in DRAM, each memory cell consists of one transistor and one capacitor.\n\nGiven that, it seems like DRAM uses one transistor and one capacitor per memory cell, whereas SRAM uses multiple transistors without capacitors.\n\nSo, looking back at the options:\n\nA. SRAM - uses multiple transistors, no capacitors.\n\nB. DRAM - uses one transistor and one capacitor.\n\nC. Both SRAM and DRAM - but that can't be right because SRAM doesn't use a capacitor.\n\nD. None - but DRAM does use one transistor and one capacitor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. DRAM.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any variation in DRAM where it might use more than one transistor per cell? For example, in some DRAM cells, like those in DDR3 or DDR4 modules, is there any difference in the basic structure?\n\nFrom what I recall, even in newer DRAM technologies, the basic memory cell still consists of one transistor and one capacitor. The complexity might increase in terms of addressing and other support circuitry, but the fundamental memory cell remains the same.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. DRAM is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
