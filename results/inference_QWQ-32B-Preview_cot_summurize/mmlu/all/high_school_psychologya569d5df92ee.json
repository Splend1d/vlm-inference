Symptoms of PTSD can include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event.\n\nLet's briefly look at why the other options are not the best fit:\n\nA. Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder, is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states that recurrently take control of the person's behavior. While DID can be associated with trauma, the symptoms described\u2014flashbacks and nightmares\u2014are more directly associated with PTSD.\n\nB. Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that involves episodes of mania and depression. While individuals with bipolar disorder can experience a range of symptoms, flashbacks and nightmares are not typical symptoms of this disorder.\n\nC. Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. Symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, and reduced expression of emotions. Again, flashbacks and nightmares are not primary symptoms of schizophrenia.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate diagnosis for someone experiencing flashbacks and nightmares after a serious car accident is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."
