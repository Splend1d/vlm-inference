                    "text": "According to the Solar Nebular theory, asteroids and comets are believed to be leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets. So, the correct answer would be option D.\n\nTo elaborate, the Solar Nebular theory explains the formation of the solar system from a rotating cloud of gas and dust, known as the solar nebula. As this nebula collapsed under its own gravity, it flattened into a disk with the Sun forming at the center. Within this disk, small particles collided and stuck together, gradually growing into larger bodies called planetesimals. These planetesimals then collided and merged to form planets.\n\nHowever, not all planetesimals grew into full-fledged planets. Some remained as smaller bodies, which are now observed as asteroids and comets. Asteroids are primarily found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, while comets reside in the outer reaches of the solar system in regions like the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud.\n\nOption A suggests that asteroids and comets are the shattered remains of collisions between planets. While collisions did occur in the early solar system, the majority of asteroids and comets are thought to have formed independently rather than being fragments from planetary collisions.\n\nOption B states that they are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed. However, according to the Solar Nebular theory, asteroids and comets formed during the same period as the planets, not significantly later.\n\nOption C proposes that they are chunks of rock or ice expelled from planets by volcanoes. While volcanic activity can eject material from a planet, this is not the primary source of asteroids and comets in the solar system.\n\nTherefore, based on the Solar Nebular theory, the most accurate description is that asteroids and comets are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
