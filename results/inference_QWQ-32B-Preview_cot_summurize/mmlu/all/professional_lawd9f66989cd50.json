                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. There's a grocery store that's being sued by a customer who got injured when he collided with the store's automatic doors. The customer says that the doors were programmed to swing outward, which surprised him and caused his injuries to his face and forearms. The grocery store is denying that the doors were unsafe or that the customer's injuries were caused by the doors.\n\nAt trial, the customer testified about his injuries and what happened. His sister also testified that she was with him that day, saw the doors swinging outward and hitting him, and that when she went back to the store the next week, the doors had been re-programmed to swing inward.\n\nNow, the question is about the admissibility of the sister's testimony. The options are:\n\nA. Admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.\n\nB. Admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent.\n\nC. Inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy.\n\nD. Inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sister is testifying about. She's saying that she saw the doors swinging outward and that they hit her brother, and that later, the doors had been changed to swing inward.\n\nOption A suggests that her testimony is admissible as a lay opinion based on commonsense impressions. Lay opinions are allowed when they're rationally based on the witness's perception and helpful to clearly understanding the witness's testimony or determining a fact in issue. In this case, the sister is describing what she saw, which is a factual observation, not really an opinion. So, maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nOption B mentions tacit admission of a party opponent. That sounds like hearsay exception, but I think it's misapplied here. Tacit admissions usually involve statements by a party opponent that are against their interest. Here, the sister is testifying as a witness, not as a party opponent. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says inadmissible on grounds of irrelevancy. I need to consider whether the sister's testimony is relevant to the case. Relevancy means that the evidence has a tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence, and the fact is of consequence in determining the action.\n\nThe sister's testimony that she saw the doors swinging outward and hitting her brother directly relates to the customer's claim that the doors were programmed to swing outward and caused his injuries. So, this seems highly relevant.\n\nAdditionally, her testimony about returning the next week and seeing the doors re-programmed to swing inward could be relevant to show that the store made changes to the doors after the incident, possibly indicating that they were aware of a problem.\n\nTherefore, on relevancy grounds, her testimony seems admissible.\n\nOption D suggests inadmissible on grounds of public policy considerations. I'm not sure what specific public policy considerations are being referred to here. In general, evidence is admissible if it's relevant unless there's a specific rule or policy that excludes it.\n\nIn this case, since the testimony is relevant, and there doesn't seem to be any specific public policy that would make it inadmissible, this option doesn't seem applicable.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that the sister's testimony should be admissible, and the best answer is likely A, admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because her testimony seems more factual than opinion-based. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me look up the rules on lay opinions.\n\nAccording to the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 701 governs opinion testimony by lay witnesses. It states that a witness who is not an expert may testify in the form of opinions or inferences that are:\n\n(a) rationally based on the witness\u2019s perception;\n\n(b) helpful to clearly understanding the witness\u2019s testimony or to determining a fact in issue; and\n\n(c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\n\nIn this case, the sister is testifying about what she saw: the doors swinging outward and hitting her brother, and that when she returned the next week, the doors were swinging inward. These are observations that she directly perceived and are not based on any specialized knowledge.\n\nSo, her testimony is more about factual observations rather than opinions. Maybe option A isn't the best fit because it's characterizing her testimony as an opinion, whereas it's actually factual testimony.\n\nPerhaps option B is trying to suggest that the store's reprogramming of the doors is an admission of some sort, but again, that doesn't seem to fit because the store is denying that the doors were unsafe or that the customer's injuries were caused by the doors.\n\nOption C says inadmissible on grounds of irrelevancy, but as I thought earlier, her testimony is directly relevant to the issues in the case.\n\nOption D mentions public policy considerations, which is vague. Maybe it's referring to some policy against allowing family members to testify, but I don't recall any such general rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the concern is that allowing the sister to testify about what she saw would lead to a flood of biased testimony from family members. But that seems like a weak argument because relevance should trump such concerns unless there's a specific rule against it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an issue with the sister testifying about the doors being re-programmed later, as that might suggest negligence or admission by the store. But again, evidence of subsequent changes can be admissible to show notice or knowledge of a problem.\n\nGiven all this, I think the trial judge should rule the sister's testimony as admissible, and the best option is A, admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper.\n\nBut I'm still a bit uneasy because her testimony is primarily factual, not opinion-based. Maybe the answer is that it's admissible, but not specifically as a lay opinion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option A is trying to encompass both factual observations and lay opinions, and in that case, it would be admissible.\n\nI think I'll go with A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA) admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper."
