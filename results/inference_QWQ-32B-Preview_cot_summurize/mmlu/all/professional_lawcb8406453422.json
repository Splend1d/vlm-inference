It goes over her friends' heads and hits a woman's straw hat who's sitting in a beach chair nearby, reading a book. The ball doesn't touch the woman, but it hits her hat, which gets knocked off, and in the process, the woman falls from her chair and breaks her arm.\n\nNow, if this woman decides to sue the girl for her broken arm, we need to figure out what her legal options are. The question is multiple choice:\n\nA. She can recover for assault only.\n\nB. She can recover for battery only.\n\nC. She can recover for both assault and battery.\n\nD. She cannot recover at all.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what assault and battery mean in legal terms because those terms might not be exactly what I think they are.\n\nAssault, legally, is the intentional creation of a harmful or offensive contact without consent. It's about the apprehension or fear of imminent harm, not the actual harm itself.\n\nBattery, on the other hand, is the actual harmful or offensive contact with someone without their consent.\n\nIn this scenario, the woman was not touched by the ball directly; it only hit her hat, which led to her falling and breaking her arm.\n\nSo, let's think about assault first. For assault, there needs to be an intentional act that causes the victim to fear imminent harm. In this case, the girl threw the ball, but she didn't aim for the woman; it was an accident. Intent is key here. Since it was accidental, it might be hard to prove intent to cause harm. So, assault might not apply here.\n\nNow, battery requires actual contact with the victim. But in this case, the ball didn't touch the woman; it touched her hat. So, did the ball make contact with her person? Probably not, since it hit the hat instead.\n\nBut wait, the hat was on her head, so it was attached to her person in a way. Does touching her hat count as touching her?\n\nIn some legal interpretations, touching an object closely associated with a person, like clothing or a hat they're wearing, could be considered touching the person themselves. So, maybe battery could apply here.\n\nHowever, in this specific scenario, the ball hit the hat, which then fell, causing the woman to fall and break her arm. So, there was no direct contact between the ball and the woman.\n\nGiven that, it might be a stretch to consider this battery, but it's worth considering.\n\nNext, let's think about negligence. The girl was playing with a ball in a public area, and she threw it too far, hitting the woman's hat and causing her to fall and break her arm.\n\nNegligence is when someone fails to exercise reasonable care, resulting in harm to another person.\n\nIn this case, was it reasonable for the girl to be playing with a ball in that area? Was there a foreseeable risk that the ball could hit someone nearby?\n\nWell, they were in a field, and there were people around, including the woman reading nearby. So, perhaps the girl should have been more careful where she was throwing the ball.\n\nIf the girl was negligent in playing with the ball in that area, and that negligence directly led to the woman's injury, then the woman might have a case for negligence.\n\nBut the question seems to be focusing on assault and battery, so maybe negligence isn't the primary issue here.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them mention negligence, so perhaps we need to stick to assault and battery.\n\nLet's consider if both assault and battery could apply.\n\nAs I thought earlier, assault requires intent to cause apprehension of harm, and battery requires actual contact.\n\nGiven that the contact was indirect (through the hat), and the act was accidental, it's unlikely that both assault and battery would apply.\n\nSo, maybe option C, recovering for both, isn't the right answer.\n\nOption D says she cannot recover at all. But if there was negligence, perhaps she can recover based on that, but since negligence isn't listed, maybe not.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about assault and battery.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, recovering for battery only.\n\nBut, as I'm not entirely sure if hitting the hat counts as hitting the person, I'm a bit unsure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's A, assault only.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that assault requires intent, which might not be present here since it was an accident.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the answer is D, she cannot recover.\n\nBut that seems harsh, because the girl's actions did lead to the woman's injury.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the law considers that indirect contact can constitute battery in some cases.\n\nI recall that battery can include indirect contact, like throwing something that hits someone.\n\nBut in this case, the ball didn't hit the woman directly; it hit her hat, which then fell, causing her to fall.\n\nSo, it's a bit removed.\n\nMaybe the connection isn't direct enough for battery.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fear of the ball hitting her could constitute assault.\n\nIf the woman saw the ball coming and feared it would hit her, that could be assault.\n\nBut the scenario says that \"Although the woman did not see the ball coming,\" so she wasn't aware of it until it happened.\n\nIf she didn't see it coming, maybe there's no assault because there was no apprehension of harm.\n\nWait, but assault can also be about the intention of the person throwing the ball, not just the victim's perception.\n\nBut in this case, the girl didn't intend to harm the woman; it was an accident.\n\nSo, intent is a key factor here.\n\nMaybe neither assault nor battery applies here, and thus the woman cannot recover.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, because the girl's actions did lead to the woman's injury.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is battery because the hat was an extension of her person.\n\nBut again, it's a bit fuzzy.\n\nGiven the options, I'm leaning towards D, she cannot recover.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I need to look up some legal definitions or cases that are similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a principle in tort law that applies here.\n\nIn tort law, battery requires unauthorized contact that is harmful or offensive.\n\nIn this case, the contact was indirect, through the hat.\n\nSome courts might consider that sufficient for battery, while others might not.\n\nGiven that, it's possible that battery could be established, but it's not clear-cut.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the woman could argue that the girl's actions constituted negligence, but again, that's not one of the options.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is D, she cannot recover.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider it from the girl's perspective.\n\nShe was playing a game, and accidents happen.\n\nHowever, she should have been more careful where she was throwing the ball.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman was sitting nearby, and perhaps should have been more aware of her surroundings.\n\nBut that seems unfair; people shouldn't have to constantly watch out for balls being thrown at them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the park has rules about where balls can be played, and if so, the girl might be at fault.\n\nBut we don't have that information in the scenario.\n\nGiven all that, I think the most appropriate answer is D, she cannot recover.\n\nWhile it's unfortunate that the woman was injured, the girl didn't intend to harm her, and the contact was indirect.\n\nTherefore, neither assault nor battery would likely be applicable in this situation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) not recover."
