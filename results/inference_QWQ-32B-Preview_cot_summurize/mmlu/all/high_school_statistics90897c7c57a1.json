So, the scenario is that a researcher wants to survey the opinions of students at our high school, and the plan is to select every twenty-fifth student entering the school in the morning. And we're assuming there are no absences. The question is, does this result in a simple random sample of students attending the school?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because every student has the same chance of being selected.\n\nB. Yes, but only if there is a single entrance to the school.\n\nC. Yes, because the 24 out of every 25 students who are not selected will form a control group.\n\nD. No, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a simple random sample is. A simple random sample is a subset of a statistical population in which each member of the subset has an equal probability of being chosen. Also, every possible sample of that size has the same chance of being selected.\n\nIn this case, the researcher is selecting every twenty-fifth student entering the school. This sounds like systematic sampling, not necessarily simple random sampling.\n\nSystematic sampling involves selecting members from a population at regular intervals. So, if you select every kth element, in this case, k is 25.\n\nNow, in simple random sampling, every student should have an equal chance of being selected, and every possible group of the desired sample size should have an equal chance of being selected.\n\nIn systematic sampling, while each individual might have an equal chance of being selected, not every possible group of the sample size has an equal chance of being selected. That's because the selection is based on a fixed interval, which can introduce some patterns or periodicities that might not be present in simple random sampling.\n\nSo, option D seems to be pointing towards this difference between systematic sampling and simple random sampling.\n\nOption A says yes, because every student has the same chance of being selected. While it's true that each student has the same individual probability of being selected in systematic sampling, it doesn't guarantee that every possible sample has an equal chance of being selected, which is a requirement for simple random sampling.\n\nOption B introduces the condition about a single entrance to the school. I'm not sure why that would be relevant. The number of entrances shouldn't affect the randomness of the sampling method, as long as all students are entering through those entrances and are equally likely to be selected according to the sampling scheme.\n\nOption C mentions a control group, which doesn't seem relevant to the definition of simple random sampling. The concept of a control group is more related to experimental design, not to sampling methods.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: No, because not every sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIf the students enter the school in a random order, then selecting every twenty-fifth student might approximate a simple random sample, but it's still not the same as true simple random sampling.\n\nAlso, if there's some pattern to the way students enter the school, the systematic sampling could introduce bias. For example, if students arrive in groups or there are patterns in arrival times, the systematic selection could coincide with those patterns, leading to a non-representative sample.\n\nSo, even though option D is correct in a general sense, perhaps there's more to consider in this specific scenario.\n\nBut based on the definitions, I think D is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
