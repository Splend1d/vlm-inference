                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a landowner who owned an apartment building in fee simple and devised it to his assistant and his friend as tenants in common. Then the assistant dies intestate, meaning without a will, and his only surviving heir is his daughter. While the assistant's estate is being administered, the friend agrees to convey his interest in the apartment building to the daughter. And the question is asking what would be a valid conveyance by the friend.\n\nSo first, I need to understand the initial setup. The landowner owned the apartment building in fee simple, which means he had the fullest possible ownership interest. He devised it to his assistant and his friend as tenants in common. Tenants in common means that each holds a separate undivided interest in the property, and their interests are not necessarily equal. They can sell or inherit their respective shares independently.\n\nNow, the assistant dies intestate, leaving his daughter as his only surviving heir. Since he died intestate, his interest in the apartment building would pass to his heirs according to the laws of intestacy, which in this case would be his daughter.\n\nSo, the assistant's interest is now owned by his daughter, but the estate is still in administration. That means that legally, the estate hasn't been fully settled yet, but the daughter is the heir entitled to the assistant's interest.\n\nMeanwhile, the friend, who is still alive and holds his own interest as a tenant in common, agrees to convey his interest to the daughter.\n\nSo, the friend wants to convey his interest in the apartment building to the daughter. The question is, what would be a valid way for the friend to do this?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. to the estate of the assistant and its successors and assigns.\n\nB. to the heirs and assigns of the assistant.\n\nC. to the daughter and her heirs and assigns.\n\nD. to the assistant as a former tenant in common with remainder to the daughter.\n\nOkay, let's analyze each one.\n\nOption A: to the estate of the assistant and its successors and assigns.\n\nWell, the assistant has already died, and his estate is in administration. So, conveying to the estate might not be directly benefiting the daughter, although ultimately the estate's assets would go to the daughter as the heir. But since the daughter is already the heir, maybe there's a better way to convey directly to her.\n\nOption B: to the heirs and assigns of the assistant.\n\nSimilar to option A, this seems indirect. The assistant's heir is the daughter, but referring to \"heirs and assigns\" might be too vague and could potentially include others if there were multiple heirs, but in this case, it's just the daughter.\n\nOption C: to the daughter and her heirs and assigns.\n\nThis seems direct and clear. The friend is conveying his interest to the daughter and allowing her to pass it on to her heirs and assigns. This seems straightforward and appropriate.\n\nOption D: to the assistant as a former tenant in common with remainder to the daughter.\n\nBut the assistant is deceased, so conveying to him as a former tenant in common doesn't make sense because he's no longer alive. You can't convey property to a deceased person.\n\nSo, option D is not valid.\n\nBetween options A, B, and C, option C seems the most direct and appropriate. It clearly conveys the interest to the daughter and allows her to have ownership rights, including the ability to transfer the interest to her own heirs or assigns.\n\nOption A and B are indirectly referring to the daughter through the estate or the heirs of the assistant, which might be acceptable, but option C is more direct and specific.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely C. to the daughter and her heirs and assigns.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
