Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I tossed the small child 10 feet into the air over my head.\"\n\nOkay, tossing a small child that high sounds dangerous. Kids are vulnerable, and hurting them is generally considered wrong. But maybe in some contexts, like at a playground with a soft surface, it could be seen as playful if done carefully. However, 10 feet is pretty high, and even with the best intentions, it's risky. I think most people would say that's morally wrong because it endangers the child.\n\nScenario 2: \"I sat outside to spy on the animals that came out at night.\"\n\nThis seems pretty harmless. Observing animals in their natural habitat is common for nature enthusiasts. It doesn't seem to harm anyone or anything. Maybe some people might think it's a bit creepy, but overall, it's probably acceptable.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think B is the correct choice here.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe someone could argue that tossing a child in the air could be acceptable in certain situations, like if the child is used to it and there's a soft surface. However, generally speaking, it's still risky and could be seen as negligent. So, I stick with B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
