Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what each of these fallacies is.\n\nA. Slippery slope: That's when someone argues that one small step will lead to a chain of events resulting in some negative outcome. Like, \"If we allow students to redo this test, next they'll want to redo all their tests, and then they'll expect to graduate without doing any work!\"\n\nB. Appeal to tradition: This seems pretty similar to what the question is describing. It's when someone argues that something is good or right just because it's traditional or has always been done that way.\n\nC. Argument from authority: That's when someone claims something is true because an authority figure says so, regardless of actual evidence.\n\nD. Ad nauseam: I think this means something is repeated over and over until people get sick of hearing it, but I'm not sure if it's a specific fallacy.\n\nGiven that, it sounds like \"appeal to tradition\" is the fallacy where someone argues for doing something because it's always been done that way.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nSlippery slope is about a chain reaction leading to a bad outcome, which isn't exactly what's happening here.\n\nArgument from authority is about relying on someone's status rather than the merit of the argument.\n\nAd nauseam seems more about repetition than about tradition.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. appeal to tradition is the correct answer here.\n\nIt's important to question why things are done a certain way and consider if there are better methods, rather than just sticking to tradition for tradition's sake.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
