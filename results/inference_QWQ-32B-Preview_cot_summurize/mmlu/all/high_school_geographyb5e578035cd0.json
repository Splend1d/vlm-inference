                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"All of the following are non-basic jobs in the city EXCEPT\" and then it lists a few options: A. city firefighter, B. social worker, C. dry cleaner, and D. garment factory worker. Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these is not a non-basic job. First, I need to understand what a non-basic job is in the context of urban economics or city planning.\n\nFrom what I recall, in the context of a city's economy, jobs are often categorized into two main types: basic jobs and non-basic jobs. Basic jobs are those that produce goods or services that are sold outside the local area, contributing to the city's economic base. These are considered export-oriented jobs because they bring in income from external sources. On the other hand, non-basic jobs are those that serve the local community and do not generate income from outside the area. These include jobs in retail, services, and other local amenities.\n\nSo, in this question, I need to identify which of the options is not a non-basic job, meaning it's a basic job that contributes to the city's economic base by selling goods or services outside the local area.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. City firefighter: Firefighters provide essential services to the local community. Their services are not sold outside the city; they are supported through local taxes and funding. So, this seems like a non-basic job.\n\nB. Social worker: Social workers also serve the local community, providing support and services to residents. Their work is not export-oriented; it's for the benefit of the local population. Therefore, this is likely a non-basic job.\n\nC. Dry cleaner: A dry cleaner provides cleaning services to local residents and businesses. Their customer base is primarily within the city, so this is also a non-basic job.\n\nD. Garment factory worker: Now, a garment factory likely produces clothes that are sold both locally and possibly exported outside the city or even the country, depending on the scale. If the factory sells a significant portion of its products outside the local area, then this job would be considered basic because it brings in external income.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, the garment factory worker seems to be the one that could be a basic job, while the others are non-basic.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure about this. Maybe there's more to it. Let's think about the garment factory worker again. If the factory is located in the city and sells its products mainly to local customers, then it might be considered a non-basic job. However, if a substantial part of its sales is from external markets, then it's a basic job.\n\nGiven that it's called a \"garment factory,\" it might be producing clothes on a scale that includes external sales, making it a basic job.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, the garment factory worker is likely the exception, being a basic job rather than a non-basic one.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Garment factory worker.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
