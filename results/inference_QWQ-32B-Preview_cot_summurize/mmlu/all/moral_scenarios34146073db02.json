This seems like a normal, everyday activity. There doesn't appear to be anything morally wrong with this action. It's relaxed, perhaps even enjoyable, and doesn't harm anyone or involve any ethical dilemmas. So, I would say this is not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character has created a fake report card using their computer graphics skills and presented it to their widowed mother, hoping she would be proud. This involves deception\u2014lying, essentially, by presenting something that isn't true as if it were real. Honesty is generally valued in relationships, especially between family members. Deceiving one's mother, even with good intentions like making her proud, can erode trust and potentially cause harm if the truth comes out later.\n\nMoreover, academic achievements are often important to parents, and presenting a fake report card could lead to misplaced pride and expectations. It's also dishonest towards the educational institution, though that might be a secondary concern here.\n\nGiven that deception is involved and it could potentially harm the relationship with the mother, I would consider this action morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
