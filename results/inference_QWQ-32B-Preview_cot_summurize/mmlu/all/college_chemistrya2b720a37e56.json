                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these spectroscopy types is a light-scattering technique. The options are nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, Raman, and ultraviolet-visible. I think I should recall what each of these techniques measures and how they interact with matter.\n\nFirst, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. I remember that NMR is based on the absorption of radiofrequency energy by nuclei in a magnetic field. It's used to study the structure and dynamics of molecules, especially in chemistry and biochemistry. But it doesn't involve light scattering; it's more about magnetic properties of atoms.\n\nNext, infrared (IR) spectroscopy. This one detects the vibrations and rotations of molecules when they absorb infrared radiation. It's great for identifying functional groups in organic molecules. Again, it's about absorption, not scattering.\n\nNow, Raman spectroscopy. I think this is the one that involves light scattering. In Raman scattering, monochromatic light, usually from a laser, interacts with molecules, and the light is scattered. Most of the scattered light is at the same wavelength as the incident light (this is called Rayleigh scattering), but a small portion is scattered at different wavelengths, which provides information about the molecular structure. So, it seems like Raman is a light-scattering technique.\n\nLastly, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. This technique measures the absorption of light in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. It's used to study the electronic transitions in molecules, which can give information about their structure and composition. Like NMR and IR, it's based on absorption, not scattering.\n\nSo, comparing all these, it looks like Raman spectroscopy is the one that involves light scattering. The other techniques are based on absorption of light at specific wavelengths.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that I'm not confusing Raman with other scattering techniques. For example, there's also Rayleigh scattering, which is the elastic scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength of light, like in the atmosphere. But Raman scattering is inelastic; some of the scattered light loses or gains energy, corresponding to molecular vibrations or rotations.\n\nAnother point to consider is that in Raman spectroscopy, the shift in wavelength of the scattered light provides information about the molecular energies, which can be correlated to different molecular features.\n\nI should also remember that Raman spectroscopy can be advantageous in some cases because it can provide information about molecular structures without requiring absorption of light, which some molecules don't do strongly in UV-Vis or IR.\n\nMoreover, Raman spectroscopy can be used to study samples that are in various states, like solids, liquids, and gases, and it's non-destructive, meaning it doesn't alter the sample.\n\nIn contrast, nuclear magnetic resonance requires a strong magnetic field and often takes longer to acquire data, but it can provide very detailed information about atomic environments.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy is great for identifying specific functional groups, but it can be less useful for studying molecules that don't have strong dipole moments.\n\nUltraviolet-visible spectroscopy is useful for studying molecules with conjugated systems or metal complexes that absorb in the UV-Vis range.\n\nGiven all this, I'm confident that Raman is the correct answer here, as it is the light-scattering technique among the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
