                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about production possibilities frontiers (PPFs). So, the question is: \"When opportunity cost is constant across all production levels, the production possibilities frontier is...\" and then it gives options A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a production possibilities frontier is. It's a graph that shows the different combinations of two goods that an economy can produce with its available resources and technology, assuming that all resources are fully and efficiently used.\n\nOpportunity cost is the cost of choosing one alternative over another in terms of the next best alternative given up. In the context of PPFs, it's the amount of one good that must be given up to produce one more unit of the other good.\n\nThe question states that the opportunity cost is constant across all production levels. That means no matter how much of one good we decide to produce, the amount of the other good we have to give up remains the same.\n\nNow, I need to think about how this affects the shape of the PPF.\n\nLet me consider option D: a straight diagonal line sloping downward from left to right. In a PPF graph, the x-axis typically represents one good, and the y-axis represents another good. A straight line indicates that the opportunity cost is constant because the slope of the line is constant. The slope represents the opportunity cost.\n\nWait, but in economics, when opportunity cost is constant, the PPF is indeed a straight line. That makes sense because the trade-off between the two goods doesn't change as we produce more of one and less of the other.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: concave to the origin. That would mean the PPF is bowed outward, away from the origin. This typically represents increasing opportunity costs, where producing more of one good requires giving up increasing amounts of the other good.\n\nOption B: convex to the origin. Convex to the origin would mean the PPF is bowed inward toward the origin. I'm not sure what that would represent, but it's not a standard shape for a PPF.\n\nOption C: undefined. That doesn't make much sense in this context because the PPF should always be definable, even if it's just a straight line or a curve.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, when opportunity cost is constant, the PPF should be a straight line. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, I think I should confirm this with a reference or a formula.\n\nIn my economics textbook, it says that if the opportunity cost is constant, the PPF will be a straight line. This is because the slope, which represents the opportunity cost, doesn't change.\n\nFor example, suppose an economy produces only two goods: guns and butter. If the opportunity cost of producing one more gun is always, say, two butter, then the PPF will be a straight line with a slope of -2.\n\nOn the other hand, if the opportunity cost increases as more of one good is produced, the PPF will be concave to the origin.\n\nSo, in this case, since the opportunity cost is constant, the PPF should be a straight line.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: a straight diagonal line sloping downward from left to right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
