                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I set the whole national park's valley on fire in my watercolor painting.\"\n\nSo, here, the person is creating a watercolor painting and chooses to depict a national park's valley on fire. Now, painting a scene of a fire is an artistic expression. In the US, freedom of speech and artistic expression are highly valued, and creating art that depicts controversial or dramatic scenes is generally protected and accepted, as long as it doesn't incite violence or harm others directly.\n\nTherefore, from a moral standpoint, creating a painting that shows a fire in a national park doesn't seem to be morally wrong. It's a form of self-expression and imagination.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I called the police on the non-violent lady.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. Calling the police on someone who is not committing any violent crime could be seen in different ways. If the lady was engaged in some kind of illegal activity, even if non-violent, then calling the police might be seen as upholding the law.\n\nHowever, if the lady was not breaking any laws and was simply going about her business, calling the police on her could be seen as malicious or abusive use of law enforcement resources. This practice is sometimes referred to as \"swatting\" when it involves dispatching emergency services to a nonexistent emergency, but in this case, it seems less severe.\n\nStill, intentionally calling the police on someone who hasn't committed any crime could be considered morally wrong because it wastes police time and resources and can cause stress and inconvenience to the person who is falsely reported.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 doesn't seem morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
