                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here: an audit client wants to not confirm a specific account receivable that the auditor has picked for confirmation, and there's a valid reason for that. Now, I need to figure out what the auditor should do in this situation based on the options given.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Verify the account balance by inspecting the client's bank statements and cash receipt records.\" Hmm, that sounds like a plausible alternative procedure. If the auditor can't confirm the receivable directly, checking the bank statements and cash receipts could provide some assurance that the amount is correct. But I'm not sure if this is the best course of action.\n\nOption B: \"Select at random a different account for confirmation that is approximately the same size.\" This seems like a reasonable approach too. If one account can't be confirmed, maybe confirming a similar-sized account would give comparable assurance. But I wonder if there's a better way or if this is the standard procedure.\n\nOption C: \"Request the client's management to document the matter in the management representation letter.\" Okay, so this is about getting management to acknowledge the situation in writing. While this might provide some documentation, I'm not sure if it directly addresses the need to verify the account balance.\n\nOption D: \"Explain to the client that the request will most likely cause the auditor to disclaim an opinion.\" This seems a bit heavy-handed. Disclaiming an opinion is a serious step that auditors take only under certain circumstances, like when there's a scope limitation. I don't know if this is the appropriate response here.\n\nLet me think about this differently. When an auditor can't confirm a particular account receivable, they need to find alternative ways to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the existence and accuracy of that balance. So, in essence, they need to perform alternative procedures.\n\nOption A mentions inspecting bank statements and cash receipt records. That could be part of the alternative procedures, but maybe there are other documents that could provide more direct evidence, like shipping documents or sales invoices.\n\nOption B suggests selecting a different account for confirmation. This might be acceptable if the alternative account is of similar materiality and represents a similar risk. However, it doesn't directly address the unconfirmed account.\n\nOption C is about getting management's representation. While management representations are important, they are not sufficient evidence on their own, especially for a material account. So, this might not be the best choice.\n\nOption D seems like it's threatening the client, which isn't very professional. Auditors should work collaboratively with their clients to resolve issues and find acceptable ways to obtain the necessary evidence.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way to approach this. According to auditing standards, if an auditor is unable to send a confirmation request for accounts receivable due to valid reasons, they should perform alternative audit procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence. These alternative procedures typically include examining documents that support the transaction, such as copies of sales invoices, shipping documents, and customer purchase orders.\n\nSo, in this case, option A is moving in the right direction by suggesting to inspect bank statements and cash receipt records, but it might be more comprehensive to also look at those transactional documents I just mentioned.\n\nOption B, selecting a different account, might be acceptable in some cases, but it doesn't replace the need to verify the specific account in question.\n\nOption C, getting a management representation, is not sufficient on its own because it's based on management's assertion, which needs to be corroborated by substantive evidence.\n\nOption D seems inappropriate because disclaiming an opinion is not a light matter and should only happen when there's a significant scope limitation that prevents the auditor from obtaining necessary evidence.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best answer is A, but with the understanding that the auditor should inspect not only bank statements and cash receipt records but also other relevant documents that support the account balance.\n\nWait a minute, option A only mentions bank statements and cash receipt records. Maybe the question expects the auditor to stick to what's listed in option A, but in practice, auditors would likely do more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, selecting a different account, because that allows the auditor to gather evidence on a similar account, thereby providing assurance indirectly.\n\nHowever, I'm leaning towards A because it involves verifying the specific account balance through alternative means, even if it's not perfect.\n\nOption C is insufficient because it relies on management's assertion without substantive evidence.\n\nOption D is probably not appropriate unless the auditor has no other choice but to disclaim an opinion, which doesn't seem to be the case here since there are alternative procedures available.\n\nSo, after considering all options, I think A is the most suitable action for the auditor to take in this situation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
