I know that in perfect competition, there are many firms and each firm produces a identical product. Also, firms are price takers, meaning they have to accept the market price. So, how does this affect the demand curve for an individual firm?\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. downward sloping and equal to the market demand curve.\n\nI think this might not be right because in perfect competition, the firm's demand curve should be horizontal, indicating perfect elasticity. The market demand curve, on the other hand, is downward sloping because as price decreases, quantity demanded increases for the entire market.\n\nB. perfectly elastic.\n\nThis sounds plausible. Since the firm is a price taker and can sell any quantity at the market price, the demand curve should be horizontal, which means perfectly elastic.\n\nC. perfectly inelastic.\n\nThis can't be right. Perfectly inelastic demand would mean that quantity demanded doesn't change regardless of price, which isn't the case for a competitive firm. In reality, if a firm in perfect competition tried to set a higher price, no one would buy from them because there are many other firms selling the same product at the market price.\n\nD. kinked at the going market price.\n\nI've heard about kinked demand curves in oligopoly, where slight changes in price can lead to different market reactions. But in perfect competition, with many firms and identical products, there shouldn't be any kinks in the demand curve. The demand should be perfectly elastic at the market price.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, the correct answer should be B. perfectly elastic.\n\nBut let me double-check. In perfect competition:\n\n1. There are many firms and many buyers.\n\n2. The product is homogeneous; all firms produce identical products.\n\n3. Firms can freely enter and exit the market.\n\n4. There is perfect information, so both buyers and sellers know the market price.\n\nGiven these characteristics, each firm faces a horizontal demand curve at the market price. This means that the firm can sell any quantity it wants at the market price, but if it tries to sell at a higher price, it won't sell anything because customers can buy from other firms at the lower market price.\n\nSo, the demand curve for an individual firm is indeed perfectly elastic.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the firm's demand curve is not downward sloping; it's horizontal.\n\nOption C is wrong because the demand is very responsive to price changes (elastic, not inelastic).\n\nOption D doesn't apply to perfect competition; kinked demand curves are more associated with oligopoly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. perfectly elastic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
