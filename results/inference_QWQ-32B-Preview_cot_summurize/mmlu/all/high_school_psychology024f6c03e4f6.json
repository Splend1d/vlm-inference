The researcher is asking participants if they typically eat breakfast, and I need to figure out what kind of variable that is. The options are categorical, continuous, dependent, or independent variable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nA categorical variable is one that belongs to a category or group. For example, hair color, gender, or types of food. It's not numerical; it's about qualities or characteristics.\n\nA continuous variable is something that can take on any value within a range. Like height, weight, or time. It's numerical and can be measured to any degree of precision.\n\nA dependent variable is the outcome that the researcher is interested in measuring. It depends on other variables in the study.\n\nAn independent variable is what the researcher manipulates or measures to see if it affects the dependent variable.\n\nIn this case, the researcher is asking whether participants typically eat breakfast. So, the answer would be either yes or no, right? That sounds like a categorical variable because it's dividing people into categories: those who eat breakfast and those who don't.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if it could be something else. Is there a way that eating breakfast could be measured on a continuous scale? Well, maybe if they asked how many minutes they spend eating breakfast or how much they eat, that would be continuous. But here, it's just whether they typically eat breakfast or not, which is a yes or no question.\n\nSo, it's probably a categorical variable.\n\nWait, but maybe it's a dependent or independent variable. To figure that out, I need to know more about the study. The question says it's \"at the outset of a study on eating habits,\" and the researcher is asking this question. So, perhaps eating breakfast is being measured to see its effect on something else, like overall health or weight, which would make it an independent variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the study is looking at what affects whether someone eats breakfast, making eating breakfast the dependent variable.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify what the study is investigating or what the researcher is trying to find out. It just says it's a study on eating habits, and the researcher is asking about breakfast consumption.\n\nGiven that, I think the most accurate answer is that whether a person eats breakfast is a categorical variable, because it's classifying participants into categories based on their breakfast eating habits.\n\nI don't think it's continuous because it's not a measured quantity that can take on any value.\n\nAnd without knowing the direction of the study, whether breakfast is the cause or the effect, I can't confidently say it's dependent or independent variable.\n\nSo, I'll go with categorical variable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
