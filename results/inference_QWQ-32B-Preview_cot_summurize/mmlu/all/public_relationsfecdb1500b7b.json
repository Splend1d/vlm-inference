Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Formal - Yeah, business writing is typically formal. It follows certain rules and standards to maintain professionalism. So, formal makes sense.\n\nB. Abstract - Hmm, abstract usually means theoretical or not concrete. In business writing, you generally want to be straightforward and practical. Abstract concepts might not be the focus unless it's in a specific context like theoretical research in business. But generally, business writing is more about concrete ideas and actions. So, abstract might not fit well.\n\nC. Personal - Business writing can sometimes include personal opinions, but mostly it's about presenting facts and data to support decisions. However, it's supposed to be professional, so personal feelings might not be appropriate. But still, sometimes personal experiences or perspectives are shared, especially in leadership communications. So, it's a bit tricky.\n\nD. Objective - Yes, business writing should be objective. It should present facts and data without bias to make informed decisions. So, objective is definitely a characteristic of business writing.\n\nComparing all these, abstract seems to be the least fitting descriptor for business writing. Business writing is more about being clear, direct, and practical rather than theoretical or abstract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
