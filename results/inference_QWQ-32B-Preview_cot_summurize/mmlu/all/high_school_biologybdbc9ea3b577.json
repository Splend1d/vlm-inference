                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about the resting membrane potential of a neuron, and it wants to know which factors it depends on. The options are:\n\nI. Active transport\n\nII. Selective permeability\n\nIII. Differential distribution of ions across the axonal membrane\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. III only\n\nB. I and II only\n\nC. II and III only\n\nD. I, II, and III\n\nOkay, so first, I need to recall what resting membrane potential is. It's the electrical potential difference across the cell membrane when the cell is at rest, not firing any signals. For neurons, it's typically around -70 millivolts.\n\nNow, let's think about each of these options.\n\nI. Active transport: This probably refers to the sodium-potassium pump, which is an active transport mechanism that moves sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell, against their concentration gradients. This pump is crucial for maintaining the ion concentration differences across the membrane.\n\nII. Selective permeability: This refers to the cell membrane's ability to allow certain ions to pass through while blocking others. In the resting state, the neuron's membrane is more permeable to potassium ions than to sodium ions.\n\nIII. Differential distribution of ions across the axonal membrane: This means that there are different concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. For example, there's a higher concentration of potassium ions inside the cell and a higher concentration of sodium ions outside.\n\nSo, how do these relate to the resting membrane potential?\n\nWell, the resting membrane potential is established by the distribution of ions across the membrane and the permeability of the membrane to those ions. The sodium-potassium pump helps maintain this distribution by pumping sodium out and potassium in.\n\nLet's consider option I: Active transport. As I mentioned, the sodium-potassium pump is an active transport process that maintains the ion gradients. Without this pump, the ion concentrations would equalize, and the membrane potential would disappear. So, active transport is definitely involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential.\n\nOption II: Selective permeability. The membrane's selective permeability to potassium allows potassium ions to flow out of the cell down their concentration gradient, which helps establish the negative internal charge. If the membrane wasn't selectively permeable, the ions would be free to move, and the potential wouldn't be maintained. So, selective permeability is also important.\n\nOption III: Differential distribution of ions. This is fundamental to the membrane potential. The Nernst equation tells us that the equilibrium potential for an ion depends on its concentration gradient across the membrane. So, the differential distribution of ions is crucial for the resting membrane potential.\n\nGiven that, it seems like all three factors are involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nActive transport (the sodium-potassium pump) maintains the ion gradients.\n\nSelective permeability allows certain ions to pass through, which affects the membrane potential.\n\nAnd the differential distribution of ions is directly related to the membrane potential via the Nernst equation and the Goldman equation, which takes into account the permeabilities of different ions.\n\nSo, all three seem to be essential.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. III only\n\nB. I and II only\n\nC. II and III only\n\nD. I, II, and III\n\nIt looks like D is the correct answer because all three factors are involved in maintaining the resting membrane potential.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's a dependency or something I'm missing.\n\nFor example, is differential distribution dependent on active transport? Yes, because the pump maintains the gradients.\n\nIs selective permeability independent? Yes, it's a property of the membrane itself.\n\nSo, even though active transport contributes to the differential distribution, both are necessary, along with selective permeability, to maintain the resting membrane potential.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
