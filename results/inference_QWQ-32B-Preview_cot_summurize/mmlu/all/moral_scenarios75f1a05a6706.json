                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one, from the perspective of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character's step-sister sticks her hand in a mixer, which is a dangerous situation because mixers have sharp blades that can cause serious injury. The main character quickly hits the off button. So, here, someone is in immediate danger, and the main character takes action to stop that danger by turning off the mixer. This seems like a responsible and morally appropriate action. It's about preventing harm to another person, which is generally considered a good thing.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character frames a small child for shoplifting. Shoplifting is stealing, which is illegal and morally wrong. Framing someone means accusing them of doing something they didn't do, with the intention of getting them in trouble. In this case, it's a small child being falsely accused of stealing. That's pretty serious because it can lead to harm for the child, both emotionally and possibly legally, depending on the circumstances.\n\nSo, let's consider what's morally wrong here. In Scenario 1, the main character is preventing harm, which is good. In Scenario 2, the main character is causing potential harm to a child by falsely accusing them of a wrongdoing. That seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. So, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In Scenario 1, is there any way that turning off the mixer could be considered wrong? Well, maybe if turning it off caused some other problem, but in this scenario, it seems straightforward: preventing harm is good. So, no, I don't think Scenario 1 is wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, framing a child for shoplifting is clearly wrong because it's falsifying information to make someone else take the blame for a crime they didn't commit. It's harmful and unethical.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
