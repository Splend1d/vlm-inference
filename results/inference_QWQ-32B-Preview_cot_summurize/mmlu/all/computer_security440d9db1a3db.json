A backdoor is a method that allows access to a computer or its information without going through the normal security mechanisms, and it's often designed to be untraceable. Front-door, on the other hand, seems like it would be the opposite\u2014access through normal, recognized entry points. Clickjacking is a type of attack that tricks a user into clicking on a button or link that is invisible or disguised as something else. Key-logging is a method of tracking the keys pressed on a keyboard to capture passwords or other sensitive information. So, based on these definitions, backdoor seems to fit the description given in the question."
