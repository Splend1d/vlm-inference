Outer core.\n\nTo elaborate, the Earth's outer core is a liquid layer composed mostly of iron and nickel, and it's in constant motion due to convection currents. This movement of conductive materials in the presence of heat and rotation generates electric currents, which in turn produce the magnetic field. This process is known as the dynamo effect.\n\nThe crust is the outermost solid shell of the Earth, where we live, and it's too thin and not conductive enough to generate a significant magnetic field. The mantle is the thick layer between the crust and the core, and while it's involved in processes like plate tectonics, it's not the source of the geomagnetic field. The inner core is solid and is surrounded by the liquid outer core, but it's the motion in the outer core that generates the magnetic field, not the inner core itself.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Outer core."
