                    "text": "So I need to find the prime factorization of 77 and use exponents where possible. Let's see, prime factorization means breaking down a number into its smallest prime number factors. So, I need to find which prime numbers multiply together to give me 77.\n\nFirst, I'll check if 77 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. But 77 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2. Next, I'll try 3. To check if 77 is divisible by 3, I can add the digits of 77: 7 + 7 = 14, and 14 is not divisible by 3, so 77 isn't either.\n\nNow, I'll try dividing by 5. But 77 doesn't end with a 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5. Next is 7. Let's see, 7 times something should give me 77. 7 times 11 is 77. Okay, so 7 and 11 are both prime numbers, and their product is 77.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 77 is 7 times 11. Now, looking at the options:\n\nA. 7 \u2022 11^2 \u2022 13\n\nB. 7^2 \u2022 11\n\nC. 7 \u2022 11 \u2022 13\n\nD. 7 \u2022 11\n\nIt seems like option D matches what I have: 7 \u2022 11.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any exponent I can use here? Well, both 7 and 11 are raised to the power of 1, but since exponents of 1 are usually not written, it's okay to leave it as 7 \u2022 11.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that 11 is indeed a prime number. Yes, 11 is a prime number because its only factors are 1 and itself.\n\nSimilarly, 7 is also a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 77 is indeed 7 \u2022 11.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A: 7 \u2022 11^2 \u2022 13. That would be 7 times 121 (which is 11 squared) times 13. That would be a much larger number, definitely not 77.\n\nOption B: 7^2 \u2022 11. That's 49 times 11, which is 539, not 77.\n\nOption C: 7 \u2022 11 \u2022 13. That's 7 times 11 times 13, which is 1001, way bigger than 77.\n\nSo, clearly, option D is the correct one.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
