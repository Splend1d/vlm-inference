The matrices are N1 with dimensions w rows and x columns, N2 with x rows and y columns, and N3 with y rows and z columns.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how matrix multiplication works in terms of time complexity. I know that multiplying two matrices, say M1 with p rows and q columns by M2 with q rows and r columns, takes time proportional to p * q * r. The result will be a matrix with p rows and r columns.\n\nSo, for the expression (N1N2)N3:\n\n1. First, compute N1N2:\n\n- N1 is w x x\n\n- N2 is x x y\n\n- Time: w * x * y\n\n- Result: a matrix with w rows and y columns\n\n2. Then, multiply that result by N3:\n\n- Result from step 1 is w x y\n\n- N3 is y x z\n\n- Time: w * y * z\n\n- Final result: a matrix with w rows and z columns\n\nTotal time for (N1N2)N3 is w * x * y + w * y * z\n\nSimilarly, for N1(N2N3):\n\n1. First, compute N2N3:\n\n- N2 is x x y\n\n- N3 is y x z\n\n- Time: x * y * z\n\n- Result: a matrix with x rows and z columns\n\n2. Then, multiply N1 by that result:\n\n- N1 is w x x\n\n- Result from step 1 is x x z\n\n- Time: w * x * z\n\n- Final result: a matrix with w rows and z columns\n\nTotal time for N1(N2N3) is x * y * z + w * x * z\n\nNow, I need to find under what condition the first approach takes less time than the second approach, meaning:\n\nw * x * y + w * y * z < x * y * z + w * x * z\n\nI need to solve this inequality to find the condition.\n\nLet me see if I can simplify this inequality.\n\nw * x * y + w * y * z < x * y * z + w * x * z\n\nMaybe I can factor out some terms.\n\nLet's see, both terms on the left have w * y, and both terms on the right have x * z.\n\nWait, perhaps I can rearrange the terms:\n\nw * x * y - w * x * z < x * y * z - w * y * z\n\nWait, that doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, factor w * y from the left:\n\nw * y * (x + z) < x * z * (y + w)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nLet me try to group terms differently.\n\nw * x * y + w * y * z - x * y * z - w * x * z < 0\n\nFactor where possible.\n\nMaybe factor y from the first and third terms:\n\ny * (w * x + w * z - x * z) - w * x * z < 0\n\nHmm, still complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of dividing both sides by common terms to simplify.\n\nAssuming all dimensions are positive, I can divide both sides by w * x * y * z to make the inequality in terms of ratios.\n\nSo, divide both sides by w * x * y * z:\n\n(w * x * y + w * y * z) / (w * x * y * z) < (x * y * z + w * x * z) / (w * x * y * z)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nLeft side:\n\nw * x * y / (w * x * y * z) = 1/z\n\nw * y * z / (w * x * y * z) = 1/x\n\nSo, 1/z + 1/x < ...?\n\nRight side:\n\nx * y * z / (w * x * y * z) = 1/w\n\nw * x * z / (w * x * y * z) = 1/y\n\nSo, the inequality becomes:\n\n1/z + 1/x < 1/w + 1/y\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option B is 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y, which is the same as what I have but with the terms in a different order. Since addition is commutative, it's the same.\n\nBut wait, in my derivation, I have 1/z + 1/x < 1/w + 1/y, which is equivalent to 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y.\n\nSo, according to this, the condition is 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y.\n\nBut let's double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from:\n\nw * x * y + w * y * z < x * y * z + w * x * z\n\nDivide both sides by w * x * y * z:\n\n(w * x * y)/(w * x * y * z) + (w * y * z)/(w * x * y * z) < (x * y * z)/(w * x * y * z) + (w * x * z)/(w * x * y * z)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n1/z + 1/x < 1/w + 1/y\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the condition is 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. There is no such condition; i.e., they will always take the same time.\n\nB. 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y\n\nC. x > y\n\nD. 1/w + 1/x < 1/y + 1/z\n\nSo, option B matches the condition I derived.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any special cases or if this makes sense intuitively.\n\nSuppose w, x, y, z are all equal to 1. Then, 1/1 + 1/1 = 2, and 1/1 + 1/1 = 2, so 2 < 2 is false, meaning the inequality doesn't hold, and indeed, both ways of computing the matrix product would take the same time, which aligns with option A.\n\nBut option B says 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y, which in this case is not true, so it's consistent.\n\nAnother example: let w=1, x=2, y=3, z=4.\n\nThen, 1/2 + 1/4 = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75\n\n1/1 + 1/3 \u2248 1 + 0.333 = 1.333\n\n0.75 < 1.333, so according to option B, computing (N1N2)N3 is faster.\n\nLet's compute the actual times:\n\n(N1N2)N3:\n\nFirst, N1N2: 1*2*3 = 6\n\nThen, result times N3: 1*3*4 = 12\n\nTotal: 6 + 12 = 18\n\nN1(N2N3):\n\nFirst, N2N3: 2*3*4 = 24\n\nThen, N1 times result: 1*2*4 = 8\n\nTotal: 24 + 8 = 32\n\nIndeed, 18 < 32, so (N1N2)N3 is faster, which matches the condition.\n\nAnother test: w=2, x=1, y=1, z=1.\n\n1/1 + 1/1 = 2\n\n1/2 + 1/1 = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5\n\n2 < 1.5 is false, so (N1N2)N3 is not faster.\n\nCompute actual times:\n\n(N1N2)N3:\n\nN1N2: 2*1*1 = 2\n\nResult times N3: 2*1*1 = 2\n\nTotal: 4\n\nN1(N2N3):\n\nN2N3: 1*1*1 = 1\n\nN1 times result: 2*1*1 = 2\n\nTotal: 3\n\nHere, 4 > 3, so N1(N2N3) is faster, which aligns with the condition not being satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the condition is indeed 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
