The firm will engage in non-price competition.\n\nB. The firm will realize economic profits.\n\nC. The firm will incur economic losses.\n\nD. The firm will realize zero economic profits.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what perfect competition is. Perfect competition is a market structure where there are many small firms, all producing identical products, and there's perfect information, meaning that both buyers and sellers know everything about the market, including prices and product quality.\n\nIn such a market, individual firms are price takers. That means they have to accept the market price for their product; they can\u2019t set their own prices above the market level because customers will just buy from someone else who\u2019s selling at the market price.\n\nNow, let's think about the long run. In the long run, firms can enter or exit the market freely. So, if there are economic profits being made in the industry, new firms will be attracted to enter the market, increasing supply and driving down prices. Conversely, if there are economic losses, some firms will exit the market, reducing supply and driving up prices.\n\nGiven that, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The firm will engage in non-price competition.\n\nIn perfect competition, all firms produce identical products, so there's no room for non-price competition, like differentiating your product through marketing or quality. Since the products are homogeneous, firms can't compete on anything other than price. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nB. The firm will realize economic profits.\n\nIn the long run, if firms are making economic profits, new firms will enter the market, increasing supply, which drives down the market price. This process continues until economic profits are driven to zero. So, in the long run, firms in perfect competition shouldn't be making economic profits.\n\nC. The firm will incur economic losses.\n\nSimilar to option B, but in reverse. If firms are incurring losses, some will exit the market, reducing supply and driving up prices. This continues until losses are eliminated. So, in the long run, firms shouldn't be incurring economic losses.\n\nD. The firm will realize zero economic profits.\n\nThis seems consistent with what I just explained. In the long run, the entry and exit of firms should drive economic profits to zero. Firms are only earning enough to cover their opportunity costs, which is the definition of zero economic profit.\n\nLet me double-check. In perfect competition, in the long run, the market price settles at the minimum point of the firm's average total cost curve. At this point, the firm is producing at its most efficient scale, and economic profit is zero.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. The firm will realize zero economic profits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
