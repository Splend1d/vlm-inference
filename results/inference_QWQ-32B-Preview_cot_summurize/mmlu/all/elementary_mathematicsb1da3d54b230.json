                    "text": "So I have this problem here: a store has 8 fish tanks, and each tank has 40 liters of water. I need to find out the total number of liters of water in all of the fish tanks. The options are A. 5, B. 48, C. 280, and D. 320.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems straightforward\u2014there are 8 fish tanks, each with 40 liters of water, and I need to find the total amount of water in all of them combined.\n\nSo, to find the total, I should probably multiply the number of tanks by the amount of water in each tank. That makes sense because if each tank has 40 liters, then 8 tanks would have 8 times 40 liters.\n\nLet me write that down: total water = number of tanks \u00d7 water per tank.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: total water = 8 \u00d7 40.\n\nNow, 8 times 40. I know that 8 times 4 is 32, so 8 times 40 should be 320.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I can think of it differently. If I have 8 tanks, and each has 40 liters, I could add 40 eight times: 40 + 40 + 40 + 40 + 40 + 40 + 40 + 40.\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n40 + 40 = 80,\n\n80 + 40 = 120,\n\n120 + 40 = 160,\n\n160 + 40 = 200,\n\n200 + 40 = 240,\n\n240 + 40 = 280,\n\n280 + 40 = 320.\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier: 320 liters.\n\nAlternatively, I could break down the multiplication: 8 \u00d7 40.\n\nI know that 8 \u00d7 4 = 32, and since 40 is 10 times 4, I can multiply 32 by 10, which gives me 320.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the place value: 40 is 4 tens, so 8 times 4 tens is 32 tens, which is 320.\n\nSo, all these methods point to 320 liters as the total amount of water in all the fish tanks.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 5 - that's way too small.\n\nB. 48 - that's less than 40, which doesn't make sense because even one tank has 40 liters, so eight should have more.\n\nC. 280 - that's what I had during my addition, but it's not the final total.\n\nD. 320 - that matches my calculation.\n\nWait a minute, in my addition, I had:\n\n40 + 40 = 80,\n\n80 + 40 = 120,\n\n120 + 40 = 160,\n\n160 + 40 = 200,\n\n200 + 40 = 240,\n\n240 + 40 = 280,\n\n280 + 40 = 320.\n\nSo, it seems like 280 is an intermediate step, not the final total. The final total is 320 liters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 320.\n\nBut let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I can use a different approach.\n\nSuppose I consider that each tank has 40 liters, and there are 8 tanks. So, total water is 8 \u00d7 40.\n\nI can also think of it as 40 \u00d7 8, which is the same thing.\n\n40 \u00d7 8:\n\n40 \u00d7 8 = (4 \u00d7 10) \u00d7 8 = 4 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10 = 32 \u00d7 10 = 320.\n\nAgain, 320 liters.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that 10 tanks would have 400 liters (since 10 \u00d7 40 = 400), then 8 tanks would have 8/10 of that.\n\nWait, but that might be more complicated than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about dividing the problem into smaller parts.\n\nFor example, 8 tanks can be thought of as 5 tanks plus 3 tanks.\n\n5 tanks: 5 \u00d7 40 = 200 liters.\n\n3 tanks: 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 liters.\n\nTotal: 200 + 120 = 320 liters.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the fact that 4 tanks would be 160 liters (since 4 \u00d7 40 = 160), so 8 tanks would be twice that, which is 320 liters.\n\nEverything I try leads me back to 320 liters.\n\nNow, looking at the options again, C is 280, which is what I had before reaching 320 in my addition. It seems like maybe someone added up seven tanks instead of eight.\n\nLet me check that:\n\n7 tanks: 7 \u00d7 40 = 280 liters.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Maybe that's where option C comes from.\n\nBut the problem says eight tanks, so it should be 8 \u00d7 40 = 320 liters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 320.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, so I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
