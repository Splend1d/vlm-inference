                    "text": "Let's see which component in saliva has antibacterial properties. I know that saliva contains various substances like enzymes, electrolytes, and mucus, but I need to figure out which one specifically has antibacterial action.\n\nOption A is lysozyme. I recall that lysozyme is an enzyme that can break down bacterial cell walls. It's found in various secretions like tears, saliva, and mucus, and it plays a role in protecting against bacterial infections. So, lysozyme seems like a strong candidate for having antibacterial action.\n\nOption B is amylase. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into simpler sugars. While it's an important component of saliva for beginning the digestion process, I don't think it has antibacterial properties. Its main function is related to digestion, not immunity.\n\nOption C is sodium chloride, which is table salt. Saliva does contain electrolytes like sodium and chloride, but I don't think sodium chloride itself has significant antibacterial action in saliva. Maybe it helps maintain the osmotic balance, but I don't recall it being prominent for its antibacterial properties.\n\nOption D is mucus. Mucus in saliva helps lubricate the mouth and protects the oral mucosa. While mucus can trap particles and has some protective functions, I don't think it's primarily antibacterial.\n\nComparing all these options, lysozyme stands out as the component with antibacterial action. It makes sense because one of the functions of saliva is to provide some protection against oral infections, and lysozyme would be the substance responsible for that.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Lysozyme.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
