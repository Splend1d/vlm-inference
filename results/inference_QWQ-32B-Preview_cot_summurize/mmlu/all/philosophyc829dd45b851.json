                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Hume's view on justice. The options are:\n\nA. has no value.\n\nB. has value in part because it is useful to society.\n\nC. has value solely because it is useful to society.\n\nD. has value solely because it is useful to the agent.\n\nI remember that Hume was an empiricist and he had some thoughts on morality and justice, but I need to recall his specific\u89c2\u70b9.\n\nFirst, I know that Hume distinguishes between natural virtues and artificial virtues. Natural virtues are things like benevolence and friendship, which he sees as arising naturally from our feelings and affections. Artificial virtues, on the other hand, are those that are created by human convention and are necessary for social living, like justice.\n\nSo, justice falls under the category of artificial virtues for Hume. He argues that justice is a convention based on human utility. In other words, justice is a system that we've created because it's beneficial for society as a whole.\n\nHume explains that in a state of nature, before the establishment of society, individuals would act purely out of self-interest. But as society developed and resources became scarce, it became necessary to establish rules to govern the possession and exchange of property. That's where justice comes in\u2014it's a set of rules designed to manage these social interactions efficiently.\n\nNow, regarding the value of justice, Hume seems to suggest that it has value because it's useful to society. But is it solely because it's useful to society, or does it have other values as well?\n\nLet me look back at what Hume actually says. In his Treatise of Human Nature, Hume argues that justice is a artificial virtue that arises out of considerations of utility. He believes that justice is not naturally appealing to us; rather, it's a construct that we've developed to maximize social welfare.\n\nHume writes that \"justice is a fictitious virtue, not present in human nature, but imposed by human convention for the benefit of society.\" So, it seems that he sees justice primarily as a tool for societal benefit.\n\nBut does he think that justice has no other value beyond its utility to society? Or does he acknowledge that it might have some intrinsic value as well?\n\nLooking deeper, Hume does seem to suggest that the value of justice is entirely derived from its utility to society. He doesn't appear to assign any intrinsic value to justice independent of its social benefits.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the closest: \"has value solely because it is useful to society.\"\n\nWait, but option B says \"has value in part because it is useful to society.\" That suggests that there might be other reasons why justice has value, besides its utility to society.\n\nGiven Hume's stance, it seems that he would argue that justice's value is solely based on its utility to society, without any additional intrinsic value.\n\nTherefore, option C seems more accurate.\n\nHowever, let's consider option D: \"has value solely because it is useful to the agent.\" This suggests that justice is valuable only because it benefits the individual practicing it. But Hume's view is more focused on the broader social utility, not just individual benefit.\n\nSo, option D doesn't seem to align with Hume's perspective.\n\nOption A, \"has no value,\" is clearly contrary to Hume's view, since he does see justice as a valuable convention that benefits society.\n\nTherefore, between options B and C, I need to decide whether Hume thinks justice has value solely because of its utility to society, or if there are other factors as well.\n\nUpon reflection, Hume's position is that justice is a artificial virtue created for the sake of societal utility. He doesn't seem to leave room for any other sources of value for justice.\n\nIn that case, option C is the best answer: \"has value solely because it is useful to society.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if Hume might see some value in justice beyond its utility to society.\n\nFor example, perhaps he might think that justice is also valuable because it aligns with certain moral sentiments or principles.\n\nHowever, from what I recall, Hume is careful to distinguish between natural virtues, which are based on moral sentiments like benevolence and sympathy, and artificial virtues like justice, which are based on utility and convention.\n\nSo, for justice, its value seems to stem exclusively from its utility to society.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is C: \"has value solely because it is useful to society.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
