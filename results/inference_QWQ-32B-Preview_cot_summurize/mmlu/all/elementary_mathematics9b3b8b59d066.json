His employer gives him a raise, and after the raise, his weekly gross pay is $307.80. We need to find out how much his weekly gross pay increased.\n\nFirst, I need to find out what Peter's weekly gross pay was before the raise. Since he works 38 hours per week and earns $7.25 per hour, I can calculate his original gross pay by multiplying his hours worked by his hourly wage.\n\nSo, original gross pay = hours worked \u00d7 hourly wage\n= 38 hours \u00d7 $7.25/hour\n\nLet me do that multiplication.\n\n38 \u00d7 7.25\n\nWell, 38 \u00d7 7 = 266\n\n38 \u00d7 0.25 = 9.5\n\nSo, 266 + 9.5 = 275.5\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that multiplication.\n\nActually, 38 \u00d7 7 = 266\n\n38 \u00d7 0.25 = 9.5\n\nYes, 266 + 9.5 = 275.5\n\nSo, his original gross pay is $275.50 per week.\n\nNow, after the raise, his gross pay is $307.80 per week.\n\nTo find the increase in his weekly gross pay, I need to subtract his original gross pay from his new gross pay.\n\nIncrease = new gross pay - original gross pay\n= $307.80 - $275.50\n\nLet's do that subtraction.\n\n307.80\n-275.50\n________\n32.30\n\nSo, the increase is $32.30.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $32.30\nB. $34.70\nC. $42.46\nD. $275.50\n\nIt looks like option A is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nOriginal gross pay: 38 hours \u00d7 $7.25/hour\n\nLet me verify 38 \u00d7 7.25.\n\n38 \u00d7 7 = 266\n\n38 \u00d7 0.25 = 9.5\n\n266 + 9.5 = 275.5\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNew gross pay is $307.80.\n\nSubtracting: 307.80 - 275.50 = 32.30\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of percentage increase or something, but the problem is straightforward: it's just asking for the difference between the new and the original gross pay.\n\nSo, the increase is $32.30, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
