The options are 16, 18, 24, or 32 hours.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how many pages Jerry reads per hour. If he read 200 pages in 10 hours, then his reading rate is 200 pages divided by 10 hours, which is 20 pages per hour.\n\nNow, if he reads at 20 pages per hour, how many hours will it take him to read 320 pages? I can find this by dividing the total number of pages by his reading rate. So, 320 pages divided by 20 pages per hour should give me the time required.\n\nLet me do the math: 320 divided by 20 is 16. So, it should take him 16 hours to read a 320-page book.\n\nLooking back at the options, 16 hours is option A. But I should double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to set up a proportion. If 200 pages take 10 hours, then 320 pages will take x hours. So, 200/10 = 320/x.\n\nCross-multiplying, 200x = 3200, so x = 3200 / 200, which is again 16 hours.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer, so I'm pretty confident that 16 hours is correct.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the reading time, like maybe he reads faster as he gets more into the book, or maybe he gets tired after a certain number of hours. But the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume his reading rate is constant.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, let's check if 16 hours makes sense. If he reads 20 pages per hour, in 16 hours he would read 20 * 16 = 320 pages, which matches the book's length. So, it checks out.\n\nI think A. 16 hours is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
