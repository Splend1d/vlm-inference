When a spouse passes away, the surviving partner often experiences a significant amount of stress and may lose important social support, which can negatively impact their health and well-being. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as \"widowhood effect\" or \"broken heart syndrome.\" It's essential for the surviving spouse to seek support from friends, family, or professionals during this time to help cope with their grief and adjust to their new circumstances."
