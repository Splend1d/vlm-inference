                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these statements is true regarding M1 and M2. I remember that M1 and M2 are measures of the money supply, but I need to recall the specifics.\n\nFirst, M1 is a narrower measure of the money supply, and it includes highly liquid assets that can be easily converted to cash. This typically includes physical currency, demand deposits, and other liquid assets like traveler's checks.\n\nM2, on the other hand, is a broader measure that includes M1 plus less liquid assets. This includes savings deposits, money market securities, and other time deposits.\n\nOption A says: \"Some of the things included in M2 are not as liquid as the things in M1.\" That makes sense because M2 includes items like savings deposits and money market funds, which are not as liquid as the components of M1. So, A seems plausible.\n\nOption B says: \"M2 is smaller than M1.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Since M2 includes M1 plus additional components, M2 should be larger than M1. So, B seems false.\n\nOption C says: \"M1 is backed by gold and M2 is backed by silver.\" I don't think that's accurate. In the modern monetary system, money is not backed by gold or silver; it's fiat money. So, C seems false.\n\nOption D says: \"The biggest component of M1 is currency.\" Let's think about that. M1 includes physical currency, demand deposits, and other liquid assets. Typically, demand deposits might be larger than physical currency in circulation, so I'm not sure if currency is the biggest component.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up the exact components of M1 and M2 to be sure.\n\nOkay, according to the Federal Reserve, M1 consists of:\n\n- Currency in circulation\n\n- Demand deposits\n\n- Other checkable deposits\n\n- Traveler's checks\n\nAnd M2 consists of M1 plus:\n\n- Savings deposits\n\n- Small-time deposits\n\n- Retail money market funds\n\n- Other deposits\n\nSo, M2 includes M1 plus some less liquid assets.\n\nLooking back at option A: \"Some of the things included in M2 are not as liquid as the things in M1.\" That seems correct because savings deposits and time deposits are less liquid than demand deposits and physical currency.\n\nOption B: \"M2 is smaller than M1.\" No, since M2 includes M1 plus other components, M2 should be larger than M1.\n\nOption C: \"M1 is backed by gold and M2 is backed by silver.\" That's not accurate in the current monetary system, which is fiat.\n\nOption D: \"The biggest component of M1 is currency.\" Let's see, in M1, demand deposits are usually a larger portion than physical currency. For example, in the US, demand deposits are a bigger component than currency in circulation. So, D seems false.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is A: Some of the things included in M2 are not as liquid as the things in M1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
