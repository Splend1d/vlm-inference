                    "text": "I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the court is likely to grant the hospital's motion for sanctions against the nurse's attorney. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the nurse was fired and believes it's because of his age, so he wants to sue the hospital for age discrimination. His attorney files a complaint in federal court based on that. But then it turns out that the hospital hired a 52-year-old man as his replacement, which seems to contradict the age discrimination claim. So, the hospital files a motion for sanctions against the nurse's attorney.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the court is likely to grant this motion. There are four options:\n\nA. No, because sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party.\n\nB. No, because the hospital failed to give the attorney the chance to withdraw the complaint before filing the motion.\n\nC. Yes, because the nurse's attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry.\n\nD. Yes, because the nurse's complaint contained legal contentions that were not warranted by existing law based on the facts in this case.\n\nLet's look at each option.\n\nOption A says sanctions are not proper against the attorney of a represented party. Hmm, I'm not sure what this means exactly. Does it mean that you can't sanction an attorney who is representing a client? That doesn't sound right. Attorneys can be sanctioned for improper conduct, even if they are representing a client. So, I think this option might be incorrect.\n\nOption B says the hospital should have given the attorney a chance to withdraw the complaint before filing the motion. That seems like maybe there's something to this. Maybe there's a rule that requires the hospital to notify the attorney and give them an opportunity to correct the mistake before seeking sanctions. I'll have to think about that.\n\nOption C says yes, the court is likely to grant the motion because the attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry. This sounds plausible. Before filing a complaint, attorneys are expected to investigate the facts and ensure that there is a reasonable basis for the claims being made. If the attorney didn't do that and the claim turns out to be baseless, then maybe sanctions are appropriate.\n\nOption D says yes, because the complaint contained legal contentions not warranted by existing law based on the facts. This is similar to option C but focuses more on the legal basis rather than the factual inquiry. Maybe both are relevant here.\n\nLet me consider the facts again. The nurse was fired and believes it's because of his age. He wants to sue for age discrimination. His attorney files the complaint, but then it's revealed that the hospital hired a 52-year-old as his replacement. Now, I'm not entirely sure how that fact affects the age discrimination claim. Does hiring an older person as a replacement necessarily mean that the termination wasn't due to age discrimination?\n\nI think not necessarily. Age discrimination can still occur even if the replacement is also older. The employer might still have discriminated based on age, perhaps preferring even older employees over the specific individual who was fired. So, maybe the fact that a 52-year-old was hired as a replacement doesn't completely negate the possibility of age discrimination.\n\nHowever, it might weaken the claim or make it less plausible. So, if the attorney knew about this fact before filing the complaint, and still proceeded with the age discrimination claim, that might indicate a lack of reasonable inquiry or a basis for sanctions.\n\nBut, perhaps the attorney didn't know about the replacement's age at the time of filing. If that's the case, then maybe sanctions wouldn't be appropriate because the attorney couldn't be expected to know something that wasn't yet known.\n\nWait, but the question says \"as it turned out,\" which suggests that the attorney might not have known about the replacement's age before filing the complaint.\n\nBut, in any case, the hospital is now seeking sanctions based on this fact.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C mentions failing to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry. So, if the attorney didn't investigate sufficiently before filing the complaint, and it turns out that the claim isn't supported by the facts, then maybe sanctions are appropriate.\n\nOption D talks about legal contentions not being warranted by existing law based on the facts. This might be a bit different. It seems more about whether the legal claims are supported by law, rather than the factual basis.\n\nIn this case, it's more about the factual basis for the age discrimination claim. So, option C might be a better fit.\n\nBut, I should also consider whether the hospital needed to give the attorney a chance to withdraw the complaint before filing the motion for sanctions. Option B suggests that without such notice, the motion shouldn't be granted.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, there is a requirement to provide notice and an opportunity to withdraw before seeking sanctions. This is to encourage the voluntary dismissal of unwarranted claims without the need for sanctions.\n\nIf that's the case here, then maybe the court won't grant the motion because the hospital didn't give the attorney a chance to withdraw the complaint first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe such notice isn't required, and the hospital can directly file the motion for sanctions.\n\nI'm a bit unsure about the procedural requirements here.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the key is whether the attorney conducted a reasonable pre-filing inquiry. If the attorney didn't do proper due diligence before filing the complaint, then sanctions could be appropriate.\n\nBut, if the attorney did conduct a reasonable inquiry and still had a basis to believe that there was an age discrimination case, even considering the replacement's age, then maybe sanctions aren't warranted.\n\nGiven that, option C seems like a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\nOption D, about legal contentions not being warranted by existing law, might not fit as well because the issue seems to be more about the factual basis for the claim rather than a misunderstanding of the law.\n\nSo, between options B and C, I need to decide.\n\nOption B says that the hospital should have given the attorney a chance to withdraw the complaint before filing the motion. If this is a procedural requirement, then maybe the court won't grant the motion without such notice.\n\nOn the other hand, if procedural rules don't require such notice, then the court could grant the motion.\n\nI think that in some rules, like Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, there is a safe harbor provision that gives the attorney an opportunity to withdraw the offending pleading before sanctions are imposed.\n\nIf that's applicable here, then maybe option B is correct.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of Rule 11 or similar rules in this context.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is C, that the nurse's attorney failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry.\n\nThis seems directly related to the situation: if the attorney didn't adequately investigate the facts before filing the complaint, and it turns out that the claim isn't supported by those facts, then sanctions could be appropriate.\n\nTherefore, I think the court is likely to grant the hospital's motion for sanctions, and the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
