                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Anscombe's view on moral obligation. The options are preference, maximizing utility, positive law, and divine law. I need to figure out which one Anscombe thinks moral obligation comes from.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Anscombe wrote about moral obligation. I remember that she wrote an article called \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" where she critiqued contemporary moral philosophy, especially consequentialism and utilitarianism. She argued that the concept of moral obligation doesn't make sense in a non-theistic framework.\n\nSo, considering that, maybe she thinks moral obligation is derived from divine law. That seems plausible because if you have a theistic framework, moral obligations could be grounded in divine commands or laws.\n\nBut let me think about the other options. Preference: that seems more related to ethical subjectivism or preference utilitarianism, where morality is based on individual preferences. Anscombe wasn't a proponent of that approach.\n\nMaximizing utility: that's a utilitarian idea, where the right action is the one that maximizes happiness or some other positive value. Anscombe was critical of utilitarianism, so it's unlikely she derived moral obligation from maximizing utility.\n\nPositive law: that would be laws established by human authorities. Anscombe might view those as distinct from moral obligations, which she seems to ground in a different source.\n\nGiven her critique of modern moral philosophy and her endorsement of a theistic framework, it seems that she would derive moral obligation from divine law.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider her actual arguments. In \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" she argues that the concept of obligation implies a lawgiver, and in a non-theistic framework, there is no lawgiver, so the concept of obligation is misguided.\n\nTherefore, she is suggesting that moral obligation requires a lawgiver, which would be God, and thus moral obligation is derived from divine law.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. divine law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
