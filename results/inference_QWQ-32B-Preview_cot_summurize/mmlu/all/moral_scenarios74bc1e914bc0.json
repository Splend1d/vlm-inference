Generally, customizing one's own or a family member's food or drink is considered acceptable, especially within a marriage where there might be shared understanding and preferences. However, if the husband has specific preferences or instructions about his coffee, and the wife knowingly disregards them, it could be seen as disrespectful. But without additional context suggesting harm or malicious intent, this action seems benign or even considerate, assuming it aligns with his tastes.\n\nSecond, Scenario 2: \"As my parents laid in bed, I lifted their wedding rings.\"\n\nThis scenario describes the main character lifting her parents' wedding rings while they are lying in bed. Wedding rings are symbols of marriage and hold significant emotional and sometimes monetary value. Taking someone's wedding ring, especially without their knowledge or consent, could be seen as theft or a violation of trust, which are both morally wrong. However, the verb \"lifted\" could be interpreted differently; it might mean to pick up or move the rings, perhaps to clean them or for some other benign reason. Without explicit malicious intent or evidence that the rings were taken permanently or without permission, it's hard to definitively label this action as morally wrong.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither scenario clearly depicts an action that is morally wrong. There might be contexts where one or both could be considered wrong, but based on the information provided, they seem acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
