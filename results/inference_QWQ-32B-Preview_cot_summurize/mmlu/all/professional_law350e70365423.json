                    "text": "So here's this scenario involving an investor and a developer who own adjoining lots in the city center. Each had an office building, but the developer decided to tear down her building and put up a taller one. She got all the necessary approvals and followed all the safety regulations. But during excavation, cracks started appearing in the investor's building. The developer says it's because of the weight of the investor's building and that if the land was in its natural state, there wouldn't be any subsidence. The investor's building got damaged badly, costing $750,000 to fix. Now, the question is about the investor's action to recover damages from the developer. Which option is the best comment regarding this situation?\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The developer is liable because she removed necessary support for the investor's lot.\" Hmm, that sounds familiar. In property law, there's something about lateral support, right? I think owners have a right to the natural support from their neighbor's land. So if the developer's excavation compromises that support, maybe she is liable. But I need to think carefully.\n\nOption B says: \"The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\" This seems to suggest that just removing support isn't enough to hold the developer responsible; there has to be proof of negligence. That might mean the developer had to act carelessly or without regard to the investor's property.\n\nOption C states: \"Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support.\" Wait, is that true? I thought the right to lateral support exists even if the land is improved, but maybe there's a exception or something.\n\nOption D says: \"The developer's only obligation was to satisfy all local, state, and federal safety regulations.\" So, if she followed all the regulations, is that the end of the story? Does that mean she can't be held liable for any damages as long as she complied with regulations?\n\nLet me try to recall what I know about lateral support and excavation cases.\n\nIn general, property owners have a right to the natural support from their neighbor's land. This means that if a neighbor excavates their land and causes the adjacent land to sink or shift, causing damage to the neighbor's building, the excavating party may be liable for the damage.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions and qualifications to this rule. For example, in urban areas where buildings are expected to be constructed and excavations are common, the rules might be different.\n\nI think in some jurisdictions, the right to lateral support is qualified by the reasonable use of the land. So, if the developer is using her land in a reasonable manner, even if it causes some subsidence, she might not be liable.\n\nAlso, if the investor's building is particularly heavy or sensitive, does that affect the developer's liability? The developer claims that the subsidence would only occur because of the weight of the investor's building.\n\nI need to think about the legal principles here.\n\nFirst, the right to lateral support is a well-recognized principle in property law. It means that a landowner is entitled to have their land supported by the land of their neighbor in its natural state.\n\nHowever, this right is not absolute. In urban areas, there's an implied grant of permission to excavate, provided that reasonable care is taken.\n\nSo, perhaps the developer is allowed to excavate as long as she does it in a manner that doesn't unreasonably harm her neighbor's property.\n\nGiven that the developer followed all safety regulations, does that shield her from liability?\n\nWell, compliance with regulations is certainly a factor, but it doesn't necessarily mean she's not liable. Regulations set a minimum standard, but liability can still arise if her actions cause harm, even if she followed the rules.\n\nMaybe the concept of negligence comes into play here. If the developer excavated in a way that a reasonable person would not, considering the proximity to the investor's building, then she could be negligent.\n\nBut the developer claims that the shoring met all safety regulations and was placed correctly. So, it seems like she took proper precautions.\n\nWait, but the investor's building still got damaged. So, even with all the regulations followed, damage occurred.\n\nDoes that mean the developer is still liable? Or is the investor out of luck?\n\nI think option B is appealing because it suggests that the developer isn't automatically liable just for removing support, but liability could be found if negligence is proved.\n\nGiven that the developer followed all regulations and industry standards, it might be hard for the investor to prove negligence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the right to lateral support is absolute, and the developer is strictly liable for any damage caused by removing support, regardless of compliance with regulations.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that.\n\nBut in urban areas, I feel like there must be some accommodation for development and construction, which might limit the strict application of the lateral support rule.\n\nOption C says that once land is improved with a building, the owner can't invoke the right to lateral support. I don't think that's correct. In fact, the right to lateral support is often invoked to protect existing improvements.\n\nOption D says that complying with safety regulations is the developer's only obligation. But I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate. Compliance with regulations is important, but it may not absolve the developer from all liability if damage is caused.\n\nLet me consider the Restatement of Torts, Section 823, which deals with this issue.\n\nAccording to the Restatement, \"[o]ne who excavates land adjacent to land occupied by a structure is subject to liability for harm caused to the structure by the excavation, if the harm is caused by the withdrawal of support from the land by the excavation, and the excavation is not otherwise privileged.\"\n\nSo, it seems like the developer could be liable if the excavation caused harm by withdrawing support, unless the excavation is privileged.\n\nWhat makes an excavation privileged?\n\nWell, Section 824 says that \"[o]ne who excavates land is privileged to withdraw from the land the support which it naturally furnishes to the land of another, unless the withdrawal is unreasonably dangerous to the land or things affixed to it of the other.\"\n\nSo, it comes down to whether the excavation was unreasonably dangerous.\n\nThe comment to Section 824 indicates that in rural areas, excavation is not privileged if it causes harm to a neighbor's land, but in urban areas, there may be an implied consent to some degree of excavation, provided reasonable care is taken.\n\nGiven that this is in the central portion of a city, it's likely an urban area where implied consent for excavation exists, but with the condition that reasonable care is taken.\n\nSo, if the developer followed all safety regulations and industry standards, it's probably reasonable to conclude that she acted with reasonable care.\n\nTherefore, perhaps she's not liable for the damage.\n\nBut the investor's building still got damaged. It seems unfair that the investor has to bear the cost of repairs.\n\nMaybe there's a way for the investor to recover damages.\n\nWait, perhaps the developer could be required to shore up the investor's building or take other measures to prevent damage, even if she's not strictly liable for the damage.\n\nBut according to the scenario, the developer used shoring that met all regulations, so maybe that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the investor could claim that the developer had a duty to take additional precautions beyond the regulations, but that seems unlikely if the developer complied with all regulations.\n\nI think the key here is whether the excavation was conducted with reasonable care, considering the circumstances.\n\nSince the developer followed all safety regulations and placed the shoring correctly, it's probably safe to say that she acted with reasonable care.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the investor cannot recover damages from the developer.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B seems the most appropriate. It says that the developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\n\nGiven that the developer followed all regulations and industry standards, it would be difficult for the investor to prove negligence.\n\nOption A is too broad because it suggests strict liability for removing necessary support, but in urban areas, there may be an expectation that some support will be removed for construction purposes, provided reasonable care is taken.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the right to lateral support generally applies even to improved land.\n\nOption D is too narrow because complying with regulations may not be the only obligation; there could be common law duties, such as the duty of care in excavation cases.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
