                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that at least one out of five children will develop a cavity before turning 10. The dentist has observed that about two children in every seven develop cavities before age 10. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"at least one\" means in terms of probability. \"At least one\" means one or more, so it's the opposite of none. In probability terms, that would be 1 minus the probability of none developing cavities. So, P(X \u2265 1) = 1 - P(X = 0). Hmm, option D says exactly that: 1 \u2013 P(X = 0). That seems promising.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure. The problem mentions that the dentist examined five children, but the ratio is two in seven develop cavities. So, the probability of developing a cavity is 2/7, right? And the children are unrelated, so I can assume their cavity development is independent.\n\nSo, this sounds like a binomial probability problem, where each child has a probability p of developing a cavity, and q = 1 - p of not developing a cavity. Here, p = 2/7, and q = 5/7.\n\nThe binomial probability formula is P(X = k) = C(n, k) * p^k * q^(n - k), where n is the number of trials (children), k is the number of successes (cavities), p is the probability of success, and q is the probability of failure.\n\nBut in this case, we don't need to calculate the exact probabilities; we just need to identify which option gives the probability that at least one will develop a cavity.\n\nOption A: P(X = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Wait, but the dentist examined only five children, so X can only be from 0 to 5. P(X = 6 or 7) would be zero. So this doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption B: P(X = 2 out of 7). Again, only five children were examined, not seven. So this doesn't apply here.\n\nOption C: P(X = 1). But \"at least one\" includes one or more, not just exactly one.\n\nOption D: 1 \u2013 P(X = 0). This matches what I thought earlier: the probability of at least one is one minus the probability of none.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate P(X \u2265 1) by summing P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5). But that's more work, and option D provides a simpler way: 1 - P(X = 0).\n\nAlso, since the children are unrelated and we're assuming independence, the binomial model is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 1 \u2013 P(X = 0).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
