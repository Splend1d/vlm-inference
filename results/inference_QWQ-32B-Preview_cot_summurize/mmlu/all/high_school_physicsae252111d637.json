                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an ideal battery and a circuit. Let me see if I can figure this out. So, an ideal battery with a constant voltage V is supplying current to a circuit that has a total resistance R. Now, if R is doubled, what happens to the total power dissipated by the circuit? The options are: it doubles, quadruples, is halved, or remains the same.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall the relationship between power, voltage, and resistance in a circuit. I remember that power dissipated in a resistor can be calculated using different formulas, but the most relevant one here might be P = V^2 / R, since voltage is constant.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP = V^2 / R\n\nSo, power is inversely proportional to resistance when voltage is constant. That means if resistance increases, power should decrease, and vice versa.\n\nNow, if R is doubled, so R_new = 2R, then the new power P_new would be:\n\nP_new = V^2 / (2R) = (V^2 / R) * (1/2) = P / 2\n\nSo, the power is halved when resistance is doubled.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it. I know that power can also be expressed as P = I^2 * R, where I is current. So, if resistance changes, current also changes.\n\nLet me see. According to Ohm's law, V = I * R, so I = V / R.\n\nIf resistance is doubled, then I_new = V / (2R) = I / 2.\n\nNow, using P = I^2 * R, the new power would be:\n\nP_new = (I / 2)^2 * 2R = (I^2 / 4) * 2R = (I^2 * R) / 2 = P / 2\n\nAgain, the power is halved.\n\nHmm, both approaches give me the same result. So, it seems that when resistance is doubled, power is halved.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another formula for power: P = I * V.\n\nIf I use this, and again, V is constant, and I is halved when R is doubled, then P_new = (I / 2) * V = P / 2.\n\nSame result again. So, no matter which formula I use, I end up with power being halved when resistance is doubled, given that voltage is constant.\n\nI think this makes sense because, in a circuit with constant voltage, increasing resistance reduces the current, and since power is related to both current and resistance, the overall effect is a decrease in power dissipation.\n\nLet me see if there's any scenario where doubling resistance would double or quadruple the power. Maybe if voltage was changing, but the problem says the battery has a constant voltage, so voltage remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if the circuit had multiple resistors in parallel or series, but the problem mentions total resistance R, so I think it's safe to treat it as a single equivalent resistance.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's confusion about power dissipation in different parts of the circuit. But the question specifies the total power dissipated by the circuit, so it should be the overall power dissipated across the entire circuit.\n\nAlright, I think I've convinced myself that the correct answer is that the power is halved when resistance is doubled.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. It will be halved.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
