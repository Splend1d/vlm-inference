They place greater emphasis on economic factors\n\nB. They place greater emphasis on material interests and power\n\nC. They place greater emphasis on ideology and beliefs\n\nD. They place greater emphasis on geopolitics\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Realist accounts focus on in the context of the Cold War. Realism in international relations theory generally emphasizes power politics, national interests, and the struggle for security and dominance among states. During the Cold War, Realists would likely see the conflict between the US and the Soviet Union as a battle for superpower status, with each side trying to maximize its influence and security.\n\nNow, Ideational approaches, on the other hand, stress the importance of ideas, beliefs, and ideologies in shaping foreign policy. So, in the context of the Cold War, an Ideational approach might look at how American values, such as democracy and freedom, drove its foreign policy decisions, perhaps beyond just material interests.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Economic factors \u2013 I don't think this is the key difference. Both Realist and Ideational approaches might consider economic factors, but Realists might see economics as part of material interests, while Ideational approaches might look at how economic policies are shaped by beliefs about free markets or capitalism versus socialism.\n\nB. Material interests and power \u2013 This seems like what Realists emphasize. So, if Ideational approaches differ, they probably don't place greater emphasis here.\n\nC. Ideology and beliefs \u2013 This sounds right for Ideational approaches. They would argue that ideas and beliefs played a crucial role in shaping US foreign policy during the Cold War, maybe even more so than material interests.\n\nD. Geopolitics \u2013 This is another area where Realists might focus, considering strategic locations and military advantages. Ideational approaches might not place as much emphasis on these traditional geopolitical factors.\n\nSo, if I have to choose, option C seems the most accurate. Ideational approaches place greater emphasis on ideology and beliefs compared to Realist accounts, which focus more on material interests and power.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it differently. If someone is a Realist, they'd probably say that the US confronted the Soviet Union because it was a rival superpower threatening American interests and security. An Ideational scholar might argue that the US acted as it did because of its commitment to spreading democracy and containing communism, believing it was morally right, perhaps beyond the immediate material benefits.\n\nTherefore, the difference lies in the prioritization of ideas and beliefs over pure material interests and power struggles.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. They place greater emphasis on ideology and beliefs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
