                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the statement that describes an idea from Kantian ethics. I remember that Kantian ethics is based on reason and moral duties, not on consequences or emotions. So, I should look for an option that matches that.\n\nOption A says, \"What is right and what is wrong are predetermined.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit like moral absolutism, where right and wrong are set and unchangeable, regardless of the situation. Kant did believe in universal moral laws, but I'm not sure if \"predetermined\" is the best way to describe his view. Maybe I should look into this more.\n\nOption B says, \"People should be treated as an end, not a means to an end.\" That rings a bell. I think this is directly from Kant's Categorical Imperative. He talked about treating people as ends in themselves, meaning that they have intrinsic value and shouldn't be used merely as tools to achieve someone else's goals. This seems like a key principle in Kantian ethics.\n\nOption C is \"The greatest good for the greatest number.\" I know this is associated with utilitarianism, not Kantian ethics. Utilitarianism focuses on the consequences of actions and aims to maximize overall happiness or utility. Kant, on the other hand, would argue that morality is about following duty and universal laws, regardless of the outcomes.\n\nOption D says, \"Those better off should give to people who are not as well off.\" This sounds like a principle of distributive justice or perhaps a socialist ideal. Kant did discuss the duties we have towards others, including helping those in need, but I don't recall it being a central tenet of his ethics. Maybe it's more associated with other ethical theories like socialism or certain interpretations of social contract theory.\n\nComparing all these options, option B seems to be the most accurate description of an idea from Kantian ethics. It directly relates to Kant's concept of treating people as ends in themselves, which is a fundamental principle in his moral philosophy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
