                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: cat food costs $0.47 per pound. I need to find out how much a 6-pound bag costs. The options are A) $2.82, B) $2.97, C) $6.47, and D) $12.77.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's a straightforward multiplication problem, right? I have to multiply the cost per pound by the number of pounds to get the total cost.\n\nSo, cost per pound is $0.47, and the bag is 6 pounds. So, total cost should be 0.47 times 6.\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n0.47\n\ntimes 6\n\nFirst, 7 times 6 is 42, so that's 2 and carry over 4.\n\nThen, 4 times 6 is 24, plus the carried over 4 is 28.\n\nSo, it should be 2.82.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider 0.47 as 47 cents per pound.\n\nSo, 47 cents per pound times 6 pounds is 282 cents.\n\nNow, to convert cents to dollars, I divide by 100.\n\n282 divided by 100 is $2.82.\n\nSo, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nNow, looking at the options, A is $2.82, which matches what I calculated.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's any tax or additional costs, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. It seems like it's just a straightforward multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the price per pound is exactly $0.47 or if it's approximately $0.47, but again, the problem states \"costs $0.47 per pound.\"\n\nSo, I think A) $2.82 is the correct answer.\n\nBut why are there other options? Maybe to check if I'm paying attention or if I make a calculation error.\n\nFor example, B) $2.97 is slightly higher than $2.82. Maybe if someone added extra cents by mistake.\n\nC) $6.47 is roughly the cost per pound plus the weight, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nD) $12.77 is even higher, perhaps if someone multiplied 0.47 by 27 or something, but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo, I think A) $2.82 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
