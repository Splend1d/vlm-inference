In the case of continuous random variables, the probability distribution function is actually the probability density function (PDF), not to be confused with the probability mass function (PMF) used for discrete random variables.\n\nThe PDF, \\( p(x) \\), describes the relative likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on a given value. However, for continuous variables, the probability of taking on any specific value is actually zero because there are infinitely many possible values.\n\nInstead, probabilities are associated with intervals. The probability that \\( x \\) lies within a certain interval is given by the integral of the PDF over that interval.\n\nNow, regarding the values that the PDF can take: the PDF can take on values greater than 1, as long as the total area under the curve is equal to 1. For example, consider a uniform distribution on the interval [0, 0.5]. The PDF would be 2 in that interval because the area of a rectangle with width 0.5 and height 2 is 1.\n\nSo, \\( p(x) \\) can be greater than 1 for some \\( x \\), as long as the integral over all \\( x \\) is 1. Therefore, the statement that \\( 0 \\leq p(x) \\leq 1 \\) for all \\( x \\) is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** Decision tree is learned by minimizing information gain.\n\nI need to recall how decision trees are constructed. Decision trees are built by selecting the best feature to split the data at each node, based on some criterion that measures the quality of the split.\n\nOne common criterion is information gain, which is based on the concept of entropy in information theory. Information gain measures how well a feature splits the data into subsets that are more homogeneous in terms of the target class.\n\nThe idea is to choose the feature that provides the highest information gain, meaning that it results in the purest possible subsets. In other words, decision trees aim to maximize information gain at each split, not minimize it.\n\nAnother criterion is the Gini impurity, which is used in algorithms like CART (Classification and Regression Trees). Again, the goal is to minimize the Gini impurity, which is equivalent to maximizing purity.\n\nSo, in the context of decision trees, we aim to maximize information gain, not minimize it. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\nGiven that both statements are false, the correct choice is:\n\nB. False, False"
