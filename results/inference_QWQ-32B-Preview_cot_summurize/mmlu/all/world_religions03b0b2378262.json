So, the question is: \"According to the Japanese origin myth, who gives birth to Amaterasu from his left eye?\n\nA. Es\n\nB. Izanagi\n\nC. Izanami\n\nD. Kami\"\n\nFirst off, I need to recall some basics about Japanese mythology. I know that Amaterasu is a really important goddess in Japanese mythology; she's the sun goddess. The other names mentioned are also figures in Japanese mythology, but I need to remember specifically who is credited with giving birth to Amaterasu.\n\nLet me think about Izanagi and Izanami. I recall that they are a divine couple who are often credited with creating the islands of Japan and many other deities. In the Japanese creation myth, they are tasked with creating the world and they give birth to various kami, which are divine beings or spirits in Shintoism.\n\nI think that Amaterasu is one of their children. But the question specifies that she is born from someone's left eye. That sounds a bit different from a typical birth story. Maybe there's a specific myth about how Amaterasu was born.\n\nWait, I seem to remember that Amaterasu was born from Izanagi's left eye, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall the story. After Izanagi travels to the underworld to try to bring back Izanami, who has died, and fails, he purifies himself upon his return to the upper world. During this purification ritual, he washes his face, and from his left eye emerges Amaterasu, from his right eye emerges Tsukuyomi (the moon god), and from his nose emerges Susanoo (the storm god).\n\nYes, that sounds familiar. So, according to this myth, Amaterasu is born from Izanagi's left eye during his purification ritual.\n\nSo, if that's the case, the answer should be B. Izanagi.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any other myth where Amaterasu is born from someone else's eye? I don't recall any such story, but mythology can be complex, and there might be variations.\n\nAlso, looking at the options:\n\nA. Es - I'm not sure who \"Es\" refers to. Maybe it's a typo or a misnomer.\n\nC. Izanami - She's Izanagi's wife and together they create the islands of Japan and other deities, but in the myth I recall, Amaterasu is born from Izanagi, not Izanami.\n\nD. Kami - This term refers to the divine beings or spirits in Shintoism, of which Amaterasu is one, but it's not a specific deity giving birth to her.\n\nSo, based on my memory of the myth, the correct answer should be B. Izanagi.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other myths or variations where Amaterasu is born from someone else's eye. I don't recall any, and in the standard creation myth of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, which are the primary sources for Japanese mythology, it is Izanagi who gives birth to Amaterasu from his left eye.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is B. Izanagi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
