                    "text": "Let's see. I have this passage from Al-Zawawi about Sultan Musa and his kingdom. It talks about a copper mine in a town called ZKRY, and how they bring ingots to another place called BYTY. Sultan Musa says that the only thing they tax in his kingdom is this crude copper, and they sell it to the pagan Sudan for gold. Also, there are pagan nations in his kingdom who don't pay tribute but instead work in extracting gold by digging pits.\n\nSo, the question is which statement about the period 600-1450 C.E. is supported by this passage. The options are:\n\nA. Religions were often spread through warfare during the period.\n\nB. International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nC. Diseases spread along trade routes.\n\nD. Nomadic migrations created powerful empires during the period.\n\nHmm, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Religions were often spread through warfare during the period.\n\nWell, the passage doesn't really mention anything about warfare or the spread of religions through warfare. It talks about taxation and trade, but not about warfare or religious conquests. So, I don't think this is supported by the passage.\n\nOption B: International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nOkay, this seems relevant. The passage mentions that they sell copper to the pagan Sudan for gold, which suggests that there are trade connections between Sultan Musa's kingdom and Sudan. It also says that they send the copper to the land of the pagan Sudan, which implies some sort of international trade relationship. So, this seems like a possible answer.\n\nOption C: Diseases spread along trade routes.\n\nThe passage doesn't mention anything about diseases or their spread. It's focused on trade and taxation, but there's no information about diseases spreading along these trade routes. So, this doesn't seem supported by the passage.\n\nOption D: Nomadic migrations created powerful empires during the period.\n\nAgain, the passage doesn't mention anything about nomadic migrations or the creation of empires through such migrations. It's about the internal workings of Sultan Musa's kingdom and its trade with Sudan. So, this doesn't seem supported either.\n\nComparing the options, option B seems to be the one most directly supported by the passage. The passage describes a trade relationship between Sultan Musa's kingdom and Sudan, involving the exchange of copper for gold. This suggests that international trade connections were indeed present and possibly still developing during this period.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Sultan Musa only taxes crude copper and uses the revenue to trade for gold indicates a structured trade system. Also, the mention of pagan nations within his kingdom who are employed in extracting gold suggests a degree of economic organization.\n\nTherefore, I believe that statement B, \"International trade connections were still being developed in the period,\" is the one supported by the passage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
