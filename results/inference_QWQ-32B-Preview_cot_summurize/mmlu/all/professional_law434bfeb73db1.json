                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a developer who conveyed title to a lot to a woman using a warranty deed two years ago. The woman bought an owner's policy of title insurance before closing. So, she's protected against any defects in title that aren't listed as exceptions in the title policy.\n\nBut there's a problem: the title commitment and the title policy didn't list a county tax lien that encumbers the lot. This is because of an error by the title insurance company. So, the tax lien isn't excepted in the policy, which means, in theory, the insurance should cover it.\n\nLast year, the woman sold the lot to her friend via a quitclaim deed for a bargain price, and the friend paid cash without doing a title search or getting title insurance.\n\nNow, the county is foreclosing on the tax lien, and the friend is claiming reimbursement from the woman's title insurance company for the tax lien amount.\n\nThe question is: Is the title insurance company obligated to pay the friend's claim?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.\n\nB. No, because the title insurance policy expired when the woman conveyed the lot to the friend.\n\nC. Yes, because the tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy.\n\nD. Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss.\n\nOption A suggests that only named insureds can make claims, and since the friend isn't named, the claim shouldn't be honored. But in title insurance, generally, only the named insureds can make claims. However, there might be exceptions or additional considerations.\n\nOption B states that the policy expired when the woman sold the lot. I need to check if title insurance policies continue after the property is sold. I think owner's title insurance typically remains in effect as long as the insured has an interest in the property. But since she sold it via quitclaim deed, her interest might still exist, or maybe not.\n\nOption C says yes, the company should pay because the tax lien wasn't listed as an exception. This seems straightforward\u2014if the lien isn't excepted, it should be covered. But the policy is with the woman, not the friend.\n\nOption D brings in the concept of covenants in the warranty deed. Warranty deeds typically include covenants against encumbrances, meaning the seller warrants that there are no undisclosed encumbrances. If there is a breach, the seller might be liable to the buyer. If the title insurance covers the seller for that liability, then maybe it extends to the friend.\n\nLet me think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, title insurance generally insures the insured party against losses due to defects in title that are not disclosed in the policy. In this case, the tax lien wasn't disclosed, so it should be covered.\n\nBut the friend isn't the named insured; the woman is. So, can the friend make a claim under the woman's policy?\n\nProbably not, because title insurance is typically for the benefit of the named insured and doesn't extend to subsequent buyers, especially when the deed is a quitclaim deed, which offers no warranties.\n\nMoreover, when the woman sold the property via quitclaim deed, she wasn't making any warranties about the title. Quitclaim deeds convey whatever interest the grantor has without any guarantees. So, the friend took the property subject to any encumbrances, known or unknown.\n\nAdditionally, the friend didn't buy title insurance, didn't do a title search, and paid cash. So, the friend assumed the risk of any title defects.\n\nNow, regarding the title policy expiring: owner's title insurance generally remains in effect as long as the insured has an interest in the property. Since the woman quitclaimed the property to her friend, she may no longer have any interest in the property, which could mean the policy is no longer in effect.\n\nBut, if the quitclaim deed doesn't completely divest her of interest, perhaps there's still coverage.\n\nHowever, even if the policy is still in effect, the friend isn't the named insured, so the claim might not be valid.\n\nOn the other hand, if the woman is liable to the friend for breach of covenant (which is less likely since it was a quitclaim deed), and the title insurance covers the woman for that liability, then perhaps the friend could indirectly benefit from the title insurance.\n\nBut this seems stretchy.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA seems plausible because the friend isn't named insured.\n\nB could be possible if the policy expired upon conveyance.\n\nC is attractive because the lien wasn't excepted, but it doesn't consider who can make the claim.\n\nD is perhaps reaching too far with the covenant idea.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is A: no, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.\n\nBut let me check if there's any principle that allows subsequent owners to claim under a previous owner's title insurance policy.\n\nGenerally, title insurance is not assignable, and only the named insureds can make claims. So, even if the policy is still in effect, the friend couldn't make a claim.\n\nTherefore, option A seems correct.\n\nOption B might also be considered, but expiration of the policy is not typically how owner's title insurance works. Owner's policies usually remain in effect indefinitely as long as the insured has an interest in the property. Since the woman quitclaimed the property, she may have no remaining interest, which could terminate the policy.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nPerhaps both A and B could be reasons, but if I had to choose one, I'd go with A: the friend isn't a named insured.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
