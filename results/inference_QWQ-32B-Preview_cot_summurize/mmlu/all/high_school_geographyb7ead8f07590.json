The question is asking what both of these cities are examples of, and the options are:\n\nA. desert cities.\n\nB. forward-thrust capitals.\n\nC. old colonial capitals.\n\nD. rival cities.\n\nFirst, let's think about what each of these options means.\n\nOption A is \"desert cities.\" Well, Ankara is in Turkey, which has a variety of climates, but Ankara itself is not in a desert region. It's more like a continental climate with hot summers and cold winters. Islamabad, on the other hand, is in Pakistan and is located in the Pothohar Plateau, which is semi-arid. So, it's closer to a desert climate, but I'm not sure if it's accurate to call it a desert city. Maybe not the best fit for both cities.\n\nOption B is \"forward-thrust capitals.\" I'm not entirely sure what this means, but I think it refers to cities that were built to move the capital away from traditional or coastal areas, perhaps to more central or strategic locations. Let's see: Ankara was chosen as the capital of Turkey in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, moving the capital from Istanbul. Similarly, Islamabad became the capital of Pakistan in 1960, replacing Karachi. Both were planned cities built to serve as the new capitals. So, this seems promising.\n\nOption C is \"old colonial capitals.\" Well, Turkey wasn't a colonial possession; it was part of the Ottoman Empire, which was a colonial power itself. So, Ankara wasn't a colonial capital. Pakistan, after gaining independence from British rule, moved its capital from Karachi to Islamabad. Karachi was the capital during the colonial period, but Islamabad was built afterward. So, perhaps neither of these cities fits the \"old colonial capitals\" category.\n\nOption D is \"rival cities.\" I don't think Ankara and Islamabad are rivals in any particular sense. They are both capitals of their respective countries, but they don't seem to have any direct rivalry or competition between them.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B, \"forward-thrust capitals,\" seems to be the most appropriate answer. Both Ankara and Islamabad were planned and built as new capitals, moving away from the previous capital cities. So, they represent a forward thrust in terms of governance and nation-building.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
