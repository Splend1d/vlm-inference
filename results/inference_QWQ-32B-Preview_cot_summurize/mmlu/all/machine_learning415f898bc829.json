                    "text": "Let's dive into the K-means algorithm and see which of these statements are accurate. K-means is a popular clustering technique used to group similar data points together based on their features. It aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.\n\nOption A says: \"Requires the dimension of the feature space to be no bigger than the number of samples.\" Hmm, I don't recall any such restriction in K-means. The algorithm can handle high-dimensional data as long as there are enough samples to represent the feature space adequately. In fact, in many real-world applications, the number of features can be much larger than the number of samples. So, I think this statement might not be accurate.\n\nOption B states: \"Has the smallest value of the objective function when K = 1.\" The objective function in K-means is the within-cluster sum of squares, which measures the compactness of the clusters. When K=1, all data points are assigned to a single cluster, and the centroid is the mean of all data points. In this case, the objective function value would be the sum of squared distances from each point to this global mean. Whether this is the smallest possible value depends on the data distribution. If the data is inherently one-cluster, then yes, K=1 might minimize the objective function. However, in most cases, choosing a higher K would allow for more specialized clusters and thus a lower objective function value. So, I'm not sure if this is always true.\n\nOption C says: \"Minimizes the within-class variance for a given number of clusters.\" This sounds familiar. The K-means algorithm indeed aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares, which is directly related to the within-class variance. By iteratively assigning data points to the nearest centroid and updating the centroids based on the mean of the assigned points, K-means tries to reduce the intra-cluster variability. So, this seems like a correct statement.\n\nOption D states: \"Converges to the global optimum if and only if the initial means are chosen as some of the samples themselves.\" K-means is known to converge to a local optimum, and the final result can depend on the initial centroid positions. While choosing initial means as some of the samples (known as K-means++) can lead to better results, it doesn't guarantee convergence to the global optimum. There's no guarantee that K-means will find the absolute best clustering; it's sensitive to initial conditions. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C appears to be the correct statement about the K-means algorithm. It indeed minimizes the within-class variance for a given number of clusters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
