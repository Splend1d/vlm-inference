                    "text": "Let's tackle this tax question step by step. So, Smith has an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $120,000, and there's an additional $40,000 in losses from rental real estate activities that aren't currently included in that AGI. Smith also actively participates in these rental activities. The question is asking how much of these rental losses Smith can deduct to determine the taxable income.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules for deducting rental losses against AGI. I know that for taxpayers who actively participate in rental real estate activities, there are some limitations on how much loss they can deduct each year, especially if their income is above certain thresholds.\n\nI recall that there's something called the passive activity loss rules, which generally prevent taxpayers from deducting passive losses against active income. However, since Smith actively participates in the rental activities, maybe some exceptions apply here.\n\nLet me think about the at-risk rules as well. The at-risk rules limit the deduction of losses to the amount the taxpayer has at risk in the activity. But I'm not given any information about how much Smith has invested or is at risk in these rental properties, so maybe that's not directly applicable here.\n\nWait, I think there's a specific rule for rental real estate activities where taxpayers can deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses against their AGI, but only if their AGI is below a certain level. For higher incomes, this deduction is phased out.\n\nLet me check what that income threshold is. I believe for single filers, the full $25,000 deduction is allowed if AGI is $100,000 or less, and it's phased out by 50% for each $1,000 over $100,000.\n\nGiven that Smith's AGI is $120,000, which is $20,000 over the $100,000 threshold, that would mean the deduction is reduced by 50% for each $1,000 over $100,000.\n\nSo, $20,000 over the threshold is 20 times $1,000, and 50% of that is 10 times $1,000, which is $10,000.\n\nTherefore, the deduction would be reduced by $10,000 from the maximum $25,000, leaving a deductible rental loss of $15,000.\n\nBut wait, the options don't include $15,000. Let me double-check the numbers.\n\nIf the phase-out is $50 for every $100 over $100,000, then for each $1,000 over, it's $500 reduction in the deduction.\n\nWait, no, it's 50% of the amount over $100,000.\n\nSo, for $20,000 over, 50% of $20,000 is $10,000 reduction.\n\nThus, $25,000 minus $10,000 equals $15,000.\n\nBut $15,000 is not one of the options. Maybe I'm misremembering the rules or the income thresholds.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Perhaps the $25,000 phase-out doesn't apply here, or maybe there are different rules for real estate rental activities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the overall limitation is based on the taxpayer's AGI and the amount of rental loss.\n\nI've heard of a rule where rental losses can't exceed the amount of rental income plus $25,000, subject to AGI limitations.\n\nBut in this case, Smith has no rental losses currently included in AGI, and is looking to deduct $40,000 in losses.\n\nGiven that Smith's AGI is $120,000, perhaps there's a limitation based on that.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different set of rules for real estate professionals, but I don't think that applies here unless specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the limitation is based on the amount of AGI, and the deduction is limited to a certain percentage.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the deduction is limited to 20% of AGI or something like that.\n\nWait, that sounds like the limitation on deducting miscellaneous itemized deductions, which are subject to the 2% of AGI floor, but I don't think that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rental losses are subject to the overall limitation on itemized deductions phase-out, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deduction is limited to the amount that would reduce AGI to zero, which in this case is $120,000 minus up to $120,000, but that seems too broad.\n\nWait, no, losses can't create a negative AGI; they can only reduce AGI to zero.\n\nBut in this case, Smith wants to deduct $40,000 in losses against $120,000 AGI, which would reduce AGI to $80,000.\n\nBut perhaps there are other limitations that further restrict how much of that $40,000 can be deducted.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is $20,000, which might be based on some other calculation or phase-out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all $40,000 can be deducted, reducing AGI to $80,000, but I doubt that, given there are usually limitations on deducting rental losses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe none of the losses can be deducted, resulting in $0 deduction.\n\nBut that seems unlikely since Smith actively participates in the activities.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is $0 because of the AGI phase-out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phase-out works differently, and at AGI of $120,000, no deduction is allowed.\n\nBut earlier calculation suggested a $15,000 deduction, which isn't an option.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is $20,000, and my calculation was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different set of rules altogether that I'm not considering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $40,000 loss is subject to the net investment income tax limitations, but I don't think that's directly relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deduction is limited based on the type of rental activities or the nature of Smith's participation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the deduction is limited to the amount of rental income received, but in this case, there's no mention of any rental income, so perhaps none.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deduction is limited to 20% of AGI, which would be $24,000, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific limitation for non-professional rental activities.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is $0, meaning no deduction is allowed due to the AGI phase-out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is $20,000 based on a different phase-out formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is $40,000, meaning all losses can be deducted.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the options provided, I'm going to guess that the answer is $20,000, option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
