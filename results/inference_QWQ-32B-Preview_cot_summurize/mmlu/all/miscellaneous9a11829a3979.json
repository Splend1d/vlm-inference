Let's see, the options are Monterey Bay, Prince William Sound, Cape Cod, and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nI think Prince William Sound is in Alaska. I recall that Alaska is known for its beautiful wildlife and pristine environment, so maybe that's where it happened. But let me double-check.\n\nMonterey Bay is in California, known for its aquarium and marine biology. Cape Cod is in Massachusetts, famous for beaches and seafood. The Gulf of Mexico is south of the United States, with states like Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida along its shores.\n\nWait a minute, I think the Exxon Valdez was a tanker carrying oil, and it struck some rocks or something, causing a massive spill. I believe it was in Alaska, which would make it Prince William Sound.\n\nAlso, I remember that the spill had a huge impact on the local ecosystem, with oil covering beaches and harming sea otters, birds, and other wildlife. The cleanup was extensive and costly.\n\nLet me see if I can recall any details about the event. I think the tanker was being navigated out of Prince William Sound and was headed to Long Beach, California, or somewhere like that.\n\nI also seem to remember that there was some controversy about the captain being drunk or something, but I might be confusing it with another incident.\n\nIn any case, based on what I've recalled, I think the answer is B. Prince William Sound.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
