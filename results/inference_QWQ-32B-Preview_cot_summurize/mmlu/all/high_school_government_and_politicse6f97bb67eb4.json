                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the principles in the Declaration of Independence and which political philosopher influenced them. The statement is \"we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\" and I need to choose between Thomas Hobbes, Niccolo Machiavelli, Jonathan Edwards, and John Locke.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these philosophers is known for. Let's start with Thomas Hobbes. He's famous for his book \"Leviathan,\" where he talks about the social contract and how people need a strong central authority to avoid the brutish nature of human life without government. His view is that in the state of nature, life is \"nasty, brutish, and short,\" and people agree to surrender some freedoms to a sovereign in exchange for order and protection.\n\nNext, Niccolo Machiavelli is known for his book \"The Prince,\" where he discusses the principles of effective leadership, often associated with realpolitik and the idea that the ends justify the means. He's more focused on how rulers can maintain power and control, rather than on the moral or ethical aspects of governance.\n\nJonathan Edwards was a key figure in the Great Awakening, an evangelical movement in colonial America. He's famous for his sermon \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.\" While he was influential in religious terms, I don't recall him having a direct influence on political philosophy or the ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThen there's John Locke, who wrote the \"Two Treatises of Government.\" Locke is known for his ideas about natural rights, consent of the governed, and the social contract. He believed that people have certain inalienable rights, such as life, liberty, and property, and that governments are formed to protect these rights. If a government fails to do so, the people have the right to overthrow it.\n\nComparing these philosophers, it seems that John Locke's ideas align most closely with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Independence. The notion that all men are created equal and have certain unalienable rights is directly reminiscent of Locke's philosophy.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that Thomas Jefferson, who drafted the Declaration, was influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, particularly John Locke. The phrase \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" is often attributed to Locke's concept of life, liberty, and property.\n\nOn the other hand, Thomas Hobbes' view of the social contract emphasizes the need for a strong central authority, which contrasts with the revolutionary spirit of the Declaration. Machiavelli's focus on pragmatic governance and the ruler's power doesn't seem directly related to the ideals of equality and inalienable rights. Jonathan Edwards, while influential in religion, doesn't seem to have a significant impact on political philosophy in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is D. John Locke.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
