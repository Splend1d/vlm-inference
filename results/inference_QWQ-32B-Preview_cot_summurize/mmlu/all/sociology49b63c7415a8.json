Auguste Comte.\n\nTo provide some context, Auguste Comte was a French philosopher who is often regarded as the father of sociology. He introduced the term \"sociology\" in his work \"Course on Positive Philosophy\" published between 1830 and 1842. Comte believed that sociology, as a scientific study of society, could help understand and improve social structures and relationships.\n\nThe other options are also important figures in sociology:\n\n- Robert K. Merton was an American sociologist who developed key concepts like \"strain theory\" and \"middle-range theory.\"\n\n- Karl Marx was a German philosopher and economist whose ideas about class struggle and capitalism have had a profound influence on sociology.\n\n- Emile Durkheim was a French sociologist who is known for his work on social integration and the concept of \"social facts.\"\n\nHowever, it was Comte who first coined the term \"sociology.\""
