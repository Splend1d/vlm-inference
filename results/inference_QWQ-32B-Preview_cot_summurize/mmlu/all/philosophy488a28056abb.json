                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about John Stuart Mill's views on pleasure. The question is: \"According to Mill, to determine whether one pleasure is more valuable than another, we must _____.\" And the options are:\n\nA. determine which one is objectively most pleasurable\n\nB. determine which pleasure most experienced people prefer\n\nC. consult philosophers of past\n\nD. consult science\n\nI remember that Mill talked about different kinds of pleasures in his work \"Utilitarianism.\" He believed that not all pleasures are equal and that some are better than others. He made a distinction between higher and lower pleasures.\n\nLower pleasures are those that are more animalistic or related to our basic senses, like eating, drinking, and physical comfort. Higher pleasures, on the other hand, are intellectual and moral pleasures, such as those derived from art, science, education, and personal achievement.\n\nMill argued that higher pleasures are more valuable because they engage our higher faculties and contribute more to our overall well-being. He believed that people who have experienced both types of pleasures would prefer the higher ones, even if they are sometimes less intense or immediately satisfying.\n\nSo, in the context of this question, it seems like the answer should relate to the preference of those who have experienced both types of pleasures.\n\nLooking at option A: \"determine which one is objectively most pleasurable.\" This sounds a bit vague. Mill didn't believe in an objective scale of pleasure that applies universally. Instead, he thought that the value of pleasure depends on its quality, not just its quantity.\n\nOption B says: \"determine which pleasure most experienced people prefer.\" This seems closer to Mill's idea. He argued that those who have experienced both higher and lower pleasures would prefer the higher ones, even if they are sometimes less intense.\n\nOption C: \"consult philosophers of the past.\" While Mill certainly drew on the ideas of past philosophers, especially his mentor Jeremy Bentham, he also developed his own thoughts on utilitarianism. So, while consulting past philosophers might be informative, it's not the direct method Mill proposed for determining the value of pleasures.\n\nOption D: \"consult science.\" Mill was influenced by scientific thinking, but in the context of evaluating pleasures, he relied more on the judgments of those who have experienced both types of pleasures.\n\nGiven this, option B seems to be the most accurate reflection of Mill's\u89c2\u70b9. He believed that the value of pleasures could be determined by the preferences of those who have experienced both higher and lower pleasures, and who are thus in a position to compare them.\n\nTo confirm, I recall a famous quote from Mill's \"Utilitarianism\" where he says, \"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.\" This illustrates his belief that higher pleasures are preferable, even if they come with some dissatisfaction, compared to the contentment of lower pleasures.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: determine which pleasure most experienced people prefer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
