                    "text": "So I've got this investment project to evaluate. It cost $1 million to undertake and is expected to deliver $2 million in five years. The discount rate is 10%. I need to find out the Net Present Value (NPV) of this project. The options are A) $1,000,000, B) $300,000, C) $2,000,000, and D) $242,000. I'm not entirely sure how to approach this, but I think I need to calculate the present value of the future cash inflow and then subtract the initial investment.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what NPV is. NPV is a method used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project by considering the time value of money. It calculates the present value of future cash flows and subtracts the initial investment. If the NPV is positive, the investment is considered worthwhile.\n\nSo, the formula for NPV is:\n\nNPV = Present Value of Cash Inflows - Initial Investment\n\nIn this case, the initial investment is $1 million, and the cash inflow is $2 million received in five years. The discount rate is 10%, which means that the value of money decreases over time due to inflation and opportunity cost, and we need to account for that.\n\nTo find the present value of the $2 million received in five years, I need to discount it back to today's value using the discount rate of 10%. The formula for present value (PV) is:\n\nPV = CF / (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\n- CF is the cash flow in the future\n\n- r is the discount rate\n\n- n is the number of periods\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPV = $2,000,000 / (1 + 0.10)^5\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.10)^5:\n\n(1.10)^5 = 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10 * 1.10\n\nLet's calculate that step by step:\n\n1.10 * 1.10 = 1.21\n\n1.21 * 1.10 = 1.331\n\n1.331 * 1.10 = 1.4641\n\n1.4641 * 1.10 = 1.61051\n\nSo, (1.10)^5 = 1.61051\n\nNow, PV = $2,000,000 / 1.61051 \u2248 $1,241,842.54\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, I think I recall that the present value factor for 10% over 5 years is approximately 0.62092. So, PV = $2,000,000 * 0.62092 = $1,241,840\n\nHmm, that still gives me around $1,241,840, but I'm not sure because when I divide $2,000,000 by 1.61051, I get approximately $1,241,842.54. Maybe I need to use a financial calculator or a table for more accuracy.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula:\n\nPV = CF * (1 / (1 + r)^n)\n\nSo, PV = $2,000,000 * (1 / 1.61051) \u2248 $2,000,000 * 0.62092 \u2248 $1,241,840\n\nOkay, so the present value of the $2 million received in five years is approximately $1,241,840.\n\nNow, to find the NPV, I subtract the initial investment from the present value of the cash inflow:\n\nNPV = $1,241,840 - $1,000,000 = $241,840\n\nLooking back at the options, D) $242,000 is closest to my calculation. I think the slight difference is due to rounding.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if I used the correct discount factor. The present value factor for 10% over 5 years should indeed be 1 / (1.10)^5 = 1 / 1.61051 \u2248 0.62092. Multiplying that by $2,000,000 gives $1,241,840, and subtracting the $1,000,000 initial investment gives $241,840, which rounds to $242,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D) $242,000.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there any mention of intermediate cash flows or any other expenses? The question seems to indicate that the only cash outflow is the initial $1 million, and the only inflow is $2 million in five years. So, no, I don't think there are any other cash flows to consider.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I'm using the correct discount rate. The question states that the discount rate is 10%, so that seems straightforward.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the $2 million is received at the end of five years or somehow differently, but the question specifies \"in five years' time,\" which typically means at the end of the fifth year.\n\nSo, I believe my calculation is correct, and the answer is D) $242,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
