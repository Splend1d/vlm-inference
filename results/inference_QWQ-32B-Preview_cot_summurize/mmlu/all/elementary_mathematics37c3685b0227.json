Since the denominators are the same, I can just add the numerators together, right?\n\nSo, 13 + 7 equals 20, and the denominator stays 14. So that's 20/14. But I think I can simplify that. Both 20 and 14 are divisible by 2. So, 20 divided by 2 is 10, and 14 divided by 2 is 7. So, 10/7.\n\nWait, but 10/7 is an improper fraction. Maybe I should turn that into a mixed number. 7 goes into 10 once, with 3 left over. So, that's 1 and 3/7.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1 and 4 over 7\n\nB. 1 and 3 over 7\n\nC. 1 and 5 over 14\n\nD. 20 over 28\n\nSo, 1 and 3/7 is option B. But wait, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I should check if 20/14 is equal to any other options.\n\nOption D is 20 over 28, which simplifies to 10/14, because both 20 and 28 divide by 2. But 10/14 simplifies further to 5/7. That's not the same as 10/7.\n\nSo, 20/14 is equal to 10/7, which is 1 and 3/7.\n\nSo, B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in adding the fractions.\n\n13/14 + 7/14 = (13 + 7)/14 = 20/14.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnd 20/14 simplifies to 10/7, which is 1 and 3/7.\n\nAlternatively, I could have kept it as 20/14 and compared it to option D, which is 20/28. But 20/28 simplifies to 10/14, which is 5/7, so not the same as 20/14.\n\nSo, option B is indeed the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
