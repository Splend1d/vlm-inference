                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to find the probability that a randomly selected student is going to a 4-year college, given that they're not going to a 2-year college. The percentages are given as follows: 54% go to 4-year colleges, 20% to 2-year colleges, 19% find employment, and 7% search for a job.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's a conditional probability problem. I need to find the probability of a student going to a 4-year college, given that they're not going to a 2-year college. In probability terms, this is P(4-year college | not 2-year college).\n\nI remember that the formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, A is \"going to a 4-year college,\" and B is \"not going to a 2-year college.\"\n\nSo, P(4-year college | not 2-year college) = P(4-year college and not 2-year college) / P(not 2-year college)\n\nBut, since going to a 4-year college and going to a 2-year college are mutually exclusive events (a student can't go to both at the same time), P(4-year college and not 2-year college) is just P(4-year college).\n\nTherefore, P(4-year college | not 2-year college) = P(4-year college) / P(not 2-year college)\n\nI know P(4-year college) is 54%, or 0.54.\n\nNow, P(not 2-year college) is 1 - P(2-year college) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(4-year college | not 2-year college) = 0.54 / 0.80 = 0.675\n\nLooking back at the options, 0.675 is option D.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the total number of students not going to 2-year colleges, which is 80%, and out of those, 54% are going to 4-year colleges. But wait, that 54% is out of the total, not out of the 80%.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider it in terms of actual numbers to make it clearer. Suppose there are 100 students.\n\n- 54 go to 4-year colleges\n\n- 20 go to 2-year colleges\n\n- 19 find employment\n\n- 7 search for a job\n\nSo, the total is 54 + 20 + 19 + 7 = 100, which checks out.\n\nNow, if a student is not going to a 2-year college, that means they are in the group of 100 - 20 = 80 students.\n\nOut of these 80 students, 54 are going to 4-year colleges.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 54 / 80 = 0.675, which again gives me D.\n\nBut let me see if there's any other factor I should consider. Are there any overlapping categories? The problem states that these are mutually exclusive options: either 4-year college, 2-year college, employment, or searching for a job. So, no overlaps.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the concept of reduced sample space. Since we're given that the student is not going to a 2-year college, the sample space is reduced to 80% of the students.\n\nOut of this reduced sample space, the proportion going to 4-year colleges is 54 / 80 = 0.675.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to use the formula for conditional probability directly, as I did earlier.\n\nEither way, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this approach.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nSuppose someone thinks that \"not going to a 2-year college\" includes those who are going to 4-year colleges, finding employment, or searching for a job.\n\nIn that case, the probability of going to a 4-year college given that they're not going to a 2-year college would indeed be the number going to 4-year colleges divided by the total not going to 2-year colleges.\n\nWhich again is 54 / 80 = 0.675.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other perspective.\n\nIs there a chance that \"not going to a 2-year college\" could be interpreted differently?\n\nI don't think so. It's clearly the complement of going to a 2-year college, which includes all other options.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 0.675.\n\nI can confidently go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
