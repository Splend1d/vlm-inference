                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's asking which of the options should be named using Roman numerals after the cation. Let me see what I know about this.\n\nSo, Roman numerals in chemical names are used to indicate the oxidation state of the cation when it's a transition metal that can have multiple oxidation states. For example, iron can be Fe2+ or Fe3+, so we have iron(II) and iron(III) in their names.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. CaCl2 - This is calcium chloride. Calcium is in group 2, and it typically forms a 2+ ion. It doesn't have multiple oxidation states, so we don't need Roman numerals here.\n\nB. CuCl2 - This is copper chloride. Copper is a transition metal and can have multiple oxidation states, like Cu+ and Cu2+. So, in this case, since it's CuCl2, copper is likely in the +2 oxidation state. So, maybe it should be named copper(II) chloride.\n\nC. AlBr3 - Aluminum bromide. Aluminum is in group 13 and typically forms a 3+ ion. It doesn't have multiple common oxidation states, so no Roman numerals are needed.\n\nD. K2Cr2O7 - Potassium dichromate. Chromium is a transition metal and can have multiple oxidation states. In potassium dichromate, chromium is in the +6 oxidation state. So, perhaps it should be named with Roman numerals.\n\nWait, but the question is about naming after the cation. In option D, the cation is potassium, which is in group 1 and always forms a +1 ion. So, maybe it's not about potassium but about chromium.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to clarify. The cation is the positive ion, and in salts, it's usually the metal. So, in option D, the cations are potassium ions, and the anions are dichromate ions. Since potassium has a fixed oxidation state, no Roman numerals are needed.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is B, CuCl2, because copper can have multiple oxidation states, and in this compound, it's likely Cu2+, so it should be named copper(II) chloride.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nOption A: CaCl2 - calcium chloride, no Roman numerals needed.\n\nOption B: CuCl2 - copper(II) chloride, Roman numerals needed.\n\nOption C: AlBr3 - aluminum bromide, no Roman numerals needed.\n\nOption D: K2Cr2O7 - potassium dichromate, no Roman numerals needed for potassium, but chromium is in a specific oxidation state, but it's in the anion, not the cation.\n\nSo, according to the question, which asks for Roman numerals after the cation, and only copper in option B has a cation that requires Roman numerals, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
