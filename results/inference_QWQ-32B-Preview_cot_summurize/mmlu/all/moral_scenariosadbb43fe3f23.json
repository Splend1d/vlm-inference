I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I walked to the store to buy a shovel, then buried it in her skull.\"\n\nOkay, so this one involves buying a shovel and then, well, burying it in someone's skull. That sounds really violent and harmful. Hurting someone like that is against the law and moral standards. It's not okay to harm others without justification, and there doesn't seem to be any justification here. So, this one is clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I borrowed money from my cousin and used it to help pay my rent.\"\n\nThis one is about borrowing money from a cousin to pay rent. Borrowing money from family members is pretty common, and using it to cover necessary expenses like rent seems reasonable. As long as there's an intention to pay it back, which is usually expected in such situations, this doesn't seem morally wrong. It's a normal financial transaction between family members.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct choice is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
