                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Boca Co. and their unemployment claims. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, there's state law that gives Boca two options for handling unemployment claims:\n\n1. Reimburse the state directly for actual unemployment claims.\n\n2. Pay a flat rate of 3% of eligible gross wages.\n\nBoca has chosen to reimburse the state directly for actual claims. They believe that these actual claims will be 2% of eligible gross wages.\n\nNow, eligible gross wages are defined as the first $15,000 of gross wages paid to each employee. Boca has four employees, each of whom earned $20,000 during the year.\n\nI need to figure out what amount Boca should report as an accrued liability for unemployment claims in its year-end balance sheet.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the eligible gross wages for each employee. Since eligible gross wages are the first $15,000 of each employee's gross wages, and each employee earned $20,000, the eligible gross wages per employee are $15,000.\n\nNext, since there are four employees, the total eligible gross wages would be 4 multiplied by $15,000, which equals $60,000.\n\nNow, Boca believes that actual unemployment claims will be 2% of eligible gross wages. So, to find the expected unemployment claims, I need to calculate 2% of $60,000.\n\n2% of $60,000 is (2/100) * 60,000 = 0.02 * 60,000 = $1,200.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the accrued liability should be $1,200.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there's anything else I need to consider.\n\nThe question mentions that Boca has chosen to reimburse the state directly for actual unemployment claims, not to pay the flat rate of 3%. So, the accrued liability should indeed be based on the expected actual claims, which are 2% of eligible gross wages.\n\nMoreover, since the employees each earned $20,000, but only the first $15,000 is eligible, I don't need to worry about the additional $5,000 per employee.\n\nTherefore, the total accrued liability should be $1,200.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $1,200\n\nB. $1,600\n\nC. $1,800\n\nD. $2,400\n\nIt seems that $1,200 is option A.\n\nBut, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there a possibility that the accrued liability should be based on the flat rate instead?\n\nNo, because Boca has chosen to reimburse actual claims, not pay the flat rate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the accrued liability should be based on the state's potential claim if Boca doesn't pay the flat rate, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding about the definition of eligible gross wages.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider that the state might charge Boca the difference between the actual claims and the flat rate, but that doesn't align with the information provided.\n\nThe problem states that Boca can choose to either reimburse actual claims or pay a flat rate of 3% of eligible gross wages. Boca has chosen to reimburse actual claims, estimating them to be 2% of eligible gross wages.\n\nTherefore, the accrued liability should be based on their estimation of actual claims, which is 2% of $60,000, or $1,200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a requirement to accrue the maximum possible liability, which would be the flat rate of 3%.\n\nIf that's the case, then 3% of $60,000 would be (3/100)*60,000 = $1,800, which is option C.\n\nBut the problem states that Boca believes actual claims will be 2%, and they have chosen to reimburse directly, so I think $1,200 is the correct accrued liability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a provision that requires them to accrue the higher of the estimated actual claims or the flat rate.\n\nIn that case, they would accrue $1,800, but again, the problem doesn't suggest that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the accrued liability should be the expected payment, which is the estimated actual claims of $1,200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the state might charge Boca the flat rate regardless of the actual claims, but that contradicts the information that Boca has chosen to reimburse actual claims.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a guarantee that the claims won't exceed the flat rate, but again, the problem doesn't indicate that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the accrued liability should be based on the state's potential claim if Boca doesn't pay the flat rate, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the flat rate is a guarantee payment, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think the correct approach is to accrue the estimated actual claims, which is $1,200.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A, $1,200.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another angle.\n\nSuppose that by choosing to reimburse actual claims, Boca is still liable up to the flat rate, and must accrue the higher amount.\n\nIn that case, they would accrue $1,800, which is option C.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't indicate any such requirement. It simply states that Boca can choose to reimburse actual claims or pay a flat rate, and they have chosen the former.\n\nTherefore, I believe $1,200 is the correct accrued liability.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a provision that requires them to accrue both the estimated actual claims and the difference to the flat rate as a contingent liability, but that seems too complex for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the accrued liability should consider the possibility of claims exceeding the estimate, but again, the problem doesn't provide any information to suggest that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the state will charge Boca the flat rate minus any actual claims reimbursed, but that doesn't align with the options given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flat rate is a maximum cap on the reimbursement, but the problem doesn't indicate that.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most straightforward and correct answer is $1,200, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
