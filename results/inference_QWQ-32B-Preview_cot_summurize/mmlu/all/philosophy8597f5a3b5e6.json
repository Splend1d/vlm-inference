                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Anscombe's view on Sidgwick, and I need to figure out what Anscombe claims about how to estimate the badness of an action according to Sidgwick. The options are:\n\nA. its actual consequences.\n\nB. its expected consequences.\n\nC. whether it violates any duties.\n\nD. whether it violates divine law.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Sidgwick and Anscombe are and what their views are on ethics.\n\nHenry Sidgwick was a British philosopher who lived in the 19th century, and he's known for his work in ethics, particularly his book \"The Methods of Ethics.\" He was influential in developing utilitarianism, which is an ethical theory that judges the rightness of actions based on their consequences, specifically whether they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number.\n\nGertrude Anscombe was a 20th-century philosopher who also wrote about ethics. She was critical of consequentialist theories like utilitarianism and was more inclined towards deontological ethics, which focuses on duties and rules rather than consequences.\n\nGiven that Anscombe was critical of consequentialism and Sidgwick was a utilitarian, it's likely that Anscombe is commenting on Sidgwick's view that the badness of an action is determined by its consequences.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. its actual consequences.\n\nB. its expected consequences.\n\nThese both relate to consequentialism, where the moral value of an action is determined by its outcomes.\n\nC. whether it violates any duties.\n\nThis is more aligned with deontological ethics, where the focus is on adhering to moral duties or rules, regardless of the consequences.\n\nD. whether it violates divine law.\n\nThis would be a theological or religious approach to ethics, where moral rules are derived from divine commands.\n\nGiven that Sidgwick was a utilitarian, it's most likely that he would consider the badness of an action based on its consequences. But the question is, does he consider the actual consequences or the expected consequences?\n\nIn utilitarianism, the focus is usually on the expected consequences because agents make decisions based on what they anticipate will happen, not on what actually happens, which might be beyond their control.\n\nHowever, there are different types of consequentialism. Act utilitarianism judges each act based on its actual consequences, while rule utilitarianism looks at the consequences of following general rules.\n\nSidgwick discussed both act and rule utilitarianism in \"The Methods of Ethics.\" He seemed to favor a form of rule utilitarianism, where actions are evaluated based on whether they conform to rules that, if generally followed, would lead to the greatest good.\n\nGiven this, it's possible that Sidgwick would consider the expected consequences of actions in light of general rules.\n\nBut Anscombe might be critiquing Sidgwick's view by attributing to him a position where the badness of an action is estimated based on its actual consequences.\n\nI need to think carefully here.\n\nPerhaps Anscombe is pointing out that, according to Sidgwick, the moral assessment of an action should be based on its actual consequences, not just on what was expected.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because, in decision-making, agents can only consider what they expect will happen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Sidgwick thought that the badness of an action is determined by its actual consequences, regardless of what was expected.\n\nThat would mean that even if someone intended to do good but caused bad outcomes, their action would be bad based on those outcomes.\n\nAlternatively, if someone intended to do bad but by chance caused good outcomes, their action would be good based on the outcomes.\n\nBut that seems problematic because it doesn't take into account the agent's intentions or the expected consequences.\n\nI think Sidgwick, being a utilitarian, would focus on expected consequences in terms of decision-making, but in evaluating the actual moral value of an action, it might be based on its actual consequences.\n\nHowever, this creates problems, as Anscombe might point out, because it could lead to blaming agents for outcomes that were outside their control or intentions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Sidgwick distinguishes between the rightness of an action, which is based on expected consequences, and the goodness of the action, which is based on actual consequences.\n\nIn that case, the badness of an action would be estimated based on its actual consequences.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. its actual consequences.\n\nB. its expected consequences.\n\nC. whether it violates any duties.\n\nD. whether it violates divine law.\n\nGiven that Sidgwick was a utilitarian, options C and D seem less likely, as they are more aligned with deontological and theological ethics, respectively.\n\nBetween A and B, I think Anscombe is highlighting that Sidgwick's view relies on actual consequences to assess the badness of an action.\n\nBut perhaps she is critiquing this aspect of his view.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she is saying that Sidgwick's view considers the badness based on expected consequences.\n\nI need to consider the context in which Anscombe is discussing Sidgwick.\n\nIn her essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe criticizes modern moral philosophy, particularly consequentialism, for abandoning the concept of natural law and for adopting a law-court model of ethics without a lawgiver.\n\nShe argues that consequentialism fails to account for the importance of intentions and the distinction between choiceworthy actions and actions that are right or obligatory.\n\nGiven this, it's possible that Anscombe is claiming that Sidgwick's view assesses the badness of an action based on its expected consequences, which aligns with consequentialist decision-making.\n\nHowever, in Sidgwick's work, he does consider both the actual and expected consequences.\n\nIn \"The Methods of Ethics,\" Sidgwick discusses the difference between felicific and utilitarian ethics. Felicific ethics focuses on the actual consequences, while utilitarian ethics focuses on the rules that tend to produce the greatest happiness.\n\nGiven this, it's possible that Anscombe is pointing out that Sidgwick's view estimates the badness of an action based on its actual consequences, which would be option A.\n\nBut I need to consider whether this aligns with Anscombe's critique.\n\nAnscombe argues that consequentialism makes the mistake of evaluating actions based solely on their outcomes, without considering the agent's intentions and the nature of the actions themselves.\n\nTherefore, she might be claiming that, on Sidgwick's view, the badness of an action is determined by its actual consequences, which she would likely view as a flaw in his theory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she is saying that Sidgwick's view considers the badness based on expected consequences, which would be option B.\n\nBut given her critique of consequentialism, it's possible that she is highlighting the problems with both actual and expected consequentialism.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"the badness of an action must be estimated in light of,\" which suggests that it's about how to assess the badness, probably in terms of moral evaluation.\n\nIn that case, if Sidgwick's view is that the badness is based on actual consequences, then option A would be correct.\n\nBut I need to consider the exact wording of the question.\n\n\"Anscombe claims that on Sidgwick\u2019s view, the badness of an action must be estimated in light of...\"\n\nGiven that Anscombe is critiquing Sidgwick, and given her views on ethics, it's likely that she is attributing to him a position where actual consequences are the basis for estimating the badness of an action.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A. its actual consequences.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider options C and D.\n\nC. whether it violates any duties.\n\nThis seems unlikely because Sidgwick was a utilitarian, and utilitarianism is typically opposed to deontological ethics, which focuses on duties.\n\nSimilarly, D. whether it violates divine law, doesn't align with Sidgwick's secular approach to ethics.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is A. its actual consequences.\n\nBut to make sure, I should consider if there's any evidence that Anscombe specifically mentions Sidgwick's view on actual versus expected consequences.\n\nUnfortunately, without direct access to Anscombe's text, I have to rely on my knowledge of their respective positions.\n\nGiven that, I think A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
