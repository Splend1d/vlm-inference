Symbol Table.\n\nTo provide more context, let's briefly discuss what each of these terms refers to:\n\nA. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): An AST is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code, typically produced by a parser. It represents the syntactic structure of the code but does not contain information about variables or their attributes directly.\n\nB. Attribute Grammar: This is a formal way to describe attributes of the elements in a syntax tree, which can be used to define the semantics of a programming language. Attributes can hold various kinds of information, including those related to variables, but the term itself refers to a method of attaching properties to syntax tree nodes, not specifically to managing variable information.\n\nC. Symbol Table: This is a data structure that contains a record of identifiers in a program and additional information about them, such as type, scope, memory location, etc. It is crucial for tasks like name resolution, type checking, and code generation.\n\nD. Semantic Stack: This term is not standard in compiler terminology. It might refer to a stack used during semantic analysis to keep track of certain information, but it is not specifically designated for managing variable information in the same way a symbol table is.\n\nHence, among the given options, the symbol table is the correct choice for managing information about variables and their attributes in a compiler."
