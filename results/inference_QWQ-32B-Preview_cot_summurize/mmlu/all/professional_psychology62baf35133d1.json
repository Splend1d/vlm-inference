                    "text": "Cluster sampling is a probability sampling technique where the population is divided into groups, or clusters, and a random sample of these clusters is selected for study. The key aspect of cluster sampling is that the sampling unit is a naturally occurring group rather than an individual member of the population. This method is often used when it is difficult or costly to compile a complete list of all individuals in the population, but it is easier to list and sample clusters.\n\nIn cluster sampling, the entire cluster is included in the sample once a cluster is selected. For example, if you are studying student behavior in schools, you might select several schools (clusters) at random and then include all students within those selected schools in your study.\n\nThis approach can enhance external validity by ensuring that the sample reflects the diversity of the population, as clusters are chosen randomly and may include a variety of subgroups. However, it's important to note that cluster sampling can sometimes lead to higher sampling error if the clusters are not homogeneous, which might affect the precision of the estimates.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. ensures the sample is representative of the population\n\nB. ensures proportional representation\n\nC. sampling unit is a naturally occurring group\n\nD. subjects and/or experimenter do no know purpose or which group they are in\n\nThe correct answer is C. sampling unit is a naturally occurring group.\n\nOption A is partially correct in that cluster sampling aims for representativeness, but it's not the defining feature. Option B refers to proportional representation, which is more associated with stratified sampling. Option D describes blind studies, which is a concept in experimental design, not related to sampling methods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
