The question is asking which of the options did NOT increase federal government power during that time. The options are the War Industries Board, the Food Administration, the Espionage Act, and the Dawes Plan.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these was and how they relate to federal power during WWI.\n\nStarting with the War Industries Board (Option A). I remember that this was established in 1917 to coordinate the production of war supplies. It basically managed the production and distribution of materials needed for the war effort. So, it had a lot of control over industries and resources, which definitely increased federal government power.\n\nNext, the Food Administration (Option B). This was headed by Herbert Hoover before he became president. Its goal was to manage the production, distribution, and conservation of food both for the military and for allied nations. Again, this involved a lot of regulation and control over agriculture and food industries, so it also increased federal power.\n\nThen, the Espionage Act (Option C). This was passed in 1917 and later expanded by the Sedition Act of 1918. These laws were meant to prevent interference with the war effort and to punish espionage and sabotage. They also restricted freedom of speech to some extent by making it illegal to criticize the government's war policies. So, this act increased federal power by limiting certain civil liberties and expanding government authority to prosecute dissent.\n\nNow, the Dawes Plan (Option D). I think this was related to post-World War I Germany, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think... I recall that after the war, there were issues with Germany's ability to pay war reparations. The Dawes Plan was proposed in 1924 as a way to manage these reparations by providing loans to Germany from the United States and other countries, which would then help Germany pay its reparations to the Allies.\n\nIf that's the case, then the Dawes Plan was more about managing post-war economic relations and didn't directly increase federal government power during World War I itself. It came after the war, in 1924, which is several years after WWI ended in 1918.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, the War Industries Board, the Food Administration, and the Espionage Act were all implemented during WWI and increased federal government power by controlling industries, managing resources, and limiting certain freedoms, respectively.\n\nThe Dawes Plan, on the other hand, was a post-war initiative aimed at addressing the economic consequences of the war, particularly regarding war reparations. Therefore, it didn't directly increase federal government power during World War I.\n\nHence, the correct answer should be Option D, the Dawes Plan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
