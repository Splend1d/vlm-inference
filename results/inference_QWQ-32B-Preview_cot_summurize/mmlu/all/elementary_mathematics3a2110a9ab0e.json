                    "text": "So I have this equation to solve: 1.2 equals 0.4 times y. I need to find out what y is. Let's see, I need to get y by itself on one side of the equation. So, I think I should divide both sides by 0.4 to isolate y.\n\nSo, y equals 1.2 divided by 0.4. Hmm, dividing decimals can be a bit tricky in my head, but I think I can manage. Maybe I can think of it in terms of fractions or something.\n\nAlternatively, I know that 0.4 is the same as 4 tenths, so 0.4y equals 1.2 means that 4 tenths of y is 1.2. So, to find y, I need to find the whole amount. If 4 tenths is 1.2, then one tenth would be 1.2 divided by 4, which is 0.3. Therefore, y, which is 10 tenths, would be 0.3 times 10, which is 3.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, y equals 3. Let me check if that's correct by plugging it back into the original equation. 0.4 times 3 is indeed 1.2. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to think about it. Maybe I can multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to eliminate the decimals. So, 1.2 times 10 is 12, and 0.4 times 10 is 4. So now, the equation is 12 equals 4y. Then, y equals 12 divided by 4, which is 3. Same answer.\n\nAnother way could be to think of 0.4 as a fraction, which is 2/5. So, the equation is 1.2 equals (2/5)y. To solve for y, I can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2. So, y equals 1.2 times 5/2. Let's calculate that: 1.2 times 5 is 6, and 6 divided by 2 is 3. Again, y equals 3.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer is y equals 3.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 1.6\n\nB. -3\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 3\n\nThe correct choice is D. 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
