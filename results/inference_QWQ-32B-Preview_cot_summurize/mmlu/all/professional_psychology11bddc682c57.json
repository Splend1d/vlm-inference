                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about when stranger anxiety typically starts in children. The options are 2-3 months, 4-6 months, 8-10 months, or 12-14 months. I need to remember what I've learned about child development.\n\nStranger anxiety is when a child gets upset or cries when around people they don't know well. I think it has something to do with their understanding of who is familiar and who isn't. I recall that babies start to recognize their caregivers early on, like in the first few months, but when does the wariness of strangers kick in?\n\nLet me think about my own experiences. When I used to babysit, I noticed that some infants weren't bothered by strangers at all; they'd smile at anyone. But as they got older, around 6 or 7 months, some would start to get fussy when someone they didn't know tried to hold them. So maybe it's around 6 months or so.\n\nWait, the options don't have 6 months exactly. The closest is 4 to 6 months or 8 to 10 months. Hmm. Maybe it starts a bit later.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that stranger anxiety is part of a child's social development, and it's related to their growing awareness of who is a familiar face and who isn't. It's like they're starting to understand that some people are their parents or regular caregivers, and others are unknown.\n\nPerhaps it coincides with other developmental milestones, like sitting up or crawling. When children start to move around more, they might become more aware of their environment and the people in it.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. 2 to 3 months: That seems really young. At that age, babies are smiling at everyone and seem pretty indiscriminate in their affection. I don't think stranger anxiety starts that early.\n\nB. 4 to 6 months: This could be possible. Around 4 months, babies start to smile more selectively and may show preferences for familiar faces. Maybe stranger anxiety begins to emerge around this time.\n\nC. 8 to 10 months: This also seems plausible. By 8 months, babies are more mobile and interacting with their environment more. They might become more attached to their primary caregivers and therefore more wary of strangers.\n\nD. 12 to 14 months: That's getting into the toddler stage. By then, children are more independent and may have stronger attachments to their parents. Maybe stranger anxiety peaks around this time.\n\nBut the question is about when it begins, not when it's at its peak. So perhaps it starts earlier.\n\nI think I need to recall the typical timeline for stranger anxiety. I believe it usually starts around 8 months and can last until about 2 years of age. So, 8 to 10 months sounds right.\n\nWait, but option B is 4 to 6 months. Maybe some children show signs of stranger anxiety earlier.\n\nI found a article once that said that some babies can show signs of stranger anxiety as early as 4 months, but it's more common around 8 months. So, it might vary.\n\nMaybe the answer is C, 8 to 10 months, as that seems to be the typical age when stranger anxiety becomes more prominent.\n\nBut to be sure, I should consider why stranger anxiety occurs. It's thought to be related to the development of object permanence and understanding that people can disappear and reappear. When babies realize that someone unknown is present, they might feel threatened because they don't know the person.\n\nPiaget's theory mentions that object permanence is achieved around 8 months, which aligns with option C.\n\nAdditionally, attachment theory suggests that babies become more attached to their primary caregivers around this time, which could lead to wariness of strangers.\n\nOn the other hand, some children might show signs of stranger anxiety earlier or later, depending on their individual development and their environment.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking for the average or most common age when stranger anxiety begins.\n\nGiven that, I think 8 to 10 months is the best answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf I look at option D, 12 to 14 months, that's when children are becoming more independent and starting to walk. They might have separation anxiety in addition to stranger anxiety.\n\nBut the question is about when stranger anxiety begins, and I think it starts earlier than 12 months.\n\nOption A, 2 to 3 months, is probably too early, as babies at that age are still in the stages of smiling at everyone and aren't yet distinguishing between familiar and unfamiliar people in the same way.\n\nOption B, 4 to 6 months, might be when some\u521d\u6b65 signs appear, but full-blown stranger anxiety is more likely to occur later.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with C, 8 to 10 months, as the beginning of when stranger anxiety typically starts in children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
