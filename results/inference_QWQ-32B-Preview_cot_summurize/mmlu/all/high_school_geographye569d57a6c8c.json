                    "text": "The two major branches of Islam are Sunni and Shiite. So, the correct answer is C. Sunni and Shiite.\n\nTo provide some more context, Islam is divided into different sects, but the two main ones are Sunni and Shiite. Sunnis make up the largest branch, comprising about 85-90% of Muslims worldwide. Shiites make up the second largest branch, with the remaining 10-15% of Muslims.\n\nThe split between Sunnis and Shiites occurred after the death of the Prophet Muhammad over a disagreement on who should lead the Muslim community. Sunnis believed that the new leader should be elected from among qualified candidates, while Shiites believed that leadership should remain within the Prophet's bloodline.\n\nToday, both Sunnis and Shiites share the same core beliefs and practices of Islam, such as the Five Pillars, but they have some differences in religious practices and interpretations of Islamic teachings.\n\nOption A mentions Sunni and Shinto, but Shinto is not a branch of Islam; it's an indigenous religion of Japan. Option B mentions Shinto and Shiite, which again includes Shinto, which is not related to Islam. Option D mentions Shamanism and Shiite; Shamanism is an ancient spiritual practice found in various cultures and is not a branch of Islam.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. Sunni and Shiite.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
