Judaism and Buddhism\n\nC. Hinduism and Buddhism\n\nD. Christianity and Buddhism\n\nI need to figure out which pair consists of religions that are both universalizing. First, I should probably understand what a universalizing religion is.\n\nFrom what I recall, universalizing religions are those that aim to appeal to all people, not just those from a particular ethnic group or region. They actively seek converts and spread their beliefs beyond their original cultural boundaries. On the other hand, there are ethnic or traditional religions that are more closely tied to a specific culture or geography and don't proselytize as aggressively.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let's look at each option.\n\nOption A is Islam and Judaism. I know that Islam is definitely a universalizing religion; it has spread all over the world through conversion and migration. Judaism, however, is more closely associated with the Jewish ethnicity and while there are conversions, it's not typically seen as a religion that actively seeks to convert everyone. So, in this pair, only Islam is universally proselytizing, whereas Judaism is more ethnic-based.\n\nOption B is Judaism and Buddhism. Again, Judaism is more ethnic, as I just mentioned. Buddhism, interestingly, has spread beyond its origins in India to become a major religion in East and Southeast Asia, and it does accept converts. So, Buddhism is universalizing, but Judaism is not.\n\nOption C is Hinduism and Buddhism. Hinduism is primarily practiced in India and is closely tied to the culture and social structure there, although it's not strictly ethnic in the same way Judaism is because it does accept converts, albeit not through active proselytization. However, some scholars consider Hinduism more of an ethnic or regional religion. Buddhism, as I said earlier, is universalizing. So, in this pair, only Buddhism is universally proselytizing.\n\nOption D is Christianity and Buddhism. Both of these religions have spread widely beyond their places of origin. Christianity began in the Middle East but has become global, with active missions and conversions. Buddhism originated in India but has spread to many other parts of the world through conversion and migration. Therefore, both Christianity and Buddhism are universalizing religions.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that option D is the correct answer because both Christianity and Buddhism are universalizing religions.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the other options again.\n\nOption A: Islam is universalizing, but Judaism is not.\n\nOption B: Buddhism is universalizing, but Judaism is not.\n\nOption C: Buddhism is universalizing, but Hinduism is more ethnic or regional.\n\nOption D: Both Christianity and Buddhism are universalizing.\n\nYes, option D seems to be the right choice.\n\nIt's worth noting that sometimes classifications can vary depending on the scholar or the context, but based on general understanding, this should be correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
