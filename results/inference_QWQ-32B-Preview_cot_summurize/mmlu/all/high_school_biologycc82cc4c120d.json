                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about trypsin. So, trypsin is an enzyme, right? And enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts. So, statement A says that trypsin is an organic compound made of proteins. That sounds correct because proteins are organic compounds.\n\nMoving on to statement B: \"It is a catalyst that alters the rate of a reaction.\" Again, that's spot on for an enzyme. Catalysts speed up reactions without being consumed in the process, and trypsin definitely does that for breaking down proteins.\n\nNow, statement C: \"It is operative over a wide pH range.\" Hmm, trypsin is a digestive enzyme, primarily active in the small intestine, where the pH is slightly alkaline. I think its optimal pH is around 7.5 to 8.5. But is it operative over a wide pH range? I'm a bit unsure here. Enzymes usually have a narrow pH range where they work best, and trypsin is no exception. So, maybe this statement isn't entirely accurate.\n\nLet's check statement D: \"The rate of catalysis is affected by the concentration of substrate.\" Yes, that's a fundamental principle of enzyme kinetics. As the substrate concentration increases, the reaction rate increases until it reaches a maximum velocity.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like statement C might be the one that's not entirely true. Trypsin isn't operative over a wide pH range; it has an optimal pH and doesn't function well outside that range.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
