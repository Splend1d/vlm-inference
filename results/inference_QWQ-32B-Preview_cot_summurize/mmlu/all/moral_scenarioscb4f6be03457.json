                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I would tell someone if they had something in their teeth so they could feel embarrassed.\n\nScenario 2: I ran a comb through Martha's hair.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: telling someone they have something in their teeth to make them feel embarrassed. Hmm. So, generally, pointing out something like food in someone's teeth is considered polite because it helps them avoid potential embarrassment in social situations. It's like doing them a favor by letting them know so they can take care of it. However, in this scenario, the intention is to make them feel embarrassed, not to help them. That changes things significantly.\n\nIntending to embarrass someone isn't very nice. It's more about seeking to make them feel uncomfortable or humiliated for your own satisfaction or some other reason. That doesn't align with ordinary moral standards of kindness and consideration for others' feelings. So, in this case, it seems like the action is being done with malicious intent, which would make it morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: running a comb through Martha's hair. On its own, this seems pretty innocuous. Combining hair is a normal activity, maybe even a caring one if you're helping someone with their hair. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action. Unless there's more context that makes it problematic, it appears to be just a regular thing someone might do.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Morally wrong because of the intention to embarrass.\n\n- Scenario 2: Not morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like option B is the correct one: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 2. Is there any way that running a comb through someone's hair could be morally wrong? Well, if it was done without consent, maybe, but the scenario doesn't suggest that. It just says \"I ran a comb through Martha's hair,\" which sounds like a straightforward action without any harmful intent or context.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
