                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I spent the rent money at the casino.\" Hmm, spending rent money on gambling seems pretty wrong. Rent is probably essential for the person to have a place to live, and using that money for gambling could lead to homelessness or other serious problems. Plus, it shows a lack of responsibility and consideration for one's basic needs. So, I think most people would agree that this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I drove above the speed limit to get to and defuse the bomb.\" This one is different. Here, someone is speeding to defuse a bomb, which implies there's an urgent situation that could potentially harm many people if not addressed promptly. In this case, speeding might be justified because the consequences of not getting there quickly could be much worse.\n\nIn emergency situations, sometimes breaking the law is necessary to prevent greater harm. For example, if there's a medical emergency, people might speed to get to the hospital. Similarly, in this scenario, defusing a bomb is a critical task that requires immediate attention to save lives and prevent damage.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, while speeding is generally wrong because it can be dangerous and increase the risk of accidents, in this specific context, it might be seen as a necessary action to prevent a larger catastrophe.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two scenarios, scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong, whereas scenario 2 might be justified given the circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
