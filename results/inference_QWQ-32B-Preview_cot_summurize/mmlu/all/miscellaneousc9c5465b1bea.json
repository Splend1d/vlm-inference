The other options don't make sense in this context. A pestle is used for grinding things, like in a mortar and pestle set. An easel is a stand used to hold the canvas or paper while painting. And a shoe is just footwear, completely unrelated to mixing paint colors.\n\nSo, yeah, palette seems correct here."
