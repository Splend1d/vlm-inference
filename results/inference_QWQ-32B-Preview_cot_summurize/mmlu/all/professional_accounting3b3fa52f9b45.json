                    "text": "To determine which situation represents inelastic demand, we need to understand the concept of price elasticity of demand. Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded to a change in price. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \\frac{\\% \\text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\\% \\text{ change in price}}\n\\]\n\nDemand is considered inelastic if the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand is less than 1. This means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:**\n\n- Price increases by 5%, quantity demanded decreases by 3%.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price Elasticity} = \\frac{-3\\%}{5\\%} = -0.6\n\\]\n\nThe absolute value is 0.6, which is less than 1. Therefore, demand is inelastic.\n\n**Option B:**\n\n- Price increases by 4%, quantity demanded decreases by 6%.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price Elasticity} = \\frac{-6\\%}{4\\%} = -1.5\n\\]\n\nThe absolute value is 1.5, which is greater than 1. Therefore, demand is elastic.\n\n**Option C:**\n\n- Price increases by 4%, quantity demanded decreases by 4%.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price Elasticity} = \\frac{-4\\%}{4\\%} = -1\n\\]\n\nThe absolute value is 1. This is the point of unit elasticity, where percentage changes in price and quantity demanded are equal.\n\n**Option D:**\n\n- Price decreases by 3%, quantity demanded increases by 5%.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Price Elasticity} = \\frac{5\\%}{-3\\%} = -1.\\overline{6}\n\\]\n\nThe absolute value is approximately 1.67, which is greater than 1. Therefore, demand is elastic.\n\nBased on this analysis, the situation with inelastic demand is:\n\n**Option A: A 5% price increase results in a 3% decrease in the quantity demanded.**"
