Education about older adults\n\nC. Travelling to older communities\n\nD. Watching the portrayals of older adults in movies and on TV\n\nFirst, I need to think about how each of these options might affect someone's attitude toward aging and older adults.\n\nOption A is \"staying away from older adults.\" If someone avoids older adults, they might not have much interaction or understanding of their lives and experiences. This could lead to stereotypes or negative attitudes because they lack personal experiences to contradict any preconceived notions. So, staying away probably doesn't improve attitudes; it might even make them worse.\n\nOption B is \"education about older adults.\" Education can provide accurate information and dispel myths about aging. Learning about the contributions older adults make to society, their wisdom, and their capabilities can certainly improve attitudes. It helps people understand that aging is a natural part of life and that older adults have a lot to offer.\n\nOption C is \"travelling to older communities.\" This could mean visiting places where older adults live, like retirement communities or senior centers. Interacting with older adults in their own environments can provide firsthand experiences and foster empathy. It might show that older adults are active, engaged, and lead fulfilling lives. So, this seems like it could improve attitudes as well.\n\nOption D is \"watching the portrayals of older adults in movies and on TV.\" Media representations can have a big impact on attitudes. Unfortunately, older adults are often stereotyped in media as frail, forgetful, or irrelevant. If someone only gets their information about older adults from TV and movies, they might adopt these stereotypes, which wouldn't improve their attitudes. However, if the portrayals are positive and realistic, it could have a beneficial effect. But generally, media representations are not always accurate or positive.\n\nComparing all these options, education about older adults seems like the most straightforward and effective way to improve attitudes. It directly addresses misconceptions and provides accurate information. Travelling to older communities could also be very beneficial, but it might not be as accessible or practical for everyone. Staying away from older adults and relying on media portrayals are likely to perpetuate negative stereotypes.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B. Education about older adults.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
