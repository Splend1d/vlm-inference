The options are Historical, Analytical, Command, and Sociological. I need to figure out which one emphasizes logic in shaping the law.\n\nFirst, I should recall what each school focuses on:\n\n1. **Historical School**: This school looks at the evolution of law over time, considering how past legal systems and traditions have shaped current laws. It emphasizes the continuity and development of legal principles through history.\n\n2. **Analytical School**: Also known as the Philosophical or Conceptual school, this approach analyzes the basic concepts and categories of law, such as rights, duties, and obligations. It often uses logic and reason to understand and define these legal concepts.\n\n3. **Command School**: This is associated with legal positivism, particularly the idea that law is the command of the sovereign backed by sanctions. It focuses on the authoritative nature of law rather than its logical structure.\n\n4. **Sociological School**: This school examines law in the context of society, considering how social factors influence the development and application of law. It looks at law as a social institution and studies its effects on society.\n\nNow, considering these descriptions, which one specifically maintains that law is shaped by logic?\n\nThe Historical School is more concerned with the evolution of law over time, not necessarily with logic shaping it.\n\nThe Analytical School seems promising because it deals with analyzing legal concepts using logic and reason. This aligns closely with the idea that law is shaped by logic.\n\nThe Command School focuses on law as commands from the sovereign, which doesn't directly emphasize logic in shaping the law.\n\nThe Sociological School looks at law in relation to society, considering social influences rather than logical constructs.\n\nTherefore, the Analytical School appears to be the one that maintains law is shaped by logic.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me think about this again. Maybe another school incorporates logic in a significant way.\n\nThe Historical School might use logic to understand the development of law, but its primary focus is on history and tradition.\n\nThe Command School is more about authority and sovereignty, not logical reasoning in shaping law.\n\nThe Sociological School is focused on social aspects and perhaps the logical implications of law on society, but not necessarily that law is shaped by logic.\n\nThe Analytical School, on the other hand, directly applies logical analysis to legal concepts and principles. It seeks to understand law through rational inquiry and logical structuring of legal ideas.\n\nSo, it makes sense that the Analytical School would maintain that law is shaped by logic.\n\nI think the answer is B. Analytical.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
