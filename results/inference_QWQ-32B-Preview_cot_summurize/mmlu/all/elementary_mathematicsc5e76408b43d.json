                    "text": "So the vice president of sales took a client out to lunch, and the lunch cost $44. She gave a 20% tip on top of that. We need to find out how much she spent in total for the lunch.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a tip is. A tip is extra money given to service staff, like waiters, as a token of appreciation for their service. It's usually a percentage of the total bill.\n\nIn this case, the tip is 20% of the lunch cost. So, I need to calculate 20% of $44 and then add that to the original $44 to get the total amount spent.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the tip amount.\n\nTo find 20% of $44, I can multiply 44 by 20% . But I should remember that percentages need to be converted to decimals for multiplication.\n\n20% as a decimal is 0.20.\n\nSo, tip = 44 * 0.20\n\nLet me do the multiplication:\n\n44 * 0.20 = 8.80\n\nSo, the tip is $8.80.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total amount spent.\n\nTotal amount = cost of lunch + tip\n\nTotal amount = 44 + 8.80 = 52.80\n\nSo, the total amount spent is $52.80.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. $8.80\n\nB. $35.20\n\nC. $52.80\n\nD. $53.80\n\nThe correct answer is C. $52.80.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the tip calculation:\n\n20% of $44 is indeed $8.80.\n\nThen, adding the tip to the original cost:\n\n44 + 8.80 = 52.80\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can calculate the total amount by multiplying the cost of the lunch by 1 plus the tip percentage.\n\nSo, in this case, it would be 44 * (1 + 0.20) = 44 * 1.20\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n44 * 1.20 = 52.80\n\nSame result. So, C. $52.80 is correct.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A: $8.80 - this is just the tip amount, not the total spent.\n\nOption B: $35.20 - this seems too low. If she spent $44 for lunch and added a tip, the total should be more than $44, not less.\n\nOption D: $53.80 - this is close to $52.80, but it's $1 more. Maybe a calculation error, but as per my calculations, it's $52.80.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $52.80.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\$52.80} \\]"
