Hmm, I need to figure out which one isn't a cat breed.\n\nFirst, I know that Persians and Maine Coons are both cats. My grandma has a Persian cat, and I've seen Maine Coons in pet stores and on the internet. They're big and fluffy, right?\n\nTurkish Angora, I think that's also a cat breed. I've heard of Angora cats before, and I think they come from Turkey, hence the name. So, that probably is a cat breed too.\n\nNow, Bichon Frise sounds familiar, but I think it's a type of dog. I'm pretty sure I've seen Bichon Frises before; they're small, white dogs that look like powder puffs. So, maybe that's the one that's not a cat breed.\n\nTo make sure, let me double-check each option.\n\nOption A: Persian. Definitely a cat breed. They have long, silky fur and flat faces.\n\nOption B: Turkish Angora. Yes, that's a cat breed known for its silky fur and blue eyes.\n\nOption C: Bichon Frise. Ah, this is a dog breed. Small, white, fluffy dog.\n\nOption D: Maine Coon. Another cat breed, known for being one of the largest domestic cat breeds.\n\nSo, based on this, Bichon Frise is the only dog breed here, while the others are all cat breeds.\n\nWait a minute, but just to be thorough, maybe there's a cat breed I don't know about with a similar name. Is there a cat breed called Bichon Frise? I don't think so. Bichon Frise is distinctly a dog breed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a cat breed that originates from a place related to Bichon Frise, but no, Bichon Frise dogs come from the Mediterranean area, I believe.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the answer is C. Bichon Frise, because it's a dog breed, not a cat breed.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I might look up \"Bichon Frise\" quickly to confirm.\n\nOkay, according to my quick search, Bichon Frise is indeed a breed of dog, not a cat. So, my initial thought was correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Bichon Frise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
