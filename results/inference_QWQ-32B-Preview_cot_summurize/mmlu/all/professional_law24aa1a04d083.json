At the end of the trial, the judge stated findings of fact on the record but never issued a written opinion. Neither party objected to the findings.

No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.\nB.

                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this construction contractor who sued a homeowner in federal court for breach of contract. The whole issue is about what work was agreed upon in the contract. Only the contractor and the homeowner testified, and they disagreed a lot on what work was supposed to be done. After the trial, the judge made some findings of fact orally but didn't write anything down. Neither side objected to those findings, and the judge ruled in favor of the homeowner. Now, the contractor is appealing, and the question is whether the appellate court is likely to overturn the findings.\n\nOption A says no, because the appellate court has to consider that the trial judge had the chance to assess the witnesses' credibility. That makes sense because trial judges often have a better sense of who is telling the truth, especially when it's just two people testifying against each other.\n\nOption B says no, because the contractor didn't object to the findings when the judge stated them. But I'm not sure if failing to object would prevent the appellate court from reviewing the findings. Maybe it's about preserving objections for appeal, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption C says yes, because a judge must write down findings of fact in a written opinion or memorandum. Hmm, in federal court, I think there are rules about how judgments should be made, but I don't remember specifics. Maybe I need to look into that.\n\nOption D says yes, because there were disputed issues of fact at trial. Well, yeah, that's pretty much always the case in trials, especially in breach of contract cases where\u53cc\u65b9\u5bf9\u5408\u540c\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, in federal court, there are rules governing how judges are supposed to make and record their findings, especially in bench trials. Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is relevant here. It says that in any nonjury civil action, the court must find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law separately. It also allows the court to direct entry of the judgment, and the findings may be stated orally on the record or in an opinion or a memorandum of decision.\n\nSo, in this case, the judge made oral findings of fact, which seem to comply with Rule 52(a), but didn't issue a written opinion. Since neither party objected, that might suggest that the procedure was acceptable.\n\nNow, on appeal, the standard of review for findings of fact in a bench trial is generally that they're reviewed for clear error. That means the appellate court will defer to the trial court's findings unless they're clearly erroneous or without substantial evidence to support them.\n\nGiven that, option A seems plausible because the appellate court should give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to assess witness credibility.\n\nOption B suggests that failing to object to the findings precludes challenging them on appeal. But in reality, failing to object might be seen as waiver only if there was a specific objection that should have been made under the rules. In this case, since the findings were oral and neither party objected, it's not clear that the contractor waived the right to challenge the findings on appeal.\n\nOption C claims that the appellate court will overturn the findings because there was no written opinion. But according to Rule 52(a), while the court is required to find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law, it can do so orally on the record. So, as long as there are adequate findings on the record, a written opinion isn't strictly necessary, although it's often preferred for clarity and reviewability.\n\nOption D says yes, because there were disputed issues of fact. But the presence of disputed issues doesn't automatically mean that the appellate court will overturn the findings. In fact, it's expected that there are disputed issues in trial, and the trial judge's role is to resolve those disputes based on the evidence and witness credibility.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most likely answer is A: No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.\n\nThis aligns with the standard of review for factual findings in bench trials, where appellate courts generally defer to the trial court's determinations, especially regarding witness credibility.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any specific rule or case law that requires written findings in federal court.\n\nLooking back at Rule 52(a), it permits the court to state findings orally, in an opinion, or in a memorandum. So, oral findings are acceptable.\n\nMoreover, in the case of Carlough v. United States, the court held that oral findings are sufficient as long as they are clear and adequate.\n\nTherefore, the appellate court is unlikely to overturn the findings simply because they were oral and not written, especially since neither party objected.\n\nAdditionally, given that the trial judge had the opportunity to assess the credibility of the contractor and the homeowner, whose testimonies were in direct conflict, the appellate court should give substantial deference to the trial judge's findings.\n\nThus, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
