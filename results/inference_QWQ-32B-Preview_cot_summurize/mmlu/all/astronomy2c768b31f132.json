The options are:\n\nA. ejecta\n\nB. raised rims\n\nC. central peaks\n\nD. A and B only\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of impact craters.\n\nEjecta are the materials that are thrown out of the crater during the impact event. Raised rims are the elevated edges around the crater. Central peaks are the mountains sometimes found in the center of larger craters.\n\nNow, the question is asking about fresh impact craters, meaning craters that haven't been eroded or altered much since their formation.\n\nI know that when an asteroid or comet hits a solid surface, it creates a crater. The energy from the impact causes material to be ejected outwards, forming the ejecta. So, it makes sense that ejecta would be a common feature.\n\nAlso, the raised rim is formed by the material that was displaced upwards and outwards by the impact. So, that should also be a common feature in fresh craters.\n\nBut what about central peaks? I recall that central peaks are more common in larger craters, especially on the Moon and other planetary bodies. They form because of the rebound of the crater floor after the initial impact.\n\nBut are central peaks present in all fresh impact craters? I think not. Smaller craters might not have central peaks because the energy of the impact isn't sufficient to cause the floor to rebound.\n\nSo, maybe A and B are common to all fresh impact craters, while C is only present in larger ones.\n\nLooking back at the options, D says A and B only, which seems to align with what I'm thinking.\n\nBut let me double-check. Are there any fresh impact craters that don't have ejecta or raised rims?\n\nI can't think of any. Even small craters should have some ejecta and a raised rim, right?\n\nOn the other hand, central peaks are more dependent on the size of the crater and the properties of the target material.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer: A and B only.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider different types of craters or different surfaces. For example, craters on ice versus rock.\n\nBut the question specifies solid surfaces, so maybe that includes rock and ice, but perhaps not softer materials like sand.\n\nStill, I believe that ejecta and raised rims are universal features of fresh impact craters on solid surfaces, while central peaks are more variable.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with D. A and B only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
