                    "text": "I've got this question here about a tax imposed by a state on nonresident photographers. Let me try to understand what's going on. So, the state has a tax that applies to nonresident photographers who run studios there. The tax is 2% on their income from the state above $12,000. And interestingly, it exempts certain income for resident photographers and nonresidents who earn income outside the state.\n\nNow, a photographer who runs a studio in this state but lives in another state is challenging the constitutionality of this tax. We need to figure out which constitutional provision would be the most applicable basis for this challenge. The options are:\n\nA. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nB. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nC. The commerce clause.\n\nD. The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV.\n\nLet me think about each one.\n\nStarting with A, the equal protection clause. This clause is about ensuring that similar individuals are treated equally under the law. So, if the tax is treating nonresident photographers differently from resident photographers, maybe there's an argument there. But I need to see if that's the most applicable.\n\nOption B is the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Due process is about the fairness of legal proceedings. Maybe the way the tax is being applied isn't fair, but I'm not sure if that's the best fit here.\n\nOption C is the commerce clause. This is in the U.S. Constitution and gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. But states also have to comply with certain restrictions when it comes to taxing interstate commerce. Since the tax is on income derived from within the state, but the photographer is a nonresident, maybe there's an issue with how states can tax activities that involve interstate commerce.\n\nOption D is the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV. This clause is about ensuring that citizens of one state aren't treated differently from citizens of another state in terms of their rights and privileges when they're in another state.\n\nGiven that the photographer is a nonresident challenging the tax, I think the most applicable provision would be the commerce clause. Here's why:\n\nThe commerce clause deals with regulations and taxes that affect interstate commerce. In this case, the photographer is a resident of another state, operating a business in this state, which involves interstate activities. The tax is based on income derived from within the state, but the photographer is a nonresident. So, there might be an argument that this tax discriminates against interstate commerce, favoring resident photographers over nonresidents.\n\nComparatively, the equal protection clause is more about discrimination within the state's own citizenry, whereas the commerce clause is about discrimination against interstate commerce.\n\nThe privileges and immunities clause might also be relevant, but it's more about individual rights as citizens of the United States, whereas the commerce clause is more directly about economic activities across state lines.\n\nSo, I think the commerce clause would be the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
