Typically, a month has about 30 days. Some months have 31 days, some have 28 or 29, but 30 is a good average.\n\nSo, if there are 30 days in a month and Rob uses 1 box every 5 days, I can divide the total days in a month by the number of days per box to find out how many boxes he uses.\n\nThat is, boxes per month = 30 days / 5 days per box = 6 boxes.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check that. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.\n\nAnother approach is to find out how many boxes Rob uses per day and then multiply by the number of days in a month.\n\nHe uses 1 box every 5 days, so per day he uses 1/5 of a box.\n\nThen, in 30 days, he would use 30 * (1/5) = 30/5 = 6 boxes.\n\nOkay, that matches the first method.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider that some months have more or fewer days. For example, in a 31-day month, he would use 31 / 5 = 6.2 boxes, which is still approximately 6.\n\nIn a 28-day month, it's 28 / 5 = 5.6 boxes, which is also close to 6.\n\nSo, overall, 6 boxes seems like a good approximation.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2 boxes\n\nB. 4 boxes\n\nC. 5 boxes\n\nD. 6 boxes\n\nThe correct answer is D. 6 boxes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
