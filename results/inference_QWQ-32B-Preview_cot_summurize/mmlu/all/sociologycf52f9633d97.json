                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option isn't a consequence of global tourism. So, first, I should understand what global tourism entails. It's basically the practice of people traveling to different parts of the world for leisure, adventure, or cultural experiences. Now, tourism has both positive and negative impacts on the destinations and the local communities.\n\nOption A says \"decreased rates of prostitution and sex tourism.\" Hmm, that seems a bit off. I've heard that in some places, tourism can actually lead to an increase in prostitution and sex tourism because there's a demand from some tourists for these services. So, if tourism is bringing in more people who are looking for sexual services, that could potentially increase prostitution in those areas. Therefore, decreased rates don't seem like a direct consequence of global tourism.\n\nOption B says \"developing countries can depend on it as a crucial source of income.\" That sounds accurate. Many developing countries rely heavily on tourism as a major source of foreign exchange and employment. For example, countries like Thailand, Cambodia, and Egypt have thriving tourism industries that contribute significantly to their economies.\n\nOption C mentions \"the exploitation of cheap, unregulated labor in poor countries.\" Again, this seems plausible. In the tourism industry, there might be a tendency to exploit local labor, paying low wages and providing poor working conditions, especially in places where regulations are lax. This can be seen in sectors like hospitality, transportation, and tourism-related services.\n\nOption D says \"we have become more aware of 'other' societies and ways of living.\" This is probably a positive consequence of tourism. When people travel to different parts of the world, they get exposed to diverse cultures, traditions, and ways of life. This can foster greater understanding and appreciation of cultural differences.\n\nSo, considering all these points, option A seems to be the odd one out. It's suggesting that global tourism leads to decreased rates of prostitution and sex tourism, which contradicts what I've read and heard about the subject. Usually, tourism is associated with an increase in such activities due to the demand from some tourists.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps in some places, tourism has led to efforts to combat prostitution and sex tourism, resulting in decreased rates. For example, there might be awareness campaigns or stricter law enforcement in tourist areas to prevent exploitation. But even then, it's not a universal consequence, and compared to the other options, it seems less directly linked to global tourism.\n\nIn contrast, options B, C, and D all seem like direct consequences of global tourism: economic dependence, labor exploitation, and cultural awareness, respectively. Therefore, I would say that option A is not a consequence of global tourism, or at least not a primary or universal one.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
