It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, there's this 25-year-old concert pianist who lives in a small studio apartment in the city. She can't keep a piano there because it's too small, so she has to travel to a school of performing arts to practice every day. She decides to move to a bigger place in the county where she can have her own piano.\n\nShe finds a house in the county that she likes and puts a bid on it through the seller's broker. But the owner is in Europe on a business trip and won't consider any offers until he returns. While waiting for the owner to come back, her friend agrees to sell his piano to her for $8,000. However, the pianist only wants the piano if she succeeds in buying the county home. So, they agree that the piano sale won't take effect unless she buys that house.\n\nThe next day, they put their oral agreement into a written contract and signed it, but they forgot to include the condition about the house in the written agreement. It only says that the friend will sell the piano to the pianist for $8,000.\n\nTwo weeks later, the owner of the county property comes back from his trip and rejects the pianist's offer. So, she didn't get the house. Now, her friend is suing her for breach of contract to buy the piano.\n\nThe question is: How should the court rule on the pianist's offer to prove, over the friend's objection, that she hasn't been able to buy the county home?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement did not become a contract.\n\nB. The evidence is admissible to show frustration of the purpose of the contract.\n\nC. The evidence is barred because the oral agreement is within the statute of frauds.\n\nD. The evidence is barred because the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, which is unconditional on its face.\n\nOkay, let's analyze this.\n\nFirst, there was an oral agreement between the pianist and her friend about the piano sale being conditional on her buying the county home. Then, they put it in writing, but forgot to include that condition in the written agreement.\n\nNow, the written agreement just says that the friend will sell the piano to the pianist for $8,000, without any conditions. But they had previously agreed orally that the sale was conditional on her buying the house.\n\nSo, the pianist wants to introduce evidence that she didn't buy the house, to show that the condition wasn't met, and therefore, the contract shouldn't be enforced against her.\n\nThe friend is objecting to this evidence, probably arguing that the written agreement is the final deal and it doesn't have any conditions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the court should allow the pianist to present this evidence.\n\nOption A says the evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement did not become a contract.\n\nHmm, that seems interesting. If the condition wasn't met, maybe the contract never came into existence.\n\nOption B suggests that the evidence is admissible to show frustration of the purpose of the contract.\n\nFrustration of purpose is a legal doctrine that excuses performance when an event occurs that destroys the fundamental reason for the contract, through no fault of either party.\n\nIn this case, the pianist's purpose for buying the piano was to have it in her new county home. Since she didn't get the house, her purpose is frustrated.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies here, because it's more about the condition precedent not being met.\n\nOption C says the evidence is barred because the oral agreement is within the statute of frauds.\n\nThe statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, especially contracts that can't be performed within one year or involve the transfer of interest in real estate.\n\nHere, the oral agreement was about selling a piano, which is personal property, and probably can be performed within a year. So, maybe the statute of frauds doesn't apply here.\n\nOption D says the evidence is barred because the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, which is unconditional on its face.\n\nThis seems plausible because the written agreement doesn't include the condition, so introducing evidence of an oral condition that contradicts the written agreement might not be allowed due to the parol evidence rule.\n\nThe parol evidence rule generally prohibits introducing oral or written statements made prior to or at the time of the written contract to contradict the written terms.\n\nBut there might be exceptions, especially if the parties intended the written agreement to include all terms.\n\nSo, in this case, since the written agreement doesn't mention the condition, and it's unconditional, perhaps the parol evidence rule would bar introducing the oral condition.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nWas there a meeting of the minds regarding the condition?\n\nInitially, orally, they agreed that the sale was conditional on her buying the house.\n\nThen, they wrote down an agreement that doesn't include that condition.\n\nDid they intend for the written agreement to supersede the oral one?\n\nOr did they just forget to include the condition in the written agreement?\n\nIf they intended the written agreement to be the final and complete contract, then perhaps the oral condition is no longer applicable.\n\nAlternatively, if the written agreement was meant to incorporate all previous agreements, including the oral condition, then maybe the condition still applies.\n\nBut since it's not written in the agreement, it might be tough to prove.\n\nAlso, considering that the friend is now suing for breach, and the written agreement doesn't have the condition, the pianist needs to defend by saying that there was an unincorporated oral condition that should be considered.\n\nBut according to the parol evidence rule, evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict the written contract may be inadmissible.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to the parol evidence rule, such as to show fraud, duress, or that the written agreement is incomplete or not the final agreement.\n\nIn this case, the pianist might argue that the written agreement is incomplete because it missed the conditional term that was agreed upon orally.\n\nBut again, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the oral condition can be considered as a condition subsequent that voids the contract if the condition isn't met.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nLet me consider option A again: the evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement did not become a contract.\n\nThis seems interesting.\n\nIf the condition wasn't met, then perhaps the contract never came into existence.\n\nBut in contract law, conditions usually relate to performance, not to the formation of the contract.\n\nMaybe it's more about the contract being conditional on the occurrence of a certain event.\n\nIn this case, the oral agreement set a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the contract.\n\nBut since the written agreement doesn't include that condition, it's unclear whether the condition is still part of the agreement.\n\nPerhaps the written agreement superseded the oral one, and therefore, the condition is no longer part of the agreement.\n\nIf that's the case, then the pianist is bound by the written agreement, which is unconditional, and she would be in breach if she doesn't buy the piano.\n\nAlternatively, if the oral condition is still part of the agreement, then the condition hasn't been met, and she shouldn't be required to buy the piano.\n\nBut again, the parol evidence rule might prevent her from introducing evidence of the oral condition.\n\nOption B mentions frustration of purpose.\n\nFrustration of purpose is different from impossibility or impracticability.\n\nIt occurs when an event destroys the fundamental purpose of the contract, and it's not due to any party's fault.\n\nIn this case, the pianist's purpose was to have a piano in her new home, but since she didn't get the home, her purpose is frustrated.\n\nHowever, frustration of purpose is a defense that discharges both parties from their obligations.\n\nBut in this scenario, the friend is suing the pianist for breach, so perhaps the pianist could raise frustration of purpose as a defense.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly related to the evidence she wants to introduce about not buying the house.\n\nOption C says the evidence is barred because the oral agreement is within the statute of frauds.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the statute of frauds typically applies to certain types of contracts, like those that can't be performed within one year or involve the transfer of real estate.\n\nSince this is a sale of a piano, which is personal property, and presumably could be performed within a reasonable time, maybe the statute of frauds doesn't apply here.\n\nTherefore, option C might not be correct.\n\nOption D says the evidence is barred because the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, which is unconditional on its face.\n\nThis seems like the most plausible answer.\n\nThe parol evidence rule generally prevents introducing oral evidence to contradict the written terms of a contract.\n\nSince the written agreement doesn't include the condition, and it's unconditional, introducing evidence of an oral condition that contradicts this would not be allowed.\n\nTherefore, the court should bar the evidence.\n\nBut wait, there might be exceptions.\n\nFor example, if the written agreement is intended to be the complete and final expression of the agreement between the parties, then parol evidence is generally excluded.\n\nHowever, if there's an allegation that the written agreement is incomplete or that there are additional terms that were not included in writing, then perhaps parol evidence could be admitted.\n\nIn this case, the pianist is trying to introduce evidence of an additional term \u2013 the condition precedent regarding the purchase of the house.\n\nBut since the written agreement doesn't include this condition, and it's unconditional, the parol evidence rule would likely bar this evidence.\n\nTherefore, option D seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether there's any other legal principle that might allow the introduction of this evidence.\n\nPerhaps if the written agreement is ambiguous, parol evidence can be introduced to clarify the ambiguity.\n\nBut here, the written agreement is unconditional on its face, so there's no ambiguity regarding the condition.\n\nAlternatively, if the parties did not intend the written agreement to be the final and complete expression of their agreement, then perhaps parol evidence could be admitted.\n\nBut without any indication of that, it's unlikely.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the evidence is barred because the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, which is unconditional on its face.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider option A again: the evidence is admissible to show that the written agreement did not become a contract.\n\nThis seems contradictory because the written agreement exists and appears to be a valid contract.\n\nIf the written agreement is complete and unconditional, then the evidence that the condition wasn't met doesn't affect its status as a contract.\n\nThe contract exists, but if there's a condition that wasn't met, that might affect its enforceability or the obligations under it, but it's still a contract.\n\nTherefore, option A doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption B, about frustration of purpose, might be a defense to non-performance, but it's not directly related to the admissibility of evidence regarding the condition.\n\nMoreover, frustration of purpose is a doctrine that discharges both parties from their obligations, which might not align with the friend's position in suing for breach.\n\nOption C, regarding the statute of frauds, seems inapplicable because the contract is for the sale of a piano, which doesn't fall under the typical categories requiring a written agreement.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is D: the evidence is barred because the oral agreement would contradict the written agreement, which is unconditional on its face.\n\nThis aligns with the parol evidence rule, which generally prevents introducing oral evidence to contradict the terms of a written contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
