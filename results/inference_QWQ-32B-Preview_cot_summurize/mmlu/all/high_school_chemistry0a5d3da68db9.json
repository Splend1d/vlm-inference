For example, if everything is in the gas phase or everything is in the aqueous phase.\n\nA heterogeneous reaction, on the other hand, involves reactants in different phases. So, there's at least one reactant in a different phase from the others.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. 2C2H2(g) + 5O2(g) \u2192 4CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)\n\nHere, all reactants and products are in the gas phase. So, this is a homogeneous reaction.\n\nB. C2H5OH(aq) + O2(aq) \u2192 HC2H3O2(aq) + H2O(aq)\n\nIn this case, all substances are in the aqueous phase. So, this is also a homogeneous reaction.\n\nC. C(s) + H2O(g) \u2192 H2(g) + CO(g)\n\nHere, we have solid carbon reacting with gaseous water to produce hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide gas. So, we have a solid and gases involved, which means different phases. This suggests a heterogeneous reaction.\n\nD. C2H2(g) + 5N2O(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(g) + 5N2(g)\n\nAll reactants and products are in the gas phase, so this is a homogeneous reaction.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C involves reactants in different phases (solid and gas), which makes it a heterogeneous reaction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
