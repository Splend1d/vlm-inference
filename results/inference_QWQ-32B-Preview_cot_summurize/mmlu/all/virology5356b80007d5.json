Let's look at each option to understand why:\n\nA. By hygiene: While maintaining good hygiene practices can help prevent the spread of many diseases, measles is highly contagious and can spread through the air via coughs and sneezes. Hygiene alone is not sufficient to control measles effectively.\n\nB. By MMR vaccine: The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. It is highly effective, with two doses providing immunity to about 99% of recipients. This vaccine has been instrumental in reducing measles cases worldwide.\n\nC. By new molecular peptide vaccines: While research is ongoing in developing new types of vaccines, including peptide vaccines, these are not yet widely used for measles control. The traditional MMR vaccine remains the standard.\n\nD. By humanised monoclonal antibodies to F protein: Monoclonal antibodies can provide passive immunity, but they are not a practical method for widespread measles control due to cost and logistical challenges. Vaccination with MMR is more feasible and effective for population-level immunity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. By MMR vaccine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
