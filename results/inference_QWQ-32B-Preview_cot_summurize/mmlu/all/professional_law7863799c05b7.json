After six months, the lawyer was very impressed with the law student's work. He called the law student into his office and told him, \"I know you were only to work for me for six months in exchange for credit in your law school extemship program. However, I'd like you to stay on as a clerk. I'll pay you $25 an hour for any work you do for me between now and the bar exam. In addition, if you put in a minimum of 10 hours per week during that time, I promise to hire you full-time as an associate when you pass the bar exam. \" The attorney then reduced this agreement to writing, which both he and the law student signed. The law student continued to work for the lawyer throughout the rest of his law school career and while he was studying for the bar exam. During that time, the law student always worked a minimum of 10 hours per week. While the law student was awaiting the results of the bar exam, his uncle passed away and left him a large apartment building. The law student decided he did not want to practice law but wanted to spend all of his time managing the apartment building. He told his roommate, a fellow law student who was awaiting his bar results, about his plans and told the roommate he would assign to the roommate the right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate, in exchange for $100. The roommate paid the $100 to the law student, who then executed a written assignment of the right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate. The roommate passed the bar exam, but the lawyer refused to hire him as an associate. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the legal effect of this assignment?\n\nA. The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment so that the roommate would be entitled to be hired as an associate.\nB. The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but would be entitled to demand adequate assurances of performance from the roommate as to the latter's willingness and professional capacity to perform satisfactory work.\nC.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which option is the most accurate regarding the legal effect of the assignment in this scenario. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a law student who worked as a clerk for a lawyer. After six months, the lawyer offered to keep the student on, paying $25 an hour, and promising to hire the student full-time as an associate once they pass the bar exam, provided the student works at least 10 hours per week until then. Both parties signed a written agreement outlining this.\n\nThe law student continued to work as agreed, putting in at least 10 hours per week. Then, before finding out the bar exam results, the student inherited a large apartment building from their uncle and decided not to practice law but to manage the building instead.\n\nSo, the student wanted to assign their right to be hired as an associate to their roommate, who was also a law student awaiting bar results, in exchange for $100. The roommate paid the $100, and the student assigned the right in writing. The roommate passed the bar exam, but the lawyer refused to hire him as an associate.\n\nNow, we need to determine the legal effect of this assignment. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment so that the roommate would be entitled to be hired as an associate.\n\nThis seems straightforward, but I need to consider if rights under a personal service contract are assignable.\n\nB. The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but would be entitled to demand adequate assurances of performance from the roommate as to the latter's willingness and professional capacity to perform satisfactory work.\n\nThis option suggests that while the assignment is valid, the lawyer can still assess the roommate's abilities.\n\nC. The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment of rights, because a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not an assignment.\n\nThis seems to be talking about the timing of the assignment, but in this case, the assignment was made after the original contract was in place.\n\nD. The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because neither the rights nor the duties under a personal service contract are properly assignable.\n\nThis option questions whether the rights and duties in a personal service contract can be assigned.\n\nLet me think about this. In contract law, the general rule is that assignments of contractual rights are permissible unless there is a specific prohibition against assignment, or the assignment would materially change the obligor's duty or risk making performance more difficult.\n\nIn this scenario, the original contract was between the lawyer and the law student, whereby the student agreed to work a certain number of hours in exchange for the promise of being hired as an associate upon passing the bar exam.\n\nNow, the student is assigning their right to be hired as an associate to their roommate. The roommate has paid for this right and has passed the bar exam.\n\nFirst, is the right to be hired as an associate assignable?\n\nPersonal service contracts are contracts that require the performance of specific individuals due to their unique skills, talents, or reputation. Generally, duties under personal service contracts are not assignable because the party who is to perform the service is chosen based on their particular qualities.\n\nHowever, in this case, the assignment is of the right to be hired, not the duty to perform the associate's duties.\n\nWait, actually, being hired as an associate implies both rights and duties. The right to be hired comes with the obligation to perform as an associate.\n\nSo, is this an assignment of a right or an delegation of duty?\n\nPerhaps it's both. By assigning the right to be hired, the student is also delegating the duty to perform as an associate to the roommate.\n\nIn contract law, assignments typically involve the transfer of rights, while delegations involve the transfer of duties.\n\nSo, in this case, the student is trying to assign their right to be hired and delegate the duty to perform as an associate to the roommate.\n\nNow, assignments of rights are generally permitted unless there is a specific prohibition in the contract or the assignment would materially change the obligor's duty.\n\nIn this case, the obligor is the lawyer, and the obligation is to hire the student as an associate upon passing the bar exam and fulfilling the work requirement.\n\nIf the student assigns this right to the roommate, does that materially change the lawyer's duty?\n\nWell, the lawyer is now being asked to hire someone else instead of the original party. The lawyer may have had expectations or reliance on hiring the original student based on their work performance and relationship.\n\nMoreover, being an associate often involves specific expectations regarding the associate's abilities, compatibility with the firm, and so on.\n\nSo, assigning the right to be hired might indeed materially change the lawyer's duty, as they would be required to hire someone other than the original party, who may not meet the same expectations.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that such an assignment is not permitted.\n\nOption D seems to suggest that neither the rights nor the duties under a personal service contract are properly assignable.\n\nGiven that this appears to be a personal service contract, where the lawyer is promising to hire the student based on their specific qualities and performance, it's likely that both rights and duties are closely tied to the individual.\n\nTherefore, assigning the right to be hired and delegating the duty to perform as an associate may not be permissible.\n\nOption C mentions that a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not an assignment. However, in this case, the assignment was made after the original contract was in place, so that might not be directly applicable.\n\nOption B suggests that the assignment is valid, but the lawyer can demand assurances of performance from the assignee. But if the assignment is not permissible in the first place due to the nature of the personal service contract, then this may not be applicable.\n\nOption A simply states that the lawyer must recognize the assignment, but again, given the nature of the contract, this may not be accurate.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most accurate statement regarding the legal effect of this assignment: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because neither the rights nor the duties under a personal service contract are properly assignable.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because neither the rights nor the duties under a personal service contract are properly assignable."
