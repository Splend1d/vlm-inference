                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Mg(OH)2 being dissolved in 500 mL of water at 25\u00b0C until it's fully saturated. Then, we're adding 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl to this solution, and we need to figure out what happens next.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some things about solubility and equilibrium. Mg(OH)2 is a sparingly soluble salt, which means it doesn't dissolve completely in water. Instead, it establishes an equilibrium between its solid form and its dissolved ions. The solubility product constant, or Ksp, describes this equilibrium.\n\nThe dissociation of Mg(OH)2 in water can be written as:\n\nMg(OH)2(s) \u21cc Mg2+(aq) + 2OH-(aq)\n\nThe Ksp expression for this is:\n\nKsp = [Mg2+][OH-]^2\n\nAt 25\u00b0C, the Ksp for Mg(OH)2 is a known value, but I don't remember it off the top of my head. Maybe I should look it up, but perhaps I can solve this without the exact number.\n\nNow, when we add HCl to this saturated solution, HCl being a strong acid, will dissociate completely:\n\nHCl(aq) \u2192 H+(aq) + Cl-(aq)\n\nThe H+ ions from HCl can react with the OH- ions present in the solution:\n\nH+(aq) + OH-(aq) \u2192 H2O(l)\n\nThis reaction will consume some of the OH- ions in the solution. According to Le Chatelier's principle, when we remove OH- ions by reacting them with H+, the equilibrium for the dissolution of Mg(OH)2 will shift to the right to replace the consumed OH- ions. In other words, more Mg(OH)2 will dissolve to restore the equilibrium.\n\nSo, adding HCl should cause more Mg(OH)2 to dissolve, not precipitate. That suggests that options A and B might not be correct.\n\nOption A says MgCl2 precipitates. I don't see why MgCl2 would precipitate here. MgCl2 is generally soluble in water, and in fact, if more Mg(OH)2 dissolves, we'd have more Mg2+ ions in solution, which could potentially react with Cl- ions, but since MgCl2 is soluble, it shouldn't precipitate.\n\nOption B says Mg(OH)2 precipitates. But according to Le Chatelier's principle, adding HCl should cause more Mg(OH)2 to dissolve, not precipitate.\n\nOption C says the Ksp for Mg(OH)2 increases. Ksp is a temperature-dependent constant, and since the temperature remains at 25\u00b0C, the Ksp shouldn't change.\n\nOption D says [H2O] increases. Well, water is the solvent, and its concentration doesn't change significantly with the addition of small amounts of solute. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think about the reaction more carefully. When HCl is added, it reacts with OH- to form water, effectively reducing the OH- concentration. According to the Ksp expression, if [OH-] decreases, [Mg2+] can increase to keep Ksp constant. Therefore, more Mg(OH)2 should dissolve to increase [Mg2+] and compensate for the decreased [OH-].\n\nBut let's consider the common ion effect. In this case, Cl- is being added, but Cl- doesn't directly affect the solubility of Mg(OH)2 because MgCl2 is soluble. So, the main effect is the consumption of OH- by H+.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the initial concentrations before and after adding HCl to see what happens.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many moles of HCl are being added.\n\nVolume of HCl added = 10.0 mL = 0.010 L\n\nConcentration of HCl = 0.1 M\n\nMoles of HCl added = volume \u00d7 concentration = 0.010 L \u00d7 0.1 mol/L = 0.001 mol\n\nThis will add 0.001 mol of H+ ions to the solution.\n\nNow, the initial solution is 500 mL of saturated Mg(OH)2 solution. Let's find the initial [OH-].\n\nFrom the Ksp expression:\n\nKsp = [Mg2+][OH-]^2\n\nAt saturation, [Mg2+] = s and [OH-] = 2s, where s is the molar solubility of Mg(OH)2.\n\nTherefore, Ksp = s \u00d7 (2s)^2 = 4s^3\n\nI need to look up the Ksp for Mg(OH)2 at 25\u00b0C. According to my reference, Ksp for Mg(OH)2 at 25\u00b0C is approximately 5.61 \u00d7 10^-12.\n\nSo,\n\n5.61 \u00d7 10^-12 = 4s^3\n\nSolving for s:\n\ns^3 = 5.61 \u00d7 10^-12 / 4 = 1.4025 \u00d7 10^-12\n\ns = (1.4025 \u00d7 10^-12)^(1/3) \u2248 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 M\n\nTherefore, initial [Mg2+] = 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 M\n\nInitial [OH-] = 2 \u00d7 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 M = 2.24 \u00d7 10^-4 M\n\nNow, when we add 0.001 mol of H+ to the solution, it will react with OH-:\n\nH+ + OH- \u2192 H2O\n\nThe amount of OH- initially present is:\n\n[OH-] \u00d7 volume = 2.24 \u00d7 10^-4 M \u00d7 0.500 L = 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 mol\n\nWe're adding 0.001 mol of H+, which is greater than the amount of OH- present. Therefore, all OH- will be consumed, and there will be excess H+ left.\n\nExcess H+ = 0.001 mol - 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 mol = 0.000888 mol\n\nThis excess H+ will react with more OH- , but since all initial OH- has been consumed, additional H+ will react with Mg(OH)2 solid to dissolve more of it.\n\nThe reaction can be written as:\n\nMg(OH)2(s) + 2H+(aq) \u2192 Mg2+(aq) + 2H2O(l)\n\nThis shows that adding H+ can dissolve more Mg(OH)2 by consuming OH- and shifting the equilibrium to the right.\n\nHowever, in this case, we have excess H+ after consuming all initial OH-, so more Mg(OH)2 will dissolve to react with the remaining H+.\n\nBut the question is, what happens when we add the HCl? Does anything precipitate?\n\nFrom the options:\n\nA. MgCl2 precipitates\n\nB. Mg(OH)2 precipitates\n\nC. Ksp for Mg(OH)2 increases\n\nD. [H2O] increases\n\nWe've established that adding HCl should cause more Mg(OH)2 to dissolve, not precipitate. So, option B is unlikely.\n\nOption A suggests MgCl2 precipitates. But MgCl2 is highly soluble in water, so it's unlikely to precipitate.\n\nOption C suggests that Ksp increases. But Ksp is a constant at a given temperature and doesn't change unless the temperature changes.\n\nOption D suggests that [H2O] increases. However, in aqueous solutions, the concentration of water is essentially constant, so this is not a significant change.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the reaction more quantitatively.\n\nLet's consider the moles after addition:\n\nInitial moles of OH-: 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 mol\n\nH+ added: 0.001 mol\n\nAfter reaction:\n\nOH- remaining: 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 mol - 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 mol = 0 mol\n\nH+ remaining: 0.001 mol - 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 mol = 0.000888 mol\n\nNow, the excess H+ will react with Mg(OH)2:\n\nMg(OH)2(s) + 2H+(aq) \u2192 Mg2+(aq) + 2H2O(l)\n\nMoles of Mg(OH)2 that can dissolve: 0.000888 mol / 2 = 0.000444 mol\n\nThis will increase [Mg2+] by 0.000444 mol in 0.510 L (original 0.500 L + 0.010 L added)\n\nNew [Mg2+] = (1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 mol + 0.000444 mol) / 0.510 L\n\nWait, but initially, [Mg2+] = 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 M in 0.500 L, which is 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 mol.\n\nAfter dissolving additional Mg(OH)2:\n\nMoles of Mg2+ added = 0.000444 mol\n\nTotal moles of Mg2+ = 1.12 \u00d7 10^-4 mol + 0.000444 mol = 0.000556 mol\n\nTotal volume = 0.500 L + 0.010 L = 0.510 L\n\nNew [Mg2+] = 0.000556 mol / 0.510 L \u2248 0.00109 M\n\nNow, for [OH-]:\n\nInitially, all OH- was consumed by H+, and any additional H+ is in excess.\n\nAfter reacting with Mg(OH)2:\n\nEach mole of Mg(OH)2 dissolved consumes 2 moles of H+ and produces 2 moles of OH-.\n\nWait, no. The reaction is:\n\nMg(OH)2(s) + 2H+(aq) \u2192 Mg2+(aq) + 2H2O(l)\n\nSo, for each mole of Mg(OH)2 dissolved, 2 moles of H+ are consumed, and 2 moles of OH- are consumed in the process of forming water.\n\nWait, no. The OH- from Mg(OH)2 reacts with H+ to form H2O.\n\nSo, dissolving Mg(OH)2 consumes H+, not produces OH-.\n\nTherefore, after adding HCl and reacting with all OH-, the excess H+ reacts with Mg(OH)2, dissolving it and consuming more H+.\n\nSo, the net effect is that [OH-] is reduced, and [Mg2+] is increased.\n\nBut the question is, does anything precipitate?\n\nGiven that MgCl2 is soluble, and no other insoluble salts are formed, it seems nothing precipitates.\n\nWait, but option A says MgCl2 precipitates. Maybe under these conditions, MgCl2 becomes less soluble?\n\nBut generally, MgCl2 is soluble, so it's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Mg(OH)2 starts to precipitate again if the ion product exceeds Ksp.\n\nBut according to Le Chatelier, adding H+ should shift the equilibrium to dissolve more Mg(OH)2, not precipitate it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the addition of HCl affects the pH so much that it shifts the equilibrium back towards precipitation.\n\nWait, let's think about the pH.\n\nInitially, the solution is basic because of the OH- from Mg(OH)2.\n\nAdding HCl will lower the pH by neutralizing the OH-.\n\nIf all OH- is consumed and there's excess H+, the solution becomes acidic.\n\nIn acidic conditions, Mg(OH)2 is less likely to precipitate because the OH- concentration is low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Mg(OH)2 will precipitate if the reaction goes too far.\n\nWait, no. If [OH-] is low, the ion product [Mg2+][OH-]^2 will be less than Ksp, favoring dissolution.\n\nWait, but if we add HCl, consume OH-, and dissolve more Mg(OH)2, increasing [Mg2+], but [OH-] is decreased, the ion product might actually decrease.\n\nWait, let's calculate the ion product after addition.\n\nNew [Mg2+] \u2248 0.00109 M\n\n[OH-] is effectively zero since all was consumed and there's excess H+.\n\nBut [OH-] can't be zero; even in acidic solutions, there's some OH- present.\n\nFrom the autoionization of water:\n\n[H+][OH-] = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 at 25\u00b0C\n\nExcess H+ is 0.000888 mol in 0.510 L, so [H+] \u2248 0.000888 mol / 0.510 L \u2248 0.00174 M\n\nTherefore, [OH-] = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14 / 0.00174 \u2248 5.75 \u00d7 10^-12 M\n\nNow, ion product = [Mg2+][OH-]^2 = (0.00109)(5.75 \u00d7 10^-12)^2 \u2248 0.00109 \u00d7 3.31 \u00d7 10^-23 \u2248 3.60 \u00d7 10^-26\n\nComparing this to Ksp = 5.61 \u00d7 10^-12\n\nSince ion product << Ksp, the solution is not saturated with respect to Mg(OH)2, and no precipitation should occur.\n\nTherefore, option B (Mg(OH)2 precipitates) is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, option A (MgCl2 precipitates) is unlikely because MgCl2 is soluble.\n\nOption C (Ksp increases) is incorrect because Ksp is temperature-dependent and remains constant at 25\u00b0C.\n\nOption D ([H2O] increases) is not significant because water is the solvent, and its concentration doesn't change appreciably.\n\nTherefore, none of the options seem correct based on this analysis.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something.\n\nPerhaps the addition of HCl causes the precipitation of another salt, but none are mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the understanding that adding HCl to a saturated Mg(OH)2 solution will cause more Mg(OH)2 to dissolve, but none of the options directly state that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is flawed, or I have a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Ksp changes due to the common ion effect, but Ksp is a constant at a given temperature.\n\nWait, no, Ksp doesn't change with added salt; it's only the solubility that changes.\n\nWait, perhaps the Ksp appears to increase because more Mg(OH)2 dissolves, but in reality, Ksp remains the same.\n\nBut the question is about what occurs when HCl is added, and the options are about precipitation or Ksp changes.\n\nGiven the analysis, it seems that nothing precipitates, and Ksp doesn't increase.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer is that none of the above occurs, but since that's not an option, maybe the best answer is D, [H2O] increases, even though it's a minor change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nWrite the solubility equilibrium:\n\nMg(OH)2(s) \u21cc Mg2+(aq) + 2OH-(aq)\n\nAdd HCl, which provides H+, reacts with OH-, reducing [OH-].\n\nAccording to Le Chatelier, the system will shift to the right to replace the removed OH-, dissolving more Mg(OH)2.\n\nTherefore, [Mg2+] increases, [OH-] decreases.\n\nIon product = [Mg2+][OH-]^2\n\nSince [OH-] decreases more significantly than [Mg2+] increases (because of the square), the ion product decreases.\n\nTherefore, the solution becomes less saturated with respect to Mg(OH)2, and no precipitation occurs.\n\nThus, options A and B are incorrect.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Ksp doesn't change with the addition of reagents; it's a constant at a given temperature.\n\nOption D is unlikely because [H2O] doesn't change significantly.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer is \"None of the above,\" but since that's not an option, maybe the question is testing something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misconception in my approach.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the formation of MgCl2 in solution.\n\nWhen HCl is added, Cl- ions are present.\n\nIf MgCl2 were to precipitate, its solubility would need to be considered.\n\nHowever, MgCl2 is highly soluble in water, with a solubility of about 540 g/L at 20\u00b0C, which is approximately 4.5 M.\n\nGiven that, it's unlikely that MgCl2 would precipitate under these conditions.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, none of the options seem correct.\n\nPerhaps the question is misworded or there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, [H2O] increases, but that seems like a negligible change and not directly related to the reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the increase in [H2O] is significant, but I doubt it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding that adding an acid to a saturated solution of a base causes more of the base to dissolve, but none of the options directly state that.\n\nGiven the options provided, I would say that the correct answer is D, [H2O] increases, but that doesn't seem like a meaningful or significant occurrence in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects that adding HCl increases [H2O] because H+ reacts with OH- to form H2O, effectively increasing the amount of water in the solution.\n\nBut in terms of concentration, since the volume also increases, the concentration of water doesn't change significantly.\n\nTherefore, I'm not entirely sure about the correct answer, but based on the process of elimination, I would choose D, [H2O] increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
