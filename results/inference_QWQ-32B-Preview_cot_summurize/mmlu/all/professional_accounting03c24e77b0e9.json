                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Level 2 observable inputs for determining fair value. It's asking which of the options isn't considered a Level 2 input. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Level 2 inputs are in the context of fair value measurements. According to the fair value hierarchy, Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This includes things like quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other market-based inputs like interest rates, yield curves, etc.\n\nOption A says: \"Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active.\" Hmm, that sounds familiar. In active markets, quoted prices are considered Level 1 inputs. But when the market is not active, even if the prices are quoted, they might not be as reliable. I think this might still be considered a Level 2 input because the market isn't active, so the quoted prices might not be the best indicator of fair value.\n\nOption B: \"Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in markets that are active.\" This seems like a clear Level 2 input. Since the assets or liabilities are similar but not identical, and the markets are active, using these quoted prices would be a Level 2 input.\n\nOption C: \"Internally generated cash flow projections for a related asset or liability.\" This one sounds different. Internally generated projections are likely to be based on the company's own estimates and assumptions, which would make them unobservable inputs. I think this would fall under Level 3 inputs, not Level 2.\n\nOption D: \"Interest rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\" This seems like a Level 2 input because interest rates are observable market data, but they're not prices for the identical asset or liability.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, option C stands out because it involves internal projections, which are not observable, whereas Level 2 inputs are supposed to be observable data.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's a scenario where internal projections could be considered Level 2. Let's see.\n\nAccording to the fair value hierarchy, Level 2 inputs are those that are observable, but not from active markets for identical assets. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs, like the company's own estimates.\n\nSince internally generated cash flow projections are based on the company's own forecasts, they would be considered unobservable, right? So, that should be Level 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C, as it's not a Level 2 observable input.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's confirm the other options.\n\nOption A: Quoted prices for identical assets in inactive markets. Yes, that's Level 2 because the market is not active, so the quoted prices might not be reliable indicators of fair value.\n\nOption B: Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets. Definitely Level 2.\n\nOption D: Observable interest rates. Again, Level 2.\n\nSo, yes, option C is the one that doesn't fit, as it's likely a Level 3 input.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
