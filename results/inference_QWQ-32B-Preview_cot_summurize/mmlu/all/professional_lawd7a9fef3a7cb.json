                    "text": "So here's this law problem involving a will, a brother and a sister, and some property in the Midwest. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the father died in 1985, and his will left his estate to his son and daughter \"to share and share alike as tenants in common.\" So, that means the estate is divided between the two of them equally, and they each own a half-interest in the property.\n\nAt the time of their father's death, the daughter was living in a different part of the Midwest, while the son was living in a Southwest state. After the funeral, the daughter went back to her own place, but the son decided to move into the estate. He put his name on the mailbox, paid the taxes and maintenance expenses, and so on. The daughter knew about this but didn't really care, so she never asked her brother about the property.\n\nFor 25 years, nothing much happened regarding the property, but in January 2010, some disputes came up between the brother and sister about their rights to the estate. The state where the property is located follows common law types of cotenancies, and there's no specific legislation on this issue.\n\nNow, the son is claiming full ownership of the property and wants to quiet title in his name. The question is, if the Midwest state has a 20-year adverse possession statute, who should win the case?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.\n\nB. The daughter, because there's no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.\n\nC. The son, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate.\n\nD. The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.\n\nOkay, so I need to understand adverse possession and how it applies to cotenants.\n\nAdverse possession is when someone occupies someone else's land openly, notoriously, and continuously for a certain period defined by statute, and at the end of that period, they can claim title to the property.\n\nBut in this case, the brother and sister are cotenants, meaning they both own parts of the same property. So, does adverse possession apply between cotenants?\n\nI think the key here is understanding the relationship between cotenants and how adverse possession works in that context.\n\nFirst, I recall that cotenants have a right to possess the entire property, even though they only own a portion of it. So, each has the right to occupy the whole property, but they also have a duty to account to each other for any profits or expenses related to the property.\n\nNow, if one cotenant excludes the other from the property without the other's consent, that could be considered ouster, and the ousted cotenant might have grounds to sue for that.\n\nIn terms of adverse possession, generally, one cannot adversely possess against their own title or against a cotenant. There's a principle that you can't adverse possess land that you already have an interest in.\n\nBut, there are exceptions. In some jurisdictions, if one cotenant ousters the other and possesses the property exclusively for the statutory period, they can extinguish the other's title.\n\nSo, in this case, the son moved into the property, put his name on the mailbox, paid taxes and maintenance, and the daughter knew about it but didn't do anything.\n\nIs this considered ouster? Did the son exclude the daughter from the property?\n\nWell, the daughter didn't try to occupy the property or ask for rent, so it seems like she didn't assert her rights. But did the son do anything to prevent her from occupying it?\n\nHe put his name on the mailbox, which might suggest that he's claiming sole possession, but didn't actively prevent her from coming in.\n\nThe problem says that the daughter knew about his occupation and didn't press him, so it's more like she's acquiescing or not caring, rather than being ousted.\n\nSo, option B says the daughter should win because there's no evidence of ouster. That might be a possibility.\n\nOption A says the daughter should win because one cotenant can't acquire title by adverse possession against another. That seems plausible based on the general rule.\n\nOption C says the son should win because the daughter renounced her rights. But renunciation usually requires some affirmative act, like selling or giving away her interest. Just not caring and not asserting her rights might not be enough.\n\nOption D says the son should win because he met the adverse possession requirements. But again, adverse possession against a cotenant might not be allowed.\n\nI need to think about the law in this Midwest state. Since it's a common law state with no specific legislation on this issue, I'll assume it follows traditional common law rules.\n\nUnder common law, adverse possession by one cotenant against another is generally not allowed because you can't possess against your own title. However, there's an exception if there's ouster.\n\nOuster means that one cotenant physically excludes the other from the property, thereby denying their right to possess.\n\nIn this case, the son occupied the property, paid taxes and maintenance, but there's no indication that he prevented the daughter from entering or using the property.\n\nThe daughter knew about his occupation and didn't do anything about it for 25 years.\n\nSo, perhaps there was no ouster, and therefore, the son can't claim adverse possession against his sister.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the daughter's failure to assert her rights for 25 years leads to the son gaining title by adverse possession.\n\nBut, considering that they are cotenants, and the general rule is that adverse possession doesn't lie between cotenants unless there's ouster, it seems that option B is the correct answer: the daughter should win because there's no evidence of ouster.\n\nMoreover, option A also suggests that one cotenant can't acquire title by adverse possession against another, which aligns with the general rule.\n\nBetween options A and B, I think B is more precise because it acknowledges that adverse possession might be possible if there's ouster, but in this case, there's no evidence of ouster.\n\nOption C is less likely because there's no clear indication that the daughter renounced her ownership rights; she just didn't care and didn't press her brother.\n\nOption D might be tempting because the son has possessed the property for more than the 20-year statutory period, but given that they are cotenants and there was no ouster, it's unlikely that adverse possession would apply.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is B: the daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
