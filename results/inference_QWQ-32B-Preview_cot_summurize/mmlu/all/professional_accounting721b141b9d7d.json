                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a company that produces a single product using a continuous process. They started with no work in process on April 1. During April, they started 10,000 units and completed 9,000 units, which were transferred out. The ending work-in-process inventory was complete as to materials but only 50% complete as to conversion costs. The costs are given: direct materials cost $114,000, direct labor $38,000, and manufacturing overhead is assigned at 50% of direct materials. I need to find the cost per equivalent whole unit for the goods manufactured in April.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of equivalent units. Since the ending work-in-process inventory is 100% complete for materials and 50% complete for conversion, I have to calculate the equivalent units for both materials and conversion costs separately.\n\nLet me start by determining the units to account for:\n\n- Units started: 10,000\n\n- Units completed and transferred out: 9,000\n\n- Ending work-in-process inventory: 10,000 - 9,000 = 1,000 units\n\nNow, for materials:\n\n- Units completed: 9,000 (100% complete)\n\n- Ending WIP: 1,000 units (100% complete)\n\n- Total equivalent units for materials: 9,000 + 1,000 = 10,000\n\nFor conversion costs:\n\n- Units completed: 9,000 (100% complete)\n\n- Ending WIP: 1,000 units (50% complete)\n\n- Total equivalent units for conversion: 9,000 + (1,000 * 0.5) = 9,000 + 500 = 9,500\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total costs for materials and conversion.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Direct materials cost: $114,000\n\n- Direct labor cost: $38,000\n\n- Manufacturing overhead: 50% of direct materials = 0.5 * $114,000 = $57,000\n\nTotal conversion costs = direct labor + overhead = $38,000 + $57,000 = $95,000\n\nNow, I can calculate the cost per equivalent unit for materials and conversion.\n\nCost per equivalent unit for materials:\n\n= Total materials cost / total equivalent units for materials\n\n= $114,000 / 10,000 = $11.40 per equivalent unit\n\nCost per equivalent unit for conversion:\n\n= Total conversion costs / total equivalent units for conversion\n\n= $95,000 / 9,500 = $10 per equivalent unit\n\nNow, to find the cost per equivalent whole unit, I need to add the materials and conversion costs per unit.\n\nCost per whole unit = materials cost per unit + conversion cost per unit\n\n= $11.40 + $10 = $21.40\n\nSo, the cost per equivalent whole unit is $21.40.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $23.22\n\nB. $21.40\n\nC. $20.90\n\nD. $15.40\n\nIt seems that $21.40 is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units to account for:\n\nStarted: 10,000\n\nCompleted: 9,000\n\nEnding WIP: 1,000\n\nMaterials:\n\n- Completed: 9,000\n\n- Ending WIP: 1,000 (100% complete)\n\n- Total equivalent units: 10,000\n\nConversion:\n\n- Completed: 9,000\n\n- Ending WIP: 1,000 * 50% = 500\n\n- Total equivalent units: 9,500\n\nCosts:\n\n- Materials: $114,000\n\n- Direct labor: $38,000\n\n- Overhead: 50% of materials = $57,000\n\n- Total conversion costs: $38,000 + $57,000 = $95,000\n\nCost per equivalent unit:\n\n- Materials: $114,000 / 10,000 = $11.40\n\n- Conversion: $95,000 / 9,500 = $10\n\n- Total per whole unit: $11.40 + $10 = $21.40\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be B. $21.40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B.\\ \\$21.40} \\]"
