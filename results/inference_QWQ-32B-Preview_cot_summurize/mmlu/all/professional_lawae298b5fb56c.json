                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the best way for the driver to respond to the pedestrian's lawsuit. Let's break down the situation:\n\n- The pedestrian lives in State A but was crossing the street in State B when hit by the driver.\n\n- The driver is a citizen of a foreign country.\n\n- The pedestrian is suing the driver in federal district court in State B for $100,000 in damages, claiming negligence.\n\n- The driver believes the pedestrian was crossing illegally and thus is responsible for the accident.\n\n- State B is a contributory negligence state.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what contributory negligence means. In contributory negligence states, if the plaintiff is found to have contributed in any way to their own injury, they can be barred from recovering any damages from the defendant. This is different from comparative negligence, where damages might be apportioned based on the degree of fault.\n\nGiven that State B is a contributory negligence state, the driver can raise contributory negligence as an affirmative defense. This means the driver needs to prove that the pedestrian was contributorily negligent, which could completely bar the pedestrian's recovery.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and asserting a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for the driver's injuries.\n\nThis seems like a comprehensive response. By filing an answer, the driver is responding to the pedestrian's claims, and by raising contributory negligence as an affirmative defense, they're arguing that the pedestrian shares fault for the accident. Additionally, asserting a counterclaim for negligence allows the driver to seek damages from the pedestrian for their own injuries, if they can prove the pedestrian's negligence caused the accident.\n\nB. File an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and defense of contributory negligence and move for judgment on the pleadings.\n\nThis option is a bit confusing because it mentions \"defense of contributory negligence\" twice. Perhaps it's a typo, and it should be \"and move for judgment on the pleadings.\" Judgment on the pleadings is a motion typically filed after the complaint and answer have been filed, asking the court to decide the case based on the pleadings alone, without needing a trial. However, in this context, it might be premature to move for judgment on the pleadings at this stage, especially since facts about who was at fault need to be established.\n\nC. Move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, because the driver is not a citizen of State B.\n\nPersonal jurisdiction refers to the court's authority over the parties involved in the lawsuit. In federal court, personal jurisdiction can be established based on various grounds, including the driver's presence in the state where the accident occurred. Since the accident happened in State B, it's likely that the court has personal jurisdiction over the driver, even if they are a foreign citizen. Therefore, this might not be a strong basis for dismissal.\n\nD. Move to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, because the driver is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nSubject-matter jurisdiction refers to the court's authority to hear the type of case being brought. In federal court, diversity jurisdiction allows federal courts to hear cases where there is complete diversity between the parties and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. Here, the pedestrian is a citizen of State A, and the driver is a foreign citizen, so there is diversity. The amount in controversy is $100,000, which meets the threshold. Therefore, federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this case.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems to be the most appropriate response for the driver. Filing an answer and raising contributory negligence as an affirmative defense aligns with the legal principles in State B. Additionally, asserting a counterclaim allows the driver to seek damages for their own injuries if they can prove the pedestrian's negligence.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in some jurisdictions, the defendant can file a separate complaint against the plaintiff, known as a cross-claim, but in this context, asserting a counterclaim within the same action is more appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the attorney should advise the driver to file an answer raising the affirmative defense of contributory negligence and asserting a counterclaim for negligence, seeking damages for the driver's injuries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
