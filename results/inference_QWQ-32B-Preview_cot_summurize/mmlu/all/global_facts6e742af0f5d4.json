                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about how many chickens were killed for meat production in 2018. The options are A. 690 million, B. 6.9 billion, C. 69 billion, and D. 690 billion. I don't remember the exact number, but I know it's a huge amount. Let me think about this.\n\nI recall that chickens are the most farmed birds for meat worldwide, and the numbers are in the billions. So, option A, 690 million, seems too low. Even 690 million is a large number, but I think it's way below the actual figure.\n\nOption B is 6.9 billion. That sounds plausible. I've heard statistics about chicken meat consumption being high, and 6.9 billion chickens sounds like a lot, but maybe it's possible.\n\nOption C is 69 billion. That's ten times more than option B. Is it really that high? I doubt it.\n\nOption D is 690 billion. That's even higher. I think that's probably too much, even for the global chicken meat industry.\n\nLet me try to recall where I might have seen statistics like this. Maybe in news articles or documentaries about animal agriculture. I remember seeing figures in the billions, but I don't recall the exact number.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to estimate based on what I know about chicken farming. I know that chickens have a short lifespan, maybe around 6-8 weeks before they're slaughtered for meat. So, the turnover is fast.\n\nAlso, considering the global population is around 7.5 billion in 2018, and if on average each person consumes a certain number of chickens per year, maybe around 10 or 20, then the total number would be in the tens of billions.\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the options given. If we assume 7.5 billion people, each consuming 10 chickens a year, that's 75 billion chickens. But option C is 69 billion, which is close, and option D is 690 billion, which seems too high.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if the average per capita consumption is that high. Maybe in some countries it's higher, in others lower.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider global production statistics. I know that China is the largest producer of chicken meat, followed by the US and Brazil.\n\nAccording to some sources, the US produces around 9 billion chickens per year for meat. If we consider that the US is one of the top producers, then globally it might be several times that amount.\n\nSo, 9 billion in the US, and maybe China and Brazil each produce around the same or more, then combined it could be around 25-30 billion.\n\nBut that's just a rough estimate, and it's probably higher.\n\nWait, but that would still be lower than option C, which is 69 billion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number includes both farmed and wild chickens, but I think wild chickens are not a significant part of meat production.\n\nI think the key here is to recall the approximate global production of chicken meat.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the weight of chicken meat produced globally and then estimate the number of chickens based on average weight.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), global poultry meat production in 2018 was around 110 million tons.\n\nAssuming an average chicken provides about 1.5 to 2 kilograms of meat, we can estimate the number of chickens slaughtered.\n\nSo, 110 million tons is 110,000,000 tons.\n\n1 ton is 1,000 kilograms, so 110,000,000 tons is 110,000,000,000 kilograms.\n\nIf each chicken provides 1.5 kg, then the number of chickens would be 110,000,000,000 kg / 1.5 kg per chicken = 73,333,333,333 chickens.\n\nThat's approximately 73 billion chickens.\n\nAlternatively, if each chicken provides 2 kg, then it would be 55 billion chickens.\n\nSo, between 55 and 73 billion chickens slaughtered in 2018 for meat production.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 69 billion, which falls within this range.\n\nOption B is 6.9 billion, which is too low, and option D is 690 billion, which is too high.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is option C, 69 billion.\n\nI think that's the best estimate based on the available information.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
