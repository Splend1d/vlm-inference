                    "text": "To write the fraction 27 over 36 in its simplest form, I need to reduce it by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Let's find the GCD of 27 and 36.\n\nFirst, I'll list the factors of each number:\n\n- Factors of 27: 1, 3, 9, 27\n\n- Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36\n\nThe common factors are 1, 3, and 9. The greatest of these is 9. So, I'll divide both the numerator and the denominator by 9.\n\n27 \u00f7 9 = 3\n\n36 \u00f7 9 = 4\n\nTherefore, 27 over 36 simplifies to 3 over 4.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 3 over 4\n\nB. 2 over 3\n\nC. 3 over 5\n\nD. 1 over 5\n\nThe correct answer is A. 3 over 4.\n\nAlternatively, I could check if the fraction is already in its simplest form by seeing if 3 and 4 have any common factors other than 1. Since 3 is a prime number and 4 is 2 squared, their only common factor is 1, so 3 over 4 is indeed in its simplest form.\n\nI could also cross-check this by dividing both numerator and denominator by smaller common factors step by step. For example, I could first divide by 3:\n\n27 \u00f7 3 = 9\n\n36 \u00f7 3 = 12\n\nSo, 27 over 36 becomes 9 over 12.\n\nNow, again, 9 and 12 have a common factor of 3:\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\n12 \u00f7 3 = 4\n\nSo, again, I arrive at 3 over 4.\n\nThis confirms that the simplest form is indeed 3 over 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. } \\frac{3}{4}} \\]"
