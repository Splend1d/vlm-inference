The loan was secured by a mortgage that contained an after-acquired property clause that provided:\"(The developer) hereby covenants that the terms of this mortgage shall apply to all after-acquired property which said mortgagor shall hereafter acquire; andMortgagee-bank's security interest in such after- acquired property shall take priority over all other parties claiming an interest in such property. \"The bank duly recorded this mortgage on August 15, 2007. On September 6, 2008, the developer purchased a four-story office building in a nearby city. The building was in need of much renovation. To finance the improvements, the developer borrowed $250,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the developer executed a promissory note for $250,000, payable to the friend in 10 years and secured by a mortgage on the office building. This mortgage was dated September 9, 2008 and recorded the following day. During the early part of 2009, the developer experienced serious financial setbacks and failed to make the monthly mortgage payments to the bank and the friend.

                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a developer, a bank, and a friend, all with interests in properties and loans. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a developer who built a mini-mall and got a $500,000 commercial loan from a bank to finance it. This loan is secured by a mortgage on the mini-mall, and that mortgage includes something called an \"after-acquired property clause.\" This clause basically says that any property the developer acquires in the future will also be covered by this mortgage, and the bank's interest in that future property will take priority over anyone else's claims.\n\nThe bank recorded this mortgage on August 15, 2007. Then, on September 6, 2008, the developer buys a four-story office building in another city that needs renovations. To finance the improvements, the developer borrows $250,000 from a friend. As security for this loan, the developer gives the friend a promissory note and a mortgage on the office building. This mortgage is dated September 9, 2008, and recorded the next day, September 10, 2008.\n\nLater, in early 2009, the developer runs into financial trouble and defaults on both mortgage payments\u2014to the bank and to the friend. The bank starts a foreclosure action on both the mini-mall and the office building. The friend intervenes, claiming that his mortgage on the office building should take priority over the bank's after-acquired property claim.\n\nNow, the question is, which security interest in the office building should be given priority? The options are:\n\nA. The bank, because its mortgage was recorded prior in time.\n\nB. The bank, because the after-acquired property clause in its mortgage is enforceable and takes priority over the friend's subsequent security interest.\n\nC. The friend, because the bank's prior recorded mortgage is outside the friend's chain of title.\n\nD. The friend, because an after-acquired property clause is void against public policy and cannot encumber real estate subsequently acquired by the mortgagor.\n\nTo answer this, we need to understand how recording statutes work and how after-acquired property clauses are treated in this jurisdiction.\n\nThe jurisdiction has a grantor-grantee index system and a specific recording statute that says: \"An unrecorded mortgage, deed, or other instrument is invalid as against a subsequent mortgagee or bona fide purchaser for value without notice.\"\n\nOkay, so this is a race-notice statute, meaning that recording is essential to protect one's interests against subsequent parties who may record their interests.\n\nLet's look at the bank's position first. The bank has a mortgage recorded on August 15, 2007, with an after-acquired property clause. The developer acquires the office building on September 6, 2008, and the friend's mortgage is recorded on September 10, 2008.\n\nThe after-acquired property clause is meant to encompass any property the developer acquires after the original mortgage was executed. So, according to this clause, the bank's mortgage should cover the office building as well, and its interest should take priority over any other claims.\n\nHowever, the friend argues that his mortgage, recorded on September 10, 2008, should take priority over the bank's after-acquired interest.\n\nTo resolve this, we need to see how after-acquired property clauses are treated under the recording statute in this jurisdiction.\n\nFirst, is the after-acquired property clause valid? In many jurisdictions, such clauses are enforceable, but their effect can be limited by recording statutes.\n\nThe recording statute here says that an unrecorded instrument is invalid against a subsequent mortgagee or bona fide purchaser without notice. So, if the bank's interest in the after-acquired property is not properly recorded, it might not take priority over a subsequent mortgagee like the friend who records first.\n\nBut in this case, the bank's original mortgage was recorded on August 15, 2007, before the developer acquired the office building. The after-acquired property clause is part of that recorded mortgage.\n\nNow, does the after-acquired property clause mean that the bank's interest automatically attaches to the office building upon its acquisition, making the bank's interest prior to any subsequent mortgages like the friend's?\n\nOr does the bank need to record a new mortgage or take some additional step to perfect its interest in the after-acquired property?\n\nThis is crucial because if the after-acquired property clause makes the bank's interest automatically attach to the new property upon acquisition, and the original mortgage was recorded before the friend's mortgage, then the bank's interest would take priority.\n\nAlternatively, if the after-acquired property clause doesn't automatically attach the interest, and the bank needs to take additional steps to record its interest in the new property, then the friend's subsequently recorded mortgage might take priority.\n\nLooking at option D, it suggests that after-acquired property clauses are void against public policy and cannot encumber subsequently acquired real estate. If that's the case in this jurisdiction, then the bank's claim based on the after-acquired property clause would be invalid, and the friend's mortgage would take priority.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, after-acquired property clauses are enforceable, especially when the original mortgage is recorded before the acquisition of the new property.\n\nOption C says that the friend's mortgage takes priority because the bank's prior recorded mortgage is outside the friend's chain of title. This might refer to the idea that since the friend is dealing directly with the developer and getting a mortgage on the office building, the bank's earlier mortgage on a different property doesn't affect the friend's priority, especially if the friend recorded first.\n\nBut given that the bank's mortgage has an after-acquired property clause, it's arguing that its interest extends to the office building as well.\n\nSo, in this scenario, both the bank and the friend have recorded interests in the office building, but at different times.\n\nThe bank's original mortgage with the after-acquired property clause was recorded on August 15, 2007, and the friend's mortgage was recorded on September 10, 2008.\n\nIf the after-acquired property clause is valid and enforceable, then the bank's interest in the office building is prior to the friend's mortgage, even though the friend recorded his mortgage after the acquisition.\n\nOn the other hand, if the after-acquired property clause is not recognized, or if it requires additional recording to perfect the interest in the new property, then the friend's recorded mortgage would take priority.\n\nGiven that the jurisdiction has a race-notice statute, and the bank's original mortgage was recorded before the friend's mortgage, it seems that the bank's interest should take priority, assuming the after-acquired property clause is enforceable.\n\nTherefore, options A and B seem plausible.\n\nOption A says the bank's mortgage was recorded prior in time, which is true, but it doesn't consider the effect of the after-acquired property clause.\n\nOption B specifically mentions that the after-acquired property clause is enforceable and takes priority over the friend's subsequent security interest.\n\nOption C suggests that the friend's mortgage takes priority because the bank's mortgage is outside the friend's chain of title. However, if the after-acquired property clause is effective, then the bank's interest is inside the chain of title.\n\nOption D claims that after-acquired property clauses are void against public policy, but that seems unlikely, as such clauses are commonly used and generally enforceable.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that the correct answer is B: the bank, because the after-acquired property clause in its mortgage is enforceable and takes priority over the friend's subsequent security interest.\n\nThis is assuming that the jurisdiction recognizes after-acquired property clauses in mortgages and that recording the original mortgage is sufficient to perfect the bank's interest in future-acquired properties.\n\nHowever, it's always possible that the jurisdiction has specific rules or case law that limits the enforceability of after-acquired property clauses, but based on standard principles, option B seems most correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
