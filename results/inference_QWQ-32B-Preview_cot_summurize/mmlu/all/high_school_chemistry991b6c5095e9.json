                    "text": "To determine which subshell's electrons would have the highest velocity after being ejected from a chlorine atom bombarded by high-energy photons, we need to consider the energy levels of the electrons in different subshells and how that affects their kinetic energy upon ejection.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the energy required to remove an electron from a particular subshell is known as the ionization energy or binding energy for that subshell. Electrons in lower energy subshells are more tightly bound to the nucleus and thus require more energy to be ejected compared to electrons in higher energy subshells.\n\nIn chlorine, the electron configuration is [Ne] 3s\u00b2 3p\u2075. However, the question mentions \"filled subshells,\" so we need to consider the subshells that are completely filled in chlorine.\n\nLooking at the electron configuration:\n\n- 1s\u00b2: fully filled\n\n- 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076: fully filled\n\n- 3s\u00b2: fully filled\n\n- 3p\u2075: partially filled\n\nSo, the filled subshells in chlorine are 1s\u00b2, 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076, and 3s\u00b2.\n\nNow, the options provided are:\n\nA. 1s\n\nB. 2p\n\nC. 3p\n\nD. 3d\n\nWait a minute, chlorine has no electrons in the 3d subshell, as its electron configuration only goes up to 3p. So, option D (3d) is not applicable here, as those subshells are empty in chlorine. Therefore, we can eliminate option D.\n\nNow, we are left with options A (1s), B (2p), and C (3p). But according to the electron configuration, 3p is only half-filled (3p\u2075), not fully filled. However, the question specifies \"filled subshells,\" which might be a misinterpretation or a typo, because in chlorine, 3p is not fully filled. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps we should consider the subshells that are filled, which are 1s\u00b2, 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076, and 3s\u00b2.\n\nBut since 2p is part of the second shell which is fully filled, and 3p is partially filled, perhaps the question intends for us to consider only the fully filled subshells, which would be 1s\u00b2, 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076, and 3s\u00b2. However, option C is 3p, which is not fully filled, so maybe there's some confusion here.\n\nRegardless, let's proceed with the understanding that we are to consider electrons from the filled subshells, which are 1s, 2p (as part of the fully filled n=2 shell), and 3s.\n\nWhen an electron is ejected from a subshell, the kinetic energy it carries upon ejection is related to the energy of the photon minus the binding energy of the electron in that subshell. According to the photoelectric effect, the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is given by:\n\nKE = hf - \u03c6\n\nwhere hf is the energy of the photon, and \u03c6 is the binding energy of the electron in the subshell from which it is ejected.\n\nGiven that the photons are high-energy, we can assume that hf is significantly larger than any of the binding energies, so the kinetic energy will be highest for the electron with the lowest binding energy.\n\nTherefore, the electron from the subshell with the lowest binding energy will have the highest kinetic energy and thus the highest velocity.\n\nNow, binding energies increase as we move closer to the nucleus. So, electrons in lower energy subshells (closer to the nucleus) have higher binding energies, while electrons in higher energy subshells have lower binding energies.\n\nIn chlorine:\n\n- 1s subshell is the closest to the nucleus, so it has the highest binding energy.\n\n- 2p subshell is farther out, so it has a lower binding energy than 1s.\n\n- 3s subshell is even farther, so it has a lower binding energy than 2p.\n\n- 3p subshell is at a similar distance to 3s but has a slightly higher energy due to penetration effects, but for our purposes, we can consider it similar to 3s.\n\nTherefore, the subshell with the lowest binding energy among the options is 3p (option C).\n\nWait, but earlier we saw that 3p is not fully filled, but if we consider it as part of the filled subshells, perhaps due to a misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider only the fully filled subshells, then 3s is the outermost fully filled subshell, and it would have a lower binding energy than 2p.\n\nBut according to the electron configuration, 3p is partially filled, and 3s is fully filled, but in reality, in multi-electron atoms, the 3p subshell has a higher energy than the 3s subshell.\n\nSo, in chlorine, the energy order is 1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p.\n\nTherefore, the subshell with the lowest binding energy is 3p, followed by 3s, then 2p, and 1s has the highest binding energy.\n\nTherefore, electrons from the 3p subshell would require the least energy to be ejected, meaning they would have the highest kinetic energy and thus the highest velocity upon ejection.\n\nHowever, since 3p is not fully filled, and the question specifies \"filled subshells,\" perhaps the correct subshells to consider are 1s, 2p, and 3s.\n\nAmong these, 3s would have the lowest binding energy, so electrons from the 3s subshell would have the highest kinetic energy upon ejection.\n\nBut option C is 3p, which is not fully filled, so perhaps there is confusion in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intends for us to consider the effective nuclear charge experienced by electrons in different subshells.\n\nElectrons in subshells closer to the nucleus experience a higher effective nuclear charge and thus have higher binding energies.\n\nElectrons in subshells farther from the nucleus experience a lower effective nuclear charge and have lower binding energies.\n\nTherefore, electrons in the 1s subshell have the highest binding energy, while electrons in the 3p subshell have lower binding energy.\n\nThus, electrons from the 3p subshell would be ejected with higher kinetic energy and velocity compared to electrons from inner subshells.\n\nBut again, 3p is not fully filled in chlorine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the electrons from the filled subshells being ejected, and among those, which one would have the highest velocity.\n\nIn that case, among the filled subshells, 3s would have the lowest binding energy, followed by 2p, and then 1s.\n\nTherefore, electrons from the 3s subshell would have the highest kinetic energy and velocity upon ejection.\n\nBut option C is 3p, which is not fully filled, so perhaps there is a mistake in the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3d subshell is being considered as empty, and thus not relevant, but in reality, empty subshells do not contribute to the electron configuration.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the correct answer is C. 3p, assuming that the question meant to include the partially filled subshell as well.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the 3p subshell is the one with the lowest binding energy in chlorine among the options, then electrons from the 3p subshell would have the highest kinetic energy and velocity upon ejection.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 3p.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
