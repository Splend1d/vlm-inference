So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I entered into a luxurious estate recently.\" Hmm, entering a luxurious estate doesn't sound inherently wrong. Maybe it's a place I'm supposed to be, like a public event or a friend's house. Unless, of course, I didn't have permission to enter, which would be trespassing. But based on just this statement, I don't know if I had permission or not. So, it's a bit unclear.\n\nSecond, Scenario 2: \"I pushed my little sister on the swingset.\" Pushing a little sister on a swingset sounds like a normal, perhaps even caring, thing to do. It seems like helping her swing. Unless, maybe, I was pushing her too hard or in a way that could hurt her, but again, from this statement alone, it seems okay.\n\nGiven that, both scenarios don't sound clearly morally wrong at face value. So, option D, \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" might be the answer.\n\nBut let's consider if there's more to it. Maybe there's some context I'm missing.\n\nFor Scenario 1, entering a luxurious estate could be wrong if I didn't have the right to be there. But if I did have permission, then it's not wrong. Since the statement doesn't specify, I'll assume that I had the right to be there, perhaps as a guest.\n\nFor Scenario 2, pushing my little sister on the swingset is probably helping her enjoy herself. Unless specified otherwise, it seems like a positive action.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
