                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character did something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I borrowed him money, and he paid me back.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character lent money to someone, and that person returned the favor by paying them back. Is there anything wrong with this? Lending money and getting it back seems like a normal financial transaction. It's expected that when you borrow money, you pay it back. So, in this case, it doesn't seem like the main character did anything morally wrong. It's a straightforward exchange.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I sang and cheered from my seat at the wake.\"\n\nA wake is a gathering, usually held before a funeral, where people come to pay their respects to the deceased. It's typically a somber and respectful event. Singing and cheering might be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful in this context because it's not in line with the expected behavior at such an occasion.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character's actions could be considered morally wrong because they didn't show the appropriate respect for the deceased and the mourners.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1.\n\nIn Scenario 1, it says \"I borrowed him money.\" Now, \"borrowed him money\" could be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1. I borrowed money from him, and then he paid me back. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if I borrowed money from him, he's the one who lent me the money, so he wouldn't be paying me back; I would be paying him back.\n\n2. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be \"I lent him money, and he paid me back.\" That would make more sense.\n\nAssuming it's a typo and it means \"I lent him money, and he paid me back,\" then as I initially thought, there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nAlternatively, if it really means \"I borrowed money from him, and he paid me back,\" that would be confusing because typically, the borrower pays back the lender.\n\nAssuming it's the first interpretation, where I lent money and was paid back, then it's not wrong.\n\nSo, overall, option C seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
