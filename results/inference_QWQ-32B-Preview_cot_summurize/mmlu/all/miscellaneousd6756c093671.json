The question is asking which concept of literary structure the teacher is helping students understand.\n\nSo, the options are:\n\nA. Plot sequence\n\nB. Point of view\n\nC. Character development\n\nD. Setting\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nPlot sequence is about the order of events in a story. It's how the story unfolds from start to finish.\n\nPoint of view is about whose perspective the story is told from. Is it first person, third person, omniscient, etc.?\n\nCharacter development is how the characters change or grow throughout the story.\n\nSetting is the time and place where the story happens.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the teacher is showing picture cards from the beginning, middle, and end of the story. This sounds like they're highlighting different parts of the story's progression. So, it seems like they're focusing on the sequence of events.\n\nLet me think about it again. Maybe it's character development because \"Where the Wild Things Are\" is a story where the main character, Max, has an adventure and learns something.\n\nBut the teacher is showing pictures from the beginning, middle, and end. That sounds more like plotting the story's structure in terms of sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps it's both plot sequence and character development. But I need to choose one.\n\nLet me consider what the teacher is directly doing. They're reading the story aloud and then showing picture cards from different parts of the story. It's likely that they're helping students understand how the story progresses from one event to another.\n\nAlso, in story structure, the beginning introduces characters and setting, the middle contains the main events and conflicts, and the end resolves the story. So, by showing these three parts, the teacher is likely explaining how stories are structured in terms of plot sequence.\n\nPoint of view might be relevant, but it's not directly addressed by showing beginning, middle, and end.\n\nSetting is important, but again, not directly related to showing these specific parts of the story.\n\nCharacter development could be a part of the story, but focusing on beginning, middle, and end seems more about the overall plot structure.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is A. Plot sequence.\n\nBut to make sure, let's think about it differently. If the teacher was focusing on character development, they might ask questions about how Max changes from the beginning to the end of the story.\n\nIf they were focusing on point of view, they might discuss who is telling the story and from whose perspective.\n\nIf they were focusing on setting, they might talk about where the story takes place.\n\nBut since they're showing pictures from the beginning, middle, and end, it's more about the sequence of events in the plot.\n\nSo, yeah, I think A. Plot sequence is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
