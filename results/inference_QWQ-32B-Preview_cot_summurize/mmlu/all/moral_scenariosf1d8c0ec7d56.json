The potential issue here is whether leaving a lit candle, even if extinguished, is safe or not. Candles are often associated with fire hazards if not handled properly. However, the character extinguished the candle before leaving, which suggests they took the necessary precaution. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action doesn't seem clearly morally wrong. It's more of a safety concern, but morally, it's acceptable as long as the candle was properly extinguished.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character uses online forums to find women to date. In terms of morality, seeking a romantic partner through online forums is a common practice in the US and is generally accepted. However, the way one conducts themselves in these forums can vary widely, and some behaviors might be considered inappropriate or unethical. But based solely on the information provided, using online forums to find dating partners isn't inherently morally wrong.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither appears to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
