                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the nature and size of the image formed by a bi-convex lens given specific parameters. Let's break down the information provided and use the relevant formulas step by step.\n\n### Given Data:\n- Bi-convex lens: This means both surfaces of the lens are convex.\n- Radius of curvature (R) = 20 cm (magnitude)\n- Object height (h) = 2 cm\n- Object distance (u) = 30 cm\n\n### Objective:\nDetermine the nature and size of the image formed by the lens.\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Determine the focal length (f) of the lens:**\n   - For a bi-convex lens, both surfaces have the same radius of curvature.\n   - Use the lensmaker's formula to find the focal length.\n\n2. **Use the lens formula to find the image distance (v):**\n   - The lens formula is \\( \\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f} \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the magnification (m) to find the image height (h'):**\n   - Magnification is given by \\( m = -\\frac{v}{u} \\).\n   - Image height \\( h' = m \\times h \\).\n\n4. **Determine the nature of the image (real or virtual, inverted or upright):**\n   - The sign of the image distance (v) indicates whether the image is real or virtual.\n   - The sign of the magnification (m) indicates whether the image is inverted or upright.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the focal length (f)\n\nThe lensmaker's formula for a thin lens is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the refractive index of the lens material.\n- \\( R_1 \\) and \\( R_2 \\) are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces.\n\nFor a bi-convex lens:\n- Both surfaces are convex, so \\( R_1 = R \\) and \\( R_2 = -R \\), where \\( R = 20 \\) cm.\n\nAssuming the lens is made of glass with a refractive index \\( n = 1.5 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = (1.5 - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{-20} \\right) = 0.5 \\left( \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{20} \\right) = 0.5 \\times \\frac{2}{20} = 0.5 \\times 0.1 = 0.05\n\\]\n\nThus, the focal length is:\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{1}{0.05} = 20 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Use the lens formula to find the image distance (v)\n\nThe lens formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( u = -30 \\) cm (since the object is on the left side of the lens) and \\( f = 20 \\) cm:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{-30} = \\frac{1}{20}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{20}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{30}\n\\]\n\nFind a common denominator (60):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{3}{60} - \\frac{2}{60} = \\frac{1}{60}\n\\]\n\nThus, the image distance is:\n\n\\[\nv = 60 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate the magnification (m) and image height (h')\n\nMagnification is given by:\n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{v}{u} = -\\frac{60}{-30} = 2\n\\]\n\nImage height is:\n\n\\[\nh' = m \\times h = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the nature of the image\n\n- The image distance \\( v = 60 \\) cm is positive, indicating a real image.\n- The magnification \\( m = 2 \\) is positive, indicating an upright image.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a discrepancy because for a convex lens, real images should be inverted. Let's re-examine the calculations.\n\n### Re-examination:\n\nUpon reviewing the calculations, I realize there is an error in determining the magnification and the nature of the image.\n\n- For a convex lens, real images are always inverted, and virtual images are upright.\n- The magnification formula \\( m = -\\frac{v}{u} \\) should be used carefully with signs.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( u = -30 \\) cm (object distance, following sign conventions)\n- \\( v = 60 \\) cm (image distance, positive indicates real image)\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{60}{-30} = 2\n\\]\n\nA positive magnification indicates an upright image, but for a convex lens forming a real image, the image should be inverted. This suggests a mistake in the interpretation of the sign conventions.\n\n### Correcting the Sign Convention:\n\nIn lens formula, the sign conventions are:\n- Object distance (u): negative for real objects (to the left of the lens).\n- Image distance (v): positive for real images (to the right of the lens), negative for virtual images (to the left of the lens).\n- Magnification (m): negative for real, inverted images; positive for virtual, upright images.\n\nGiven that, in this case:\n- \\( u = -30 \\) cm\n- \\( v = 60 \\) cm (real image)\n- \\( m = -\\frac{60}{-30} = 2 \\) (positive magnification suggests upright image, which contradicts the expected inverted image for real images from convex lenses).\n\n### Resolution:\n\nThe discrepancy arises from the interpretation of the magnification sign. For real images formed by convex lenses, the image is inverted, and magnification should be negative. Let's re-calculate magnification correctly.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( v = 60 \\) cm\n- \\( u = -30 \\) cm\n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{v}{u} = -\\frac{60}{-30} = 2\n\\]\n\nThis positive magnification suggests an upright image, which contradicts the known behavior of convex lenses forming real, inverted images. Therefore, there must be an error in the calculation or interpretation.\n\n### Correct Calculation:\n\nLet's re-examine the lens formula calculation.\n\nGiven:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute values:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{-30} = \\frac{1}{20}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{20}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{30}\n\\]\n\nFind a common denominator (60):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{3}{60} - \\frac{2}{60} = \\frac{1}{60}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nv = 60 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate magnification:\n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{v}{u} = -\\frac{60}{-30} = 2\n\\]\n\nThis suggests an upright image, which is incorrect for a real image formed by a convex lens. The error lies in the interpretation of the sign conventions.\n\n### Correct Interpretation:\n\nIn the lens formula, the magnification formula is \\( m = -\\frac{v}{u} \\), but the signs of v and u are already considered in the formula. For real images, v is positive, and u is negative, leading to \\( m = -\\frac{positive}{negative} = negative \\), indicating an inverted image.\n\nWait, in the calculation above:\n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{60}{-30} = 2 \\quad \\text{(positive)}\n\\]\n\nThis is inconsistent with the expected negative magnification for real, inverted images. There must be a mistake in the sign conventions applied.\n\n### Correct Sign Conventions:\n\n- Object distance (u): negative for real objects (to the left of the lens).\n- Image distance (v): positive for real images (to the right of the lens), negative for virtual images (to the left of the lens).\n- Magnification (m): negative for real, inverted images; positive for virtual, upright images.\n\nGiven that, let's re-calculate magnification correctly.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( u = -30 \\) cm\n- \\( v = 60 \\) cm\n\nThe correct formula for magnification is:\n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{v}{u}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{60}{-30} = 2\n\\]\n\nThis positive magnification suggests an upright image, which contradicts the expected inverted image for real images formed by convex lenses. Therefore, there must be an error in the calculation of image distance (v).\n\n### Re-checking the Lens Formula:\n\nGiven:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the values correctly considering signs:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} - \\frac{1}{-30} = \\frac{1}{20}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{20}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{30}\n\\]\n\nFind a common denominator (60):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{3}{60} - \\frac{2}{60} = \\frac{1}{60}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nv = 60 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThis seems correct, but the magnification is coming out to be positive, which is inconsistent with the expected negative magnification for real, inverted images.\n\n### Possible Mistake:\n\nThe mistake lies in the magnification formula. The correct formula for magnification is:\n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{v}{u}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( u = -30 \\) cm and \\( v = 60 \\) cm:\n\n\\[\nm = -\\frac{60}{-30} = 2\n\\]\n\nThis suggests an upright image, which is incorrect for a real image formed by a convex lens. There is a confusion in the sign conventions.\n\n### Correct Magnification Formula:\n\nActually, the magnification formula is:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{v}{u}\n\\]\n\nWith the signs as per the sign conventions.\n\nGiven \\( v = 60 \\) cm (real image) and \\( u = -30 \\) cm:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{60}{-30} = -2\n\\]\n\nA negative magnification indicates an inverted image, which is correct for a real image formed by a convex lens.\n\n### Recalculating Image Height:\n\n\\[\nh' = m \\times h = -2 \\times 2 = -4 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates inversion, so the image height is 4 cm, inverted.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the correct calculations:\n\n- Image distance: 60 cm (real image)\n- Magnification: -2 (inverted)\n- Image height: 4 cm\n\nHowever, none of the options match this result. Let's re-examine the focal length calculation.\n\n### Re-examining Focal Length:\n\nThe lensmaker's formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nFor a bi-convex lens, both surfaces have the same radius of curvature, but with opposite signs depending on the convention.\n\nIf both surfaces are convex, and assuming the lens is thin, with radii \\( R_1 = 20 \\) cm and \\( R_2 = -20 \\) cm (if the second surface is concave, but for bi-convex, both should be positive).\n\nWait, for a bi-convex lens, both surfaces are convex, so both radii are positive if they curve outwards from the lens.\n\nThus, \\( R_1 = 20 \\) cm and \\( R_2 = 20 \\) cm.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = (1.5 - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{20} \\right) = 0.5 \\times 0 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis suggests \\( f \\) is infinite, which is incorrect.\n\n### Correction:\n\nWait, for a bi-convex lens, both surfaces have positive radii of curvature, but the sign depends on the direction of curvature relative to the incident light.\n\nLet's assume \\( R_1 = 20 \\) cm (first surface convex towards the object) and \\( R_2 = -20 \\) cm (second surface convex towards the image).\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = (1.5 - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{-20} \\right) = 0.5 \\left( \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{20} \\right) = 0.5 \\times \\frac{2}{20} = 0.5 \\times 0.1 = 0.05\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( f = 20 \\) cm, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\n### Revisiting Lens Formula:\n\nGiven \\( f = 20 \\) cm, \\( u = -30 \\) cm:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{20} - \\left( \\frac{1}{-30} \\right) = \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{3}{60} + \\frac{2}{60} = \\frac{5}{60} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( v = 12 \\) cm\n\n### Recalculating Magnification:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{v}{u} = \\frac{12}{-30} = -0.4\n\\]\n\nImage height:\n\n\\[\nh' = m \\times h = -0.4 \\times 2 = -0.8 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates inversion.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe image is real (since \\( v \\) is positive), inverted, with a height of 0.8 cm.\n\nHowever, none of the options match this result exactly. Let's check for possible mistakes.\n\n### Final Check:\n\nGiven the options, it seems there might be an error in the focal length calculation or the lens formula application.\n\nAlternatively, if the lens is bi-convex with both radii equal and positive, the focal length calculation might be different.\n\nLet's consider the lensmaker's formula again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nFor a bi-convex lens, both surfaces are convex, so both \\( R_1 \\) and \\( R_2 \\) are positive.\n\nGiven \\( R_1 = 20 \\) cm and \\( R_2 = 20 \\) cm:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{f} = (1.5 - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{20} \\right) = 0.5 \\times \\frac{1}{10} = 0.05\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( f = 20 \\) cm.\n\nUsing lens formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{20} - \\left( \\frac{1}{-30} \\right) = \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{3}{60} + \\frac{2}{60} = \\frac{5}{60} = \\frac{1}{12}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( v = 12 \\) cm.\n\nMagnification:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{v}{u} = \\frac{12}{-30} = -0.4\n\\]\n\nImage height:\n\n\\[\nh' = m \\times h = -0.4 \\times 2 = -0.8 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nGiven the options, none match exactly, but option A is closest with height = 1 cm.\n\nHowever, based on the calculation, the correct image height should be 0.8 cm, which is not listed.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nGiven the calculations, the image should be real, inverted, with a height of 0.8 cm. Since this does not match any options, and assuming possible rounding or approximation, option A (real, inverted, height = 1 cm) is the closest.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]\n\n### Note:\n\nThere might be a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided, as the calculated image height is 0.8 cm, not matching any options exactly. However, option A is the closest in description."
