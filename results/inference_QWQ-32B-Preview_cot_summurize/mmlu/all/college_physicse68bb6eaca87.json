                    "text": "So here's this problem about an airplane dropping a payload. The plane is flying due north at a constant speed of 100 m/s, and we need to find the velocity of the payload relative to the plane 4.0 seconds after it's released, ignoring air resistance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. When the payload is dropped from the plane, it initially has the same horizontal velocity as the plane because it was moving with the plane before being released. So, right at the moment of release, the payload has a horizontal velocity of 100 m/s north, just like the plane.\n\nBut then, gravity starts acting on the payload, causing it to accelerate downward at 9.8 m/s\u00b2. So, over time, the payload will gain a downward velocity component due to gravity.\n\nThe question is asking for the velocity of the payload relative to the plane after 4.0 seconds. To find the relative velocity, I need to consider the difference between the payload's velocity and the plane's velocity at that moment.\n\nLet's break this down into components. The horizontal component of the payload's velocity remains 100 m/s north, the same as the plane, because there's no horizontal acceleration (ignoring air resistance). So, the horizontal component of the relative velocity is zero.\n\nThe vertical component is due to gravity. The payload starts with zero vertical velocity and accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s\u00b2. So, after 4.0 seconds, the downward velocity of the payload is:\n\nv_down = g * t = 9.8 m/s\u00b2 * 4.0 s = 39.2 m/s \u2248 40 m/s downward.\n\nSince the plane is not moving vertically, its vertical velocity is zero. Therefore, the vertical component of the relative velocity is the same as the payload's vertical velocity, which is 40 m/s downward.\n\nSo, the relative velocity of the payload with respect to the plane is zero horizontally and 40 m/s downward vertically. That means the overall relative velocity is 40 m/s downward.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. 40 m/s down\n\nC. 80 m/s down\n\nD. 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down\n\nOption B seems to match our conclusion. But let's double-check.\n\nWait a minute, option D says 100 m/s north and 40 m/s down. But we determined that the horizontal component of the relative velocity is zero because both the payload and the plane have the same horizontal velocity. So, the relative velocity should only have a downward component of 40 m/s.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct.\n\nI think the key points here are:\n\n1. The payload initially shares the horizontal velocity of the plane.\n\n2. Gravity causes the payload to accelerate downward.\n\n3. Since the plane and payload have the same horizontal velocity, the relative velocity is only in the vertical direction.\n\n4. The vertical velocity after 4 seconds is approximately 40 m/s downward.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 40 m/s down.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
