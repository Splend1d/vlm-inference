                    "text": "Let's see what these terms mean. Artifacts and ecofacts are both important in archaeology, but they have different characteristics.\n\nFirst, artifacts are objects made or modified by humans for a specific purpose. They can tell us a lot about the culture, technology, and lifestyle of past societies. Ecofacts, on the other hand, are natural objects that have been used or influenced by human activities. They can provide information about diet, environment, and subsistence strategies.\n\nOption A says that artifacts are valuable and rare, while ecofacts are easy to come by. While some artifacts are indeed valuable and rare, many are common and not particularly valuable. Ecofacts can also be common, but their value lies in the information they provide about human-environment interactions. So, this option might not be entirely accurate.\n\nOption B states that artifacts decay rapidly, whereas ecofacts last for a long time. Actually, it's often the opposite. Artifacts made from durable materials like stone or metal can last for thousands of years, while ecofacts, such as plant remains or animal bones, may decompose more quickly unless preserved in specific conditions.\n\nOption C says that artifacts are made by humans and exhibit traces of human activity, while ecofacts are natural objects that show evidence of human use or modification. This seems accurate because artifacts are directly created by humans, whereas ecofacts are natural items that have been impacted by human actions.\n\nOption D suggests that artifacts are facts about art, and ecofacts are facts about nature. This is misleading because artifacts can be much more than just art; they include tools, weapons, pottery, and other cultural items. Ecofacts are not necessarily facts about nature but are natural materials affected by human activities.\n\nConsidering these points, option C appears to be the most correct definition for artifacts and ecofacts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
