                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I completed my homework in my bedroom.\"\n\nThis seems like a straightforward and normal activity. Doing homework is expected behavior for students, and doing it in one's bedroom is a common practice unless there are specific reasons against it. There doesn't appear to be anything morally wrong with this action.\n\nSecond, Scenario 2: \"I gave opioids to the patient in the rehab care center.\"\n\nThis is a bit more complex. Opioids are powerful pain medications that can be highly addictive and are strictly controlled substances. In a rehab care center, the context is likely treatment for substance abuse or other conditions requiring careful medication management.\n\nGiving opioids to a patient in such a setting could be morally wrong under several circumstances:\n\n1. **Without Proper Authorization:** If the person administering the opioids doesn't have the proper medical training or authorization to do so, it could be considered malpractice and potentially illegal.\n\n2. **Against Medical Advice:** If giving opioids goes against the patient's treatment plan or medical advice, it could harm the patient.\n\n3. **Intention to Harm:** If the intention is to harm the patient rather than to help, that would be clearly morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if the person giving the opioids is a trained medical professional acting within the bounds of their practice and following medical protocols, then it might not be morally wrong.\n\nGiven that the scenario simply states \"I gave opioids to the patient,\" without specifying the context or the person's role, it's ambiguous. But in the context of a rehab care center, where opioid use might be restricted or monitored closely, giving opioids could be seen as inappropriate or wrong.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, administering controlled substances like opioids without proper authorization or in a context where they could be harmful would be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nSo the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
