                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here, and I need to symbolize the sentence: \"If either George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll.\" The options are:\n\nA. (G \u2283 H) \u2228 I\n\nB. (G \u2228 H) \u2283 I\n\nC. (G \u2283 H) \u2228 ~I\n\nD. (G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sentence clearly. It says that if George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll. So, it's a conditional statement where the condition is \"George enrolls or Harry enrolls,\" and the consequence is \"Ira does not enroll.\"\n\nIn logical terms, a conditional statement is typically symbolized as \"if P, then Q,\" which is P \u2283 Q. So, here, P is \"George enrolls or Harry enrolls,\" and Q is \"Ira does not enroll.\"\n\nNow, let's break it down:\n\n- Let G represent \"George enrolls.\"\n\n- Let H represent \"Harry enrolls.\"\n\n- Let I represent \"Ira enrolls.\"\n\nThe sentence says \"either George enrolls or Harry enrolls,\" which is G \u2228 H.\n\nThen, \"then Ira does not enroll,\" which is ~I.\n\nSo, putting it together, it should be (G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (G \u2283 H) \u2228 I\n\nThis says \"if George enrolls, then Harry enrolls, or Ira enrolls.\" That's not matching the original sentence.\n\nB. (G \u2228 H) \u2283 I\n\nThis says \"if George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira enrolls.\" But the original says Ira does not enroll, so this is incorrect.\n\nC. (G \u2283 H) \u2228 ~I\n\nThis says \"if George enrolls, then Harry enrolls, or Ira does not enroll.\" Again, not matching the original sentence.\n\nD. (G \u2228 H) \u2283 ~I\n\nThis says \"if George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll.\" That matches exactly with the original sentence.\n\nSo, the best symbolization is option D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret it.\n\nSuppose George enrolls and Harry does not enroll. According to the sentence, then Ira does not enroll. Similarly, if Harry enrolls and George does not, Ira does not enroll. And if both George and Harry enroll, Ira does not enroll. Only if neither George nor Harry enroll, there's no condition specified for Ira.\n\nOption D seems to capture that correctly.\n\nOption A: (G \u2283 H) \u2228 I\n\nThis would be true if either \"if George enrolls, then Harry enrolls\" or \"Ira enrolls.\" That's not the same as the original conditional.\n\nOption B: (G \u2228 H) \u2283 I\n\nThis says that if either George or Harry enrolls, then Ira enrolls, which is the opposite of the original sentence.\n\nOption C: (G \u2283 H) \u2228 ~I\n\nThis says that either \"if George enrolls, then Harry enrolls\" or \"Ira does not enroll.\" Again, not the same as the original conditional.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
