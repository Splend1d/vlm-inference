I need to figure out which one best describes the Mafia. I know that the Mafia is like a criminal organization, right? They're involved in all sorts of illegal activities, like extortion, drug dealing, gambling, that kind of thing.\n\nFirst, let's look at option A: white-collar crime. I think white-collar crime refers to non-violent crimes usually committed by business or government professionals in the course of their occupational duties. Things like fraud, embezzlement, that sort of thing. The Mafia does commit crimes, but they're not typically what I think of as white-collar crimes. So, maybe not A.\n\nOption B is organized crime. Now, that sounds pretty relevant. Organized crime usually involves a hierarchical structure, where there are different levels of leadership and members who carry out various criminal activities. The Mafia is known for its structured organization, with families, bosses, underbosses, captains, and soldiers. It seems like a perfect fit for organized crime.\n\nOption C is non-criminal deviance. I'm not entirely sure what that means. Deviance usually refers to behaviors that violate social norms, but not necessarily laws. So, maybe things like eccentric behavior or breaking social conventions without committing a crime. The Mafia, however, is involved in criminal activities, so this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption D is global terrorism. Terrorism is the use of violence or threats to intimidate people, often for political purposes. While the Mafia might use violence, their primary motives are more about making money and maintaining power within their criminal enterprises, not about political agendas. So, probably not terrorism.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems like B, organized crime, is the most appropriate choice. The Mafia is a classic example of an organized crime syndicate with a structured hierarchy and involvement in various illegal activities for profit.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should double-check what each term really means.\n\nWhite-collar crime: These are crimes committed by people of higher social status in the course of their occupational activities, usually involving fraud or embezzlement. The Mafia does commit some financial crimes, but their operations are much broader and more violent.\n\nOrganized crime: This refers to criminal activities carried out by structured groups, often with a leadership hierarchy, and involving ongoing criminal activities like drug trafficking, gambling, prostitution, etc. This aligns closely with the Mafia's modus operandi.\n\nNon-criminal deviance: As I thought, this would be behavior that deviates from social norms but isn't necessarily illegal. The Mafia's activities are illegal, so this doesn't fit.\n\nGlobal terrorism: Terrorism is about instilling fear to achieve political or ideological goals. While the Mafia might be feared, their primary goal is financial gain, not political change.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. organized crime.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
