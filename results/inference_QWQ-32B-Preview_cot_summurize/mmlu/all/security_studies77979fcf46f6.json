                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement doesn't fit with the liberalist view of the international system. First, I should recall what liberalist conception means in this context.\n\nLiberalism in international relations generally emphasizes the role of institutions, interdependence among states, and the potential for cooperation and peaceful conflict resolution. It often contrasts with realism, which tends to focus on power politics and the anarchic nature of the international system.\n\nSo, looking at option A: \"International politics is not the same everywhere; it is only 'realist' in certain places at certain times.\" This seems to suggest that realism is not universally applicable, which aligns with a liberalist perspective that values diverse approaches and recognizes the potential for cooperation beyond realist dynamics.\n\nOption B: \"The nation state does not exist as a unitary actor within the international system.\" Liberalism often acknowledges that states are influenced by various internal actors and interests, so this statement seems consistent with liberalist thoughts.\n\nOption C: \"Nation states are not basically alike.\" Liberalism might argue that states have different characteristics, interests, and capabilities, which influence their behavior in the international system. So, this also seems in line with liberalist conception.\n\nOption D: \"States are and should remain the sole actors to be considered in the study of International Relations.\" Hmm, this sounds more realist, as realism places primary emphasis on states as the main actors in an anarchic international system. Liberalism, on the other hand, often includes other actors such as international organizations, NGOs, and multinational corporations as important players in global affairs.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Some liberalists might still consider states as central, but not necessarily the sole actors. So, perhaps this statement is more restrictive than a typical liberalist view, which would probably argue that while states are important, other actors also play significant roles.\n\nGiven that, option D might be the statement that doesn't align with the liberalist conception of the international system, as liberalism generally embraces a multi-actor approach to international relations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option A is not entirely liberalist because it still acknowledges realist elements in certain contexts. However, liberalism can accommodate that by recognizing that different situations may require different approaches.\n\nSimilarly, options B and C seem clearly consistent with liberalist thoughts.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D, as it restricts the study of international relations to states alone, which contradicts the liberalist inclusion of other actors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
