                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this problem about Wendy Wholesaler and Roberta Retailer. So, there's a dispute, and Roberta needs to prove that Wendy is a \"merchant\" and not just a \"casual party.\" The question is asking for the least important factor indicating that Wendy is a merchant, and there are four options:\n\nA. Is a wholesaler rather than a retailer.\n\nB. Deals in the goods sold to Roberta.\n\nC. Holds herself out as an expert in the goods sold to Roberta.\n\nD. Sells under 10 units a year to Roberta.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what distinguishes a merchant from a casual party. From what I recall, a merchant is someone who deals in goods of a particular type as a regular part of their business, whereas a casual party might sell items occasionally without it being their main line of business.\n\nOption A says that Wendy is a wholesaler rather than a retailer. Wholesalers typically sell goods in large quantities to retailers or other businesses, so being a wholesaler suggests that Wendy is engaged in the business of selling goods, which aligns with the definition of a merchant. So, this seems like an important factor.\n\nOption B states that Wendy deals in the goods sold to Roberta. If Wendy regularly deals in these types of goods, that would support the notion that she is a merchant because she has expertise and is involved in the trade of those goods.\n\nOption C says that Wendy holds herself out as an expert in the goods sold to Roberta. If Wendy presents herself as having knowledge and expertise in the goods, that could indicate that she is a merchant, as merchants are expected to have knowledge about the products they sell.\n\nOption D mentions that Wendy sells under 10 units a year to Roberta. This seems like a low volume of sales. If Wendy only sells a small number of units annually to Roberta, it might suggest that this is not a regular part of her business, which could make her seem more like a casual party than a merchant.\n\nConsidering these points, I think that option D is the least important factor indicating that Wendy is a merchant. In fact, selling under 10 units a year might suggest the opposite\u2014that she is not regularly engaged in the sale of these goods, which could make her seem more like a casual party.\n\nOptions A, B, and C all point towards Wendy being a merchant, while option D suggests the opposite. Therefore, in the context of proving that Wendy is a merchant, the fact that she sells under 10 units a year to Roberta is likely the least important factor, and possibly even works against that assertion.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
