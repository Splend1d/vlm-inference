Show high satisfaction through all the years of marriage\n\nB. Show high satisfaction that steadily declines as the years pass\n\nC. Show lower levels during the years when children are present\n\nD. Show ups and downs throughout the marriage\n\nI need to think about what research says about marital satisfaction over time. I remember from some psychology classes that relationships can go through different phases, and satisfaction isn't always constant.\n\nOption A says that marriages show high satisfaction through all the years. That seems too perfect. I doubt that any marriage remains at peak satisfaction year after year without any dips.\n\nOption B suggests that satisfaction starts high and declines over time. Maybe that's possible, as people might idealize the early stages of marriage, and as time passes, reality sets in, leading to declining satisfaction.\n\nOption C points to lower satisfaction when children are present. That makes sense because raising children can bring a lot of stress and challenges that might affect marital satisfaction.\n\nOption D says there are ups and downs throughout the marriage. This seems the most realistic to me, as relationships naturally have good times and challenging times.\n\nBut I need to consider which one is most accurate for long-lasting marriages.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the idea that marriages that last long might have learned to cope with challenges, and thus their satisfaction might not decline as much over time compared to marriages that end in divorce.\n\nI recall a concept called the \"marriage cycle\" or \"relationship cycle,\" which suggests that relationships go through phases of rising and falling satisfaction.\n\nAlso, there's the idea of the \"seven-year itch,\" suggesting that around seven years into the marriage, satisfaction might dip, possibly leading some couples to consider separation.\n\nBut in long-lasting marriages, perhaps they navigate through those dips and come out stronger.\n\nMaybe option D is the best answer, as it acknowledges that there are ups and downs, but the marriage persists through them.\n\nOption C could be partially true, but it's probably not the overall pattern for all long-lasting marriages.\n\nOption A seems too idealistic, and option B suggests a steady decline, which might not be the case in enduring marriages.\n\nI think that in long-lasting marriages, couples experience fluctuations in satisfaction but find ways to work through challenges, leading to resilience in their relationship.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option D: Show ups and downs throughout the marriage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
