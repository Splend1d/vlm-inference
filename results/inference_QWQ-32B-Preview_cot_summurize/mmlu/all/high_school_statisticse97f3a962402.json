The school buses students from urban, suburban, and rural communities. Let's see what each option means and which one makes the most sense.\n\nFirst, there's a convenience sample. That's when you just pick the easiest or most accessible participants. For example, maybe interviewing only the students who are hanging out in the cafeteria during lunch. But that might not represent all students because different types of students might hang out in different places or at different times.\n\nNext, there's a simple random sample, or SRS. This is where every student in the school has an equal chance of being selected, regardless of their background or which class they're in. You could maybe assign each student a number and then randomly pick numbers from a hat or use a random number generator. This seems fair, but I wonder if it accounts for the differences between urban, suburban, and rural students.\n\nThen, there's a stratified sample. This method involves dividing the population into subgroups, or strata, based on certain characteristics, and then sampling from each stratum proportionally or equally. In this case, the strata could be the different communities: urban, suburban, and rural. Or maybe the different tracking classes: honors, regular, and below-grade. This seems like it could capture the diverse perspectives of students from different backgrounds and academic tracks.\n\nLastly, there's a systematic sample. This is where you select every kth member of the population after a random starting point. For example, choosing every 10th student from an alphabetical list. This can be easy to do, but it might introduce some bias if there's a pattern in the list that corresponds with every 10th student.\n\nNow, considering the goal is to study attitudes toward tracking in different classes, and the student population comes from diverse backgrounds, I think a stratified sample would be the most appropriate. This way, you can ensure that you're getting responses from students in honors, regular, and below-grade classes, as well as from urban, suburban, and rural communities. This should give a more comprehensive view of the attitudes across the different groups.\n\nAlternatively, a simple random sample could also work, but there's a chance that it might not proportionally represent all groups, especially if some groups are smaller than others. With a stratified sample, you can make sure that each subgroup is adequately represented.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Stratified sample.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
