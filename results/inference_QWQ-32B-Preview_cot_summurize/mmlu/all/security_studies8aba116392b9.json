                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out when an issue might fail to become securitized. There are four options here, and I need to pick the one that best explains when securitization doesn't happen. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what securitization means. From what I recall, securitization is a process where a political actor frames an issue as a security threat, which then justifies extraordinary measures to address it. It's like when someone says, \"This is an emergency, and we need special actions to handle it.\"\n\nNow, option A says: \"When the general public is not convinced of the legitimacy of the proposed threat.\" So, if people don't believe that the issue is really a threat, then it won't be securitized. That makes sense because if no one thinks it's a big deal, why would they accept extraordinary measures?\n\nOption B: \"When, following the discursive element of the process, extraordinary measures are not implemented.\" This one is a bit tricky. The discursive element refers to the way the issue is talked about or framed as a security threat. So, even if it's framed as a threat, if nothing actually changes or if the measures aren't put in place, maybe the securitization fails.\n\nOption C: \"When the securitizing actor is not granted the special right to implement extraordinary measures.\" This seems similar to option A but focuses on the actor rather than the public. So, if the actor who's trying to securitize the issue isn't given the authority to take extra measures, then securitization fails.\n\nOption D: \"When the audience are convinced via the speech act or the securitizing actor but fail to grant that actor the special rights requested in order to address the proposed threat.\" This one combines elements of A and C. The audience is convinced it's a threat but doesn't give the actor the power to do anything about it.\n\nHmm. Let's think about this. In securitization theory, there are three main components: the securitizing actor, the audience, and the threat. The actor presents the threat in a way that convinces the audience to accept extraordinary measures.\n\nSo, for securitization to fail, something has to go wrong in this process. Maybe the actor doesn't convince the audience, or maybe the audience doesn't grant the actor the power to act.\n\nOption A focuses on the audience not being convinced of the threat's legitimacy. That seems like a key failure point. If the audience doesn't buy that there's a threat, there's no reason to securitize it.\n\nOption B mentions that extraordinary measures aren't implemented after the discursive element. But maybe the measures are implemented, but they're not effective, or something else happens. It's a bit vague.\n\nOption C is about the securitizing actor not being granted special rights. This seems similar to option D, but D specifies that the audience is convinced but doesn't grant the special rights.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the difference is that in option A, the audience isn't convinced of the threat, whereas in option D, they are convinced but don't grant the special rights.\n\nSo, securitization might fail at different stages. First, the audience has to accept that there's a threat, and second, they have to accept granting special powers to handle it.\n\nPerhaps both are necessary for securitization to succeed. If either the audience doesn't accept the threat or doesn't grant the special powers, securitization fails.\n\nGiven that, option D seems like a specific case where the audience is convinced of the threat but doesn't grant the special rights. That would indeed lead to securitization failing because, without the special rights, the actor can't implement the extraordinary measures needed to address the threat.\n\nOption C is similar but doesn't specify that the audience is convinced. It just says the actor isn't granted the special right, which could happen for various reasons, including the audience not being convinced in the first place.\n\nOption A is more about the initial acceptance of the threat's legitimacy, which is a prerequisite for securitization.\n\nSo, perhaps the question is asking for a specific scenario where the audience is convinced of the threat but still doesn't grant the special rights.\n\nThat would make option D the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider the question again: \"When may an issue fail to become securitized?\"\n\nIt's asking for a condition under which securitization fails. And option D describes a situation where the audience is convinced but doesn't grant the special rights.\n\nIs that the only way securitization can fail? No, because if the audience isn't convinced in the first place, securitization also fails.\n\nSo, maybe the question is looking for a more specific scenario, perhaps one that distinguishes between the audience's acceptance of the threat and their granting of special rights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering that the audience can be convinced of the threat but still refuse to grant the special rights, perhaps due to other political considerations or checks and balances.\n\nIn that case, option D would indeed represent a failure of securitization, even though the audience acknowledges the threat.\n\nComparing option D to option A, option A is about the audience not being convinced of the threat, which is a different failure point.\n\nSo, perhaps the question is designed to test the understanding that securitization requires both acceptance of the threat and granting of special rights.\n\nTherefore, both option A and option D could represent failures of securitization, but the question seems to be asking for a single answer.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to highlight that even if the audience accepts the threat, securitization can still fail if the special rights aren't granted.\n\nThat would make option D the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that without the special rights, the extraordinary measures can't be implemented, which is essential for securitization.\n\nLooking back at option B, it mentions that extraordinary measures are not implemented following the discursive element.\n\nThis seems related to option D, but option B doesn't specify why the measures aren't implemented. It could be because the audience didn't grant the special rights, or perhaps for other reasons.\n\nOption C is similar to option D but doesn't specify the audience's conviction.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think option D is the most precise answer because it specifies that the audience is convinced of the threat but doesn't grant the special rights, leading to the failure of securitization.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
