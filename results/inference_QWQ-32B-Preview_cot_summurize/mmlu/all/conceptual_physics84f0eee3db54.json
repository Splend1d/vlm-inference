                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about interference. It asks, \"The phenomenon of interference occurs for\" and gives options A. sound waves, B. light waves, C. both of these, D. neither of these. I need to decide which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what interference is. Interference is when two or more waves meet and combine in a way that their amplitudes add up or cancel each other out. This can create patterns like constructive interference, where the waves reinforce each other, or destructive interference, where they cancel each other.\n\nNow, does this happen with sound waves? I know that sound is a wave, specifically a pressure wave that travels through a medium like air. When two sound waves meet, they can interfere with each other. For example, if you have two speakers playing the same tone, at certain points in the room, the sound might seem louder because the waves are in phase and constructively interfering. At other points, the sound might be quieter or even cancelled out if the waves are out of phase and destructively interfering. So, interference definitely occurs with sound waves.\n\nWhat about light waves? Light is an electromagnetic wave, and it also exhibits interference. A classic example is Young's double-slit experiment, where light passing through two slits interferes with itself, creating a pattern of bright and dark bands on a screen. This demonstrates that light waves can constructive and destructively interfere just like sound waves.\n\nSo, both sound waves and light waves exhibit interference. That would suggest that option C, \"both of these,\" is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where interference doesn't occur for either of these waves? Well, interference is a fundamental property of waves, and both sound and light are waves, so it's expected that they both exhibit interference. I can't think of a situation where interference doesn't occur for these types of waves under the right conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Both of these.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
