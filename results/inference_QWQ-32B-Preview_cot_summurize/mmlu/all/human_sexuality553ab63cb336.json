                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Joe and his relationships, and it's related to attachment theory. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, let's understand what attachment theory is. Attachment theory is a psychological concept that was originally developed by John Bowlby to explain the dynamics of long-term relationships between humans. It's particularly known for its focus on the relationships between children and their caregivers, but it's also been extended to adult relationships.\n\nIn the context of adult relationships, attachment styles are generally categorized into a few main types: secure, anxious-ambivalent, avoidant, and sometimes a fourth style called disorganized. Each of these styles is thought to develop based on early experiences with primary caregivers and influences how people interact in their romantic relationships later on.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. a secure lover\n\nB. an avoidant lover\n\nC. an anxious-ambivalent lover\n\nD. a passionate lover\n\nI notice that \"passionate lover\" isn't one of the standard attachment styles I'm familiar with, so maybe it's included here for some other reason, but I'll keep it in mind.\n\nLet's look at the description of Joe. It says that Joe wants desperately to get close to Helen, but Helen seems put off by his desperate advances. Moreover, this is typical of Joe's relationships with women. So, Joe is someone who really craves closeness and intimacy but his approach seems to push people away.\n\nComparing this to the attachment styles:\n\n1. Secure lovers are comfortable with intimacy and independence. They don't worry much about being abandoned or about getting too close to someone. They have a healthy balance between needing connection and maintaining their own space.\n\n2. Avoidant lovers tend to be uncomfortable with intimacy and are more independent. They might prioritize their personal freedom over emotional connection and can be distant in relationships.\n\n3. Anxious-ambivalent lovers really crave closeness and are often worried about being abandoned or rejected. They might be clingy or needy in their relationships, which can push partners away.\n\n4. Passionate lover isn't a standard attachment style, so perhaps it's not the right answer here.\n\nGiven Joe's behavior\u2014desperately wanting to get close to Helen and being typical in his relationships\u2014it sounds like he is anxious-ambivalent. His desperate advances suggest that he really wants intimacy but maybe doesn't go about it in the most effective way, which could be why Helen is put off.\n\nOn the other hand, if Joe were avoidant, he would probably not be making such desperate advances because avoidant types are more likely to pull back from intimacy. And secure types wouldn't be desperate; they'd be more relaxed about getting close.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the best answer is C. an anxious-ambivalent lover.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. Desperate advances suggest a strong desire for closeness, which is characteristic of anxious-ambivalent attachment. Avoidant types would likely not be making such advances, and secure types wouldn't be desperate about it.\n\nTherefore, C seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
