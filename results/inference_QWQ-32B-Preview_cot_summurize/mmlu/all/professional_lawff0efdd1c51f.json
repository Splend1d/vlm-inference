                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a land transaction, and there's a bit of a mix-up in the offer letter. Let's break it down step by step to understand what's going on and determine which option is correct regarding the legal consequences.\n\nFirst, the buyer sends a letter offering $2,200 per acre for the parcel of land, but it turns out that the buyer actually intended to offer $2,000 per acre but made a typo. The owner receives this letter and replies, accepting the offer as stated, which is $2,200 per acre. Both parties are aware that similar land in the area has been selling between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the probable legal consequences of this correspondence. There are four options:\n\nA. There is no contract because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.\n\nB. There is no enforceable contract because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake as to a basic assumption.\n\nC. There is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as the buyer intended.\n\nD. There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A suggests that there is no contract because the parties have different understandings of the price term. The buyer intended to offer $2,000 but typed $2,200, and the owner accepted $2,200. So, there is a discrepancy between what the buyer meant to say and what was actually communicated. However, in contract law, the objective theory of contracts generally applies, which means that the meaning of a contract is determined by the outward expressions of intent, not the subjective intentions of the parties.\n\nSo, based on the objective theory, the owner's acceptance of $2,200 would seem to create a contract at that price, regardless of the buyer's intention to offer a lower price. Therefore, option A might not be correct.\n\nOption B proposes that there is no enforceable contract because of a mutual mistake regarding a basic assumption. A mutual mistake is when both parties are mistaken about a fundamental fact that is essential to the contract. In this case, the buyer mistakenly typed $2,200 instead of $2,000, but the owner understood the offer to be $2,200 and accepted it.\n\nHowever, for a mutual mistake to void a contract, both parties must share the same mistaken belief about a material fact. Here, the buyer made a unilateral mistake in typing the wrong amount, but the owner understood and accepted the higher price. So, it's not a mutual mistake because the owner didn't share the same mistaken belief; they understood the offer as $2,200.\n\nTherefore, option B might not be correct either.\n\nOption C states that there is a contract formed at $2,000 per acre, reflecting the buyer's true intention. This would require that the buyer's mistake be rectified, essentially allowing them to correct the typo and proceed with the lower price.\n\nHowever, under the objective theory of contracts, the parties are bound by the terms they outwardly express, not their internal intentions. So, even if the buyer made a typo, the owner relied on the terms as stated in the letter, which was $2,200 per acre.\n\nAllowing the buyer to rescind or correct the offer after acceptance could undermine the certainty and reliance interests in contract formation. Therefore, option C seems unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nOption D asserts that there is a contract formed at $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention. This aligns with the objective theory of contracts, where the meaning of the contract is based on the objective expression of the parties, not their subjective intentions.\n\nGiven that the owner accepted the offer as communicated, which was $2,200 per acre, and there's no indication that the owner knew about the buyer's mistake, it seems that the contract should be enforced at $2,200 per acre.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that comparable land has been selling between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre suggests that $2,200 is within the reasonable range, so it's not an absurd or unrealistic price that would indicate a mistake.\n\nTherefore, option D appears to be the most probable legal consequence in this scenario.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because, under the objective theory, the different subjective intentions don't necessarily void the contract.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because there isn't a mutual mistake; the owner understood and accepted the offer as stated.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because it would require correcting a unilaterally mistaken expression, which isn't typically allowed once acceptance has occurred.\n\n- Option D is correct because the contract should be enforced based on the terms as communicated and accepted, which is $2,200 per acre.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
