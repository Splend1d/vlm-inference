                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out Cobb's weighted average cost of goods sold for May. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, Cobb Inc. started May with 200 units in inventory, costing a total of $1250. So, the beginning inventory is $1250 for 200 units. That means the cost per unit at the beginning was $1250 divided by 200 units, which is $6.25 per unit.\n\nThen, during May, Cobb made two purchases:\n\n- On May 4, they bought 20 units at $5.80 each, totaling $116.\n\n- On May 17, they bought 80 units at $5.50 each, totaling $440.\n\nSo, total purchases during May are 20 + 80 = 100 units, costing $116 + $440 = $556.\n\nNow, Cobb sold 10 units on May 14 for $120. But since they use the periodic inventory method, they won't update their inventory records until the end of the period. So, I need to calculate the cost of goods sold based on the weighted average cost at the end of May.\n\nTo find the weighted average cost, I need to find the total cost of all units available for sale and divide that by the total number of units available for sale.\n\nFirst, let's find the total cost of all units available for sale:\n\n Beginning inventory: $1250\n\n Purchases: $556\n\n Total cost = $1250 + $556 = $1806\n\nNow, total units available for sale:\n\n Beginning units: 200\n\n Purchased units: 100\n\n Total units = 200 + 100 = 300 units\n\nSo, the weighted average cost per unit is total cost divided by total units:\n\n $1806 / 300 units = $6.02 per unit\n\nNow, Cobb sold 10 units, so the cost of goods sold would be 10 units times the weighted average cost per unit.\n\n Cost of goods sold = 10 units * $6.02/unit = $60.20\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $60.20\n\nB. $62.10\n\nC. $62.50\n\nD. $65\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I did this correctly. Maybe I need to consider the sale date and the purchases before that.\n\nCobb sold 10 units on May 14, and the purchases were on May 4 and May 17. Since it's periodic inventory, I think I did it right by considering all units available at the end of the month and then calculating the weighted average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the units on hand at the time of sale, but with periodic inventory, I think the method I used is correct.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm.\n\nCalculate the total units available for sale: beginning inventory + purchases = 200 + 20 + 80 = 300 units.\n\nTotal cost: $1250 + $116 + $440 = $1806.\n\nWeighted average cost per unit: $1806 / 300 = $6.02.\n\nCost of goods sold: 10 units * $6.02 = $60.20.\n\nYes, that matches option A.\n\nI think I'm good here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA. $60.20\n\n**Explanation**\n\nTo determine Cobb's weighted average cost of goods sold for May, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the total cost of beginning inventory and purchases:**\n   - Beginning inventory: 200 units at $1250.\n   - Purchase on May 4: 20 units at $5.80 each ($116 total).\n   - Purchase on May 17: 80 units at $5.50 each ($440 total).\n   - Total cost = $1250 + $116 + $440 = $1806.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of units available for sale:**\n   - Beginning units: 200\n   - Purchased units: 20 + 80 = 100\n   - Total units = 200 + 100 = 300 units.\n\n3. **Determine the weighted average cost per unit:**\n   - Weighted average cost per unit = Total cost / Total units = $1806 / 300 = $6.02 per unit.\n\n4. **Calculate the cost of goods sold:**\n   - Units sold: 10\n   - Cost of goods sold = Units sold * Weighted average cost per unit = 10 * $6.02 = $60.20.\n\nTherefore, the weighted average cost of goods sold for May is $60.20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA. $60.20"
