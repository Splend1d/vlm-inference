                    "text": "So I've got this question here about what the first step should be for a group designing training programs for outplaced workers to fill existing jobs in community organizations. The options are:\n\nA. Determine the skill levels and job satisfaction of currently employed people in the community.\n\nB. Evaluate the self-esteem of each outplaced worker.\n\nC. Perform job analyses for all jobs for which training will be offered.\n\nD. Develop training objectives for all jobs for which training will be offered.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step. The goal is to design training programs to help outplaced workers get jobs in community organizations. So, the focus is on matching these workers with available jobs and preparing them with the necessary skills.\n\nOption A suggests determining the skill levels and job satisfaction of currently employed people in the community. While this might be useful information, it's not directly relevant to the needs of the outplaced workers or the jobs they're trying to fill. The current employees' job satisfaction might not have a direct impact on the training needs of the outplaced workers.\n\nOption B is about evaluating the self-esteem of each outplaced worker. While self-esteem is important for overall well-being and can affect job performance, it might not be the first priority when designing training programs. The immediate focus should be on the skills and knowledge needed for the jobs, rather than the psychological state of each individual worker, unless there's a specific reason to believe that low self-esteem is a barrier to their employment.\n\nOption C proposes performing job analyses for all jobs for which training will be offered. Job analysis is a fundamental step in any training program design because it helps identify the specific skills, knowledge, and abilities required for each job. This information is crucial for determining what should be included in the training curriculum.\n\nOption D is about developing training objectives for all jobs for which training will be offered. While this is also important, it seems to come after job analysis. You need to know what the job requires before you can set objectives for the training.\n\nSo, logically, the first step should be to understand what the jobs entail, which is job analysis. Once you have that information, you can then set specific training objectives based on those requirements.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning. If we do job analysis first, we can identify the necessary skills and knowledge for each job. Then, we can develop training objectives that address gaps between what the outplaced workers currently know and what is required for the jobs. This seems like a solid approach.\n\nComparing this with the other options, assessing the skill levels of current employees (option A) might not be directly helpful, as the focus should be on the jobs and the outplaced workers. Evaluating self-esteem (option B) is more about the individuals' psychological state and may not be as immediately relevant as understanding the job requirements. Developing training objectives (option D) comes after knowing what needs to be trained, which is determined through job analysis.\n\nTherefore, it seems that option C, performing job analyses for all jobs for which training will be offered, is the first step the group should take.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
