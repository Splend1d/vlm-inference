                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about the rational-economic model of decision-making. It's asking which assumption the model is based on. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that decision-makers place more emphasis on the costs of certain decisions than on other consequences. Hmm, the rational-economic model is about making decisions that maximize utility or benefit, considering both costs and benefits. So, it's not just about costs; it's about balancing costs and benefits. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B says that decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions. That sounds familiar. In economics, the rational model often assumes that people have perfect information. So, they know everything about all possible options and what each one leads to. That seems like a key assumption.\n\nOption C says that individuals are better than groups at making decisions, especially under stressful conditions. Wait, the rational-economic model is more about how decisions are made based on rational calculations, not about whether individuals or groups are better at decision-making. This seems off track.\n\nOption D says that decision-makers\u2019 knowledge about possible alternatives is always incomplete. That's interesting. But if the rational model assumes complete information, then this would be the opposite. So, probably not the correct choice.\n\nLet me think again. The rational-economic model is based on the idea that people make decisions by weighing the costs and benefits and choosing the option that maximizes their utility. For this to work, they need to know all the alternatives and all the consequences of each alternative. So, having complete information is crucial for this model.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is Option B: decision-makers have complete information about all alternatives and their consequences before making decisions.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options aren't fitting.\n\nOption A is too narrow because the model isn't just about costs; it's about both costs and benefits.\n\nOption C is about individual vs. group decision-making, which isn't directly related to the rational-economic model's assumptions.\n\nOption D suggests incomplete information, which actually contradicts the rational model's assumption of complete information.\n\nSo, Option B seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
