Martin Luther.\n\nThe Lutheran Church is named after Martin Luther, a German theologian and ecclesiastical reformer who sparked the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. Luther's ideas and teachings led to the establishment of Lutheranism as a distinct branch of Christianity.\n\nLet me explain a bit more about why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Martin Luther King Jr: He was a prominent leader in the African American civil rights movement and a Baptist minister. While he shares the surname \"Luther,\" he is not associated with the founding of the Lutheran Church.\n\nC. Luther Vandross: He was an American singer, songwriter, and record producer, best known for his soulful voice and contributions to popular music. He has no connection to the Lutheran Church.\n\nD. Lex Luthor: He is a fictional character in DC Comics, often portrayed as a supervillain and a nemesis of Superman. He has no relation to the Lutheran Church.\n\nSo, to summarize, the Lutheran Church is named after Martin Luther, the key figure in the Protestant Reformation.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nMartin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben, Germany. He was a monk, priest, and professor of theology who strongly criticized the Roman Catholic Church's practices, particularly the sale of indulgences. In 1517, he famously posted his Ninety-Five Theses on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, which challenged the church's authority and sparked widespread debate and reform.\n\nLuther's translation of the Bible into German also played a significant role in shaping the German language and making the scriptures accessible to the common people. His theological contributions, including the doctrines of justification by faith alone and the priesthood of all believers, became foundational to Lutheranism.\n\nToday, Lutheranism is one of the largest branches of Protestantism, with millions of members worldwide. It is known for its emphasis on scripture as the authority in matters of faith and its distinctive theological perspectives.\n\n**Key Figures and Developments:**\n\n- **Philip Melanchthon:** A close associate of Luther, he played a crucial role in systematizing Lutheran theology and\u7f16\u5199\u4e86\u300a\u5965\u683c\u65af\u5821\u4fe1\u6761\u300b\uff08Augsburg Confession\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u8def\u5fb7\u5b97\u4fe1\u4ef0\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u58f0\u660e\u3002\n\n- **The Book of Concord:** This is a collection of Lutheran confessional documents, including the Augsburg Confession, which provides a comprehensive statement of Lutheran beliefs.\n\n- **Lutheran Churches Today:** There are various Lutheran denominations around the world, each with its own governance structure and practices. Some notable ones include the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod (LCMS), and the Church of Sweden.\n\nUnderstanding the historical and theological context of the Lutheran Church helps appreciate its significance in the broader landscape of Christianity.\n\n**Further Reading:**\n\n- \"Here I Stand: A Life of Martin Luther\" by Roland H. Bainton\n\n- \"Luther: Hero or Heretic?\" by Eric Metaxas\n\n- \"The Cambridge Companion to Martin Luther\" edited by Donald K. McKim\n\nThese resources can provide deeper insights into Martin Luther's life, his reforms, and the development of Lutheranism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Lutheran Church is named after Martin Luther, the influential theologian and reformer whose ideas and actions led to the Protestant Reformation. His critique of certain Catholic practices and his emphasis on scripture and faith have shaped the beliefs and practices of Lutheranism, which remains a significant branch of Christianity today.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
