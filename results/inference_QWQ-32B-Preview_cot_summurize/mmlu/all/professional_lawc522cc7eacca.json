                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this legal problem. It seems a bit complicated, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are three parcels of land on a mountain: A, B, and C. The woman owns A, which is the highest, and her sister owns C, which is the lowest. Parcel B is in between them. Originally, the woman owned all three parcels, and in 2000, she built a private drainage system that ran across all three parcels, draining sewage from A to a municipal sewer at the bottom of the mountain.\n\nThen, in 2005, the woman sold parcel C to her sister, and the deed didn't mention the drainage system. Now, part of the sister's land (parcel C) is subsiding because of the drainage system, likely due to the soil being too pliable or soft.\n\nThe sister is suing the woman for property damage caused by this subsidence. We need to decide who should win the judgment.\n\nThe answer choices are:\n\nA. The sister, because she is entitled to lateral support for her land in its natural condition.\n\nB. The sister, because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.\n\nC. The sister, because she is entitled to support for her land in its improved condition.\n\nD. The woman, unless the sister proves that the woman was negligent in constructing the drainage system.\n\nOkay, so this seems to be about the rights to support for land when there are adjacent or underlying properties.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between lateral and subjacent support.\n\nLateral support refers to the right of a landowner to have their land supported by the adjacent land of their neighbor. So, if someone excavates their land and causes their neighbor's land to collapse, the neighbor can claim damages for the loss of lateral support.\n\nSubjacent support, on the other hand, refers to the right of a landowner to have their land supported by the underlying land beneath it. This is more about the subsoil and the foundation.\n\nIn this case, the sister's land (parcel C) is subsiding over the drainage system, which is underground. So, it seems like the issue is with the subsoil supporting her land.\n\nGiven that, subjacent support might be more relevant here.\n\nBut let's look at the options more closely.\n\nOption A mentions lateral support for the land in its natural condition. Option B mentions subjacent support for the land in its natural condition. Option C mentions support for the land in its improved condition.\n\nOption D says the woman wins unless the sister proves negligence in constructing the drainage system.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"natural condition\" means. I think it refers to the land before any improvements or alterations were made by the owners.\n\nIn this case, both parcels A and C have homes built on them, so their improved condition includes these structures.\n\nThe problem states that the subsidence is due to an especially pliable soil condition that the woman was unaware of prior to constructing the drainage system.\n\nSo, the woman built the drainage system without knowing about the soil issues.\n\nNow, I need to think about the sister's rights regarding the support of her land.\n\nIf the sister is entitled to lateral or subjacent support for her land in its natural condition, that might mean that any alterations by the woman that affect the natural support are liable.\n\nBut, since the drainage system was built when the woman owned all three parcels, including C, it's possible that at that time, there was no issue because she owned everything.\n\nHowever, later, she sold C to her sister, and the deed didn't mention the drainage system.\n\nSo, now, the sister is the new owner of C, and the drainage system is already in place, affecting her land.\n\nThe subsidence is happening because of the drainage system, which is underground, so it's affecting the subsoil.\n\nGiven that, subjacent support might be the relevant legal concept here.\n\nI recall that in property law, there is a general rule that a landowner has the right to the natural support from the underlying land of the neighbor.\n\nMeaning, if you have land above a certain subsoil, you have the right to have that subsoil support your land in its natural condition.\n\nIf someone alters the subsoil, say by digging out material, and that causes your land to subside, you can claim damages for the loss of subjacent support.\n\nIn this case, the woman installed an underground drainage system, which might have altered the subsoil, leading to subsidence on parcel C.\n\nSo, the sister might have a claim for loss of subjacent support.\n\nBut, there's a complication here: when the woman built the drainage system, she owned all three parcels, including C.\n\nSo, at that time, she was not interfering with anyone else's support because she owned everything.\n\nBut then, she sold C to her sister, and now, as separate owners, the sister is claiming damage.\n\nI need to think about whether the fact that the woman owned all the land at the time of construction affects the sister's rights now.\n\nPerhaps, since the drainage system was built when the woman owned all the land, and she sold C without mentioning the system, the sister might have certain rights or expectations about the condition of the land.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that the soil condition was especially pliable, and the woman was unaware of it before constructing the drainage system.\n\nSo, it seems like the subsidence was not intentional or known to the woman at the time of construction.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the sister has a claim based on the right to subjacent support.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Lateral support in natural condition.\n\nB. Subjacent support in natural condition.\n\nC. Support for improved condition.\n\nD. Woman wins unless sister proves negligence.\n\nI think lateral support is more about the physical side-to-side support from adjacent land, whereas subjacent is about the underlying support.\n\nSince the issue is with the subsoil due to the underground drainage system, subjacent support seems more appropriate.\n\nOption C mentions support for the land in its improved condition. I'm not sure about that. I think the general rule is that you're entitled to support for the land in its natural condition, not necessarily for any improvements.\n\nImprovements are considered at your own risk, in a way.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is not correct.\n\nOption D says the woman wins unless the sister proves negligence in constructing the drainage system.\n\nWell, if the sister can prove negligence, then maybe the woman is liable.\n\nBut, in this case, the woman was unaware of the soil condition before constructing the system.\n\nSo, it might be difficult for the sister to prove negligence.\n\nBut, perhaps negligence is not required for a claim of loss of support.\n\nI need to think about the principles of property law here.\n\nIn property law, the rule is that you have a right to the natural support from adjacent or underlying land.\n\nIf someone alters that support, causing damage to your land, you can recover damages, regardless of whether the alteration was negligent or not.\n\nIt's more of a strict liability thing.\n\nSo, in that sense, maybe the sister can claim damages based on the loss of subjacent support, without needing to prove negligence.\n\nBut, in this case, since the woman owned all the land at the time of construction, maybe the rules are different.\n\nPerhaps, by selling parcel C to her sister, she impliedly warranted that the land was free from defects caused by her own actions, like installing the drainage system.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a doctrine of covenants or easements by implication here.\n\nWait, the deed to the sister didn't mention the drainage system.\n\nSo, perhaps the sister didn't know about the drainage system when she bought C.\n\nIf that's the case, and the drainage system is causing damage to her land, she might have a claim against the woman for not disclosing this important feature.\n\nBut, I think the question is focusing more on the right to support.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nOption A: lateral support in natural condition.\n\nOption B: subjacent support in natural condition.\n\nOption C: support for improved condition.\n\nOption D: woman wins unless sister proves negligence.\n\nGiven that the issue is with the subsoil due to an underground drainage system, subjacent support seems most relevant.\n\nTherefore, option B might be correct.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the sister is entitled to support for the land in its natural condition.\n\nIf she has improvements on the land, like the ranch-style home, those improvements are at her own risk, unless the woman did something negligent.\n\nSo, perhaps option C is not correct because support for improved condition isn't typically guaranteed.\n\nOption D suggests that the woman wins unless the sister proves negligence.\n\nBut, if the sister can claim damages based on the loss of subjacent support, regardless of negligence, then maybe option D isn't correct.\n\nTherefore, I think option B is the right answer: the sister should win because she is entitled to subjacent support for her land in its natural condition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
