Given that angle B measures 110 degrees in parallelogram ABCD, we can use these properties to find the measure of angle C.\n\nFirst, since ABCD is a parallelogram, angle B and angle D are opposite angles, so angle D also measures 110 degrees. Similarly, angles A and C are opposite angles and therefore equal.\n\nNext, because angles B and C are consecutive angles in the parallelogram, they must be supplementary. Therefore, the sum of angle B and angle C is 180 degrees.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\nangle B + angle C = 180 degrees\n\nGiven that angle B is 110 degrees:\n\n110 degrees + angle C = 180 degrees\n\nSubtracting 110 degrees from both sides:\n\nangle C = 180 degrees - 110 degrees = 70 degrees\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle C is 70 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{70} \\]"
