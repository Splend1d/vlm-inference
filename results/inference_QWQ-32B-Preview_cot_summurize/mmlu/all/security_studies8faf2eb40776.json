Environmental change can be a cause of war between countries, largely centred on resource scarcity interrelated with conflict. There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity.\nB. Population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation can lead to environmentally caused conflict. There is therefore a linear link between population growth and environmental change, and environmental change is the critical determinant in the production of violence.\nC. Common findings in research organizations investigating environmental violence have failed to find quantifiable relationships between environmental and social variables and the cause of war. Analysis of aggregated data failed to establish a common causal mechanism. The extensity of possible variables being simply too vast, mitigating any definitive relationship.\nD. Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.\n"

So, I need to consider which option best explains the relationship between environmental change, resources, population growth, and conflict, particularly from the perspective of strong states.\n\nOption A suggests that environmental change, especially resource scarcity, can lead to war between countries. It also mentions that inequity in resource distribution can cause violence. This seems plausible because resources like water, oil, and minerals are often sources of conflict. Strong states might be concerned about this because they have the power and interest in maintaining stability and controlling resources.\n\nOption B focuses on population growth and its impact on environmental degradation, which can lead to conflict. It suggests a direct link between population growth and environmental change, which in turn causes violence. While population growth does put pressure on resources, attributing conflict solely to this factor might be too simplistic. Strong states might view population growth in weaker states as a security concern, but I'm not sure if this is the primary concern for environmental security agendas.\n\nOption C states that research has failed to find a clear relationship between environmental and social variables and the cause of war. It mentions that the complexity of variables makes it hard to establish a definitive link. This seems realistic because conflict is usually multifaceted, involving political, economic, and social factors beyond just environmental issues. For strong states, this might mean that while environmental factors are important, they are just one piece of the puzzle in security considerations.\n\nOption D suggests that strong states are less prone to internal violent conflicts, whereas transitioning states are more vulnerable. It also says that environmental change isn't likely to cause war but can contribute to it. This seems balanced, acknowledging that environmental factors can play a role in conflict but are not the sole determinants. Strong states might have better capacity to manage environmental issues and therefore avoid conflicts, but they still need to consider environmental security in their agendas.\n\nConsidering these options, I think Option D best answers the question. It recognizes that while environmental change can be a contributory factor to conflict, it's not the primary cause, especially for strong states that have the resources and stability to manage environmental challenges. Strong states might include environmental security in their agendas to prevent conflicts in weaker states that could have spillover effects or to maintain their own resource security.\n\nHowever, Option A also has merit because resource scarcity can indeed lead to international conflicts, which would be a concern for strong states. But Option D seems more comprehensive as it considers both internal and external factors and the role of environmental change in the context of broader security issues.\n\nMaybe I should consider what environmental security means for strong states. Environmental security is part of a broader agenda that includes protecting national interests, maintaining stability, and ensuring access to resources. For strong states, this might involve managing their own environmental degradation to prevent internal conflicts, as well as addressing global environmental issues that could lead to conflicts in other regions.\n\nOption C highlights the complexity of establishing a direct link between environmental change and conflict, which is important because it cautions against oversimplifying the causes of war. However, it doesn't specifically address the concerns of strong states.\n\nOption B focuses on population growth, which is certainly a factor in environmental degradation and potential conflict, but again, it might not be the primary concern for strong states, which may have more immediate security priorities.\n\nPerhaps the answer is a combination of these options. Environmental change can contribute to conflict, especially in states that are less able to manage environmental degradation and resource scarcity. Strong states might be more concerned with the secondary effects of such conflicts, such as refugee flows, terrorism, or the destabilization of regions that are strategically important.\n\nIn that case, the environmental security agenda for strong states would include measures to prevent conflicts caused by environmental issues in weaker states, as well as managing their own environmental security to avoid internal conflicts.\n\nGiven that, Option D seems the most appropriate because it acknowledges that environmental change can be a contributory factor to conflict, particularly in states undergoing transitions, and that strong states are less prone to internal violent conflicts. This aligns with the idea that strong states have the capacity to manage environmental challenges more effectively and therefore are less likely to experience conflicts directly related to environmental issues.\n\nHowever, strong states might still be concerned about environmental security because of the potential for conflicts in other regions that could affect their interests. For example, water scarcity in the Middle East could lead to conflicts that involve major powers.\n\nAdditionally, strong states might use environmental issues as a tool for foreign policy, such as imposing sanctions or offering aid conditional on environmental reforms.\n\nIn conclusion, while all options provide some insight into the relationship between environmental change and conflict, Option D best addresses the concern of the environmental security agenda for strong states by recognizing the contributory role of environmental change in conflict, particularly in transitioning states, and the relative resilience of strong states to internal conflicts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
