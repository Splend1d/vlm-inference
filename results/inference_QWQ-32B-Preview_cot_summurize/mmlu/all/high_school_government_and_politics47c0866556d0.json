                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement is true about congressional incumbents running for reelection. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that incumbent senators are more likely to be reelected than incumbent members of the House of Representatives. Hmm, I think senators have six-year terms, and House members have two-year terms. Maybe senators have more time to establish themselves and become well-known, so perhaps they have a higher reelection rate. But I'm not sure about that. I'll keep this in mind.\n\nOption B says that incumbents are prohibited by law from spending more on their reelection campaigns than their challengers spend. That sounds unlikely. I've heard that incumbents usually have more resources and can spend more money on their campaigns. There might be some regulations on campaign spending, but I don't think there's a law that limits incumbents to spending less than their challengers. In fact, I think there are limits on how much individuals can contribute, but not on how much they can spend compared to their opponents.\n\nOption C says that incumbents have a great advantage over challengers because they are better known and can raise campaign funds more easily. This seems plausible. Incumbents usually have name recognition, they've built networks, and they might have a track record to campaign on. Also, they can more easily attract donations because they are established figures. So, this sounds like a reasonable statement.\n\nOption D says that ever since the 1994 election, the majority of congressional incumbents have failed in their reelection attempts. I need to think about this. 1994 was the year of the Republican Revolution, where there was a significant shift in Congress. But even then, I don't think the majority of incumbents lost their seats. Maybe there was a higher-than-usual turnover, but not a majority losing. I recall that incumbents generally have a high reelection rate, often above 80%.\n\nSo, considering all these points, option C seems to be the most accurate statement. Incumbents do have advantages in terms of name recognition and fundraising, which help them in reelection campaigns.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
