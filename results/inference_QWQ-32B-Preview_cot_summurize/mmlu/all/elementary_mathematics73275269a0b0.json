I need to find out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 14 plus negative 71 means. Adding a negative number is the same as subtracting the positive version of that number. So, 14 plus negative 71 is the same as 14 minus 71.\n\nNow, 14 minus 71. I know that 71 is bigger than 14, so when I subtract a larger number from a smaller one, I get a negative result. So, the answer should be negative.\n\nLet me calculate the difference between 71 and 14. 71 minus 14 is 57. Since I'm subtracting 71 from 14, the result will be negative 57.\n\nSo, 14 minus 71 equals negative 57.\n\nLooking back at the options, D) -57 matches my answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Adding negative 71 to 14 is indeed the same as subtracting 71 from 14. And 14 - 71 is definitely negative 57.\n\nI think D) -57 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
