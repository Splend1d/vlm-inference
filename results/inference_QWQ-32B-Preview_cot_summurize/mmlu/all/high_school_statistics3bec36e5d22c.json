                    "text": "So I've got this question here about confidence intervals, and I need to figure out what happens to the interval size when I change from a 90% confidence level to a 99% confidence level, assuming everything else stays the same. The options are:\n\nA. increases the interval size by 9%.\n\nB. decreases the interval size by 9%.\n\nC. increases the interval size by 57%.\n\nD. decreases the interval size by 57%.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what a confidence interval is for a population proportion. I remember that it's a range of values that likely contains the true population proportion, and the confidence level tells me how confident I am that the true proportion falls within that interval.\n\nThe formula for a confidence interval for a population proportion is:\n\np\u0302 \u00b1 Z*(\u221a(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n))\n\nWhere:\n\n- p\u0302 is the sample proportion,\n\n- Z* is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level,\n\n- n is the sample size.\n\nSo, the width of the interval depends on the Z-score and the standard error (\u221a(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n)).\n\nSince the question says \"all other things being equal,\" I can assume that the sample proportion (p\u0302) and the sample size (n) remain the same. That means the only thing changing is the Z-score, based on the confidence level.\n\nI need to find out how the interval size changes when moving from 90% confidence to 99% confidence.\n\nFirst, I should find the Z-scores for both confidence levels.\n\nFor a 90% confidence interval, the Z-score is approximately 1.645. This is because 90% of the area under the standard normal curve lies within 1.645 standard deviations of the mean (1.645 corresponds to the 95th percentile, since the interval is symmetric around the mean and we're leaving out 5% in each tail).\n\nFor a 99% confidence interval, the Z-score is approximately 2.576. This is because 99% of the area under the standard normal curve lies within 2.576 standard deviations of the mean (2.576 corresponds to the 99.5th percentile, with 0.5% in each tail).\n\nNow, the interval size is proportional to the Z-score because the margin of error is Z* times the standard error.\n\nSo, the interval size for 90% confidence is:\n\n2 * 1.645 * (\u221a(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n))\n\nAnd for 99% confidence, it's:\n\n2 * 2.576 * (\u221a(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n))\n\nSince p\u0302 and n are the same in both cases, the ratio of the interval sizes is:\n\n(2 * 2.576) / (2 * 1.645) = 2.576 / 1.645 \u2248 1.565\n\nSo, the 99% confidence interval is approximately 1.565 times larger than the 90% confidence interval.\n\nTo find the percentage increase, I can calculate:\n\n(1.565 - 1) * 100% = 56.5%\n\nSo, the interval size increases by approximately 56.5%.\n\nLooking back at the options, C says \"increases the interval size by 57%,\" which is very close to my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the Z-scores to make sure I have them correct.\n\nFor 90% confidence, the Z-score is indeed 1.645.\n\nFor 99% confidence, it's 2.576.\n\nYes, those are standard values.\n\nNow, let's confirm the calculation:\n\nInterval size ratio = 2.576 / 1.645 \u2248 1.565\n\nPercentage increase = (1.565 - 1) * 100% = 56.5%\n\nSo, increasing from 90% to 99% confidence increases the interval size by approximately 56.5%, which rounds to 57%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. increases the interval size by 57%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect the interval size.\n\nThe standard error term (\u221a(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n)) remains constant since p\u0302 and n are unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the only factor affecting the interval size is the Z-score, which increases from 1.645 to 2.576.\n\nHence, the interval size increases by approximately 57%.\n\nI think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
