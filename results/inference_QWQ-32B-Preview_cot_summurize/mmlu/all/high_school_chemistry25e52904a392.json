                    "text": "Let's tackle this equilibrium problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on equilibrium constants and partial pressures, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the reaction. Sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide in the presence of a catalyst. The balanced chemical equation should be:\n\n\\[ 2SO_2 + O_2 \\rightleftharpoons 2SO_3 \\]\n\nWait, actually, that's the synthesis of sulfur trioxide from sulfur dioxide and oxygen. Let me confirm that. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the equilibrium constant given is \\( K_p = 3.0 \\times 10^{22} \\) at a certain temperature. \\( K_p \\) is expressed in terms of partial pressures, so I need to work with pressures throughout the problem.\n\nThe problem mentions that a 2.0-liter flask has enough \\( SO_3 \\) added to produce a pressure of 0.789 atm. I need to be careful with units here. The answer choices are in torr and mm Hg, so I should make sure to convert everything to the same units. For now, I'll work in atm and convert at the end if needed.\n\nInitially, there's only \\( SO_3 \\) in the flask at a partial pressure of 0.789 atm. At equilibrium, some \\( SO_3 \\) will decompose back into \\( SO_2 \\) and \\( O_2 \\).\n\nLet me set up an ICE table to track the changes in partial pressures.\n\nInitial:\n\n\\( P_{SO_3} = 0.789 \\) atm\n\n\\( P_{SO_2} = 0 \\) atm\n\n\\( P_{O_2} = 0 \\) atm\n\nChange:\n\nLet\u2019s assume that at equilibrium, \\( P_{O_2} = x \\) atm. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, for every atm of \\( O_2 \\) produced, 2 atm of \\( SO_2 \\) are produced, and 2 atm of \\( SO_3 \\) are consumed.\n\nSo:\n\nChange:\n\n\\( P_{SO_3} = -2x \\)\n\n\\( P_{SO_2} = +2x \\)\n\n\\( P_{O_2} = +x \\)\n\nEquilibrium:\n\n\\( P_{SO_3} = 0.789 - 2x \\)\n\n\\( P_{SO_2} = 2x \\)\n\n\\( P_{O_2} = x \\)\n\nNow, the equilibrium constant expression for \\( K_p \\) is:\n\n\\[ K_p = \\frac{(P_{SO_3})^2}{(P_{SO_2})^2 (P_{O_2})} \\]\n\nPlugging in the equilibrium partial pressures:\n\n\\[ 3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{(0.789 - 2x)^2}{(2x)^2 (x)} \\]\n\nThis looks a bit complicated. I need to solve for \\( x \\), which is the equilibrium partial pressure of \\( O_2 \\).\n\nFirst, let's simplify the equation:\n\n\\[ 3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{(0.789 - 2x)^2}{4x^3} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( 4x^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 3.0 \\times 10^{22} \\times 4x^3 = (0.789 - 2x)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 1.2 \\times 10^{23} x^3 = (0.789 - 2x)^2 \\]\n\nThis is a cubic equation in terms of \\( x \\), which seems messy to solve directly. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nGiven that \\( K_p \\) is very large (\\( 3.0 \\times 10^{22} \\)), this suggests that the equilibrium lies far to the right, meaning that the reaction strongly favors the products. However, in this case, the products are \\( SO_3 \\), and we're starting with \\( SO_3 \\), so actually, the reaction will favor the reactants, decomposing \\( SO_3 \\) into \\( SO_2 \\) and \\( O_2 \\).\n\nWait, but \\( K_p \\) is large, which would mean that the concentration of products over reactants is large, but in this reaction, products are \\( SO_3 \\), which we have initially. So perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that \\( K_p \\) is so large that the reaction goes to completion, meaning that all \\( SO_3 \\) decomposes into \\( SO_2 \\) and \\( O_2 \\). But that doesn't make sense because if \\( K_p \\) is large, the equilibrium lies to the right, meaning more products, but in this reaction, products are \\( SO_3 \\), which contradicts the idea that it decomposes completely.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me look back at the reaction:\n\n\\[ 2SO_2 + O_2 \\rightleftharpoons 2SO_3 \\]\n\nGiven \\( K_p = 3.0 \\times 10^{22} \\), which is very large, this means that at equilibrium, the concentration of \\( SO_3 \\) is very high compared to the concentrations of \\( SO_2 \\) and \\( O_2 \\). Therefore, the decomposition of \\( SO_3 \\) back into \\( SO_2 \\) and \\( O_2 \\) is highly suppressed.\n\nSo, in other words, almost all \\( SO_3 \\) remains as \\( SO_3 \\), and very little \\( SO_2 \\) and \\( O_2 \\) are present at equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium partial pressure of \\( O_2 \\) should be very small.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can assume that \\( x \\) is negligible compared to 0.789 atm, so \\( 0.789 - 2x \\approx 0.789 \\).\n\nLet me try that approximation.\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{(0.789)^2}{(2x)^2 (x)} = \\frac{0.789^2}{4x^3} \\]\n\n\\[ 3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{0.622521}{4x^3} \\]\n\n\\[ 3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{0.15563025}{x^3} \\]\n\n\\[ x^3 = \\frac{0.15563025}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\n\\[ x^3 = 5.187675 \\times 10^{-23} \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\sqrt[3]{5.187675 \\times 10^{-23}} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\approx 3.73 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ atm} \\]\n\nNow, I need to check if my approximation was valid. Let's see if \\( 2x \\) is negligible compared to 0.789 atm.\n\n\\( 2x = 7.46 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ atm} \\), which is indeed negligible compared to 0.789 atm. So the approximation holds.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium partial pressure of \\( O_2 \\) is approximately \\( 3.73 \\times 10^{-8} \\) atm.\n\nBut the answer choices are in torr and mm Hg. I need to convert this to torr.\n\n1 atm = 760 torr\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ 3.73 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ atm} \\times 760 \\text{ torr/atm} = 2.83 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ torr} \\]\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA. 2.88 \u00d7 10^-6 torr\n\nB. 3 \u00d7 10^-18 mm Hg\n\nC. 1100 mm Hg\n\nD. 1.32 \u00d7 10^-5 torr\n\nHmm, my calculation gives \\( 2.83 \\times 10^{-5} \\) torr, which is closest to choice D, \\( 1.32 \\times 10^{-5} \\) torr, but not exactly the same. Maybe I made a calculation error.\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ x^3 = \\frac{0.15563025}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} = 5.187675 \\times 10^{-23} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ x = \\sqrt[3]{5.187675 \\times 10^{-23}} \\]\n\nCalculating the cube root:\n\n\\[ x \\approx 3.73 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ atm} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ 3.73 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ atm} \\times 760 \\text{ torr/atm} = 2.83 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ torr} \\]\n\nWait, but choice D is \\( 1.32 \\times 10^{-5} \\) torr, which is half of my value. Maybe I missed a step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should not have approximated \\( 0.789 - 2x \\) as 0.789. Maybe the approximation isn't valid.\n\nLet me try solving the equation without approximation.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\\[ 3.0 \\times 10^{22} = \\frac{(0.789 - 2x)^2}{4x^3} \\]\n\nLet\u2019s rearrange:\n\n\\[ (0.789 - 2x)^2 = 1.2 \\times 10^{23} x^3 \\]\n\nThis is a quartic equation, which is difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe I can assume that \\( x \\) is extremely small compared to 0.789, so \\( 0.789 - 2x \\approx 0.789 \\), and proceed as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider taking the square root of both sides to simplify.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nTake square roots:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} = \\frac{0.789 - 2x}{\\sqrt{4x^3}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} = \\frac{0.789 - 2x}{2x^{3/2}} \\]\n\nThis still looks complicated. Maybe I should consider logarithms, but that won't help much.\n\nGiven the complexity of the equation, perhaps my initial approximation is acceptable, and the discrepancy between my calculated value and choice D is due to rounding errors or significant figure differences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nLet me double-check the equilibrium expression. The reaction is:\n\n\\[ 2SO_2 + O_2 \\rightleftharpoons 2SO_3 \\]\n\nSo, \\( K_p = \\frac{(P_{SO_3})^2}{(P_{SO_2})^2 (P_{O_2})} \\)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is written in the reverse direction. If I consider the decomposition of \\( SO_3 \\):\n\n\\[ 2SO_3 \\rightleftharpoons 2SO_2 + O_2 \\]\n\nThen, \\( K_p' = \\frac{(P_{SO_2})^2 (P_{O_2})}{(P_{SO_3})^2} \\)\n\nAnd \\( K_p' = \\frac{1}{K_p} = \\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\)\n\nThis might be a better way to approach the problem, considering the decomposition reaction.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor the decomposition reaction:\n\n\\[ 2SO_3 \\rightleftharpoons 2SO_2 + O_2 \\]\n\nWith \\( K_p' = \\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\)\n\nInitial partial pressures:\n\n\\( P_{SO_3} = 0.789 \\) atm\n\n\\( P_{SO_2} = 0 \\) atm\n\n\\( P_{O_2} = 0 \\) atm\n\nChange:\n\nLet\u2019s say \\( P_{O_2} = y \\) atm at equilibrium.\n\nThen, \\( P_{SO_2} = 2y \\) atm\n\n\\( P_{SO_3} = 0.789 - 2y \\) atm\n\nEquilibrium expression:\n\n\\[ K_p' = \\frac{(2y)^2 (y)}{(0.789 - 2y)^2} = \\frac{4y^3}{(0.789 - 2y)^2} = \\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\nThis is similar to what I had before but with \\( K_p' \\) being very small.\n\nGiven that \\( K_p' \\) is very small, this means that the equilibrium lies far to the left, meaning that the decomposition is highly suppressed, and \\( y \\) will be very small compared to 0.789 atm.\n\nTherefore, I can approximate \\( 0.789 - 2y \\approx 0.789 \\)\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4y^3}{0.789^2} = \\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\n\\[ 4y^3 = \\frac{0.789^2}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\n\\[ 4y^3 = \\frac{0.622521}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\n\\[ 4y^3 = 2.07507 \\times 10^{-22} \\]\n\n\\[ y^3 = 5.187675 \\times 10^{-23} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\sqrt[3]{5.187675 \\times 10^{-23}} \\]\n\n\\[ y \\approx 3.73 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ atm} \\]\n\nThis is the same value I obtained earlier for \\( x \\). So, my previous approximation was correct.\n\nNow, converting to torr:\n\n\\[ 3.73 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ atm} \\times 760 \\text{ torr/atm} = 2.83 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ torr} \\]\n\nBut choice D is \\( 1.32 \\times 10^{-5} \\) torr, which is different. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or the answer choices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial pressure is given in mm Hg, not atm. Let me check the units again.\n\nThe problem says \"0.789 atm Hg.\" That seems like a typo. Probably meant \"0.789 atm\" or \"0.789 mm Hg.\" I need to clarify this.\n\nAssuming it's \"0.789 atm,\" my calculations hold.\n\nIf it's \"0.789 mm Hg,\" then I need to convert that to atm first.\n\n1 atm = 760 mm Hg\n\nSo, 0.789 mm Hg = \\( \\frac{0.789}{760} \\) atm \u2248 0.001038 atm\n\nLet me redo the calculations with this value.\n\nInitial \\( P_{SO_3} = 0.001038 \\) atm\n\nUsing the same approach:\n\n\\[ K_p' = \\frac{(2y)^2 (y)}{(0.001038 - 2y)^2} = \\frac{4y^3}{(0.001038 - 2y)^2} = \\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\nAgain, assuming \\( y \\) is very small compared to 0.001038 atm:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4y^3}{(0.001038)^2} = \\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\n\\[ 4y^3 = \\frac{(0.001038)^2}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\n\\[ 4y^3 = \\frac{0.000001077444}{3.0 \\times 10^{22}} \\]\n\n\\[ 4y^3 = 3.59148 \\times 10^{-29} \\]\n\n\\[ y^3 = 8.9787 \\times 10^{-30} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\sqrt[3]{8.9787 \\times 10^{-30}} \\]\n\n\\[ y \\approx 4.48 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ atm} \\]\n\nConverting to torr:\n\n\\[ 4.48 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ atm} \\times 760 \\text{ torr/atm} = 3.41 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ torr} \\]\n\nThis is much smaller than any of the answer choices, so probably the initial pressure is 0.789 atm, not mm Hg.\n\nMaybe the equilibrium constant is given wrong, or perhaps I need to consider temperature or other factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the reaction quotient and approach it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm applying the equilibrium constant. Let me look up the expression for \\( K_p \\).\n\nFor the reaction \\( 2SO_2 + O_2 \\rightleftharpoons 2SO_3 \\), the equilibrium constant \\( K_p \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ K_p = \\frac{(P_{SO_3})^2}{(P_{SO_2})^2 (P_{O_2})} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nGiven that, and starting with only \\( SO_3 \\), my ICE table seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe"
