                    "text": "Let's see. So, the question is about research that shows parents play more roughly with male children and are more protective of female children. It's asking which theory of gender-role identity development this behavior is most consistent with. The options are:\n\nA. Psychodynamic\n\nB. Social learning\n\nC. Cognitive development\n\nD. Gender schema\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories is about.\n\nStarting with psychodynamic theory. I think this is related to Freud's ideas, where personality develops through a series of psychosexual stages, and gender identity is formed through identification with the same-sex parent. But I'm not sure how this directly relates to parents playing more roughly with boys and being more protective of girls.\n\nNext, social learning theory. This is about learning behaviors through observation and imitation, and being influenced by rewards and punishments. So, if parents are playing differently with boys and girls, maybe kids are learning gender roles by watching and\u6a21\u4effing their parents' behaviors.\n\nThen, cognitive development theory, which is associated with Jean Piaget. This theory focuses on how children develop understanding and reasoning. In the context of gender roles, it might involve how children categorize themselves as male or female and then behave according to those categories.\n\nLastly, gender schema theory, which suggests that children learn about gender roles by absorbing the cultural norms and expectations about what is appropriate for their gender. They then organize this information into schemas or mental frameworks that guide their behavior.\n\nNow, considering the research about parents playing more roughly with boys and being more protective of girls, I need to think about which theory this best fits.\n\nIf it's psychodynamic, maybe it's about parents encouraging boys to be more aggressive and girls to be more nurturing, aligning with traditional gender stereotypes. But I feel like psychodynamic theory is more about internal psychological processes rather than parental behavior.\n\nSocial learning theory seems relevant because kids are learning by observing and imitating their parents. If parents are playing roughly with boys, boys might learn that rough play is acceptable for them, and if parents are protective of girls, girls might learn to be more cautious or dependent.\n\nCognitive development theory might involve children understanding their gender and then seeking out activities and behaviors that match their gender category. So, if parents are playing differently based on gender, it could be influencing how children categorize and think about their gender roles.\n\nGender schema theory seems closely related because it's about internalizing cultural norms and expectations. Parents may be reinforcing these schemas by treating boys and girls differently, thereby teaching them what is expected of their gender.\n\nHmm, all of them seem somewhat applicable, but I need to pick the one that is most consistent with this type of research.\n\nLet me consider the focus of each theory:\n\n- Psychodynamic: focuses on unconscious processes and psychosexual development.\n\n- Social learning: focuses on observation, imitation, and reinforcement.\n\n- Cognitive development: focuses on how children think and categorize information.\n\n- Gender schema: focuses on how children organize gender-related information into mental frameworks.\n\nIn the case of parents playing more roughly with boys and being more protective of girls, it seems like parents are modeling certain behaviors and possibly reinforcing them through their interactions.\n\nSo, social learning theory might be a good fit because it's about learning through observation and interaction.\n\nBut gender schema theory also makes sense because parents are likely socializing their children into gender roles that align with cultural norms, and children are internalizing these expectations.\n\nMaybe I should consider which theory places the most emphasis on parental influence in shaping gender roles.\n\nSocial learning theory emphasizes learning through observation and imitation, which includes parental modeling.\n\nGender schema theory also involves learning from the environment, including parents, but it's more about creating mental frameworks based on cultural norms.\n\nCognitive development theory, while it involves how children think about their gender, might not place as much emphasis on parental behavior directly.\n\nPsychodynamic theory is more about internal psychological processes triggered by parent-child relationships, but not specifically about observational learning.\n\nGiven that, social learning theory and gender schema theory both seem strong candidates.\n\nBut the question is about parental behavior influencing children's gender-role identity development.\n\nSocial learning theory directly addresses how children learn behaviors by observing and imitating their parents.\n\nGender schema theory is more about how children internalize and organize gender-related information, which may include parental behaviors, but it's a broader cognitive framework.\n\nGiven that the research is specifically about parental behavior (playing roughly with boys and being protective of girls), it seems most directly aligned with social learning theory, where children learn gender-appropriate behaviors by observing and imitating their parents' behaviors.\n\nMoreover, social learning theory includes the concept of reinforcement, where parents may reinforce certain behaviors in boys and girls based on their gender, which aligns with the idea of playing more roughly with boys (reinforcing aggression) and being more protective of girls (reinforcing nurturance or passivity).\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. Social learning.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should double-check the other options.\n\nPsychodynamic theory might suggest that parents are fulfilling their child's unconscious wishes or needs based on their gender, but it's not as focused on the behavioral aspects of learning through observation and interaction.\n\nCognitive development theory, while it involves how children think about their gender, doesn't emphasize the role of parental behavior in the same way that social learning theory does.\n\nGender schema theory is about how children organize gender-related information, but it's more of a cognitive framework, whereas social learning theory is about behavioral learning through observation and interaction.\n\nTherefore, considering the focus on parental behavior and children learning through observation and interaction, social learning theory seems the most consistent with the research described.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
