I know that there are many cups in different sports, like the cricket has the Ashes, tennis has the Davis Cup, squash has the World Squash Championships, and golf has the Ryder Cup. Wait, the Ryder Cup is in golf, and it's a big deal between the US and Europe. But I've heard of the Walker Cup before, and I think it might also be in golf.\n\nLet me try to recall. I remember that the Walker Cup is an international team golf competition between amateur golfers from the United States and Great Britain and Ireland. It's named after George H. Walker, who was a prominent golf official. So, if that's the case, then the answer should be D. golf.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's eliminate the other options. Cricket has the Ashes, which is a famous tournament between England and Australia. Tennis has the Davis Cup for men and the Fed Cup for women. Squash has the World Squash Championships and other team events, but I don't recall the Walker Cup being associated with squash.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, I think the correct answer is D. golf. But to be absolutely sure, maybe I should look it up online or check a sports encyclopedia. However, since this is a multiple-choice question and I have to choose one, I'll go with D. golf.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
