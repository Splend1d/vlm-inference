It's about separating religion from public affairs and promoting a neutral stance in government and society. The other options don't really fit:\n\n- B. Heathenism refers to people who are not part of the main religions, like Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. It's more about being pagan or following old, pre-Christian beliefs.\n\n- C. Sacrilege is when someone does something disrespectful to something that's considered holy or sacred. It's not about moving away from religion as a whole.\n\n- D. Nationalism is about strong feelings of support for your country and its interests, often above other countries. It doesn't directly relate to a movement away from religion.\n\nSo, secularism seems to be the most appropriate answer here."
