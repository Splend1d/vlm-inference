Without meaning to say that the foreigners harbor such destructive intentions in their hearts, we yet positively assert that from their inordinate thirst after gain, they are perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us! And such being the case, we should like to ask what has become of that conscience which heaven has implanted in the breasts of all men? We have heard that in your own country opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that you know full well how hurtful it is to mankind. Since you do not permit it to injure your own country, you ought not to have this injurious drug transferred to another country, and above all others, how much less to the Inner Land! Of the products which China exports to your foreign countries, there is not one which is not beneficial to mankind in some shape or other.\nLin Zexu, Chinese trade commissioner, letter to Queen Victoria, 1839\nWhich of the following most likely prompted the complaint voiced in the passage?\n\nA. British sale of opium in China\nB. British exports of tobacco to China\nC. British introduction of gunpowder to China\nD. British encouragement of heroin use to China\n"

                    "text": "Let's see what this passage is all about. It's a letter from Lin Zexu, who was a Chinese trade commissioner, written to Queen Victoria in 1839. So, it's during a time when China was dealing with foreign trade, particularly with Britain.\n\nThe passage talks about a \"poisonous drug\" being sent by foreigners, and it mentions that these foreigners are \"perfectly careless about the injuries they inflict upon us.\" It also mentions that in their own country, opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity, which suggests that the drug in question is opium.\n\nLin Zexu is essentially asking why Britain would sell something in China that they don't allow in their own country, something that they know is harmful to humanity. He's criticizing the double standard and the harm being caused by this trade.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. British sale of opium in China\n\nB. British exports of tobacco to China\n\nC. British introduction of gunpowder to China\n\nD. British encouragement of heroin use in China\n\nGiven the context and the mention of opium being prohibited in Britain but sold in China, option A seems to be the most likely prompt for this complaint.\n\nOption B, tobacco, was also traded, but the passage specifically mentions \"opium.\"\n\nOption C, gunpowder, was actually introduced to the West from China, so it's unlikely to be the subject here.\n\nOption D, heroin, was not yet in existence in 1839; it was first synthesized in 1874.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is A. British sale of opium in China.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
