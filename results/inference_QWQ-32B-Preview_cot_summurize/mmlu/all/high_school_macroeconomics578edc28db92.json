                    "text": "I think this scenario is about frictional unemployment. So, let me see. Frictional unemployment is when people are between jobs, maybe they quit one and are looking for another. In this case, the person is unhappy with their wage at the supermarket and decides to quit and look for a new job at a competing store. That sounds like they're voluntarily leaving one job to find a better one, which is typical of frictional unemployment.\n\nLet me make sure I understand the other types too, just to be clear. Cyclical unemployment is related to the business cycle, so when the economy is in a downturn, more people lose their jobs. Structural unemployment is when there's a mismatch between the skills workers have and what the jobs require, or when entire industries decline. Seasonal unemployment happens when jobs are affected by seasons, like tourism or agriculture.\n\nIn this case, it's not about the economy's ups and downs, or about skills mismatch, or seasons. It's just someone choosing to leave a job because they're unhappy with the wage and looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. So, yeah, I think D. Frictional is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
