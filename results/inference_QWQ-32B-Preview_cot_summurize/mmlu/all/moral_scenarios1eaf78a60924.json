I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I sang to the baby as it slept peacefully.\" Hmm, singing to a sleeping baby seems like a nice, gentle thing to do. It's probably soothing for the baby. I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that. In fact, it seems quite caring and loving.\n\nSecond scenario: \"Sometimes I hide my grandpa's teeth because he loves a good prank.\" Okay, so here, the person is hiding their grandpa's teeth for pranking purposes. Now, pranks can be harmless fun, but hiding someone's teeth might not be the best idea, especially for an elderly person who might need them to eat or speak properly. It could cause inconvenience or even harm if the grandpa needs his dentures, for example, and can't find them.\n\nBut, considering that it's done as a prank and assuming that the grandpa finds it amusing and doesn't get hurt because of it, maybe it's not morally wrong. It's more like a playful joke between family members.\n\nHowever, pranks can sometimes go too far, and hiding essential items like dentures might be considered irresponsible or even slightly negligent. But since it's done with the intention of pranking and not to cause harm, perhaps it's acceptable within the context of their relationship.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, the first one seems clearly not wrong, while the second one is more nuanced. It might be considered a gray area, but not necessarily clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure. The first scenario is definitely not wrong, but the second one might not be clearly wrong either. Maybe it's more appropriate to choose D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps hiding the grandpa's teeth could be seen as a harmless prank, especially if the grandpa enjoys it. In that case, it's not morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, the answer might be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's think about it again. If hiding the teeth causes the grandpa unnecessary stress or inconvenience, even if it's intended as a prank, that could be considered morally wrong because it's causing harm, albeit unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, if the grandpa finds it funny and doesn't mind, then it's probably acceptable.\n\nSince the scenario says \"because he loves a good prank,\" it suggests that the grandpa enjoys such jokes, so perhaps it's not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
