                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to find the sum of the determinants of two matrices, A and B. Matrix A is 2x2, and matrix B is 3x3. The (i,j) entry of each matrix is given by i + j.\n\nFirst, I need to construct matrix A. Since it's 2x2, it has entries a11, a12, a21, and a22. According to the problem, aij = i + j.\n\nSo, for matrix A:\n\n- a11 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- a12 = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- a21 = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- a22 = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nTherefore, matrix A is:\n\n[2 3]\n\n[3 4]\n\nNow, I need to find the determinant of A. The formula for the determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is ad - bc.\n\nSo, det(A) = (2)(4) - (3)(3) = 8 - 9 = -1.\n\nNext, matrix B is 3x3, with entries bij = i + j.\n\nSo, for matrix B:\n\n- b11 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- b12 = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- b13 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- b21 = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- b22 = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- b23 = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- b31 = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n- b32 = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- b33 = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nTherefore, matrix B is:\n\n[2 3 4]\n\n[3 4 5]\n\n[4 5 6]\n\nNow, I need to find the determinant of B. The formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix [a b c; d e f; g h i] is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).\n\nSo, det(B) = 2*(4*6 - 5*5) - 3*(3*6 - 5*4) + 4*(3*5 - 4*4)\n\nLet's compute each part:\n\nFirst, 4*6 = 24, 5*5 = 25, so 24 - 25 = -1\n\nSecond, 3*6 = 18, 5*4 = 20, so 18 - 20 = -2\n\nThird, 3*5 = 15, 4*4 = 16, so 15 - 16 = -1\n\nNow, plug these back into the formula:\n\ndet(B) = 2*(-1) - 3*(-2) + 4*(-1) = -2 - (-6) - 4 = -2 + 6 - 4 = 0\n\nSo, det(B) = 0\n\nNow, the sum det(A) + det(B) = -1 + 0 = -1\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -2\n\nB. -1\n\nC. 0\n\nD. 2\n\nThe answer should be B. -1\n\nBut wait, I recall that in the original problem, the answer was supposed to be D. 2, but according to my calculations, it's -1. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, matrix A:\n\n[2 3]\n\n[3 4]\n\ndet(A) = 2*4 - 3*3 = 8 - 9 = -1. That seems correct.\n\nMatrix B:\n\n[2 3 4]\n\n[3 4 5]\n\n[4 5 6]\n\ndet(B) = 2*(4*6 - 5*5) - 3*(3*6 - 5*4) + 4*(3*5 - 4*4)\n\nCalculate each term again:\n\n4*6 = 24, 5*5 = 25, so 24 - 25 = -1\n\n3*6 = 18, 5*4 = 20, so 18 - 20 = -2\n\n3*5 = 15, 4*4 = 16, so 15 - 16 = -1\n\nNow, plug back in:\n\n2*(-1) - 3*(-2) + 4*(-1) = -2 - (-6) - 4 = -2 + 6 - 4 = 0. That seems correct.\n\nSo, det(A) + det(B) = -1 + 0 = -1.\n\nBut if the book says the answer is D. 2, maybe there's a mistake in the book, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the matrices are defined differently. Let me check the problem again.\n\n\"If A is the 2 by 2 matrix whose (i, j) entry is equal to i + j, and B is the 3 by 3 matrix whose (i, j) entry is equal to i + j, find the value of the sum detA + detB.\"\n\nYes, that's correct. I think my calculations are right, and the sum should be -1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-1} \\]"
