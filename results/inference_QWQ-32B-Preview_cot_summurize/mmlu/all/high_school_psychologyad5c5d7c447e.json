In this study, she observed how infants between the ages of 12 to 18 months reacted to being separated from their caregivers and then reunited with them in a unfamiliar environment. The way infants responded to these separations and reunions provided insights into the nature of their attachment styles, which are categorized into secure, avoidant, ambivalent, and disorganized attachments. This research has been foundational in understanding how early relationships with caregivers influence a child's social and emotional development."
