At trial, the customer wants the court to take judicial notice of a printed statement from a printer's association that defines the minimum standard of skill for the printing industry in the community. He's asking the court to accept this statement as the applicable standard of care for printing companies in the area.\n\nNow, the question is, should the court grant this request or deny it, and why?\n\nFirst off, let's understand what judicial notice is. Judicial notice is a rule that allows courts to accept the truth of a certain fact without requiring any evidence to prove it. This is usually for facts that are widely known or can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned, like the date of a historical event or the population of a city.\n\nIn this case, the customer is asking the court to take judicial notice of a standard of care defined by a printer's association. The standard of care is essentially what level of skill and diligence is expected from printing companies in the community.\n\nOption A says the court should grant the request because it promotes an expeditious and economical disposition of the proceedings. That makes sense because if the court takes judicial notice, they don't have to hear lots of evidence about what the standard of care is, which could save time and money.\n\nOption B says the court should grant the request because the standard of care is amply supported by information supplied to the court. Well, the customer is providing a printed statement from a printer's association, which seems like a reliable source for defining industry standards.\n\nOption C says the court should deny the request because judicial notice cannot be taken of matters that are ultimate issues in the case. The ultimate issue here is whether the printing company was negligent, which depends on whether they met the standard of care. So, if the standard of care is an ultimate issue, then maybe the court shouldn't take judicial notice of it.\n\nOption D says the court should deny the request if the judge determines that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute. If there's any disagreement about what the standard of care should be, then perhaps it's not appropriate for judicial notice.\n\nNow, digging a bit deeper into the law, judicial notice is generally for facts that are not subject to reasonable dispute. For example, the court can take judicial notice of the fact that Paris is the capital of France, but probably not of something like the standard of care in a particular industry, which can be more subjective and open to interpretation.\n\nIn negligence cases, the standard of care is often a question for the jury to decide, based on the evidence presented. It's about what a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have done under similar circumstances. In this case, it's what a reasonable printing company would do regarding the quality of prints and accuracy of names.\n\nSo, considering that, it seems like the standard of care is a key issue in the case, and perhaps it shouldn't be decided by judicial notice. Also, different printing companies or industry associations might have different standards, so it's possible that the statement from this particular association is subject to dispute.\n\nMoreover, judicial notice is typically not used for legal standards or standards of care, which are more about applying the law to the facts rather than establishing a factual matter.\n\nTherefore, options C and D seem more plausible. Option C says deny the request because judicial notice cannot be taken of matters that are ultimate issues in the case. The standard of care is central to determining negligence, so it could be considered an ultimate issue.\n\nOption D says deny the request if the judge determines that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute. If the judge thinks that other printing companies or experts might disagree with the association's definition, then it's not appropriate for judicial notice.\n\nBetween C and D, I think D is a better answer because it allows for the possibility that the statement might not be subject to dispute, in which case judicial notice could be appropriate. But in reality, industry standards can vary, and different associations might have different standards, so it's likely that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute.\n\nAlso, according to the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 201, judicial notice can be taken of adjudicative facts, but not of legal rules or standards. Since the standard of care is more about the legal rule applying to the facts, it might not be proper for judicial notice.\n\nFurthermore, the customer is trying to use this statement to establish the legal standard, which is typically a matter for the court to decide or for expert testimony. So, it's probably more appropriate for the customer to call an expert witness from the printing industry to testify about the standard of care rather than asking the court to take judicial notice of it.\n\nIn conclusion, the court should deny the request if the judge determines that the statement is subject to reasonable dispute, which seems likely in this scenario. So, option D is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
