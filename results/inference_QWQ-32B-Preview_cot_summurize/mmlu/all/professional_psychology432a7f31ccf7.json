                    "text": "Let's see... The question is about tonotopic processing of auditory stimuli and where it occurs in the brain. So, I need to recall what tonotopy means and which part of the brain is responsible for processing sound.\n\nFirst off, tonotopy refers to the organization of the auditory system where neurons are arranged in a way that reflects the frequency of sound they respond to. It's like a map where neighboring neurons respond to similar frequencies, and as you move through the map, the frequencies change gradually.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Striate cortex - I know that the striate cortex is another name for the primary visual cortex, which is located in the calcarine sulcus. It's involved in processing visual information, not auditory. So, that probably isn't the right answer.\n\nB. Heschl's convolutions - I think this is related to the auditory cortex. I recall that the primary auditory cortex is located in Heschl's gyrus or Heschl's convolutions, which are part of the temporal lobe. This seems like a strong candidate for where tonotopic processing occurs.\n\nC. Calcarine sulcus - As mentioned earlier, this is where the primary visual cortex is located. Since it's involved in vision, not hearing, this isn't the right choice.\n\nD. Pre-central gyrus - I know that the pre-central gyrus is associated with the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary muscle movements. It's not involved in auditory processing, so we can rule this out as well.\n\nSo, between these options, Heschl's convolutions seem to be the correct location for tonotopic processing of auditory stimuli. To double-check, I remember that in the auditory system, sound information travels from the ear through the auditory nerve to the cochlear nucleus, then to the superior olivary complex, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate nucleus, and finally to the primary auditory cortex in Heschl's gyrus.\n\nIn the primary auditory cortex, sound frequencies are mapped topographically, meaning that different frequencies are processed in specific areas, creating a tonotopic map. This organization allows for the precise processing and perception of sounds, including pitch and tone.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Heschl's convolutions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
