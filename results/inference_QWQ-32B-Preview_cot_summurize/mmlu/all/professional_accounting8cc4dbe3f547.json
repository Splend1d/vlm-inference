For not-for-profit organizations, investments are typically reported at fair value.\n\nLet's break down the information provided:\n\n- **Stock A:**\n  - Number of shares: 100\n  - Cost per share: $50\n  - Fair value at the beginning of the year: $45 per share\n  - Fair value at the end of the year: $51 per share\n\n- **Stock B:**\n  - Number of shares: 200\n  - Cost per share: $40\n  - Fair value at the beginning of the year: $41 per share\n  - Fair value at the end of the year: $49 per share\n\nSince the investments are to be reported at their fair value at the end of the year, we will use the end-of-year fair values to calculate the total amount to be reported.\n\nFirst, calculate the total fair value for Stock A:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total fair value of Stock A} = \\text{Number of shares} \\times \\text{Fair value per share at end of year} = 100 \\times 51 = 5,100\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the total fair value for Stock B:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total fair value of Stock B} = \\text{Number of shares} \\times \\text{Fair value per share at end of year} = 200 \\times 49 = 9,800\n\\]\n\nNow, sum the fair values of both stocks to get the total amount of stock investments to be reported:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total stock investments} = \\text{Total fair value of Stock A} + \\text{Total fair value of Stock B} = 5,100 + 9,800 = 14,900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of stock investments that should be reported in the year-end statement of financial position is $14,900.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
