                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this woman who went to a business meeting in a commercial building, and after the meeting, she got hurt in the elevator because it suddenly fell to the basement from the third floor. She's suing the building's owner now. At trial, the only evidence she has about whether the owner was negligent or not is that she was in the elevator when it malfunctioned. Now, the question is, should the trial judge dismiss the case right away as a matter of law, without even letting the jury decide, and which option among A, B, C, or D is correct?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. It's about negligence in a legal context, specifically regarding premises liability, I think. The woman is claiming that the building owner was negligent, which led to her injury in the elevator.\n\nOption A says: \"Yes, because the injured person always has the affirmative burden of proving negligence.\" That sounds familiar. In most legal cases, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the defendant was negligent. So, if she can't prove negligence, maybe the case should be dismissed.\n\nOption B says: \"Yes, because it cannot be presumed that the building owner was negligent.\" This seems similar to option A. It's saying that we can't just assume the owner was negligent; there needs to be evidence of it.\n\nOption C says: \"No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\" This is interesting. It's suggesting that since the owner had exclusive control over the elevator, and such accidents don't usually happen without someone being negligent, maybe we can infer negligence from that.\n\nOption D says: \"Yes, because the woman assumed the risk when she decided to use an obviously dangerous instrumentality.\" This seems to be about assumption of risk, meaning that if she knew the elevator was dangerous and chose to use it anyway, she might not be able to hold the owner liable.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, in negligence cases, especially premises liability, the plaintiff generally needs to prove that the defendant had a duty to maintain a certain standard of care, that they breached that duty, and that the breach caused the plaintiff's injury.\n\nIn this case, the building owner likely had a duty to ensure that the elevator was safe for users, including tenants and visitors.\n\nNow, the woman was in the elevator when it malfunctioned and fell. That's the only evidence she has regarding negligence. So, she doesn't have any direct evidence that the owner was negligent; she just knows that the elevator failed.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there's a concept called res ipsa loquitur, which means \"the thing speaks for itself.\" This is a legal doctrine that allows a jury to infer negligence from the mere occurrence of an accident, under certain conditions.\n\nThe conditions for res ipsa loquitur typically include:\n\n1. The injury was caused by something that was under the defendant's exclusive control.\n\n2. The accident is one that doesn't ordinarily occur without someone's negligence.\n\n3. The plaintiff didn't contribute to the accident.\n\nIf these conditions are met, then the jury can infer negligence without direct evidence of how the defendant was negligent.\n\nIn this case, the elevator was probably under the owner's exclusive control. Elevators are complex machines that require maintenance and regular checks, and generally, the building owner is responsible for ensuring they're safe.\n\nAlso, elevator falls don't ordinarily occur without some kind of negligence, whether it's poor maintenance, failure to inspect, or some other lapse in duty.\n\nSo, based on that, option C seems plausible. It's saying that because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and such accidents don't usually happen without negligence, we can infer negligence.\n\nOn the other hand, options A and B are saying that the plaintiff has the burden of proving negligence and that negligence can't be presumed. That's true, but res ipsa loquitur is an exception to that general rule, allowing inference of negligence from the accident itself under certain conditions.\n\nOption D is about assumption of risk. For this to apply, the woman would have had to know that the elevator was dangerous and still choose to use it, thereby accepting the risk. But there's no indication in the scenario that she knew it was dangerous. She just used the elevator, presumably expecting it to be safe.\n\nSo, assuming she didn't know about any dangers, it's unlikely that assumption of risk would apply here.\n\nTherefore, going back to res ipsa loquitur, if the conditions are met, the plaintiff might not need direct evidence of negligence to proceed with the case. The fact that the elevator malfunctioned could be enough to infer that the owner was negligent in some way.\n\nSo, in this context, the trial judge should not dismiss the case as a matter of law without letting it go to the jury, because there's a basis for inferring negligence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer seems to be option C: \"No, because the elevator was under the owner's exclusive control and accidents of this nature do not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence.\"\n\nThis allows the case to go to the jury, who can then decide whether negligence occurred based on the circumstances.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that res ipsa loquitur is a doctrine that varies by jurisdiction, and courts apply it differently. Some jurisdictions have specific rules about when it can be applied.\n\nAdditionally, the building owner might have defenses, such as evidence that they maintained the elevator properly and followed all safety regulations, which could contradict the inference of negligence.\n\nBut based on the information provided in the scenario, option C seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
