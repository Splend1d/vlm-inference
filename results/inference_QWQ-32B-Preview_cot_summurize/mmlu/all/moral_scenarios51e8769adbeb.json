                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I told my girlfriend her new glasses made her look like she was trying to look smart.\n\nScenario 2: As a horse trainer, it's my job to break horse's legs.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about Scenario 1. So, the person told their girlfriend that her new glasses made her look like she was trying to look smart. Hmm, is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, telling someone something that might be hurtful or offensive could be considered morally wrong because it could harm their feelings or self-esteem. On the other hand, maybe the person was just making an observation, perhaps even trying to complement her in a clumsy way. But overall, it seems like a thoughtless or perhaps even slightly mean thing to say, which might be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: As a horse trainer, it's my job to break horse's legs. That sounds really severe. Breaking legs is causing serious physical harm, which is generally considered morally wrong. But wait, is breaking a horse's legs actually part of horse training?\n\nI think there might be some confusion here. In horse training, there's a term called \"breaking,\" which refers to training a horse to be ridden or driven. But \"breaking legs\" is different; that would involve causing fractures or injuries to the horse's legs, which is clearly abusive and against animal welfare standards.\n\nSo, in Scenario 2, if the person is saying that their job is to break horse's legs, that would be morally wrong because it involves causing unnecessary harm to animals.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe Scenario 1 isn't necessarily wrong. Maybe the person was just giving an opinion about the glasses, and it's not necessarily hurtful. Perhaps the girlfriend didn't take offense, or maybe they have a relationship where they tease each other.\n\nHowever, generally speaking, making comments about someone's appearance that could be interpreted as critical or insulting is not nice and could be considered morally wrong, especially in a relationship where one should be supportive and kind.\n\nSo, I think both scenarios involve some degree of moral wrongness.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think A is the correct answer because both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe Scenario 2 is more clearly wrong than Scenario 1. Hurting animals is generally more universally condemned than making a potentially hurtful comment to a partner.\n\nIn the US as of 2020, there is a strong emphasis on animal welfare, and causing intentional harm to animals is illegal and morally reprehensible.\n\nSo, perhaps Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, and Scenario 1 is more nuanced, depending on the context and intent behind the comment.\n\nIf that's the case, then the answer would be C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Scenario 1 is not morally wrong if the comment was meant as a joke or if the girlfriend didn't mind. In that case, it wouldn't be harmful, and thus not morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if the comment was meant to be hurtful or if it did harm the girlfriend's feelings, then it would be morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, Scenario 1 could be either wrong or not wrong, depending on the context.\n\nBut the question asks for which scenario the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, \"clearly\" implies that it's unambiguously wrong.\n\nIn that case, Scenario 1 might not be clearly wrong because it depends on the intent and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nWhereas Scenario 2 is clearly wrong because breaking a horse's legs is unambiguously harmful and against animal welfare standards.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but that would mean Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nBut I'm not sure if Scenario 1 is clearly not wrong. It could be wrong depending on the context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both are wrong, just to different degrees.\n\nBut the question is about which one is clearly morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, that would mean Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nBut Scenario 2 seems clearly wrong because of the harm involved.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"break\" in horse training is being misunderstood.\n\nIn horse training, \"breaking\" a horse refers to training it to be ridden, not to cause physical harm.\n\nSo, perhaps Scenario 2 is being misinterpreted.\n\nIf \"breaking\" in horse training doesn't mean causing fractures, but rather training the horse to accept a saddle and rider, then it's not about breaking legs but about training the horse.\n\nIn that case, Scenario 2 would not involve any moral wrongdoings, as it's part of normal horse training.\n\nIf that's the case, then Scenario 1 might be the only one involving something morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut I need to clarify what \"break horse's legs\" means.\n\nBreaking a horse, in the context of training, means to train it to be ridden, but \"break horse's legs\" specifically refers to legs, which would imply causing injury to the legs.\n\nSo, perhaps it's a misstatement, and it should be \"break horses,\" meaning to train them.\n\nIf that's the case, then Scenario 2 would not involve any moral wrongdoings, and only Scenario 1 would.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if \"break horse's legs\" is intended to mean causing harm to the legs, then it is clearly morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, and assuming it's a typo or misstatement, perhaps the answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong.\n\nPerhaps Scenario 1 is just a matter of poor communication, and Scenario 2 is part of normal horse training.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be D: Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut I don't think so, because causing harm to animals is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nWait, but if \"break horse's legs\" means training them, then it's not wrong.\n\nOtherwise, if it means causing harm, it is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the ambiguity is intentional to test understanding.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Scenario 1 is wrong due to potential harm to the girlfriend's feelings, and Scenario 2 is not wrong if \"break horse's legs\" refers to training.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if \"break horse's legs\" means causing harm, then Scenario 2 is wrong, and Scenario 1 may or may not be wrong.\n\nBut the question specifies \"clearly morally wrong,\" so perhaps Scenario 1 isn't clearly wrong, making Scenario 2 the only clearly wrong one.\n\nThus, the answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut I need to consider that harming animals is generally more severely condemned than hurtful comments.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 2 is clearly wrong, and Scenario 1 may not be clearly wrong, depending on context.\n\nHence, C is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
