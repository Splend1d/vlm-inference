She wants to maximize her utility. So, I need to figure out what she should do with her consumption of these two goods.\n\nFirst, I remember that to maximize utility, the marginal utility per dollar should be equal for all goods. That's the basic condition for consumer equilibrium. So, in this case, for X and Y, MUx/Px should equal MUy/Py.\n\nHere, the marginal utility per dollar for X is 5, and for Y, it's 10. Since 5 doesn't equal 10, Carmen isn't at the utility-maximizing point yet.\n\nSo, what should she do? Well, since the marginal utility per dollar is higher for Y than for X, she gets more satisfaction from the last dollar spent on Y compared to X. Therefore, to maximize her utility, she should reallocate her spending from X to Y.\n\nIn other words, she should buy fewer units of X and more units of Y. That way, the marginal utility per dollar spent on X will increase as she buys less of it, and the marginal utility per dollar spent on Y will decrease as she buys more of it. She should keep doing this until MUx/Px equals MUy/Py.\n\nLet me check the options:\n\nA. Maintain her current consumption level of the two goods. That can't be right because she's not at equilibrium yet.\n\nB. Buy fewer units of X and more units of Y. That seems to align with what I just thought.\n\nC. Buy fewer units of Y and more units of X. That would be the opposite of what I think she should do.\n\nD. Buy fewer units of both X and Y. That doesn't make sense because she's spending her entire income already.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Buy fewer units of X and more units of Y.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other consideration I should think about? For example, does the price of the goods change as she buys more or less? But the question doesn't mention anything about prices changing, so I'll assume prices are constant.\n\nAlso, is there any constraint on her income or the availability of the goods? The question says she spends her entire weekly income on X and Y, so I think the only decision is how to allocate her spending between X and Y.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
