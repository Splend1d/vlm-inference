                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about public relations tactics. It asks which one involves sending journalists on visits to appropriate locations. The options are media release, media tour, press room, and promotional days/weeks. Hmm, I need to think about what each of these terms means in the context of PR.\n\nFirst, a media release, also known as a press release, is a written statement issued to the media to announce something newsworthy, like a company's latest achievement or a product launch. It's basically a pre-written story that PR professionals send to journalists to encourage them to cover the story. So, it's more about distributing information through writing, not about physical visits.\n\nNext, a media tour sounds like it might involve physical travel. I think this is when PR organizations arrange for journalists to visit specific locations, perhaps to see a company's operations, a event, or a product in action. It seems like this could be the answer because it directly involves sending journalists to appropriate locations.\n\nA press room is usually a designated area where journalists can access information, such as press releases, schedules, and sometimes live feeds or interviews, especially at events like conferences or press conferences. It's more of a centralized hub for information rather than a physical tour.\n\nPromotional days or weeks are periods where a company or organization focuses on promoting a particular product, service, or cause. This could involve various activities like discounts, events, or increased advertising, but it doesn't necessarily involve sending journalists on visits.\n\nComparing all these options, the media tour stands out as the tactic that involves sending journalists to appropriate locations. It seems like a way for PR professionals to give journalists firsthand experience or insights into what they're promoting, which can lead to more engaging and accurate coverage.\n\nI recall that media tours are sometimes called press trips or familiarization trips, where journalists are taken to a location to familiarize themselves with a product, service, or destination. This could be especially common in tourism PR, where journalists are taken on trips to experience resorts, attractions, or cultural events, so they can write about them afterward.\n\nSo, based on this understanding, I think the correct answer is B. Media tour.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
