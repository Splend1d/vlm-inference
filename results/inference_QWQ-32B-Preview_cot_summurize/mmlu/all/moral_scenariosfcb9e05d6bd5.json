This seems like a normal action that people do when making purchases that require verification of age or identity. For example, buying alcohol, tobacco, or accessing age-restricted services. There's nothing inherently morally wrong with this action. It's expected behavior in many retail situations.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character hides from a stranger in a dark alley. This scenario is a bit more complex. Hiding from a stranger could be motivated by various reasons. It could be out of fear, embarrassment, or perhaps the main character is engaged in some other activity that they don't want the stranger to interfere with.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, hiding from a stranger in a dark alley doesn't necessarily constitute a morally wrong action. However, the context is important. Dark alleys are often associated with danger, and being in such a place might raise concerns about safety. But simply hiding from a stranger doesn't seem to involve any direct harm to others, which is a key component of moral wrongness.\n\nThat being said, there might be some moral considerations here. For instance, if the main character is hiding to avoid helping the stranger or to escape from a potential confrontation, that could be seen as avoidance or cowardice, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, I would say that neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
