                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what kind of interest the public utility companies have in that 10-foot strip of land along the rear of each lot. The plan says there's a franchise right granted to them, and it includes the right of ingress and egress. So, I need to decide whether this is a license, an equitable servitude, an easement appurtenant, or an easement in gross.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these terms means.\n\nA license is a privilege to use someone else's land, but it's usually revocable and doesn't involve any interest in the land itself. It's more like permission to be on the property for a specific purpose.\n\nAn equitable servitude is a type of restriction on land use that's enforceable in equity, usually arising from a contractual agreement between parties. These can run with the land, meaning they bind not just the original parties but also their successors.\n\nAn easement appurtenant is an interest in land that benefits another piece of land. It's said to \"run with the land,\" so when the dominant or servient estate is sold, the easement remains.\n\nAn easement in gross is an interest in land that benefits a particular individual or entity, not attached to any land they own. It doesn't run with the land in the same way an easement appurtenant does.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A, a license, seems unlikely because licenses are generally revocable and don't convey any interest in the land. But here, the plan creates a \"franchise right,\" which sounds more permanent and seems to convey some interest beyond just permission.\n\nOption B, equitable servitude, could be a possibility because the restrictions in the development plan are intended to run with the land and bind future owners. However, equitable servitudes typically impose restrictions on how the land can be used, whereas here, it's granting a right to the utility companies.\n\nOption C, easement appurtenant, might fit if the utility companies' right is for the benefit of some other land they own. But in this case, the right is for their use in providing utilities, not necessarily for the benefit of another specific piece of property.\n\nOption D, easement in gross, seems the most appropriate because it's an interest in the land for the benefit of a particular entity, the public utility companies, not necessarily for the benefit of another piece of land.\n\nBut wait, I remember that easements in gross can be for commercial purposes, like utility companies, and they don't necessarily have to be attached to another piece of land. So, that makes sense.\n\nLet me think about this again. The plan grants a \"franchise right\" to public utility companies, including the right of ingress and egress, on a 10-foot strip along the rear of each lot. The purpose is presumably to allow the companies to install and maintain utilities like electricity, water, gas, etc.\n\nThis sounds a lot like a right-of-way easement, which would allow the utility companies to enter the property and perform necessary work.\n\nNow, is this an easement appurtenant or an easement in gross?\n\nAn easement appurtenant benefits another piece of land, whereas an easement in gross benefits a person or entity without regard to land ownership.\n\nIn this case, the utility companies are likely using this strip for the purpose of serving multiple properties, not necessarily for the benefit of a particular piece of land they own. So, it seems more like an easement in gross.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that it's described as a \"franchise right\" suggests that it's a granted privilege that's somewhat permanent and attaches to the land, which aligns with an easement in gross.\n\nEquitable servitudes are more about restrictions on how land can be used, like no building on certain areas, rather than granting rights to use the land to someone else.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the best answer is D, easement in gross.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if it could be an easement appurtenant.\n\nIf the utility companies had another piece of land that this right benefited, then it could be appurtenant to that land. However, typically, utility easements are for the purpose of serving multiple properties, so it's more of a benefit to the company itself rather than to a specific piece of land they own.\n\nTherefore, easement in gross makes more sense.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's recorded and intended to run with the land suggests that it's a permanent interest, which again supports it being an easement in gross.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Easement in gross.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
