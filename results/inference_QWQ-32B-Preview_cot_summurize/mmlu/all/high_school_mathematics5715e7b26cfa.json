                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: find the range of the function y = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0 \u2013 x). And there are options to choose from: A. \u20133 \u2264 y \u2264 3; B. \u20132 \u2264 y \u2264 8; C. 0 \u2264 y \u2264 6; D. 2 \u2264 y \u2264 8. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I know that the sine function, sin(x), has a range of -1 to 1. So, sin(\u03c0 - x)... hmm, I recall that sin(\u03c0 - x) is equal to sin(x). Is that right? Let me confirm that. Yeah, from trigonometric identities, sin(\u03c0 - x) = sin(x). So, y = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0 - x) simplifies to y = 5 + 3 * sin(x).\n\nAlright, so now it's y = 5 + 3 * sin(x). Since sin(x) ranges from -1 to 1, 3 * sin(x) will range from 3*(-1) to 3*(1), which is -3 to 3. Then, adding 5 to that, y will range from 5 + (-3) to 5 + 3, which is 2 to 8.\n\nLooking at the options, that matches option D: 2 \u2264 y \u2264 8.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something. Is there any possibility that sin(\u03c0 - x) behaves differently? No, as far as I know, sin(\u03c0 - x) is indeed equal to sin(x).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to find the range. Let's consider the general form of a sine function: y = A * sin(Bx - C) + D. In this case, A is the amplitude, D is the vertical shift, and the period is 2\u03c0/B. The range of this function is D - A to D + A.\n\nIn my function, y = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0 - x), which can be rewritten as y = 5 + 3 * sin(x), so A = 3 and D = 5. Therefore, the range should be 5 - 3 to 5 + 3, which is 2 to 8. That again points to option D.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the function as y = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0 - x), and I don't simplify it, perhaps there's another way to look at it. But since sin(\u03c0 - x) = sin(x), it shouldn't make a difference.\n\nLet me consider the domain of x. Is there any restriction on x? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume x can be any real number, which is the standard domain for sine functions.\n\nSo, with x ranging over all real numbers, sin(x) will indeed range from -1 to 1, and the rest of my reasoning holds.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can pick some values of x and see if y falls within 2 to 8.\n\nLet's try x = 0:\n\ny = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0 - 0) = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0) = 5 + 3*0 = 5, which is within 2 to 8.\n\nx = \u03c0/2:\n\ny = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0 - \u03c0/2) = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0/2) = 5 + 3*1 = 8, which is the upper bound.\n\nx = \u03c0:\n\ny = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0 - \u03c0) = 5 + 3 * sin(0) = 5 + 0 = 5, again within 2 to 8.\n\nx = 3\u03c0/2:\n\ny = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0 - 3\u03c0/2) = 5 + 3 * sin(-\u03c0/2) = 5 + 3*(-1) = 2, the lower bound.\n\nx = 2\u03c0:\n\ny = 5 + 3 * sin(\u03c0 - 2\u03c0) = 5 + 3 * sin(-\u03c0) = 5 + 3*0 = 5.\n\nSo, y values are indeed between 2 and 8.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility for y to be outside this range. Since sin(x) is bounded between -1 and 1, and we've multiplied it by 3 and added 5, y cannot be less than 2 or greater than 8.\n\nTherefore, the range of y is 2 \u2264 y \u2264 8, which is option D.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\ 2 \\leq y \\leq 8} \\]"
