So, I need to choose the correct statement about what crystals in minerals are made of.\n\nOption A says, \"atoms with a definite geometrical arrangement.\" Hmm, I remember that crystals have a repeating pattern of atoms or molecules. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B says, \"molecules that perpetually move.\" Now, crystals are solids, and solids have their atoms or molecules in fixed positions, vibrating in place but not moving around like in liquids or gases. So, \"perpetually move\" might not be accurate for crystals.\n\nOption C says, \"X-ray patterns.\" X-rays are used to study the structure of crystals, but crystals aren't made of X-ray patterns. So, this doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D says, \"3-dimensional chessboards.\" That sounds like a funny metaphor, but literally, crystals aren't made of chessboards. So, this can't be right.\n\nLooking back, option A seems the most accurate. Crystals have a ordered arrangement of atoms or ions in a definite geometrical pattern. This is what gives them their characteristic shapes and properties.\n\nWait a minute, the question says \"crystals that make up minerals.\" So, it's specifically talking about crystalline minerals in geology. In mineralogy, a mineral is a naturally occurring, inorganic substance with a definite chemical composition and ordered atomic structure. So, the crystalline structure is defined by the arrangement of atoms or ions.\n\nI think option A is the correct answer. The other options don't accurately describe what crystals in minerals are composed of.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
