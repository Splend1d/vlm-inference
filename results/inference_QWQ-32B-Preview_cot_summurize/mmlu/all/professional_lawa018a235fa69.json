                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex with multiple conveyances and recordations, so I need to keep track of the sequence of events and apply the rules of a pure race statute.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a pure race statute is. In a pure race jurisdiction, the first party to record their deed wins, regardless of notice. So, whoever records first gets priority over subsequent recorders, even if those subsequent parties had no notice of the prior conveyance.\n\nNow, let's outline the sequence of events:\n\n1. February 1: Man conveys orchard to gardener, and gardener records the conveyance.\n\n2. February 2: Gardener conveys property to landscaper, but she does not record her deed.\n\n3. February 4: Gardener conveys the orchard to a friend, who gives a check for $100,000 and records the conveyance. The friend has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper.\n\n4. February 6: Landscaper records her deed.\n\n5. Friend conveys his interest to an investor for $115,000.\n\n6. February 5: Investor purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the landscaper and records the deed.\n\nOkay, so we have conveyances to gardener, landscaper, friend, and investor, with various recording dates.\n\nUnder a pure race statute, the first to record prevails.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Gardener recorded on February 1.\n\n- Friend recorded on February 4.\n\n- Landscaper recorded on February 6.\n\n- Investor recorded on February 5.\n\nSo, the sequence of recordations is:\n\n1. Gardener: Feb 1\n\n2. Friend: Feb 4\n\n3. Investor: Feb 5\n\n4. Landscaper: Feb 6\n\nIn a pure race statute, the first to record wins. So, the gardener recorded first on Feb 1.\n\nBut wait, the gardener conveyed the property to the friend on Feb 4, and the friend recorded that conveyance, even though the friend had knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper.\n\nHowever, under a pure race statute, since the friend recorded his deed on Feb 4, which is before the landscaper recorded on Feb 6, the friend would have priority over the landscaper.\n\nBut hold on, the gardener had already recorded his deed on Feb 1 when he received the property from the man.\n\nNow, when the gardener conveys to the friend, and the friend records on Feb 4, does that mean the friend has priority over the landscaper, who recorded on Feb 6?\n\nYes, because in a pure race, first to record wins, regardless of notice.\n\nSo, friend has priority over landscaper.\n\nThen, the friend conveys to the investor, who records on Feb 5.\n\nSo, investor records after friend recorded on Feb 4, but before landscaper recorded on Feb 6.\n\nWait, but in a pure race, it's the first to record who gets priority.\n\nSo, gardener recorded on Feb 1, friend on Feb 4, investor on Feb 5, landscaper on Feb 6.\n\nSo, gardener has the initial record, but then friend records a conveyance from gardener, so friend supersedes gardener.\n\nThen investor records from friend, so investor supersedes friend.\n\nFinally, landscaper records on Feb 6, which is after investor recorded on Feb 5.\n\nSo, since investor recorded before landscaper, investor has priority over landscaper.\n\nTherefore, investor would have the best claim to the property.\n\nWait, but let's think about it step by step.\n\n- Feb 1: Gardener records deed from man.\n\n- Feb 2: Gardener conveys to landscaper (unrecorded).\n\n- Feb 4: Gardener conveys to friend, friend records.\n\n- Feb 5: Friend conveys to investor, investor records.\n\n- Feb 6: Landscaper records.\n\nSo, under pure race:\n\n- Gardener recorded first on Feb 1.\n\n- Friend recorded on Feb 4, so friend supersedes gardener.\n\n- Investor recorded on Feb 5, so investor supersedes friend.\n\n- Landscaper recorded on Feb 6, so landscaper is last.\n\nTherefore, investor has priority over landscaper.\n\nBut, is there any issue with the friend's conveyance?\n\nWait, the friend had actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper when he took the conveyance from the gardener.\n\nBut in a pure race statute, notice doesn't matter; it's just about who records first.\n\nSo, even though friend had knowledge, since he recorded before the landscaper, he has priority over her.\n\nThen, investor recorded after friend, so investor has priority over friend and landscaper.\n\nTherefore, investor should have the best claim.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any defect in the chain.\n\nWait, the gardener conveyed to both landscaper and friend, which are conflicting conveyances.\n\nIn a pure race, friend recorded first (Feb 4), landscaper recorded later (Feb 6), so friend has priority over landscaper.\n\nThen, friend conveys to investor, who records on Feb 5, which is before landscaper recorded on Feb 6.\n\nSo, investor has priority over landscaper.\n\nTherefore, investor should be the one who prevails.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. The investor.\n\nBut let's see the options again:\n\nA. The investor.\n\nB. The landscaper.\n\nC. The friend.\n\nD. The gardener.\n\nGiven the analysis, A seems correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, perhaps there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there any possibility that the landscaper could have priority?\n\nWell, in a pure race, it's all about recording first.\n\nSince investor recorded before landscaper, investor has priority.\n\nEven though landscaper might have had a earlier conveyance date (Feb 2), without recording, it doesn't matter.\n\nSo, no, landscaper should not prevail.\n\nSimilarly, friend recorded on Feb 4, but then friend conveyed to investor, who recorded on Feb 5, so investor has priority over friend.\n\nGardener recorded on Feb 1, but then conveyed to friend, so friend superseded gardener.\n\nTherefore, ultimately, investor has the strongest claim.\n\nSo, the answer is A. The investor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
