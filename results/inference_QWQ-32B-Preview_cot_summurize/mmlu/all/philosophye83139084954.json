                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Rawls and the original position. So, Rawls has this idea of the original position, where rational beings, behind a veil of ignorance, decide on the principles of justice that will govern society. The veil of ignorance means they don't know anything about their own personal characteristics, like their intelligence, strength, social status, etc. So, they're supposed to choose principles that are fair and unbiased.\n\nNow, the question is asking why, in this original position, parties wouldn't accept utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is a theory that says we should maximize overall happiness or utility. So, let's look at the options:\n\nA. It's too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness.\n\nB. Doing so would be too risky.\n\nC. It requires us to do unjust things, such as executing innocent people.\n\nD. They would be behind the veil of ignorance and thus would never have heard of utilitarianism.\n\nFirst, option D seems unlikely because in Rawls's thought experiment, the parties in the original position are rational and know about different theories of justice, including utilitarianism. So, they wouldn't be ignorant about utilitarianism itself; they're just ignorant of their own personal details.\n\nOption C mentions that utilitarianism might require us to do unjust things, like executing innocent people. While it's true that utilitarianism can sometimes lead to counterintuitive conclusions, like sacrificing one life to save many, I'm not sure if that's the main reason Rawls thought parties in the original position wouldn't accept it.\n\nOption A suggests that it's too difficult to determine which policies maximize happiness. That could be a problem because, in the original position, people are trying to choose principles that are feasible and can be applied in reality. If it's too hard to figure out what maximizes happiness, maybe that's a drawback.\n\nBut option B says that accepting utilitarianism would be too risky. This seems plausible in the context of the original position. Remember, people don't know their own place in society, so they're risk-averse. They want to choose principles that protect them no matter what position they end up in.\n\nSo, if they choose utilitarianism, there's a risk that their own interests might be sacrificed for the greater good. For example, maybe they end up being part of a minority that's being overlooked for the benefit of the majority. That seems risky, especially when you're behind the veil of ignorance.\n\nIn contrast, Rawls argues that people in the original position would choose his two principles of justice, which emphasize fair equality of opportunity and the difference principle. These principles are designed to protect the least advantaged and ensure equality, which seems less risky than utilitarianism.\n\nSo, I think option B, \"doing so would be too risky,\" is the most plausible reason why parties in the original position wouldn't accept utilitarianism.\n\nBut let me double-check. Option C mentions specific unjust actions, like executing innocent people. While utilitarianism could theoretically justify such actions, it's more about the potential for individual rights to be violated for the greater good. Rawls's theory, on the other hand, prioritizes individual rights and liberties.\n\nSo, perhaps the parties in the original position would reject utilitarianism because it doesn't sufficiently protect individual rights, which they would value given their uncertainty about their own positions in society.\n\nWait, but that seems similar to option B, where choosing utilitarianism is risky because your own rights might not be protected.\n\nOption A, about the difficulty of determining which policies maximize happiness, is also a valid point. Utilitarian calculations can be complex and uncertain. In the original position, people might prefer principles that are easier to apply and less dependent on unpredictable outcomes.\n\nHowever, Rawls seems more concerned with the protection of basic liberties and fairness, which aligns more closely with option B's idea of risk aversion.\n\nLet me look back at Rawls's arguments. In \"A Theory of Justice,\" Rawls argues that rational beings in the original position would prefer his principles over utilitarianism because his principles provide a more equitable and less risky framework for society.\n\nSpecifically, Rawls argues that the difference principle (which allows inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged) is more attractive in the original position because it ensures a floor of welfare for everyone, whereas utilitarianism could potentially allow great inequalities if they lead to a slight increase in total happiness.\n\nSo, from this perspective, utilitarianism is risky because it might lead to a situation where you, as a person in the original position, could end up being worse off compared to what the difference principle would guarantee.\n\nTherefore, I believe option B is the correct answer: parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism because doing so would be too risky.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
