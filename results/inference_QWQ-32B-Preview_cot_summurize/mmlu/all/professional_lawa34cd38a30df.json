Among other things, the renovations included installing a new front door made of plate glass. The contractor purchased the door from a glass door company. The sales representative of the glass door company told the contractor and the owner that plate glass was \"super safe\" and could withstand considerable pressure. The contractor installed the door, completed the other renovation work, and the store reopened for business later that same month. A few weeks later, a shopper and her 9-year- old son went to the drug store to purchase some merchandise. As they approached the store, the son was skipping ahead of his mother. Until he was within a few steps of the door, he thought it was open. When he realized it was, in fact, closed, he slowed down and, while still \"going faster than walking,\" pushed his hand against the handle to push open the door. His hand slipped off the handle and, at the same time, there was a \"kind of exploding noise. \" Due to a defect, the glass shattered and broke, cutting the son's hand and wrist. A subsequent inspection revealed that the glass door had been negligently installed by the contractor.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this law problem. It's about a kid getting hurt by a glass door that shattered when he tried to open it. There were a few players involved: the drug store owner, an independent contractor who renovated the store, and a glass door company that sold the door to the contractor.\n\nSo, the shopper, who's the kid's mom, wants to sue the glass door company under strict products liability. I need to decide whether she'll prevail or not, and why.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what strict products liability means. From what I recall, strict liability in products cases means that the manufacturer or seller can be held liable for defects in the product, even if they didn't intend to create a defective product. The focus is on the product's condition, not on the care taken during its production.\n\nIn this case, the glass door shattered due to a defect, which cut the kid's hand and wrist. So, there seems to be a defect in the product, which is the glass door.\n\nOption A says the plaintiff will prevail because the glass door was defective. That sounds plausible.\n\nBut then there's option B, which says the plaintiff will prevail because the sales representative represented the plate glass as being \"super safe.\" Hmm, this might relate to misrepresentation or breach of warranty, but strict products liability is different from warranty claims or misrepresentation. So, maybe this isn't the right reason.\n\nOption C says the plaintiff won't prevail because the contractor negligently installed the plate glass door. Now, installation issues can affect whether a product is used correctly, but in strict products liability, the focus is on the product itself. If the door was defective regardless of how it was installed, then the installation issue might not bar the claim. So, maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption D says the plaintiff won't prevail because the son negligently pushed open the glass door. So, this is about contributory negligence. If the kid was negligent, that might reduce the damages he can recover, but in strict products liability, the plaintiff's negligence isn't typically a bar to recovery; it might just affect the amount of damages.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the strongest argument is option A: the plaintiff will prevail because the glass door was defective.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if the glass door company can be held strictly liable. Was the company the manufacturer or just the seller? The problem says the contractor purchased the door from the glass door company, and the sales representative made the \"super safe\" claim. So, the glass door company is at least the seller, if not the manufacturer.\n\nIn strict products liability, both manufacturers and sellers can be liable for defects. So, the glass door company should be liable.\n\nNow, about the \"super safe\" representation. That might be relevant to a different cause of action, like misrepresentation or breach of warranty, but for strict products liability, the key is the defect in the product.\n\nAlso, the fact that the contractor installed the door negligently might be relevant, but again, in strict products liability, if the product is defective, the seller can still be liable even if there were contributing factors like poor installation.\n\nSimilarly, the kid's negligence might affect the amount of damages, but it shouldn't bar the claim entirely under strict liability.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: the plaintiff will prevail because the glass door was defective.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about it another way. If the product is defective, and that defect causes harm, then under strict products liability, the manufacturer or seller should be responsible, regardless of other factors like installation or user negligence.\n\nSo, yeah, I think A is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA) prevail, because the glass door was defective."
