It's asking about a systematic approach that uses critical thinking to answer big questions about reality, morality, and knowledge. The options are the argumentative method, the philosophical method, propositional logic, and syllogistic reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nThe argumentative method sounds like it's about constructing and presenting arguments to persuade others. While philosophy does involve arguing points, I think there's more to it.\n\nThe philosophical method probably refers to the general approach philosophers take to explore and understand fundamental questions. That seems promising.\n\nPropositional logic is a branch of logic that deals with propositions and their logical relationships. It's more about the structure of arguments than about the content of philosophical questions.\n\nSyllogistic reasoning is a form of deductive reasoning where conclusions are drawn from two premises that share a common element. Again, it's a tool used in philosophy but not the overall method.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is B. the philosophical method. It seems to encompass the systematic use of critical reasoning to address fundamental questions, which is what philosophy is all about.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a better fit.\n\nThe argumentative method is more about persuasion, which is a part of philosophy but not its core.\n\nPropositional logic is a specific type of logic used in philosophy, but it's not the overall method.\n\nSyllogistic reasoning is another specific tool, like propositional logic.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. the philosophical method is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
