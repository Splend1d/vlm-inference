                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Stevenson's response to an objection regarding his theory of goodness. So, the objection is that Stevenson's theory doesn't account for a kind of goodness that is both objective and known a priori. Now, I need to figure out how Stevenson responds to this objection based on the options given.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what's being asked. Stevenson is a philosopher who has a particular theory about goodness, and someone is objecting that his theory doesn't cover a certain type of goodness\u2014that which is objective and known independently of experience (a priori). The question is asking how Stevenson replies to this criticism, and I have four options to choose from: A, B, C, and D.\n\nOption A says that Stevenson claims to have proven that such a property doesn't exist. So, according to this, Stevenson would be arguing that there isn't any objective goodness known a priori, hence his theory doesn't need to account for it because it doesn't exist.\n\nOption B suggests that Stevenson claims to have offered an account of just such a property. This would mean that Stevenson has indeed addressed this kind of goodness in his theory, perhaps integrating it or explaining it in terms of his own framework.\n\nOption C states that Stevenson claims he doesn't understand such a property. This would imply that Stevenson is either ignorant of what objective, a priori goodness is or doesn't recognize its validity.\n\nOption D is a catch-all, \"none of the above,\" which means that Stevenson's response doesn't fit any of the first three categories.\n\nTo answer this correctly, I need to recall Stevenson's views on goodness. I know that Stevenson is associated with emotivism or prescriptivism in ethics, which emphasizes the expressive function of moral language. In his theory, moral statements are more about expressing attitudes or prescriptions rather than describing objective facts.\n\nGiven that, it's likely that Stevenson would have a response to the objection about objective, a priori goodness. Let's consider each option in light of what I know about his theory.\n\nStarting with Option A: Does Stevenson claim to have proven that objective, a priori goodness doesn't exist? Well, Stevenson's approach is more about analyzing the nature of moral language and judgments rather than proving the non-existence of certain properties. He might argue that the concept of objective goodness is misguided, but I don't recall him presenting a definitive proof of its non-existence. So, this option seems less likely.\n\nOption B: Has Stevenson offered an account of such a property? Given that his theory is based on emotivism or prescriptivism, which focuses on the expressive and motivational aspects of moral language, it's unclear how he would account for an objective, a priori goodness. Objective properties are typically thought to exist independently of our attitudes or prescriptions, so it's doubtful that Stevenson would claim to have accounted for such a property within his framework. Therefore, this option also seems unlikely.\n\nOption C: Does Stevenson claim he doesn't understand such a property? This seems improbable because Stevenson was a well-educated philosopher who engaged with various ethical theories. It's unlikely that he would admit to not understanding a central concept in ethics. Moreover, his work suggests that he has a good grasp of different notions of goodness, including objective ones.\n\nOption D: None of the above. This might be the case if Stevenson's response doesn't neatly fit into categories A, B, or C.\n\nGiven that none of the first three options seem to align well with what I know about Stevenson's theory, I'm leaning towards Option D. However, to be thorough, I should consider whether there's another way Stevenson might have responded to this objection.\n\nPerhaps Stevenson would argue that the notion of objective, a priori goodness is confused or incoherent, but that's different from proving it doesn't exist (Option A). Or maybe he would suggest that such concepts are merely expressions of attitude, which would relate back to his emotivist position, but that might not directly address the objection.\n\nAlternatively, Stevenson might accept that there are objective, a priori goods but maintain that his theory can still accommodate them, perhaps by interpreting even these as involving prescriptive elements. However, this seems contrary to the nature of his theory.\n\nAnother possibility is that Stevenson would dismiss the objection as based on a misunderstanding of his theory, but that doesn't directly correspond to any of the options.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is D. None of the above. Stevenson's response likely doesn't fit neatly into claiming to have proven the non-existence of such a property, offering an account of it, or claiming not to understand it. Instead, he might engage with the objection in a different manner, perhaps by challenging the assumptions behind the concept of objective, a priori goodness or by explaining how his theory can coexist with such notions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
