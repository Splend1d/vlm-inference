That means each number in the list should be smaller than the one that follows it.\n\nLet's look at option A: 167,213, 161,455, 17,400, 11,633.\n\nHmm, starting with 167,213, then 161,455. Wait, 161,455 is smaller than 167,213, so that's not in order from least to greatest because it's decreasing there. So option A is not correct.\n\nOption B: 10,354, 10,600, 104,321, 106,213.\n\nLet's see: 10,354 to 10,600\u2014that's increasing. 10,600 to 104,321\u2014wait, 104,321 is larger than 10,600. And then 104,321 to 106,213\u2014that's also increasing. So far, it looks like this list is ordered from least to greatest.\n\nOption C: 160,233, 171,141, 11,645, 16,703.\n\nStarting with 160,233, then 171,141\u2014that's increasing. But then 171,141 to 11,645\u2014that's a decrease, which means it's not in order from least to greatest. So option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D: 12,209, 12,902, 125,466, 125,464.\n\nStarting with 12,209 to 12,902\u2014increasing. Then 12,902 to 125,466\u2014increasing. But then 125,466 to 125,464\u2014that's a decrease. So option D is not correctly ordered from least to greatest.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B is the only list that appears to be ordered from least to greatest without any decreases between the numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
