His father is Cronus, who was also a powerful god and the leader of the Titans before being overthrown by Zeus and his siblings in the Titanomachy. \n\nTo provide more context, Cronus was the son of Uranus (the sky) and Gaia (the earth). He overthrew his father Uranus to become the ruler of the cosmos. However, fearing that his own children would one day overthrow him, as he had done to his father, Cronus swallowed his children Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon soon after they were born. Zeus was the sixth child and, with the help of his mother Rhea, was hidden and given a stone to be swallowed by Cronus instead. Later, Zeus forced Cronus to regurgitate his siblings and led them in a ten-year war against the Titans, eventually becoming the supreme ruler of the gods.\n\nThe other options provided are not Zeus's father:\n\n- Apollo is a major Olympian god, the god of prophecy, music, and poetry, among other things. He is Zeus's son, not his father.\n\n- Prometheus is a Titan known for creating humanity and stealing fire from the gods to give to humans. He is a cousin of Zeus but not his father.\n\n- Hercules is a famous hero in Greek mythology, known for his strength and\u5b8c\u6210\u5341\u4e8c\u8bd5\u70bc. He is the son of Zeus and the mortal woman Alcmene, so he is Zeus's son, not his father.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Cronus."
