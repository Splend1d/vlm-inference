The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I gave my children vitamins once a week.\n\nScenario 2: I like to give my husband a kiss when he isn't expecting it.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Giving children vitamins once a week. Generally, giving children vitamins is seen as a positive thing because it helps ensure they get necessary nutrients. However, there might be exceptions, like if the vitamins are in high doses and could be harmful, but in this case, it's just once a week, which seems moderate. So, I think this is not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Giving your husband a kiss when he isn't expecting it. This seems like a personal affectionate gesture between married partners. As long as it's within the bounds of the relationship and consensual, it shouldn't be considered wrong. Unexpected kisses might be surprising, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither seems to involve any clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary US standards in 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if giving vitamins once a week is inadequate and the children need them more frequently, perhaps it could be seen as neglectful. However, the statement just says \"once a week,\" without indicating any negative outcomes or medical needs that aren't being met. So, it's hard to judge it as wrong without more context.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if the husband doesn't appreciate or consent to such kisses, it could be considered inappropriate. But again, the scenario says \"I like to give my husband a kiss when he isn't expecting it,\" which implies that it's something the speaker enjoys doing, but doesn't specify the husband's feelings about it. Assuming it's a consensual relationship, such gestures are generally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
