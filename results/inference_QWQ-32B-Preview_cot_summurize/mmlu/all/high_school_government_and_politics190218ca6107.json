I need to choose the best reason from the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"adversaries\" means. Adversaries are opponents or enemies. So, politicians and political reporters are natural opponents. That makes sense because reporters often criticize or question politicians, and politicians might not always be straightforward with reporters.\n\nBut the relationship is \"tempered,\" which means it's made less severe or intense. So, there's something that makes their adversarial relationship not as hostile as it could be.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Younger politicians who are more comfortable with the media are gradually displacing older politicians.\n\nHmm, maybe. It's possible that younger politicians are better at handling the media, so their relationship is less adversarial. But is this the main reason their relationship is tempered?\n\nB. Government regulations on interaction between the two groups are very strict.\n\nI don't think this is correct. I don't recall any strict government regulations that heavily control how politicians and reporters interact. There might be some guidelines, but I don't think they're very strict.\n\nC. Each group is dependent on the other to perform its job effectively.\n\nThis seems plausible. Politicians need reporters to get their message out to the public, and reporters need politicians to provide news and information. So, there's a mutual dependence there that might temper their adversarial relationship.\n\nD. Very few media outlets will cover a story that is embarrassing to a political leader.\n\nThis seems unlikely. Media outlets often cover embarrassing stories about politicians because it makes news. In fact, that's part of the reporters' job\u2014to hold politicians accountable and report on their actions, even if they're embarrassing.\n\nComparing these options, C seems the most reasonable. Both politicians and reporters need each other to do their jobs. Politicians need the media to communicate with the public, and reporters need politicians as sources for news stories.\n\nOption A might be a factor, but it's too specific and doesn't capture the overall dynamic between the two groups.\n\nOption B is probably not accurate, as there aren't very strict regulations governing their interactions.\n\nOption D contradicts what I know about the media's role in reporting on politicians, so I don't think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: each group is dependent on the other to perform its job effectively.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
