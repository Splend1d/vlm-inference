                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the interest theory of rights and see which option manages to formulate it without assuming the correlativity of rights and duties. First, I need to understand what the will theory and the interest theory are all about.\n\nThe will theory, as you've mentioned, ties the enforcement of a duty to the exercise of will by the right-holder. It's all about the active choice of the individual to enforce their rights, and it assumes that rights and duties are correlated\u2014meaning that every right corresponds to a duty on someone else's part.\n\nNow, the interest theory takes a different approach. It focuses on the interests of the right-holder. The idea is that rights are about protecting certain interests that individuals have, rather than being about the exercise of will or correlating directly with duties.\n\nSo, the question is asking which of the options successfully formulates the interest theory without assuming that rights and duties are correlated.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Regarding X's interest as directly related to Y's duty.\"\n\nHmm, this seems to maintain a connection between interest and duty, which might still assume correlativity. So, maybe this isn't the one.\n\nOption B: \"Accepting that conferring a right means that the interest represented by that right ought to be recognized.\"\n\nThis seems more in line with the interest theory. It's about recognizing the interest that the right represents, without necessarily tying it directly to a specific duty. So, this might be a candidate.\n\nOption C: \"Treating an interest as the exercise of choice.\"\n\nWait, this sounds a bit like blending the will theory with the interest theory. The exercise of choice is more aligned with will theory, whereas interest theory is about the interests themselves, not necessarily about choosing to exercise rights. So, perhaps this isn't the best fit.\n\nOption D: \"Asserting that X has a right whenever the protection of his interest is recognized as a reason for imposing duties\u2014only when they are actually imposed.\"\n\nThis seems to connect the recognition of an interest with the imposition of duties, which again brings in correlativity. It's saying that rights are tied to duties being imposed, which is what the will theory assumes.\n\nSo, comparing all these, option B seems to be the one that formulates the interest theory without assuming the correlativity of rights and duties. It's focusing on the recognition of the interest itself, rather than on the duties imposed on others.\n\nBut let me double-check. The interest theory is primarily concerned with protecting certain interests of individuals. So, if conferring a right means that the interest it represents ought to be recognized, that aligns well with the interest theory. It doesn't necessarily imply that there's a corresponding duty; it's more about acknowledging the importance of the interest.\n\nIn contrast, options A and D both tie the interest directly to duties being imposed, which brings back the correlativity that the question wants to avoid.\n\nOption C seems to miss the mark because it equates interest with the exercise of choice, which is more about will than about interest.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B: Accepting that conferring a right means that the interest represented by that right ought to be recognized.\n\nThis formulation focuses on the recognition of interest without necessarily implying a correlated duty, which is what the interest theory aims for.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
