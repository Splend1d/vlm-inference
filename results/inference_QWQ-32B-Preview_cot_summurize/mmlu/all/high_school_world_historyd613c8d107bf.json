                    "text": "Let's see. The question is about an event that symbolized the end of South Africa's institutionalized discrimination. So, I need to think about South Africa's history of apartheid and when it came to an end.\n\nFirst, I recall that apartheid was a system of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the South African government from 1948 until the early 1990s. It was a oppressive regime that separated people based on race and denied many rights to non-white citizens.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The election of F.W. de Klerk\n\nB. The election of Nelson Mandela\n\nC. The bombing of Lesotho\n\nD. The Boer War\n\nI need to consider which of these events marked the end of apartheid.\n\nStarting with option D, the Boer War, I know that was in the late 19th century, around 1899-1902. That's way before apartheid was established, so it can't be that.\n\nOption C, the bombing of Lesotho, doesn't ring a bell. I think Lesotho is a country surrounded by South Africa, but I don't remember any specific event related to a bombing there that would signify the end of apartheid.\n\nOption A, the election of F.W. de Klerk. I remember that F.W. de Klerk was a significant figure in South African politics during the transition from apartheid to democracy. He was the last state president of apartheid South Africa and shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for their work together to negotiate an end to apartheid.\n\nOption B, the election of Nelson Mandela. Mandela was a iconic figure in the struggle against apartheid. He was imprisoned for 27 years for his activism and later became the first black president of South Africa in a fully representative democratic election in 1994.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that the end of apartheid is most directly associated with the election of Nelson Mandela as president in 1994. This election marked the first fully democratic election in South Africa, where people of all races could vote, and it signified the end of the racist apartheid system.\n\nF.W. de Klerk was indeed important in the transition, as he released Mandela from prison in 1990 and began the process of dismantling apartheid. However, it was Mandela's election that solidified the end of the\u65e7 system and the beginning of a new era.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. The election of Nelson Mandela.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's double-check.\n\n- A. The election of F.W. de Klerk: De Klerk was elected as state president in 1989, but his election didn't mark the end of apartheid; rather, it was his subsequent decisions that started the process of dismantling apartheid.\n\n- B. The election of Nelson Mandela: As mentioned, this was in 1994 and represented the culmination of the transition to democracy.\n\n- C. The bombing of Lesotho: This seems unrelated to the end of apartheid.\n\n- D. The Boer War: As established, this was long before apartheid.\n\nHence, the most appropriate answer is B. The election of Nelson Mandela.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
