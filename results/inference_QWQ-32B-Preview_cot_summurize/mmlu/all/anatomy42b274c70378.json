                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on my anatomy, but I think I can figure this out. So, the coronal suture is a type of fibrous joint that connects bones of the skull. Specifically, it's involved in the articulation of the cranial bones.\n\nLet me recall: the skull consists of several bones, including the frontal bone, which forms the forehead and the roofs of the orbital cavities; the parietal bones, which form the sides and roof of the cranium; the occipital bone at the back and base of the skull; the temporal bones on the sides; and the sphenoid bone, which is more central and butterfly-shaped.\n\nNow, the coronal suture is the one that runs across the skull, roughly horizontal, near the forehead. So, it should be connecting the bone above the eyes (frontal bone) to the bones behind it (parietal bones).\n\nLet me check the options:\n\nA. frontal and parietal bones.\n\nB. left and right parietal bones.\n\nC. parietal and occipital bones.\n\nD. parietal, squamous temporal and greater wing of the sphenoid.\n\nOption A seems to make sense because the coronal suture is between the frontal and parietal bones. But let me double-check.\n\nI remember that the sagittal suture runs along the midline from front to back, separating the two parietal bones, so that's not the coronal suture.\n\nThe lambdoid suture is at the back, between the parietal and occipital bones, so that's option C.\n\nSo, if the coronal suture is frontally located, it should be between the frontal and parietal bones.\n\nWait, but I've also heard of the squamous suture, which might be between the parietal and temporal bones.\n\nOption D mentions parietal, squamous temporal, and greater wing of the sphenoid, which sounds more like the squamous suture.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\n- Coronal suture: frontal and parietal bones.\n\n- Sagittal suture: between the two parietal bones.\n\n- Lambdoid suture: parietal and occipital bones.\n\n- Squamous suture: parietal and temporal bones.\n\nAnd there's also the sphenoid bone, which has the greater wing, but I think that's involved in other sutures.\n\nGiven that, option A seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other sutures involving these bones.\n\nFor example, is there a suture between the frontal and temporal bones? I don't think so; the frontal bone articulates mainly with the parietal and nasal bones, I believe.\n\nAlso, the sphenoid bone has articulations with several bones, but I think the main sutures are named after their locations or shapes.\n\nCoronal suture specifically refers to the one that runs from side to side, like a crown, hence \"coronal.\"\n\nSo, based on that, I'm confident that the answer is A: frontal and parietal bones.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
