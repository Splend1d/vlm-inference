                    "text": "So I have this problem: estimate 32 multiplied by 68, and I need to figure out between which two numbers the product lies. The options are:\n\nA. 18 and 28\n\nB. 180 and 280\n\nC. 1,800 and 2,800\n\nD. 18,000 and 28,000\n\nFirst, I need to understand what estimation means in this context. Estimation is about finding an approximate value that's close to the actual answer but easier to compute. So, I should try to round the numbers to make the multiplication simpler.\n\nLooking at 32 and 68, I can round them to nearest tens. 32 is close to 30, and 68 is close to 70. So, multiplying 30 by 70 gives me 2,100. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there's a better way to estimate this. Maybe I can consider other rounding options. For example, rounding 32 to 30 and 68 to 70 seems reasonable, but perhaps rounding both to the nearest ten in the other direction? Like 32 to 30 and 68 to 60. That would give me 30 times 60, which is 1,800. Or rounding 32 to 40 and 68 to 70, which would be 40 times 70, equaling 2,800.\n\nHmm, so depending on how I round the numbers, I get different estimates: 1,800, 2,100, or 2,800.\n\nLooking back at the options, I see that option C is between 1,800 and 2,800. That seems to encompass my estimates. Let me see if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the exact product and then see between which numbers it falls. Let's do that to check.\n\nSo, 32 multiplied by 68:\n\nFirst, 32 times 60 is 1,920.\n\nThen, 32 times 8 is 256.\n\nAdding those together: 1,920 plus 256 equals 2,176.\n\nOkay, so the exact product is 2,176.\n\nNow, looking at the options again:\n\nA. 18 and 28 \u2013 that's way too low.\n\nB. 180 and 280 \u2013 still too low.\n\nC. 1,800 and 2,800 \u2013 2,176 falls within this range.\n\nD. 18,000 and 28,000 \u2013 that's way too high.\n\nSo, based on the exact calculation, 2,176 is between 1,800 and 2,800.\n\nBut since the question is about estimation, maybe I shouldn't calculate the exact value. Let's try estimating without calculating precisely.\n\nI can think of 32 as about 30 and 68 as about 70, so 30 times 70 is 2,100.\n\nAlternatively, 32 is a bit more than 30, and 68 is a bit less than 70, so their product should be around there.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 32 as 30 plus 2, and 68 as 70 minus 2, but that might be overcomplicating it for an estimation.\n\nAnother way is to consider that 32 is about 30, and 68 is about 70, so the product should be around 30 times 70, which is 2,100.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that 32 is closer to 30 than to 40, and 68 is closer to 70 than to 60, maybe the product is closer to 2,100 than to 1,800 or 2,800.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the other options again.\n\nOption A: 18 to 28 \u2013 these are single-digit multiples of 10, way too small.\n\nOption B: 180 to 280 \u2013 that would be appropriate if the numbers were in the single digits, but 32 and 68 are two-digit numbers, so their product should be much larger.\n\nOption D: 18,000 to 28,000 \u2013 that would be more appropriate for three-digit numbers, like 300 times 600, but 32 and 68 are only in the tens.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most reasonable choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I understand the magnitude of the product.\n\n32 is about 30, 68 is about 70, and 30 times 70 is 2,100.\n\nSo, the product should be in the thousands, specifically between 1,800 and 2,800.\n\nHence, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
