                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. It's asking how often the CPI is calculated and by which agency. The options are:\n\nA. week; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nB. month; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nC. month; The Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nD. quarter; The Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what CPI is. I know that CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. It's like an indicator of inflation or deflation.\n\nNow, who calculates this? I think it's the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS. I've heard of them in economics class. They collect data on employment, unemployment, and prices, among other things. So, that would point towards option C or D, since both mention the BLS or BEA.\n\nWait, BEA is the Bureau of Economic Analysis. I think that's a different agency. They handle things like GDP calculations, right? So, maybe option C is the correct one, since it's monthly and by the BLS.\n\nBut let me double-check. I recall that CPI is calculated monthly. Every month, the BLS releases the CPI data, showing how prices have changed from the previous month and from the same month a year ago.\n\nLet me see, option A says week, but I don't think CPI is calculated weekly. It's too frequent. Inflation isn't usually measured on a weekly basis; it's more common to look at monthly or quarterly changes.\n\nOption B says month, but it's the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which, as I recall, isn't the one responsible for CPI.\n\nOption C says month and Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aligns with what I remember.\n\nOption D says quarter, which is every three months, but CPI is more granular than that. It's reported monthly.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is C: month; The Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look it up online to confirm. However, since this is a quiz question, I should probably rely on my knowledge rather than cheating with external sources.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about other economic indicators and which agencies are responsible for them. For example, unemployment rates are also calculated by the BLS, so it makes sense that CPI would be as well, since both are related to labor and economic conditions.\n\nAlso, the frequency makes sense because monthly data allows for timely tracking of price changes, which is crucial for monetary policy and understanding the economy's health.\n\nSo, I'm going to go with option C: month; The Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
