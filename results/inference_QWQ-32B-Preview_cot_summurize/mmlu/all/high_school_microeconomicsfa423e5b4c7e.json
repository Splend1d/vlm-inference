                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the fundamental aspect of the free market system from these options. Okay, so first, what is a free market system? It's an economic system where prices are determined by supply and demand, and businesses and consumers make decisions based on prices without much government intervention. So, it's all about letting the market forces work on their own.\n\nOption A says \"A high degree of government involvement.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound right for a free market. In a free market, the government's role is minimal. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B is \"Public ownership of resources.\" Wait, in a free market, resources are usually privately owned, right? So, public ownership might be more related to a command economy or socialism. So, B seems incorrect.\n\nOption C is \"Private property.\" Yeah, private property is a key element in a free market system. People and businesses own property, and they can use it and profit from it as they see fit. This seems like a fundamental aspect.\n\nOption D says \"Central planners set wages and prices.\" That sounds more like a planned economy, where the government decides everything. In a free market, prices and wages are set by the interaction of supply and demand, not by central planners.\n\nSo, between C and D, C seems to be the correct answer. Private property is indeed a fundamental aspect of the free market system. It allows for individual initiative, investment, and innovation.\n\nLet me just double-check. In a free market, the main principles are voluntary exchange, private property, freedom to enter and compete in markets, and prices determined by supply and demand. So, private property is definitely one of the foundations.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Private property.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
