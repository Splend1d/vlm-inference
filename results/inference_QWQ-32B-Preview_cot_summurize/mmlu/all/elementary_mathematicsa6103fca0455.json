                    "text": "So I have this problem here: If 3 cans of pears cost $2.37, how many cans of pears can you buy for $9.48? The options are A. 3 cans, B. 12 cans, C. 36 cans, D. 13 cans.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much one can of pears costs. If 3 cans cost $2.37, then one can would cost $2.37 divided by 3. Let me calculate that:\n\n$2.37 \u00f7 3 = $0.79 per can.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many cans I can buy for $9.48 if each can costs $0.79. So, I'll divide $9.48 by $0.79.\n\n$9.48 \u00f7 $0.79 = ?\n\nLet me do the division:\n\n79 goes into 94 once (79 x 1 = 79), subtract that from 94, and get 15. Bring down the 8 to make it 158.\n\n79 goes into 158 twice (79 x 2 = 158), subtract that, and get 0.\n\nSo, $9.48 \u00f7 $0.79 = 12 cans.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 12 cans is one of the choices. So, that seems to be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, cost per can: $2.37 \u00f7 3 = $0.79. That seems correct.\n\nThen, number of cans for $9.48: $9.48 \u00f7 $0.79.\n\nLet me verify that division again:\n\n79 x 12 = 948 cents, which is $9.48. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to solve this problem.\n\nAnother way could be to set up a proportion:\n\n3 cans / $2.37 = x cans / $9.48\n\nThen, solve for x:\n\nx = (3 cans * $9.48) / $2.37\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, 3 * 9.48 = 28.44\n\nThen, 28.44 \u00f7 2.37 = ?\n\n2.37 goes into 28.44 how many times?\n\n2.37 x 12 = 28.44\n\nSo, x = 12 cans\n\nAgain, I get 12 cans.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of total cost.\n\nIf 3 cans cost $2.37, then for $9.48, I can find out how many sets of 3 cans I can buy.\n\nEach set of 3 cans costs $2.37, so $9.48 \u00f7 $2.37 = number of sets.\n\n$9.48 \u00f7 $2.37 = 4 sets\n\nSince each set contains 3 cans, 4 sets x 3 cans/set = 12 cans.\n\nAgain, the same answer, 12 cans.\n\nLet me see if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there a possibility that the price per can changes with quantity? The problem doesn't suggest any discount or price change for buying more, so I can assume the price per can remains constant at $0.79.\n\nAlso, checking the options, 12 cans is listed, and the other options don't make sense based on my calculations.\n\n3 cans is the amount you can buy for $2.37, not $9.48.\n\n36 cans would be way more than what $9.48 can buy at $0.79 per can.\n\n13 cans would be more than $9.48, since 12 cans cost exactly $9.48 (12 x 0.79 = 9.48).\n\nWait, actually, 12 x 0.79 = 9.48, so 13 cans would be 12 x 0.79 + 0.79 = 9.48 + 0.79 = 10.27, which is more than $9.48.\n\nSo, with $9.48, you can only buy up to 12 cans.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 12 cans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
