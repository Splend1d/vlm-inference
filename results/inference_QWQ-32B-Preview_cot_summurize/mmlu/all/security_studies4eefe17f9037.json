It is possible to study military security through non-realist analytical lenses, and to adopt a social constructivist approach that regards cultural and social factors as being important focuses of study. This has led to claims that broader approaches to military endeavours should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations.\n\nLet me explain why I think this is the correct answer. First, it's important to understand what social constructivism is in the context of international relations and security studies. Social constructivism is a theory that suggests that international relations are shaped by shared ideas, norms, and identities, rather than just material power or interests. It emphasizes the role of social interactions and the construction of meaning in international politics.\n\nNow, military security is traditionally studied through a realist lens, which focuses on the competition for power among states and the importance of military capabilities. However, social constructivism offers a different perspective by highlighting how military security is influenced by social and cultural factors.\n\nOption A acknowledges that military security can be studied using non-realist approaches like social constructivism. It suggests that by considering cultural and social factors, we can gain a broader understanding of military endeavors. This approach also proposes that incorporating social and development specialists in conflict situations could be beneficial, which aligns with the social constructivist emphasis on the role of ideas and norms in shaping international relations.\n\nOption B says that social constructivists reject the foundations of realism in military security studies and that their approach is inadequate for formulating military security theory. While it's true that social constructivism challenges realist assumptions, it doesn't necessarily render their approach inadequate. Instead, social constructivism provides complementary insights that can enrich our understanding of military security.\n\nOption C claims that social constructivism is based on ideas that directly contradict military-centered theory and that social constructivists tend to dismiss military endeavors as clumsy and detrimental to human security. While it's possible that some social constructivists may hold such views, it's too sweeping to say that this is the general tendency. Social constructivism is more about understanding how military actions are shaped by social and cultural contexts rather than inherently dismissing military endeavors.\n\nOption D suggests that to study military security, analysts must adopt a realist lens but can later combine it with other approaches like social constructivism to consider different referent objects such as environmental or human security. While this acknowledges the role of realism in military security studies, it implies that realism is the primary or necessary starting point, which isn't necessarily the case. Social constructivism can be used independently to analyze military security.\n\nTherefore, Option A seems to be the most accurate and balanced view, recognizing that social constructivism offers valuable perspectives on military security by considering cultural and social factors and proposing broader approaches to military endeavors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
