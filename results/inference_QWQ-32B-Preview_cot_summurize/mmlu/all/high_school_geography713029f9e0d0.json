                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about urban models, and I need to figure out which one describes high-rent residential areas growing outward from the city center along major highways, with lower-rent inhabitants moving in sequentially. The options are the concentric zone model, central place model, urban realms model, and sector model.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these models is about.\n\nThe concentric zone model, I think, is the one where the city grows in concentric circles from the center, with each ring serving a different function, like residential, commercial, or industrial areas. So, it's like a series of rings around the city center.\n\nThe central place model is different; it's more about how cities and towns are arranged in a hierarchy, with larger centers providing more goods and services and being fewer in number, while smaller centers are more numerous and provide basic services. It's like a system of places where each has a certain area it serves.\n\nThe urban realms model, I'm not as familiar with, but I think it's about dividing the city into distinct areas or realms that have their own characteristics and functions, maybe overlapping or interacting in complex ways.\n\nAnd the sector model, I believe, suggests that cities grow in sectors or wedges from the center outwards, along transportation routes like highways or railways. Each sector might have a different land use or social class associated with it.\n\nNow, the question is about high-rent residential areas growing outward along major highways, with lower-rent inhabitants moving in sequentially. This sounds like areas developing in sectors or wedges from the city center, which aligns with the sector model.\n\nIn the sector model, developed by Homer Hoyt, the city grows in sectors rather than rings. These sectors extend outward along transportation corridors, like highways, and different activities or social classes occupy different sectors.\n\nSo, high-rent areas might develop along a highway, and as the city grows, these high-rent areas expand outward, pushing lower-rent inhabitants to move to areas that were previously higher-rent, creating a sequential movement.\n\nThis seems to match the description in the question.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nThe concentric zone model, proposed by Ernest Burgess, suggests that the city grows in concentric rings, with the central business district in the middle, surrounded by concentric zones of different uses, like transition zone, workingmen's homes, better residences, and commuting zone.\n\nThis doesn't really fit the description of growth along highways in sectors.\n\nThe central place model, by Walter Christaller, is more about the spatial arrangement of places and their hierarchical relationships, based on central places providing goods and services to surrounding areas.\n\nIt doesn't specifically describe how residential areas of different rent levels grow along highways.\n\nThe urban realms model, which I think is associated with the work of Kevin Lynch and others, emphasizes the idea of city areas having their own identities and functions, but it's not specifically about the pattern of growth along transportation corridors.\n\nTherefore, the sector model seems to be the most appropriate answer here.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about how the sector model works. It suggests that urban growth occurs in sectors or wedges extending from the city center along transportation routes, such as highways or railways.\n\nThese sectors can have different land uses or social classes. For example, one sector might be residential for high-income families, another for middle-income, and so on.\n\nAs the city grows, these sectors expand outward, and sometimes, there can be a process where higher-income residents move to the outer edges of a sector along the highway, seeking newer, larger homes and better amenities.\n\nAs they move out, lower-income residents might move into the areas previously occupied by the higher-income groups.\n\nThis process is sometimes called \"filtering,\" where housing stock is gradually occupied by lower-income groups as higher-income groups move to newer, more desirable areas.\n\nThis seems consistent with the description in the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Sector model.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
