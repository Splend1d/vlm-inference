                    "text": "So I've got this question here about cross-price elasticity between goods X and Y, and it's saying that the cross-price elasticity is +2.0. I need to figure out what that means in terms of the relationship between these two goods. The options are:\n\nA. goods X and Y are normal goods.\n\nB. goods X and Y are inferior goods.\n\nC. goods X and Y are complementary goods.\n\nD. goods X and Y are substitute goods.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what cross-price elasticity is. Cross-price elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of good X responds to a change in the price of good Y. The formula is something like:\n\nCross-price elasticity (Exy) = (% change in quantity demanded of X) / (% change in price of Y)\n\nNow, in this case, Exy is +2.0, which is positive.\n\nI know that:\n\n- If Exy is positive, goods X and Y are substitutes. That means when the price of Y goes up, the quantity demanded of X also goes up, because consumers switch from Y to X.\n\n- If Exy is negative, goods X and Y are complements. That means when the price of Y goes up, the quantity demanded of X goes down, because X and Y are used together.\n\n- If Exy is zero, the goods are independent; a change in the price of Y doesn't affect the quantity demanded of X.\n\nSo, given that Exy is +2.0, which is positive, that suggests that goods X and Y are substitutes.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. normal goods - This refers to goods for which demand increases as income increases, but it doesn't say anything about the relationship between X and Y.\n\nB. inferior goods - These are goods for which demand decreases as income increases, but again, that's about the relationship between demand and income, not between two goods.\n\nC. complementary goods - This would correspond to a negative cross-price elasticity, which isn't the case here.\n\nD. substitute goods - This aligns with the positive cross-price elasticity.\n\nSo, it seems like the answer should be D. substitute goods.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about what normal and inferior goods are. Normal goods are those for which demand increases as income increases, and inferior goods are those for which demand decreases as income increases. However, the cross-price elasticity is about the relationship between two goods, not about their relationship with income. So options A and B aren't directly related to the cross-price elasticity sign.\n\nComplementary goods have a negative cross-price elasticity, as defined, so that doesn't match the +2.0 given here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. goods X and Y are substitute goods.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the magnitude of the elasticity is 2.0, which is greater than 1, indicating that the percentage change in the quantity demanded of X is twice the percentage change in the price of Y. But for this question, the key point is the sign, which indicates substitutability.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
