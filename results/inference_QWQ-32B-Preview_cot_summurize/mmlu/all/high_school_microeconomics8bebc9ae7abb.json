                    "text": "Let's see. Price discrimination is when a firm charges different prices to different customers for the same product. For a firm to do this successfully, certain conditions need to be met. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption I says: \"The firm cannot face a downward sloping demand curve.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Actually, for price discrimination to occur, the firm usually faces a downward sloping demand curve because it needs to sell more units by lowering the price for some customers. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption II: \"The firm must have market power.\" That makes sense. Price discrimination requires some degree of market power so that the firm can set different prices without being undercut by competitors. If it's a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers and can't discriminate.\n\nOption III: \"Buyers with differing demand elasticities must be separable.\" Yes, this is crucial. The firm needs to be able to identify and separate customers who have different price sensitivities. If all customers have the same elasticity, there's no room for discrimination.\n\nOption IV: \"The firm must have motives beyond profit maximization.\" I'm not sure about this. Typically, price discrimination is used as a profit-maximizing strategy. So, it seems like the firm is still aiming to maximize profits, just through different means. Maybe this isn't a necessary condition.\n\nOption V: \"The firm must be able to prevent the re-sale of its products.\" Absolutely. If customers can buy the product at a lower price and resell it to others who were charged a higher price, that would undermine the price discrimination strategy. So, preventing resales is key.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. I, III, and V only: But I think I ruled out I as incorrect.\n\nB. III and IV only: III is correct, but I'm not sure about IV.\n\nC. I and IV only: Both seem incorrect based on my earlier thoughts.\n\nD. II, III, and V only: These all seem correct.\n\nSo, D seems to be the best answer. Let me double-check.\n\n- II: Market power is necessary for price discrimination.\n\n- III: Separable buyers with different elasticities are needed.\n\n- V: Preventing resale is crucial to maintain price discrimination.\n\nAnd options I and IV don't seem to be necessary conditions. Therefore, D is likely the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
