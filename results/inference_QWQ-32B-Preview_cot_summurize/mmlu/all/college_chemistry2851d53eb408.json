                    "text": "To calculate the Q-factor for an X-band EPR cavity, we need to use the relationship between the resonant frequency, the bandwidth, and the Q-factor. The formula that relates these quantities is:\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{f_0}{\\Delta f} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( Q \\) is the quality factor,\n- \\( f_0 \\) is the resonant frequency,\n- \\( \\Delta f \\) is the bandwidth.\n\nGiven that this is an X-band EPR cavity, we need to know the typical resonant frequency for X-band. X-band typically refers to microwave frequencies around 8 to 12 GHz. For EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) spectroscopy, the standard X-band frequency is approximately 9.5 GHz.\n\nSo, let's assume \\( f_0 = 9.5 \\) GHz.\n\nThe bandwidth \\( \\Delta f \\) is given as 1.58 MHz.\n\nFirst, we need to ensure that both frequencies are in the same units. Let's convert GHz to MHz for consistency.\n\n\\[ 9.5 \\text{ GHz} = 9.5 \\times 10^3 \\text{ MHz} \\]\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{9.5 \\times 10^3 \\text{ MHz}}{1.58 \\text{ MHz}} \\]\n\nPerform the division:\n\n\\[ Q = \\frac{9500}{1.58} \\approx 6012.658 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\n\\[ Q \\approx 6013 \\]\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Q = 1012\nB. Q = 2012\nC. Q = 3012\nD. Q = 6012\n\nThe closest value to our calculation is D. Q = 6012.\n\nIt's possible that there was a slight rounding difference or a different standard frequency was used for X-band in this context. Nonetheless, based on the typical values and the calculation, option D is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
