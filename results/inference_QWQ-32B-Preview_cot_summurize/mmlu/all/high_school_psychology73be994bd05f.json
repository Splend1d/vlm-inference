The options are psychometricians, occupational psychologists, developmental psychologists, and social psychologists. I think I know a little bit about each, but I want to make sure I get this right.\n\nFirst, psychometricians. I know that psychometrics is about measuring psychological attributes, like intelligence or personality, using tests and questionnaires. So, they're more focused on measurement tools rather than how people change over time.\n\nNext, occupational psychologists. These are psychologists who work in workplace settings, looking at things like job performance, organizational behavior, and employee well-being. While they do look at behavior, it's specifically in the context of work, not necessarily across the entire life span.\n\nThen there are developmental psychologists. I think this is the one. Developmental psychologists study how people grow and change over their lifetime, looking at physical, cognitive, and social development from infancy through old age. That sounds exactly like what the question is asking for.\n\nFinally, social psychologists. They study how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by others. While they do look at social aspects, they don't necessarily focus on changes over the entire life span. Their focus is more on interpersonal and group dynamics in specific situations.\n\nSo, based on this, I believe the answer is C. Developmental psychologists. But I'll double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\n- Psychometricians: Focus on measurement of psychological traits, not on developmental changes.\n\n- Occupational psychologists: Focus on work-related behaviors and issues, not necessarily across the entire life span.\n\n- Developmental psychologists:\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u4e2a\u4f53\u4ece\u51fa\u751f\u5230\u8001\u5e74\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u9898\u610f\u3002\n\n- Social psychologists: Focus on social influences on behavior, but not specifically on developmental changes over time.\n\nYeah, it seems clear that developmental psychologists are the ones who study these changes across the life span. I think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
