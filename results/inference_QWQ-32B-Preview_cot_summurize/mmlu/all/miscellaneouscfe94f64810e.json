I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what Arabic numerals are. I know that Arabic numerals are the numbers we use every day, like 1, 2, 3, and so on. They're also sometimes called Hindu-Arabic numerals because they were developed in India and then spread to the Arab world and later to Europe.\n\nSo, the Arabic numeral for '2' should just be '2'. That seems straightforward. Option A is '2', which matches what I know.\n\nNow, let's look at the other options to make sure. Option B is 'II'. I recognize that as the Roman numeral for 2. Roman numerals use letters from the alphabet to represent numbers: I for 1, V for 5, X for 10, and so on. So 'II' would be 1 + 1, which equals 2. But the question is asking for Arabic numerals, not Roman numerals. So B can't be the correct answer.\n\nOption C is 'I', which is the Roman numeral for 1. That's not 2, so that's not right.\n\nOption D is 'ii'. This might be similar to 'II' but in lowercase. It still represents 2 in Roman numerals, but again, it's not an Arabic numeral.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. '2'.\n\nTo double-check, I can think about other Arabic numerals. For example, the Arabic numeral for 1 is '1', for 3 is '3', and so on. So consistently, '2' is the Arabic numeral for two.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that in different numeral systems, the same number can be represented differently. For instance, in binary, 2 is written as '10', but that's not relevant here because the question specifies Arabic numerals.\n\nSo, I'm confident that A. '2' is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
