                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these options isn't a feature of an export processing zone. So, first things first, what exactly is an export processing zone?\n\nFrom what I recall, an export processing zone, or EPZ, is a special type of economic zone set up by a country to encourage exports. These zones usually offer incentives to businesses that set up operations there, with the goal of boosting the country's export earnings and stimulating economic growth.\n\nOkay, so looking at the options:\n\nA. Tariff reductions on exports.\n\nThat sounds like a likely feature. If a country wants to encourage exports, reducing tariffs on goods sent abroad makes sense. It makes those exports more competitive in the international market.\n\nB. Raw materials imported duty-free.\n\nHmm, that also seems plausible. If businesses in the EPZ are allowed to import raw materials without paying duties, it reduces their costs. This should make their final products more price-competitive when they export them.\n\nC. Exemption from customs duties.\n\nThis is similar to option B but seems more broad. Exemption from customs duties could apply to both imports and exports. Again, this would reduce costs for businesses in the EPZ and make their products more attractive in the global market.\n\nD. Strict pollution regulations.\n\nNow, this one is interesting. While it's important for environmental reasons to have strict pollution regulations, I'm not sure if this is typically considered a feature of EPZs. In fact, sometimes EPZs are criticized for having lax environmental standards to attract businesses.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up what exactly are the features of EPZs.\n\nLet me think about this differently. What are the typical incentives or features that governments offer in EPZs to attract businesses?\n\nWell, usually, they offer things like:\n\n- Tax holidays or exemptions\n\n- Duty exemptions on imported machinery and raw materials\n\n- Simplified administrative procedures\n\n- Infrastructure support\n\n- Access to skilled labor\n\n- Sometimes, subsidies or other financial incentives\n\nSo, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Tariff reductions on exports \u2013 that aligns with the goal of making exports more competitive.\n\nB. Raw materials imported duty-free \u2013 that's directly related to reducing production costs.\n\nC. Exemption from customs duties \u2013 again, reducing costs and simplifying trade.\n\nD. Strict pollution regulations \u2013 this doesn't seem to fit with the typical incentives offered in EPZs. In fact, it might be seen as a barrier to business operations, which could deter some companies from setting up in EPZs.\n\nBut, hold on, environmental regulations are important, and some countries do have strict environmental standards in their EPZs. However, from what I remember, the main features of EPZs are more focused on tax and duty exemptions, rather than environmental regulations.\n\nMaybe I should consider that strict pollution regulations aren't necessarily a feature that's unique to EPZs, and perhaps in some cases, EPZs might have lower environmental standards to attract businesses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I understand that EPZs focus more on economic incentives rather than environmental regulations.\n\nGiven that, option D seems like the least likely feature compared to the others.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. Strict pollution regulations.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me consider why someone might think that strict pollution regulations are a feature of EPZs.\n\nWell, perhaps in some countries, EPZs are required to adhere to higher environmental standards as part of their operation. However, from my understanding, this isn't universally the case, and it's not typically highlighted as a primary feature compared to the economic incentives.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C are all directly related to reducing costs and streamlining trade, which are central to the purpose of EPZs.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct answer, as it's not typically considered a core feature of export processing zones.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
