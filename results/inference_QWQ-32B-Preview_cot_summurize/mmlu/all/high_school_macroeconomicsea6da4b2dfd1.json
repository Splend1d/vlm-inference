                    "text": "So I've got this economics problem here. The government decides to increase both government spending and taxes by the same amount, and they want to keep a balanced budget. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.75. I need to figure out which of the options is correct regarding the policy direction, the expenditure multiplier, and the tax multiplier.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a balanced budget means in this context. If the government increases spending and taxes by the same amount, theoretically, there shouldn't be a change in the budget deficit or surplus, hence it's balanced.\n\nNow, about the policy direction. If the government is increasing spending, that usually stimulates the economy, which is expansionary. But since they're also increasing taxes by the same amount, which tends to reduce disposable income and therefore consumption, that's contractionary. So, overall, is this policy expansionary or contractionary?\n\nLet me think about the net effect. The increase in government spending directly increases GDP, while the increase in taxes reduces disposable income and thus consumption. But since the MPC is 0.75, meaning that for every additional dollar of income, 75 cents are spent, the reduction in consumption might not completely offset the increase in government spending.\n\nMaybe I should look at the balanced budget multiplier to understand the net effect on GDP.\n\nI recall that the balanced budget multiplier is the combined effect of an equal increase in government spending and taxes. The formula for the balanced budget multiplier is usually the expenditure multiplier minus the tax multiplier, divided by the change in government spending and taxes being the same.\n\nWait, actually, the balanced budget multiplier is often considered to be equal to one, meaning that the net effect on GDP is equal to the change in government spending, because the positive effect of government spending is partially offset by the negative effect of the tax increase.\n\nBut I need to verify that.\n\nLet me recall the formulas for the expenditure multiplier and the tax multiplier.\n\nThe expenditure multiplier is usually 1 / (1 - MPC), which with MPC = 0.75 would be 1 / (1 - 0.75) = 1 / 0.25 = 4.\n\nThe tax multiplier is typically -MPC / (1 - MPC), so with MPC = 0.75, it would be -0.75 / 0.25 = -3.\n\nSo, the expenditure multiplier is 4, and the tax multiplier is -3.\n\nNow, in this scenario, government spending increases by a certain amount, which would multiply through the economy by 4, and taxes increase by the same amount, which would reduce GDP by 3 times that amount.\n\nTherefore, the net effect on GDP would be the sum of these two effects: 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nSo, the balanced budget multiplier is 1, meaning that GDP increases by the amount of the increase in government spending (assuming taxes are increased by the same amount).\n\nTherefore, even though taxes are increased, the net effect is still an increase in GDP, which suggests that the policy is expansionary.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. expansionary 4 3\n\nB. expansionary 4 -3\n\nC. contractionary 4 3\n\nD. contractionary 4 -3\n\nGiven that the expenditure multiplier is 4 and the tax multiplier is -3, and the policy is expansionary, the correct choice seems to be option B.\n\nBut wait, in option B, the tax multiplier is listed as -3, which matches what I calculated, and the policy is expansionary, which also matches my conclusion.\n\nOption A has the tax multiplier as 3, which would be incorrect because an increase in taxes should have a negative impact on GDP.\n\nOption C says contractionary, but based on my analysis, it should be expansionary.\n\nOption D also says contractionary with a tax multiplier of -3, which is inconsistent with my conclusion.\n\nTherefore, option B appears to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let me double-check the balanced budget multiplier.\n\nIf government spending increases by, say, $100, and taxes increase by $100, then:\n\nThe increase in GDP from government spending is $100 * 4 = $400.\n\nThe decrease in GDP from taxes is $100 * (-3) = -$300.\n\nSo, the net change in GDP is $400 - $300 = $100, which is equal to the initial increase in government spending.\n\nHence, the balanced budget multiplier is 1, and the policy is expansionary.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: expansionary, expenditure multiplier 4, tax multiplier -3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
