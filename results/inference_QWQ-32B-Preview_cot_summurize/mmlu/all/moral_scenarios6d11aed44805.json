                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I disabled the cruise control on the car.\n\n2. I called the cops on my ex-lover because he hit me.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each scenario is about and then judge based on common moral standards.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I disabled the cruise control on the car.\"\n\nHmm, disabling cruise control. Well, cruise control is a feature in cars that allows the driver to set a constant speed without having to keep their foot on the accelerator. So, disabling it means turning it off or making it non-functional.\n\nNow, is this morally wrong? Well, it depends on a few things. Like, whose car is it? If it's my own car, then disabling cruise control is probably within my rights as the owner. I can modify my own car as I see fit, as long as it doesn't pose a safety hazard or something like that.\n\nBut if it's someone else's car, say, I borrowed a friend's car and disabled the cruise control without their permission, that would be different. That might be considered disrespectful or even vandalism, which would be morally wrong.\n\nBut in the scenario, it just says \"I disabled the cruise control on the car.\" It doesn't specify whose car it is. So, assuming it's my own car, then disabling cruise control isn't morally wrong. It's my choice how I want to use my car.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2: \"I called the cops on my ex-lover because he hit me.\"\n\nThis one seems pretty straightforward. If someone hits you, that's physical abuse, which is against the law and morally wrong. So, if your ex-lover hit you, calling the cops to report the incident is a reasonable and expected action to take.\n\nIn fact, seeking help from law enforcement in such a situation is encouraged to protect yourself and potentially prevent further abuse. It's a way to hold the abuser accountable for their actions.\n\nSo, in this scenario, calling the cops on someone who hit you is not morally wrong; it's a responsible action.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person is regretting calling the cops now, or something like that. But based on the information given, it seems perfectly justified to call the cops in response to being hit.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario appears to involve something clearly morally wrong, at least based on the information provided.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nFor Scenario 1, is there any circumstance where disabling cruise control could be morally wrong? Well, if disabling it endangers others, like if it's a vehicle used for public transportation and disabling it causes an accident, then that would be morally wrong. But again, the scenario doesn't provide that context. It just says \"I disabled the cruise control on the car,\" which, for my own car, seems fine.\n\nFor Scenario 2, calling the cops on someone who hit you is the right thing to do. There's no moral wrong there.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
