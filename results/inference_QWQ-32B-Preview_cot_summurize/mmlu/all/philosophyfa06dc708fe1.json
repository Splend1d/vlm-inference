Legality. I remember that W.D. Ross was a philosopher who talked about duties that seem binding at first glance, but I don't recall all the specific duties he listed.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Ross's prima facie duties are. I think he proposed a few key duties that people have in moral situations. Let's see:\n\n1. Fidelity: This is about keeping promises and being faithful in our commitments. That seems like something Ross would include.\n\n2. Reparation: This is about making amends for wrongs done. I think this is another one of Ross's duties.\n\n3. Gratitude: Repaying those who have benefited us. Yeah, that's probably on the list.\n\n4. Justice: Giving people their due, treating them equally and fairly.\n\n5. Beneficence: Acting in the interest of others, promoting their good.\n\n6. Self-improvement: Improving our own character and abilities.\n\n7. Non-maleficence: Not harming others.\n\nI think those are the main ones. Now, looking at the options:\n\nA. Fidelity: That's definitely one of them.\n\nB. Beneficence: Also on the list.\n\nC. Non-maleficence: Yep, that's there too.\n\nD. Legality: Hmm, I don't recall Ross mentioning legality as a prima facie duty. In fact, I think Ross was more concerned with what we ought to do based on moral principles, rather than what the law requires.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps Ross did include legality as a duty. I should double-check.\n\nI know that Ross's duties are supposed to be based on intuitionism, where certain duties are self-evident to moral intuition. Legality might not fit into that framework as naturally as the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps legality is implied under justice, since following the law is part of treating people justly. But I don't remember Ross specifically mentioning legality as a separate duty.\n\nLet me try to recall if there are any sources that list legality as one of Ross's prima facie duties. I don't recall any off the top of my head, and my ethics textbooks don't mention it.\n\nMoreover, Ross was more concerned with moral duties that are independent of legal systems, emphasizing that sometimes moral duties may conflict with legal duties.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that legality is not one of Ross's prima facie duties.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Legality.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's make sure that non-maleficence is indeed one of Ross's duties. I think it is often included in discussions of prima facie duties, and Ross did emphasize not harming others as a moral obligation.\n\nYes, in Ross's framework, non-maleficence would fall under the duty to avoid acting badly or harming others.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are all part of Ross's duties, while D, legality, is not.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
