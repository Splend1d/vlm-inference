                    "text": "So here's this scenario with two guys planning a burglary and involving an alarm specialist. I need to figure out who's liable for what crimes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are two men who agreed to burglarize a home. That sounds like conspiracy to me because conspiracy is when two or more people agree to commit a crime together. So, option A says the two men are guilty of conspiracy, which seems plausible.\n\nBut then, they involve an alarm specialist. One of the men asks the specialist for help in disarming the security system. The specialist says he doesn't want to participate but tells them how to do it themselves. So, did the specialist become part of the conspiracy? Hmm.\n\nIn law, for someone to be part of a conspiracy, they need to agree to participate in the crime. Here, the specialist says he doesn't want to participate but still provides information on how to disarm the system. Is that enough to consider him part of the conspiracy?\n\nI think it's a gray area. He didn't agree to help; he said he didn't want to participate. But he still gave them the knowledge they needed to carry out their plan. Maybe he's not directly liable for conspiracy, but his actions could be considered aiding and abetting.\n\nNow, the two men go to the house but see a vicious guard dog and decide not to proceed with the burglary. So, they abandoned their plan. What does that mean for their liability?\n\nAttempted burglary would require that they took a substantial step towards committing the burglary but didn't complete it. Here, they went to the house but decided not to go through with it because of the dog. Is that a substantial step?\n\nProbably, going to the house and preparing to commit the burglary counts as a substantial step. So, they might be liable for attempted burglary.\n\nBut what about the alarm specialist? Does his providing information make him liable for attempted burglary as well?\n\nWell, if the specialist is considered an accomplice, then he could be liable for the attempt, assuming his actions contributed to their preparation.\n\nWait, but they didn't actually disarm the alarm because they didn't proceed due to the dog. So, did the specialist's assistance contribute to an attempt?\n\nMaybe. The information might have given them the confidence to go to the house, even if they didn't ultimately disarm the alarm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look at the options again.\n\nOption B says all three are guilty of conspiracy. But the specialist didn't agree to participate; he just provided information. So, maybe not conspiracy.\n\nOption C says the two men are guilty of conspiracy and all three are guilty of attempted burglary. That seems possible because the men took a substantial step, and the specialist aided them.\n\nOption D says all three are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted burglary. That might be going too far, given the specialist's reluctance to participate.\n\nOption A is just that the two men are guilty of conspiracy, which is probably true, but doesn't address the attempted burglary.\n\nI think the most accurate statement is Option C: the two men are guilty of conspiracy, and all three are guilty of attempted burglary. The specialist aided in the attempt by providing crucial information, even if he didn't agree to be part of the conspiracy.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to look up some legal definitions to confirm.\n\nFirst, conspiracy generally requires an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime. Here, it's clear that the two men agreed to burglarize the home, so they are conspirators.\n\nAs for the specialist, since he didn't agree to participate in the crime but still provided assistance, he might be liable as an accessory or for aiding and abetting, but not necessarily for conspiracy.\n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, providing assistance with knowledge that the assistance will be used to commit a crime can be considered part of the conspiracy. It's complicated.\n\nNow, for attempted burglary, it typically requires a substantial step towards committing the burglary with the intent to commit the crime. Going to the house and preparing to burglarize it would likely qualify as a substantial step.\n\nThe specialist, by providing the information on how to disarm the alarm, contributed to their preparation, which could make him liable for attempted burglary as an accomplice.\n\nBut again, since he didn't agree to the crime, his liability might be different from that of the conspirators.\n\nMaybe the best answer is Option C: the two men are guilty of conspiracy, and all three are guilty of attempted burglary. This way, the men are liable for conspiracy, and the specialist is liable for aiding and abetting the attempt.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the specialist is only liable for providing the information, which could be considered obstruction or something else, but in the context of this question, it seems like he's involved in the attempt.\n\nI need to be careful here because criminal liability can vary by jurisdiction, but assuming standard common law principles, Option C seems the most accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
