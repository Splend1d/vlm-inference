                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a normally distributed random variable X, with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 4. I need to find the approximate interquartile range for this distribution, and there are four options to choose from. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the interquartile range (IQR) is. I think it's the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3), so IQR = Q3 - Q1. In a normal distribution, these quartiles correspond to specific z-scores, right?\n\nI remember that for a standard normal distribution, Q1 is at approximately z = -0.6745 and Q3 is at z = 0.6745. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, these z-scores are equidistant from the mean.\n\nGiven that, I can find the values of Q1 and Q3 for my distribution, which has a mean (\u03bc) of 25 and a standard deviation (\u03c3) of 4.\n\nSo, the formula to find a value from a z-score is:\n\nX = \u03bc + z\u03c3\n\nLet me calculate Q1:\n\nQ1 = 25 + (-0.6745)(4) = 25 - 2.70 = 22.30\n\nAnd Q3:\n\nQ3 = 25 + (0.6745)(4) = 25 + 2.70 = 27.70\n\nNow, the interquartile range is Q3 - Q1 = 27.70 - 22.30 = 5.40\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 25.00 \u2013 22.30 = 2.70\n\nB. 27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40\n\nC. 27.70 \u00f7 22.30 = 1.24\n\nD. 2.00(4.00) = 8.00\n\nOption B matches the calculation I just did. So, it seems like B is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. I recall that in a normal distribution, approximately 50% of the data lies within one standard deviation of the mean, but for quartiles, it's specifically at z-scores of approximately \u00b10.6745.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that the interquartile range for a normal distribution is approximately 1.35 times the standard deviation. Let me see if that holds true.\n\nSo, IQR \u2248 1.35\u03c3 = 1.35 * 4 = 5.4\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation of 5.40.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the difference between Q3 and Q1 should be twice the distance from the mean to Q1 or Q3, since the distribution is symmetric.\n\nFrom my earlier calculation, the distance from the mean to Q1 is 2.70, and similarly to Q3 it's +2.70. So, the total IQR would be 2 * 2.70 = 5.40, which again matches.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that the interquartile range is 5.40.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, option B is \"27.70 \u2013 22.30 = 5.40\", which is exactly that.\n\nOption A is \"25.00 \u2013 22.30 = 2.70\", which is just the distance from the mean to Q1, not the IQR.\n\nOption C is \"27.70 \u00f7 22.30 = 1.24\", which is irrelevant for IQR.\n\nOption D is \"2.00(4.00) = 8.00\", which might be mistaken if someone thought IQR is 2 standard deviations, but that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other way to approach this.\n\nI know that in a normal distribution, the z-scores corresponding to the quartiles are approximately \u00b10.6745, as I used earlier. Alternatively, some sources might use slightly different values, but 0.6745 is widely accepted.\n\nUsing this z-score, the calculation for Q1 and Q3 is straightforward, as I did.\n\nAlternatively, if I look at the empirical rule, which states that approximately 68% of the data lies within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three. But that doesn't directly help with the quartiles.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the percentiles directly. For example, Q1 is the 25th percentile and Q3 is the 75th percentile. In a normal distribution, we can find the values corresponding to these percentiles using the z-table or z-scores.\n\nLooking up the z-scores for the 25th and 75th percentiles in a standard normal distribution table, I should find values close to \u00b10.6745.\n\nSo, my initial approach seems solid.\n\nIn conclusion, the approximate interquartile range for this normal distribution with mean 25 and standard deviation 4 is 5.40, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
