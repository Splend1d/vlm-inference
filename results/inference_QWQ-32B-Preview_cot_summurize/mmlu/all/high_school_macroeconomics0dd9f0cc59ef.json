Let me think this through.\n\nSay's law, named after Jean-Baptiste Say, is a principle in economics that suggests that supply creates its own demand. So, basically, when goods are produced, they generate income which is then used to demand other goods. It's like a cycle where producing something leads to the ability to buy something else.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. When price goes up, supply goes up.\n\nHmm, that sounds more like the law of supply, where higher prices incentivize producers to supply more. But that's not specifically Say's law.\n\nB. It is better to give than to receive.\n\nThis seems more like a moral statement or a proverb, not an economic law.\n\nC. Demand creates its own supply.\n\nThis sounds similar to Say's law but inverted. Say's law is about supply creating its own demand, not the other way around.\n\nD. Supply creates its own demand.\n\nYes, this matches what I recall about Say's law. The idea is that the act of producing goods (supply) generates the income that leads to demand for other goods.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D. Supply creates its own demand.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. In Say's law, the focus is on production and supply driving demand, not the other way around. It's a concept that was influential in classical economics, suggesting that economies tend to be self-regulating and that overproduction is not a general problem because supply creates its own demand.\n\nOption C is close, but it's the opposite of Say's law. The idea that demand creates its own supply might be related to the acceleration principle in economics, which explains how increases in demand can lead to increases in supply through investment and production expansion. But that's not the same as Say's law.\n\nOption A is about the relationship between price and supply, which is a basic microeconomic principle but not specifically Say's law.\n\nOption B is unrelated to economics.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Supply creates its own demand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
