But on the way, I stop in Columbus, Ohio to visit a relative, and then I fall in love with the city and decide to stay there instead. So, basically, I changed my destination because of something I encountered along the way, which is Columbus.\n\nNow, let's see what each option means:\n\nA. Intervening opportunity: This is when someone changes their migration plans because they find a better opportunity somewhere else along the way. It's like, oh, I was going to go here, but I found something even better here, so I'll stay here instead.\n\nB. Distance decay: This is a concept where the interaction or influence between two places decreases as the distance between them increases. It's not really about changing migration plans; it's more about how distance affects relationships or movements.\n\nC. Involuntary migration: This is when people are forced to move against their will, like because of war, natural disasters, or other compelling reasons. In this case, I chose to stay in Columbus; it was a voluntary decision.\n\nD. Push-pull factors: These are the reasons why people leave one place (push factors) and go to another place (pull factors). For example, maybe I'm leaving my hometown because of lack of jobs (push) and going to Pittsburgh for better job opportunities (pull). But in this scenario, I changed my mind and stayed in Columbus instead.\n\nSo, in this situation, I think A. intervening opportunity fits best because I found something attractive in Columbus that made me change my original plan of moving to Pittsburgh.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. Was there any distance decay involved? Well, maybe, but it's not the main point here. I wasn't interacting with Pittsburgh from Columbus; I was choosing to stay in Columbus instead of continuing to Pittsburgh.\n\nWas it involuntary migration? No, because I chose to stay.\n\nWere push-pull factors involved? Probably, but again, the key point is that I changed my destination because of an opportunity in Columbus.\n\nTherefore, intervening opportunity seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
