                    "text": "Let's see what's going on here. So, there's this kiosk at the airport that sells souvenirs ranging from $3.99 to $29.99, and the average price is $14.75. The airport is increasing the rent by 5%, and to cover this extra cost, the kiosk owner decides to raise the price of all items by 50 cents.\n\nNow, we need to figure out what happens to the mean price and some other statistics after this price increase. The options are:\n\nA. Both the mean price and the range of prices increase by 50 cents.\n\nB. The mean price stays the same, but the range increases by 50 cents.\n\nC. Both the mean price and the standard deviation increase by 50 cents.\n\nD. The mean price increases by 50 cents, but the standard deviation remains the same.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the mean price. The mean is just the average price of all the items. If every item's price increases by 50 cents, then the average price should also increase by 50 cents, right? Because you're adding the same amount to each price.\n\nSo, if the original mean was $14.75, after adding 50 cents to each item, the new mean should be $14.75 + $0.50 = $15.25.\n\nNext, the range of prices. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest prices. If you add 50 cents to every price, both the highest and the lowest prices will increase by 50 cents. So, the difference between them remains the same.\n\nFor example, originally, the range is $29.99 - $3.99 = $26.00. After the increase, the highest price becomes $29.99 + $0.50 = $30.49, and the lowest becomes $3.99 + $0.50 = $4.49. The new range is $30.49 - $4.49 = $26.00, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, the range doesn't change.\n\nNow, what about the standard deviation? Standard deviation measures the spread of the prices around the mean. If you add the same amount to every price, the spread doesn't change because you're shifting all the prices by the same amount. So, the standard deviation remains the same.\n\nFor example, if you have prices like $10, $12, and $14, the standard deviation is based on the differences from the mean, which is $12. The differences are -$2, $0, and $2. If you add 50 cents to each, the new prices are $10.50, $12.50, and $14.50, with a new mean of $12.50. The differences are still -$2, $0, and $2, so the standard deviation is the same.\n\nTherefore, adding a constant to each value shifts the mean by that constant but doesn't affect the standard deviation.\n\nSo, going back to the options:\n\nA. Mean increases by 50 cents, range increases by 50 cents. But we saw that the range stays the same.\n\nB. Mean stays the same, range increases by 50 cents. But the mean increases, and the range stays the same.\n\nC. Mean and standard deviation both increase by 50 cents. But standard deviation stays the same.\n\nD. Mean increases by 50 cents, standard deviation remains the same. This matches what we've concluded.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Is there any chance that the range could change?\n\nWell, if you add 50 cents to every price, the highest price increases by 50 cents, and the lowest price also increases by 50 cents. So, the difference between them remains the same. So, the range doesn't change.\n\nAnd for standard deviation, since it's a measure of spread, adding a constant to each value doesn't change the spread; it just shifts all the values up by the same amount.\n\nSo, yes, D seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
