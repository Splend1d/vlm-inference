                    "text": "Let's see what's needed for a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, on a DNA sample. PCR is a technique used to make many copies of a specific DNA segment. It's pretty cool because it allows scientists to amplify DNA quickly in a lab setting.\n\nFirst off, I know that PCR involves cycles of heating and cooling to denature the DNA and allow primers to bind, followed by extension to make new DNA strands. So, what do I need to make this happen?\n\nOption A is reverse transcriptase. Hmm, I think reverse transcriptase is used to make DNA from RNA, like in reverse transcription PCR or RT-PCR. But for regular PCR, which starts with DNA, do I need reverse transcriptase? I don't think so. PCR is for amplifying DNA, not converting RNA to DNA. So, maybe A isn't required.\n\nOption B is a vacuum chamber. That sounds really high-tech, but I don't recall PCR requiring a vacuum chamber. PCR is usually done in a thermal cycler, which heats and cools the reaction mixture at specific temperatures. I don't think a vacuum is necessary for that process. So, probably B isn't required.\n\nOption C is primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA. Primers are short DNA sequences that bind to specific regions of the DNA template. They initiate the DNA synthesis by the polymerase enzyme. So, yes, primers are essential for PCR. Without them, the polymerase wouldn't know where to start copying the DNA. So, C seems required.\n\nOption D is DNA ligase. DNA ligase is an enzyme that connects two separate DNA fragments by forming phosphodiester bonds between them. It's used in processes like DNA repair or in molecular cloning to join DNA fragments. But in PCR, the polymerase enzyme synthesizes new DNA strands, and ligase isn't needed to connect the newly synthesized strands. So, I don't think D is required for PCR.\n\nWait a minute, I forgot to mention that in PCR, a heat-stable DNA polymerase, like Taq polymerase, is used to synthesize new DNA strands. So, besides primers, you need the polymerase enzyme, nucleotides (dNTPs), and a suitable buffer solution. But looking at the options, only primers and ligase are listed, and ligase isn't needed.\n\nSo, to sum it up, for PCR on a DNA sample, you need primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA. Reverse transcriptase isn't necessary unless you're dealing with RNA, a vacuum chamber isn't required, and DNA ligase isn't needed because the polymerase takes care of synthesizing new DNA.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
