                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Logan's Address. So, first things first, I need to understand what Logan is saying here. He's an Indian leader speaking in 1774, and he's talking about his experiences with white people.\n\nHe starts by appealing to any white man who might have entered his cabin hungry and wasn't given meat, or cold and naked and wasn't clothed. So, he's emphasizing his hospitality towards whites. Then he mentions that during a long and bloody war, he stayed neutral and advocated for peace. His own people even called him the friend of the white man because of his love for them.\n\nBut then, something tragic happens. Colonel Cresap, without provocation, murders all of Logan's relations, including his women and children. He's expressing that there's no drop of his blood left in any living creature because of this massacre. This personal tragedy calls for revenge, which Logan seeks by killing many whites.\n\nHowever, now that revenge is satisfied, he rejoices in the prospect of peace for his country. But he wants to make it clear that his joy isn't out of fear; he's not afraid of anyone. He's a man of courage who wouldn't turn his heel to save his life. He ends by asking who mourns for him, suggesting that he might not have many allies or that his way of life is fading away.\n\nNow, the question is about how a sympathetic reader in the early years of the United States would react to this address in terms of Indian policies. So, I need to think about what kind of policy someone who feels bad for Logan might support.\n\nOption A is exterminating all Indians. That seems really extreme and opposite to being sympathetic. If someone is sympathetic to Logan's plight, they probably wouldn't want to exterminate all Indians. So, I can likely rule that one out.\n\nOption B is respecting Indian territory and sovereignty. This seems more aligned with sympathy. If someone empathizes with Logan's loss and his desire for peace, they might want to ensure that Indian lands are respected and that Indians have their own autonomous regions. This could be a possible answer.\n\nOption C is encouraging Indians to migrate to Canada and Mexico. Hmm, this might have been a thought back then, but it seems a bit dismissive of their presence in the United States. Sympathy might not necessarily lead to pushing them out of the country, but rather finding a way for coexistence.\n\nOption D is building reservations and encouraging Indians to change their ways. This seems like a paternalistic approach, where whites decide what's best for the Indians. While it might be well-intentioned, it still involves imposing changes on Indian cultures and ways of life.\n\nConsidering these options, if a reader is sympathetic to Logan's address, they would probably favor a policy that acknowledges the injustices done to Indians and seeks to prevent further conflicts by respecting their lands and\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743. So, respecting Indian territory and sovereignty seems like the most sympathetic approach.\n\nBut let's think deeper. In the context of the early United States, there were various attitudes towards Indians. Some people saw them as savages who needed to be controlled or eliminated, while others saw them as noble beings who deserved respect and fair treatment.\n\nLogan's address presents him as a peaceful leader who was driven to violence only by a personal tragedy. A sympathetic reader would likely see him as a victim of unjust violence and want to prevent such tragedies in the future.\n\nRespecting Indian territory and sovereignty could be a way to achieve that. By recognizing Indian lands and their right to govern themselves, the U.S. could potentially avoid conflicts and allow Indians to live according to their own customs without interference.\n\nOn the other hand, building reservations and encouraging Indians to change their ways might seem like a way to assimilate them into white culture, which could be seen as patronizing. While some might see it as helpful, a sympathetic reader might respect Logan's way of life and not want to impose changes on him or his people.\n\nEncouraging Indians to migrate to Canada and Mexico seems like a way to remove the problem rather than addressing the root issues. It doesn't seem very sympathetic, as it doesn't consider the Indians' attachment to their ancestral lands.\n\nExterminating all Indians is clearly the least sympathetic option, as it involves violence and genocide.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, respecting Indian territory and sovereignty seems to be the most sympathetic approach. It aligns with the idea of peaceful coexistence and recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that in reality, U.S. policies towards Indians in the early years often involved displacement, violence, and attempts at assimilation, rather than respecting their sovereignty. So, while option B might be the most sympathetic, it may not have been the most common or realistic policy at the time.\n\nBut for the purpose of this question, which asks about a sympathetic reader's likely support, I think B is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
