Positive environment and micro-management\n\nC. Age and quality of life\n\nD. Lack of control and insufficient reward\n\nHmm, burnout is when someone feels really exhausted and overwhelmed from their job or responsibilities. I've heard it's related to stress and not feeling supported.\n\nOption A mentions external locus of control and insufficient praise. External locus of control means someone believes that events are determined by factors outside their influence, like luck or other people. So, if someone feels like they can't control what happens to them, and they don't get enough recognition or praise for their work, that could lead to feeling unsupported and maybe burnout.\n\nOption B says positive environment and micro-management. A positive environment sounds good, like a supportive workplace. But micro-management is when bosses closely monitor and control every little thing an employee does, which can be stressful. So, maybe having a positive environment could help prevent burnout, but micro-management could cause it. This option seems a bit mixed.\n\nOption C is age and quality of life. Age is just how old someone is, and quality of life relates to their general well-being. These seem more like personal factors, but I'm not sure directly how they cause burnout. Maybe older people or those with lower quality of life are more susceptible to burnout, but it's not directly about the work environment.\n\nOption D is lack of control and insufficient reward. Lack of control means someone doesn't have much say in how they do their work or make decisions, which can be stressful. Insufficient reward could mean not getting paid enough or not feeling appreciated for their work. Both of these sound like they could lead to burnout.\n\nComparing options A and D, both mention insufficient praise or reward and lack of control. Option A includes external locus of control, which is similar to lack of control, and option D directly says lack of control.\n\nI think option D is more straightforward and directly relates to factors that can cause burnout: lack of control over one's work and not receiving adequate rewards for it.\n\nOption B is confusing because a positive environment should reduce burnout, but micro-management could increase it. So, it's not clear if overall it increases burnout or not.\n\nOption C seems more about personal factors rather than work-related factors that directly cause burnout.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D: lack of control and insufficient reward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
