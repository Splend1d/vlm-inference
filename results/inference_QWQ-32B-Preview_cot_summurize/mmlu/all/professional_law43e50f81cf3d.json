                    "text": "Let's dive into this contract scenario between the homeowner and the painter. So, on May 1, they agreed that the painter would paint the homeowner's house for $10,000. The painting was supposed to happen in June, and the payment was due within one week after the painting was finished. There's also a clause that says, \"The rights under this contract are not to be assigned.\"\n\nNow, the painter started painting on June 1 and then, on June 10, assigned his right to receive payment from the homeowner to his nephew.\n\nWe need to figure out which statement is most accurate regarding this assignment.\n\nOption A says: \"The homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew, since the contract was nonassignable.\"\n\nHmm, the contract does have a no-assignment clause: \"The rights under this contract are not to be assigned.\" So, generally, if there's a no-assignment clause, assignments are not permitted unless the other party consents. But, in this case, the painter assigned his right to receive payment to his nephew anyway.\n\nIn contract law, assignment of contractual rights is generally permissible unless there's a specific prohibition in the contract or the nature of the contract makes assignment incompatible with its purpose. Here, the assignment is of the right to receive payment, which is an assignment of a monetary right, not of the obligation to perform the painting.\n\nSo, even though there's a no-assignment clause, the assignment might still be enforceable because it's just the right to receive money, not the obligation to perform the painting service.\n\nBut, the no-assignment clause might still have some effect. I need to think about that.\n\nOption B says: \"Since personal service contracts of this nature are nonassignable, the homeowner would be under no duty to pay the nephew.\"\n\nWait, is this a personal service contract? Well, the painter is providing a service\u2014painting the house. Generally, contracts for personal services are not assignable because the performance depends on the particular skills or characteristics of the individual performing the service.\n\nHowever, in this case, the assignment is not of the obligation to perform the service but of the right to receive payment for the service already performed. So, even if it's a personal service contract, assigning the right to receive payment might still be allowed.\n\nI recall that in many jurisdictions, assignments of contractual rights are permitted unless specifically prohibited by law or the contract itself. Since the contract has a no-assignment clause, that complicates things.\n\nOption C says: \"The assignment would constitute a novation, relieving the homeowner of liability.\"\n\nNovation is when a new contract is agreed upon by all parties, replacing the old one. In this case, the assignment is just transferring the right to receive payment, not creating a new contract. So, this doesn't sound right.\n\nOption D says: \"The assignment would be irrevocable if it were reduced to writing and signed by the painter.\"\n\nAssignments can be revocable or irrevocable. Generally, an assignment is irrevocable if it's for consideration or if it's in writing and signed by the assignor. In this case, the assignment is to the painter's nephew, but we don't know if there was consideration involved.\n\nBut, more importantly, even if the assignment is in writing and signed, the no-assignment clause in the original contract might override that.\n\nWait, perhaps the key here is whether the assignment is enforceable despite the no-assignment clause.\n\nI think the most accurate statement is that the homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew because of the no-assignment clause.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the original contract prohibits assignment of rights, then assigning the right to receive payment might be invalid.\n\nHowever, some argue that assignments of monetary rights are freely assignable unless the contract specifically prohibits it.\n\nIn this case, the contract says, \"The rights under this contract are not to be assigned.\" So, it seems broad enough to cover the assignment of the right to receive payment.\n\nTherefore, despite the assignment to the nephew, the homeowner might not be obligated to pay the nephew because the assignment was invalid due to the no-assignment clause.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the homeowner is estopped from relying on the no-assignment clause if the painting has been completed and the assignment has already been made.\n\nBut, based on the information given, it seems that the no-assignment clause would prevent the assignment from being enforceable.\n\nTherefore, the homeowner would not be obligated to pay the nephew.\n\nSo, option A is the most accurate.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, even though it's a personal service contract, the assignment is of a monetary right, which might still be assignable.\n\nOption C is wrong because it's not a novation.\n\nOption D might be partially correct, but given the no-assignment clause, the assignment might still not be enforceable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
