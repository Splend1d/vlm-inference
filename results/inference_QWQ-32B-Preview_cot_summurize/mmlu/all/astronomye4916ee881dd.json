                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out what one astronomical unit (AU) is equal to. I remember that an AU is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, but I don't recall the exact number off the top of my head. Let me think about this.\n\nI know that light travels at about 300,000 kilometers per second, and it takes around 8 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth. So, if I can calculate the distance light travels in 8 minutes, that might give me a rough idea of what an AU is.\n\nFirst, convert 8 minutes to seconds: 8 minutes * 60 seconds per minute = 480 seconds.\n\nNow, distance equals speed multiplied by time, so:\n\nDistance = 300,000 km/s * 480 s = 144,000,000 km.\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the distance from the Sun to the Earth is approximately 144 million kilometers. But I think the actual definition of an AU is slightly different.\n\nI recall that the official definition of one astronomical unit is exactly 149,597,870,700 meters, which is equivalent to about 149.6 million kilometers.\n\nComparing this to the options given:\n\nA. 130 million km\n\nB. 150 million km\n\nC. 170 million km\n\nD. 190 million km\n\nThe closest option to 149.6 million km is 150 million km, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, 149.6 million km is closer to 150 million km than to 130 million km. So, option B seems to be the correct choice.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's check if there's any other definition or if there's been any change in the definition over time.\n\nI remember that the definition was revised in 2012 to be exactly 149,597,870,700 meters, so it's precise.\n\nGiven that, 149,597,870,700 meters is equal to 149,597,870.7 kilometers.\n\nRounding that to the nearest million kilometers gives us 150 million km.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B, 150 million km.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the other options:\n\nOption A, 130 million km, is significantly less than the actual value.\n\nOption C, 170 million km, is higher than the actual value.\n\nOption D, 190 million km, is even higher.\n\nSo, option B is indeed the closest and most accurate among the choices provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n"
