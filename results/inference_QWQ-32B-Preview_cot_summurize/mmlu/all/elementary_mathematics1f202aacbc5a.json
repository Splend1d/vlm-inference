                    "text": "So I have this problem here. It says that a stack of 7 pennies has a height of 1 centimeter. Nick has a stack of pennies that's 4 centimeters high, and I need to find out how many pennies, n, are in Nick's stack. There are four options for equations: A. n = 7 + 4, B. n = 7 - 4, C. n = 7 \u00d7 4, and D. n = 7 \u00f7 4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of pennies and the height of the stack. The problem tells me that 7 pennies make 1 centimeter. So, if I have 4 centimeters, I need to find out how many pennies that would be.\n\nLet me think about this. If 7 pennies are in 1 centimeter, then in 4 centimeters, there would be 4 times as many pennies, right? Because each centimeter adds another 7 pennies.\n\nSo, that means I should multiply the number of pennies per centimeter by the number of centimeters. That is, n = 7 \u00d7 4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I add another centimeter, I add another 7 pennies. So, for 1 cm, it's 7 pennies; for 2 cm, it's 14 pennies; for 3 cm, it's 21 pennies; and for 4 cm, it's 28 pennies. So, yes, n = 7 \u00d7 4 makes sense.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is n = 7 + 4. That would be 11 pennies. But that doesn't make sense because if 7 pennies are in 1 cm, then 4 cm should have more than 7 pennies, specifically 28 pennies, not 11.\n\nOption B is n = 7 - 4. That would be 3 pennies, which is less than 7. That can't be right because the stack is taller than 1 cm.\n\nOption D is n = 7 \u00f7 4. That's 1.75 pennies, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a penny in this context.\n\nSo, the only logical choice is C, n = 7 \u00d7 4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about the units. If 7 pennies make 1 cm, then the number of pennies per centimeter is 7. So, for 4 cm, it should be 7 pennies/cm \u00d7 4 cm = 28 pennies. The units work out correctly.\n\nAlso, I can think about it in terms of proportion. If 1 cm corresponds to 7 pennies, then 4 cm would correspond to 4 times as many pennies, which again is 28 pennies.\n\nTherefore, the equation that can be used to find the number of pennies, n, in Nick's stack is n = 7 \u00d7 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
