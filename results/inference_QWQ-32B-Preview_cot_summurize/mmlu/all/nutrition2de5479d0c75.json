                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. So, we have four statements, and we need to find out which one isn't true. The statements are about docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, and its relation to vegan diets.\n\nFirst, let's understand what DHA is. DHA is a type of omega-3 fatty acid that's really important for our brain and eye health. It's commonly found in fish and other seafood, which are typical sources in non-vegan diets.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n**Option A: \"Docosahexaenoic acid can be synthesised from linolenic acid in vegans.\"**\n\nLinolenic acid, also known as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is another type of omega-3 fatty acid. It's found in some plant sources like flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts. The human body can convert ALA into longer-chain omega-3s, including EPA and DHA, but the conversion rate is generally low, around 5-10% for DHA.\n\nSo, while it's possible for vegans to synthesize DHA from ALA, the efficiency is not great. But the statement says \"can be synthesised,\" which is technically true, even if it's not very efficient.\n\n**Option B: \"Docosahexaenoic acid is absent from vegan diets.\"**\n\nThis one seems a bit tricky. Since DHA is not directly found in plant foods, it's accurate to say that traditional vegan diets don't include DHA. However, vegans can obtain DHA from fortified foods or supplements, especially those made from microalgae, which are a natural source of DHA.\n\nSo, while DHA might be absent from unfortified vegan diets, it's possible for vegans to include DHA in their diet through supplements or fortified products.\n\n**Option C: \"Lack of docosahexaenoic acid in vegans causes visual and cognitive impairment.\"**\n\nThis is a strong statement. While DHA is crucial for visual and cognitive development, especially in infants and young children, the impact of DHA deficiency in adults who follow a vegan diet isn't as clearly established.\n\nSome studies suggest that vegans who don't supplement with DHA may have lower blood levels of DHA, but it's not clear if this leads to visual or cognitive impairment. More research is needed in this area.\n\nHowever, given that DHA is important for brain and eye health, it's plausible that a\u957f\u671f\u7f3a\u4e4f might have some negative effects, but the direct causation isn't firmly established yet.\n\n**Option D: \"Microalgae can be used to synthesise docosahexaenoic acid.\"**\n\nThis is factually correct. Microalgae are natural sources of DHA and are used to produce DHA supplements for both vegans and non-vegans. So, this statement is true.\n\nNow, considering all these points, we need to find the statement that is NOT true.\n\nOption A is technically true, even if the synthesis is inefficient.\n\nOption B is partially true but doesn't account for fortified foods and supplements.\n\nOption C is a strong statement that isn't definitively proven, making it potentially not true.\n\nOption D is definitely true.\n\nGiven that, I think Option C is the one that's not necessarily true, because the causation between lack of DHA and visual and cognitive impairment in vegans isn't firmly established. More research is needed to confirm such claims.\n\nSo, my answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
