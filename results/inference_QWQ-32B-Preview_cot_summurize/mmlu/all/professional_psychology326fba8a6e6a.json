                    "text": "So I'm looking at this question about Berkowitz's revision of the frustration-aggression hypothesis. The original hypothesis, I think, was that frustration directly leads to aggression, like when someone blocks your goals, you get aggressive. But Berkowitz revised that in 1971, and the question is asking which option best describes his revision.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"acting aggressively is likely to produce desirable outcomes.\" So, according to this, frustration leads to aggression when being aggressive would give you some benefit or achieve something you want. That sounds plausible. Maybe if you think hitting someone will make them stop bothering you, you might act aggressively.\n\nOption B is: \"there are aggressive cues in the environment.\" This suggests that frustration leads to aggression when there are things around that\u63d0\u793a or encourage aggressive behavior. Like, if you see someone else fighting or if there are weapons around, that might make you more likely to act aggressively when you're frustrated.\n\nOption C mentions: \"the aggressor has an internal locus of control.\" I know that locus of control is about whether people believe they can control their own life events (internal locus) or if they believe that external forces control their life (external locus). So, if someone has an internal locus of control, they believe they can influence outcomes themselves. I'm not sure how that directly relates to frustration leading to aggression.\n\nOption D is: \"the target of the aggression is of lower status than the aggressor.\" This suggests that frustration leads to aggression specifically when the person you're aggressive towards has lower status than you. Maybe it's easier to take out your frustration on someone you perceive as beneath you.\n\nNow, thinking back to Berkowitz's revision, I remember that he incorporated ideas from social learning theory and cognitive theories. He suggested that aggression is more likely when it's cued by the environment or when it's seen as a appropriate response to frustration.\n\nLooking at these options, option B about aggressive cues in the environment seems to align with that. If there are cues in the environment that suggest aggression is appropriate or acceptable, then frustration is more likely to lead to aggression.\n\nOption A also seems relevant because if aggression seems likely to achieve desired outcomes, that might make it more likely for someone to choose aggression when frustrated.\n\nBut between A and B, I think B is more directly related to Berkowitz's revision because he emphasized the role of environmental cues in triggering aggressive behavior. He argued that frustration increases arousal and makes people more likely to notice and respond to aggressive cues in the environment.\n\nOption C about internal locus of control doesn't seem directly related to the frustration-aggression link. While someone with an internal locus of control might believe they can control their own behavior, including aggressive responses, it's not specifically about the frustration leading to aggression.\n\nOption D about the target's status seems more related to who might be chosen as a target for aggression, but not necessarily about the conditions under which frustration leads to aggression.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B: frustration leads to aggression when there are aggressive cues in the environment.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should double-check what Berkowitz actually proposed. From what I recall, he suggested that frustration increases arousal and broadens the range of behaviors that can be triggered by environmental cues. So, if aggressive cues are present, that increases the likelihood of aggressive behavior.\n\nYes, that supports option B.\n\nMaybe option A is also partly correct because if aggression is seen as likely to produce desirable outcomes, that could also make it more likely to occur in response to frustration. But I think that's more related to cost-benefit analyses of behavior rather than directly to Berkowitz's revision.\n\nSo, I'll go with B as the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
