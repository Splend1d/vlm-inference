                    "text": "So I have this problem: find the product of 5.7 times 8 mentally, using the Distributive Property. The options are A) 46.4, B) 456, C) 4.56, and D) 45.6. I need to figure this out in my head, so let's see how to make this easier.\n\nFirst off, I know that the Distributive Property helps me break down multiplication into smaller parts that are easier to handle. It's like splitting a big problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. For example, if I have a number like 5.7, I can think of it as 5 plus 0.7, and then multiply each part by 8 separately before adding them back together.\n\nSo, 5.7 times 8 can be thought of as (5 + 0.7) times 8, which equals 5 times 8 plus 0.7 times 8. That makes sense.\n\nLet me calculate 5 times 8 first. 5 times 8 is 40. Got that.\n\nNext, 0.7 times 8. Well, 0.7 is the same as 7 tenths, so 7 tenths times 8 would be 56 tenths. Wait, but 7 times 8 is 56, and since 0.7 is 7 tenths, 56 tenths is the same as 5.6. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to add those two results together: 40 plus 5.6. That should be 45.6.\n\nLet me double-check that. 40 plus 5 is 45, and then plus 0.6 makes 45.6. Yep, that seems right.\n\nLooking back at the options, D) 45.6 matches what I got. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider 5.7 as 6 minus 0.3. So, 6 minus 0.3 times 8 would be 6 times 8 minus 0.3 times 8. 6 times 8 is 48, and 0.3 times 8 is 2.4. So, 48 minus 2.4 should also give me 45.6.\n\nLet me do that subtraction. 48 minus 2 is 46, and then minus 0.4 would be 45.6 again. Okay, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 5.7 as 50 tenths plus 7 tenths, which is 57 tenths, and then multiply by 8. 57 tenths times 8 is 456 tenths. Now, 456 tenths is the same as 45.6. Again, the same answer.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach it using the Distributive Property, I keep getting 45.6. Therefore, the correct answer should be D) 45.6.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's quickly consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A) 46.4 is a bit higher than what I calculated. Maybe if I had done 5.8 times 8, but 5.7 times 8 should be less than that.\n\nOption B) 456 is way too big. That's like forgetting about the decimal point in 5.7 and treating it as 57 times 8, which is 456, but that doesn\u2019t account for the decimal.\n\nOption C) 4.56 is too small. That would be like doing 0.57 times 8, which is not the case here.\n\nSo, again, D) 45.6 is the correct choice.\n\nUsing the Distributive Property really helps break down the problem and makes mental calculation much easier. It\u2019s a handy tool to have in your math toolbox.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
