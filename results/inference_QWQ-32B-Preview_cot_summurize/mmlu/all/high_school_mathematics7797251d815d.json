                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Wayne thinks that \"Y\" is a vowel, but Kristen doesn't. Kristen thinks there are only 5 vowels. We need to find out by what percent the probability of selecting a vowel is greater in Wayne's opinion compared to Kristen's.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of them considers as vowels.\n\nFor Kristen, it's clear: she thinks there are 5 vowels. I assume she's considering A, E, I, O, and U.\n\nWayne, on the other hand, includes \"Y\" as a vowel. So, according to him, there are 6 vowels: A, E, I, O, U, and Y.\n\nThe total number of letters in the alphabet is 26.\n\nSo, the probability that a randomly selected letter is a vowel, according to Kristen, is 5 out of 26. That is:\n\nP_kristen = 5/26\n\nSimilarly, according to Wayne, it's 6 out of 26:\n\nP_wayne = 6/26\n\nNow, we need to find out by what percent P_wayne is greater than P_kristen.\n\nTo find the percentage increase, I can use the formula:\n\nPercentage increase = [(P_wayne - P_kristen) / P_kristen] * 100%\n\nLet me plug in the values:\n\nFirst, P_wayne - P_kristen = 6/26 - 5/26 = 1/26\n\nThen, divide that by P_kristen, which is 5/26:\n\n(1/26) / (5/26) = (1/26) * (26/5) = 1/5\n\nFinally, multiply by 100% to get the percentage:\n\n(1/5) * 100% = 20%\n\nSo, the probability is 20% greater in Wayne's opinion than in Kristen's.\n\nLooking back at the options, 20% is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst,\u786e\u8ba4 Kristen considers 5 vowels: A, E, I, O, U.\n\nWayne considers 6 vowels: A, E, I, O, U, Y.\n\nTotal letters: 26.\n\nProbabilities:\n\nP_kristen = 5/26\n\nP_wayne = 6/26\n\nPercentage increase:\n\n[(6/26 - 5/26)/ (5/26)] * 100% = (1/26)/(5/26) * 100% = 1/5 * 100% = 20%\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in decimals to verify.\n\n5/26 is approximately 0.1923\n\n6/26 is approximately 0.2308\n\nDifference: 0.2308 - 0.1923 = 0.0385\n\nThen, 0.0385 / 0.1923 \u2248 0.2, which is 20%.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think 20% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{20\\%} \\]"
