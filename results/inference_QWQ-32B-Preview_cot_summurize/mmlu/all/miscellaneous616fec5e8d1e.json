So, maybe gamma is the third letter. But I'm not entirely sure, maybe I should double-check.\n\nI remember that delta is like a triangle, and it might be later in the alphabet. Phi is also a letter, but I'm not sure where it falls in the sequence. Theta is another one, but again, I don't recall its position.\n\nWait, I think the order is alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and so on. So, if alpha is A, beta is B, gamma is C, and delta is D, then gamma should be the third letter.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I can list out the first few letters of the Greek alphabet:\n\n1. Alpha (\u03b1)\n\n2. Beta (\u03b2)\n\n3. Gamma (\u03b3)\n\n4. Delta (\u03b4)\n\n5. Epsilon (\u03b5)\n\n6. Zeta (\u03b6)\n\n7. Eta (\u03b7)\n\n8. Theta (\u03b8)\n\n9. Iota (\u03b9)\n\n10. Kappa (\u03ba)\n\nYeah, that seems right. So, gamma is indeed the third letter.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. delta\n\nB. gamma\n\nC. phi\n\nD. theta\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. gamma.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nDelta is the fourth letter, so it's not the third.\n\nPhi is much later; it's the 21st letter, I think.\n\nTheta is the eighth letter.\n\nSo, none of them are correct except for gamma.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
