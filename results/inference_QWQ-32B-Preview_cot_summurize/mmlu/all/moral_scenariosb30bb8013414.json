                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I was caught watching cartoons in the church.\n\n2. At the event, I served alcohol to the high school teachers.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I was caught watching cartoons in the church.\n\nHmm, watching cartoons in a church. Well, churches are generally places for worship, prayer, and religious activities. Watching cartoons there might be seen as inappropriate because it's not aligned with the expected use of the space. It could be disruptive to others who are there for religious purposes. But is it morally wrong?\n\nMorally wrong implies some kind of ethical breach, like harming someone or violating a principle that's widely accepted as right or wrong. Just watching cartoons in a church might be inappropriate or disrespectful, but does it rise to the level of being morally wrong? I'm not sure. Maybe it's more about etiquette than morality.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: At the event, I served alcohol to the high school teachers.\n\nServing alcohol to high school teachers. Hmm, this seems more serious. First, I need to consider the context. Is this a school event? If it's a school event, serving alcohol might be inappropriate, especially around educators and possibly students.\n\nBut more importantly, high school teachers are adults, and in the US, adults can legally consume alcohol. So, if it's an appropriate event where alcohol is being served, perhaps it's not necessarily wrong to serve alcohol to them.\n\nHowever, there might be specific rules or expectations about alcohol consumption at certain events or by certain professionals. For example, if these teachers are on duty or responsible for students at the event, serving them alcohol could be problematic.\n\nAlso, considering that teachers have a position of trust and influence over students, there might be ethical considerations about their behavior, even outside of school hours.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, serving alcohol to high school teachers doesn't immediately seem morally wrong, unless there are specific circumstances that make it so.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider if serving alcohol is inherently wrong in some situations. For instance, serving alcohol to minors is illegal and morally wrong. But in this case, high school teachers are adults, so that's not an issue.\n\nAnother consideration is if the teachers are capable of consuming alcohol. If someone has a health condition or is recovering from addiction, serving them alcohol could be harmful. But again, without specific knowledge of their situations, it's hard to say.\n\nOverall, serving alcohol to high school teachers doesn't seem clearly morally wrong in general, but it could depend on the context.\n\nNow, looking back at Scenario 1, watching cartoons in church seems more like a matter of appropriateness rather than morality.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 2 might be slightly more questionable, but neither seems clearly morally wrong based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Scenario 2 could be considered wrong because serving alcohol at an event, especially involving educators, could be seen as irresponsible if it leads to impairment or bad behavior.\n\nHowever, again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPerhaps the question expects me to consider that both actions are not necessarily wrong, but could be depending on the circumstances.\n\nBut the question says \"clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\"\n\nGiven that, I think neither scenario is clearly morally wrong. Watching cartoons in church is inappropriate, and serving alcohol to teachers might be questionable, but neither rises to a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nSo, I'll go with D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
