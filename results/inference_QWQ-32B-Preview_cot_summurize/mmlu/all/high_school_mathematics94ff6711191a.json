                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that the base of a solid is the region bounded by the curve x\u00b2 = 4y and the line y = 2, and that each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square. I need to find the volume of this solid, and there are options: A. 8, B. 16, C. 20, D. 32.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize what's going on. There's a curve x\u00b2 = 4y, which is a parabola opening upwards, and a horizontal line at y = 2. The region bounded by these two is the base of the solid. Then, for each y-value, there's a square cross-section perpendicular to the y-axis.\n\nSo, to find the volume, I probably need to integrate the areas of these square cross-sections along the y-axis from the lowest y-value to y = 2.\n\nFirst, let's find the bounds of integration. The parabola x\u00b2 = 4y intersects the line y = 2 when x\u00b2 = 8, so x = \u00b1\u221a8 = \u00b12\u221a2. But since the cross-sections are perpendicular to the y-axis, I need to integrate with respect to y, from y = 0 (since the vertex of the parabola is at (0,0)) to y = 2.\n\nWait, but does the parabola start at y = 0? Let's check: if x = 0, then y = 0 from the equation x\u00b2 = 4y. So yes, the base runs from y = 0 to y = 2.\n\nNow, for each y, the cross-section is a square. To find the side length of the square, I need to know the width of the region at that y.\n\nFrom the equation x\u00b2 = 4y, solving for x gives x = \u00b1\u221a(4y) = \u00b12\u221ay. So at each y, the distance from one side of the parabola to the other is 2\u221ay - (-2\u221ay) = 4\u221ay.\n\nWait, but that's the total width at height y. Since the cross-section is a square, does that mean the side of the square is equal to the width at that y, which is 4\u221ay?\n\nLet me make sure: the problem says that each plane section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square. So, the area of each cross-section is (side length)^2. If the side length is equal to the width of the base at that y, then yes, side length is 4\u221ay, and the area would be (4\u221ay)^2 = 16y.\n\nThen, the volume would be the integral from y = 0 to y = 2 of the area dy, which is \u222b from 0 to 2 of 16y dy.\n\nLet's compute that: \u222b16y dy from 0 to 2 is 16*(y^2)/2 evaluated from 0 to 2, which is 16*(4/2 - 0) = 16*2 = 32.\n\nSo, the volume is 32, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is the side length of the square really 4\u221ay? Let's think about it again.\n\nThe parabola is x\u00b2 = 4y, so for a given y, x ranges from -2\u221ay to 2\u221ay. The width at that y is 4\u221ay, as I said. If the cross-section perpendicular to the y-axis is a square, then the side of the square should indeed be equal to the width at that y, which is 4\u221ay.\n\nTherefore, the area of the cross-section is (4\u221ay)^2 = 16y, and integrating that from y = 0 to y = 2 gives \u222b16y dy from 0 to 2 = 16*(y^2)/2 from 0 to 2 = 16*(4/2) = 16*2 = 32.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me consider if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the volume as generated by squares stacked along the y-axis, each with side length 4\u221ay, and integrate their areas.\n\nWait, that's essentially what I just did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for volume with known cross-sections: V = \u222bA(y) dy from a to b, where A(y) is the area of the cross-section at height y.\n\nIn this case, A(y) = (4\u221ay)^2 = 16y, and integrating from y = 0 to y = 2 gives V = \u222b16y dy from 0 to 2 = 32.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there's any mistake in assuming that the side length is 4\u221ay.\n\nIs the width at height y indeed 4\u221ay?\n\nFrom x\u00b2 = 4y, x = \u00b12\u221ay, so the total width is 4\u221ay. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the area is (4\u221ay)^2 = 16y.\n\nIntegrating that from y = 0 to y = 2 gives V = 32.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 32.\n\nBut let me check again why the side length is 4\u221ay and not something else.\n\nThe cross-section is a square perpendicular to the y-axis. The base at each y is the segment from x = -2\u221ay to x = 2\u221ay.\n\nSo, the length of that segment is 4\u221ay.\n\nTherefore, the side of the square is 4\u221ay, and the area is (4\u221ay)^2 = 16y.\n\nIntegrating along y from 0 to 2: \u222b16y dy = 16*(y^2)/2 from 0 to 2 = 16*(4/2 - 0) = 16*2 = 32.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting something different.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the cross-sections are squares, but maybe the side length is different.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nSuppose I consider a small change in y, dy.\n\nThe side length of the square at height y is 4\u221ay, as before.\n\nThen, the volume of that thin slice is (16y) dy.\n\nIntegrating from y = 0 to y = 2 gives V = \u222b16y dy from 0 to 2 = 32.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up the integral in terms of x.\n\nBut since the cross-sections are perpendicular to the y-axis, it's more natural to integrate with respect to y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a solid of revolution, but in this case, it's not a solid of revolution; it's a solid with known cross-sections.\n\nTherefore, my original approach seems correct.\n\nThus, the volume is 32, which is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
