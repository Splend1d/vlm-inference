In 1994, the farmer delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the farmer, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, an investor, aware of the existence of the farmer-to-son deed, sought out the farmer and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed of the farm from the farmer to the investor and his heirs. The farmer executed such a deed, and the investor promptly recorded it. The investor's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the farm by adverse possession. In 1998, the investor constructed a fence around the farm. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the farm to a rancher and, for $15,000, paid by the rancher, signed and delivered a deed of the farm in favor of the rancher and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the rancher made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a teacher paid the investor $20,000, and the investor delivered to the teacher a deed of the farm in favor of the teacher and his heirs. The teacher had examined the property, had searched the title, and was aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument. Although the teacher did not reside on the property,he regularly visited the farm twice a week. The teacher recorded his deed. In 2007, for $25,000, paid by a professor, the rancher signed and delivered a deed of the farm naming the professor and his heirs as grantees. Before the professor had paid the rancher and taken his deed, the professor visited the farm and observed the fence. However, the teacher was not present when the professor visited the property, and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094f anyone \u0080\u0094was using it. In any case, the professor did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. The professor then recorded the deed. Note: This jurisdiction uses Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Indices and has no Tract IndexThe jurisdiction's recording act provides: \"Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded. \"In 2008, in an action to quiet title to the farm, which of the following parties would have priority of title?\n\nA. The professor.\nB. The investor.\nC. The teacher.\nD. The rancher.\n"

                    "text": "This is a complex scenario involving multiple conveyances of the same property over time, and it's essential to apply the jurisdiction's recording act to determine who has priority of title. The recording act states: \"Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.\"\n\nLet's break down the transactions step by step:\n\n1. **1993:** Farmer has good record title to the farm in fee simple absolute.\n\n2. **1994:** Farmer delivers a deed to his son for $1,000, naming the son and his heirs as grantees. The son neglects to record the deed.\n\n   - At this point, the son has equitable title, but since he didn't record the deed, his interest isn't protected against subsequent bona fide purchasers who record first.\n\n3. **1998:** Investor approaches the farmer and buys a deed for $10,000, naming the investor and his heirs as grantees. The investor records this deed promptly.\n\n   - The investor records the deed, establishing priority over the son's unrecorded deed.\n\n4. **1998:** Investor constructs a fence around the farm, intending to acquire title by adverse possession.\n\n   - Adverse possession requires continuous, open, and notorious use of the property against the true owner's rights, typically for a statutory period. However, in this case, the investor is already claiming title through the deed, so adverse possession may not be directly relevant here.\n\n5. **1999:** Son sells the farm to the rancher for $15,000, delivering a deed naming the rancher and his heirs as grantees. The rancher makes no effort to search the title, examine the property, or record the deed.\n\n   - The son is conveying an interest he may not actually have, given the investor's prior recorded deed. The rancher, not recording the deed, is at risk.\n\n6. **2003:** Teacher buys the farm from the investor for $20,000, receiving a deed naming the teacher and his heirs as grantees. The teacher examines the property and searches the title, aware of the prior farmer-to-son instrument, and records the deed.\n\n   - The teacher records the deed, which should give priority over any unrecorded conveyances.\n\n7. **2007:** Rancher sells the farm to the professor for $25,000, delivering a deed naming the professor and his heirs as grantees. The professor visits the farm, observes the fence, but doesn't search the title before purchasing. The professor then records the deed.\n\n   - The professor records the deed, but his claim may be subordinate to earlier recorded deeds.\n\nNow, to determine who has priority of title in 2008 when an action to quiet title is brought, we need to consider the recording act and the sequence of recorded deeds.\n\n- **Farmer to son (1994):** Unrecorded.\n\n- **Farmer to investor (1998):** Recorded by investor.\n\n- **Son to rancher (1999):** Unrecorded.\n\n- **Investor to teacher (2003):** Recorded by teacher.\n\n- **Rancher to professor (2007):** Recorded by professor.\n\nUnder the recording act, \"Every conveyance of real estate which is not recorded is void against a subsequent purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.\"\n\n- The investor recorded first in 1998, establishing priority over the son's unrecorded deed.\n\n- The teacher recorded in 2003, after the investor, but the teacher's deed is from the investor, who had recorded title in 1998.\n\n- The professor recorded in 2007, after both the investor and the teacher.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue with the rancher's deed to the professor. The rancher received his deed in 1999 from the son, who had no valid title due to the investor's prior recorded deed. Therefore, the rancher received a void conveyance, and any subsequent conveyance by the rancher would also be void.\n\nGiven this, the professor's claim is based on a defective title from the rancher and doesn't have priority over the teacher's recorded deed from the investor.\n\nThus, the teacher has the priority of title, having recorded a deed from the investor, who had previously recorded their deed from the farmer.\n\n**Answer: C. The teacher.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The investor recorded first in 1998, establishing priority over the son's unrecorded deed.\n\n- The teacher recorded in 2003, receiving the deed from the investor, thereby acquiring priority over any subsequent unrecorded deeds.\n\n- The professor recorded in 2007, but his title is defective because it\u6e90\u81ea the rancher, who received a deed from the son\u2014whose interest was void due to the investor's prior recorded deed.\n\nTherefore, the teacher has the superior claim to the property."
