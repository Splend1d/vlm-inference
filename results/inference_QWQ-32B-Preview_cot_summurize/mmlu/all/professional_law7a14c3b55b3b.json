Ex post facto law, C. Statutes, and D. Ordinances. I think I need to understand what each of these terms means to determine which one fits the description.\n\nFirst, let's look at a bill of attainder. I recall that a bill of attainder is a legislative act that inflicts punishment on a specific individual or group without a trial. It's like the legislature deciding someone is guilty and punishing them directly, bypassing the judicial process. That sounds pretty much like what the question is asking for.\n\nNext, ex post facto law. I know that ex post facto laws are laws that retroactively change the legal consequences of actions that were committed before the enactment of the law. So, they can make an act criminal in retrospect, or increase the punishment for a crime after it was committed. While these laws can be controversial because they affect people's rights retroactively, they still require a trial to convict someone. So, even with an ex post facto law, a person would still have to go through the judicial process to be punished.\n\nStatutes are just general laws enacted by a legislature. They apply to the public at large and are not targeted at specific individuals or groups without a trial. So, statutes in general don't fit the description of inflicting punishment without a trial.\n\nOrdinances are similar to statutes but are usually enacted by local governments, like cities or counties. Again, they are general laws that apply to the community and don't specifically punish individuals without a trial.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems like a bill of attainder is the legislative act that directly inflicts punishment without a trial. I think the answer is A. Bill of attainder.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should confirm if there are any other options that might fit this description. For example, maybe ex post facto laws could be considered as inflicting punishment without a trial because they retroactively change the law, but as I thought earlier, they still require a trial to apply the punishment.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are any other types of legislative acts that might fit this description, but based on my knowledge, bills of attainder are specifically designed to punish without a trial.\n\nI remember that in the United States, the Constitution actually prohibits bills of attainder. The Constitution states that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed. So, bills of attainder are not allowed, which reinforces the idea that they are a type of legislative act that directly punishes without a trial.\n\nIn conclusion, among the options provided, a bill of attainder is the legislative act that inflicts punishment without a trial. So, the correct answer is A. Bill of attainder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
