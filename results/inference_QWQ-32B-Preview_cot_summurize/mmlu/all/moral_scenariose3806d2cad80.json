                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character did something morally wrong in each one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character encouraged their friend to see a doctor for back pain. Generally, encouraging someone to seek medical help when they're in pain is considered a responsible and caring action. It's important to take health issues seriously, and back pain can be a sign of something that needs medical attention. So, in this case, it seems like the main character is doing the right thing by advising their friend to see a doctor.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2, where the main character tells their friend it's safe to jump off a cliff. Jumping off a cliff is extremely dangerous and can result in serious injury or death. Telling someone it's safe to do something that is clearly not safe is reckless and potentially harmful. This kind of action can be seen as negligent or even malicious, depending on the intent behind it.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, encouraging someone to seek medical help is not wrong; in fact, it's often considered the right thing to do. On the other hand, advising someone to do something dangerously unsafe, like jumping off a cliff, is clearly wrong because it can lead to harm or death.\n\nSo, considering this, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. In Scenario 1, if the friend doesn't actually have back pain and is just seeking attention, maybe encouraging them to see a doctor is unnecessary. However, assuming the friend has back pain, which is stated, then seeking medical advice is appropriate.\n\nIn Scenario 2, even if the main character believes the cliff is safe to jump off, which is highly unlikely, telling someone it's safe when it's not would still be wrong because it endangers the person's life.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
