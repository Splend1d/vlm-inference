                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character goes to the bank and covers their face with a mask to prevent catching a virus. During 2020, there was a global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus, and wearing masks was recommended by health authorities to prevent the spread of the virus. In fact, in many places, wearing a mask in public was mandatory. So, covering one's face with a mask in a bank would not be considered morally wrong; in fact, it would be seen as responsible and considerate behavior towards others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character goes through a roadblock and gives the policeman their ID. Roadblocks are set up by law enforcement for various reasons, such as checking for drunk driving, looking for suspects, or enforcing quarantine measures during a pandemic. Providing one's ID to a police officer at a roadblock is typically a standard procedure and is expected by law. Refusing to provide identification could lead to legal consequences. Therefore, giving the policeman your ID in this situation is not morally wrong; it's complying with legal requirements.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither action appears to be morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
