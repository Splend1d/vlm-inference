The land began to subside along the line of excavation and about three feet of homeowner's land fell off into the driveway, making that part of her property useless.

Homeowner sued and asked for an injunction compelling the neighbor to build and maintain a retaining wall. Will the court rule for the plaintiff/homeowner?\n\nA. Yes, because excavation is an abnormally dangerous activity and neighbor is absolutely liable for any damages caused by the violation.\nB. Yes, because every landowner has a right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state.\nC. No, because the neighbor did not go onto the adjacent land and confined all excavation to his own land.\nD.

Let's break down the scenario and analyze each option to determine the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Scenario Summary:**\n\n- Homeowner owns a property with a natural condition and a house.\n\n- Neighbor owns an adjacent property to the east.\n\n- Neighbor built a driveway on their property, excavating five feet deep.\n\n- As a result, homeowner's land subsided, and part of it fell into the driveway, rendering that part useless.\n\n- Homeowner demands that neighbor fill in the property to prevent further erosion but no action was taken.\n\n- Homeowner sues for an injunction to compel neighbor to build and maintain a retaining wall.\n\n**Options:**\n\nA. Yes, because excavation is an abnormally dangerous activity and neighbor is absolutely liable for any damages caused by the violation.\n\nB. Yes, because every landowner has a right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state.\n\nC. No, because the neighbor did not go onto the adjacent land and confined all excavation to his own land.\n\nD. No, the right to lateral support is a common law right that has been abrogated by statute in virtually all states so that the right no longer exists.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n**Option A: Abnormally Dangerous Activity**\n\nExcavation can be considered an activity that has the potential to cause harm to adjacent properties, but it is not universally classified as an abnormally dangerous activity under all legal systems. Liability for such activities generally depends on whether the excavation was conducted with reasonable care and in compliance with local regulations. Therefore, this option may not be the most accurate basis for the court's ruling.\n\n**Option B: Right to Lateral Support**\n\nIn common law, landowners have a right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state. This means that adjacent landowners cannot excavate their land in a manner that causes the soil of the neighboring property to subside or collapse. If neighbor's excavation led to the subsidence of homeowner's land, this could be a violation of the right to lateral support, potentially justifying an injunction to prevent further harm.\n\n**Option C: Confined Excavation to Own Land**\n\nWhile neighbor may have confined the excavation to their own property, the law recognizes that actions on one's own land can have effects on adjacent properties. If those actions cause harm to the neighboring property, the actor may still be liable, especially if the harm was foreseeable. Therefore, simply staying on one's own property does not necessarily exempt one from liability for damages caused to neighbors.\n\n**Option D: Abrogation by Statute**\n\nThis option suggests that the right to lateral support has been abolished by statute in most states. However, this is not universally true, and the status of this right varies by jurisdiction. In many places, the right to lateral support still exists, but it may be subject to certain limitations or modifications based on statutory law.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the information provided, the most compelling argument seems to be based on the right to lateral support (Option B). If neighbor's excavation activities have caused subsidence and damage to homeowner's property, the court is likely to rule in favor of the homeowner, ordering the neighbor to take corrective measures such as building and maintaining a retaining wall to prevent further erosion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Yes, because every landowner has a right to the lateral support of the soil in its natural state.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
