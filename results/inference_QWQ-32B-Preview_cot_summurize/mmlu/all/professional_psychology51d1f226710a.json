This is because all members must contribute successfully for the task to be completed. If one member falls short, it can hold back the entire group.\n\nTo understand this better, let's briefly look at the other options:\n\n- **Additive task**: In this type of task, the group's performance is the sum of each member's contribution. So, the more each member contributes, the better the overall performance.\n\n- **Compensatory task**: Here, members can compensate for each other's weaknesses. For example, if one member is weak in a certain area, another member who is strong in that area can help offset the deficiency.\n\n- **Disjunctive task**: In a disjunctive task, the group's performance is determined by the best performer in the group. So, the highest skill level among members sets the standard for the group.\n\nTherefore, in a conjunctive task, the group's performance is indeed limited by the least skilled or knowledgeable member."
