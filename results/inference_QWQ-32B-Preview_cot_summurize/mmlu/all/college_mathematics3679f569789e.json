There is a rearrangement a_i_k of the terms such that \u2211 a_i_k = 4.\n\nOkay, so this is about series and rearrangements. I know that if a series is absolutely convergent, meaning \u2211|a_i| converges, then any rearrangement of the series will converge to the same sum. However, in this case, \u2211|a_i| diverges, which means the series is conditionally convergent because \u2211 a_i converges to 2.\n\nFor conditionally convergent series, the Riemann rearrangement theorem tells us that we can rearrange the terms to converge to any real number, or even to diverge. So, in this case, since the series is conditionally convergent (it converges but not absolutely), we should be able to find a rearrangement that sums to any real number, including 4.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** There exists metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT \u201cclosed and bounded\u201d.\n\nThis statement is about metric spaces, closed and bounded sets, and continuous functions.\n\nFirst, recall that in metric spaces, being closed means containing all its limit points, and being bounded means that there exists some ball of finite radius that contains the set.\n\nNow, in Euclidean spaces, like R^n, the Heine-Borel theorem tells us that a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. And we know that continuous functions map compact sets to compact sets.\n\nHowever, in general metric spaces, closed and bounded does not imply compact. So, it's possible to have a closed and bounded set in a metric space that is not compact.\n\nIf X is closed and bounded but not compact, and f is continuous, then f(X) may not be closed and bounded.\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nConsider X = N, the natural numbers, with the discrete metric, where d(m, n) = 1 if m \u2260 n, and 0 otherwise. In this metric, X is closed (since it's the whole space) and bounded (since the distance between any two points is at most 1).\n\nNow, let Y = R with the standard metric, and define f : N \u2192 R by f(n) = n. This function is continuous because in the discrete metric, every function is continuous.\n\nBut f(N) = N, which is closed in R but not bounded. So, f(X) is closed but not bounded.\n\nAlternatively, if we define f(n) = 1/n for n \u2265 1, then f(N) = {1, 1/2, 1/3, ...}, which is bounded but not closed, since 0 is a limit point not in f(N).\n\nSo, in this case, f(X) is bounded but not closed.\n\nTherefore, there exists such metric spaces X and Y, and a continuous function f, where X is closed and bounded, but f(X) is not closed and bounded.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
