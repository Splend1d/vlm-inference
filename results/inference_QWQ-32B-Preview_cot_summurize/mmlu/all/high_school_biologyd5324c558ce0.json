DNA and proteins\n\nB. nucleic acid and a capsid\n\nC. DNA and cell membrane\n\nD. RNA and cell wall\n\nFirst, I need to recall what viruses are made of. I remember that viruses are much simpler than cells; they aren't even considered living because they can't reproduce on their own. They need a host cell to replicate.\n\nSo, what are the main parts of a virus? I think the core components are their genetic material and some sort of protein coat that protects it.\n\nLet me look at option A: DNA and proteins. Well, viruses can have either DNA or RNA as their genetic material, not necessarily both. So this might not be precise.\n\nOption B says nucleic acid and a capsid. Nucleic acid refers to either DNA or RNA, which makes sense because viruses have one or the other, but not both. A capsid is the protein shell that encases the nucleic acid. That sounds accurate.\n\nOption C mentions DNA and cell membrane. Wait, viruses don't have cell membranes. They don't have any cellular components because they aren't cells. So this can't be right.\n\nOption D says RNA and cell wall. Again, viruses don't have cell walls. Cell walls are found in plant cells and bacteria, not in viruses.\n\nSo, between options A and B, B seems more accurate because it uses the term nucleic acid, which encompasses both DNA and RNA, and specifies a capsid, which is the correct term for the protein coat.\n\nI think the best answer is B: nucleic acid and a capsid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
