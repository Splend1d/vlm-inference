                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out where the dissolved salts in the ocean mainly come from. There are four options: marine biological activity, atmospheric deposition, weathering of continental rocks, and eruptions of undersea hot-spot volcanoes. I need to think about which one is the primary source.\n\nFirst, let's consider marine biological activity. Organisms in the ocean do release minerals and salts through processes like photosynthesis and respiration, but I'm not sure if that's the main source of dissolved salts. It seems more likely that salts come from other sources.\n\nNext, atmospheric deposition. This would involve salts and minerals being deposited into the ocean from the air, maybe from dust particles or pollutants. While this does contribute some salts, I don't know if it's the principal source.\n\nThen there's the weathering of continental rocks. I recall that rainwater reacts with rocks on land, causing them to break down and release minerals, which are then carried to the ocean by rivers. This sounds like it could be a significant source of salts.\n\nLastly, undersea hot-spot volcanoes. These are areas where magma rises from deep within the Earth and creates new oceanic crust. Volcanic activity can release minerals and salts into the ocean water. This might also be a notable source.\n\nTo decide which one is the principal source, I need to think about the quantities involved. The weathering of continental rocks seems like it would contribute a large amount of salts to the ocean over time, as it's a continuous process affecting vast areas. Additionally, rivers carry a significant amount of dissolved minerals into the ocean.\n\nOn the other hand, undersea volcanoes are also persistent sources of minerals, but perhaps their contribution is more localized. Atmospheric deposition and marine biological activity might be important but perhaps not as much as the other two.\n\nI think the weathering of continental rocks is the main source of dissolved salts in the ocean. What do you think?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
