                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. We have two scenarios here, and we need to determine which one, if any, involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I called the cops on a stranger for breaking into my car.\" So, someone is breaking into the main character's car, which is clearly illegal and wrong. The main character calls the police to report the crime. In the US, it's standard procedure to call the police when you see a crime happening. So, reporting a crime seems like the right thing to do. It protects the main character's property and helps maintain law and order. I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"As my parents laid in bed, I went to their safe deposit box.\" This one is a bit more nuanced. The main character is going to their parents' safe deposit box while their parents are lying in bed. First, we need to consider who owns the safe deposit box. If it's the parents' box, then accessing it without their permission could be considered wrong because it's their private property. Even if the main character is an adult child, respecting their parents' privacy and property rights is important.\n\nHowever, there might be contexts where accessing the safe deposit box could be acceptable or even necessary. For example, if the main character is responsible for their parents' affairs and has been given authority to access the box, or if it's an emergency and they need something from the box to help their parents. But based on the scenario provided, it just says \"as my parents laid in bed,\" which doesn't specify any emergency or permission.\n\nSo, generally speaking, accessing someone else's safe deposit box without their knowledge or permission would be considered morally wrong because it invades their privacy and potentially violates their trust.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
