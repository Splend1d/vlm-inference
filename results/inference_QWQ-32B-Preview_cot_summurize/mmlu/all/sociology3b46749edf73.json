                    "text": "Let's see... I'm looking at this question about the \"extension pattern\" that Parker identified in 1976. So, I need to figure out which option correctly describes this pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the extension pattern is. From what I remember, it has something to do with how people approach their leisure time in relation to their work. It seems like it's about whether their leisure activities are extensions of their work or if they use leisure time to escape from work.\n\nOption A says it's about clerical and unskilled manual workers who see leisure time as a chance to escape from alienating work. That sounds familiar. Maybe this is the one where people want to get away from their work stresses and do something completely different in their free time.\n\nOption B talks about professionals and skilled workers whose work interests spill over into leisure time. This sounds like the opposite of option A, where people enjoy their work so much that they continue it even when they're not being paid to do so.\n\nOption C mentions a neutral balance between work and leisure, neither connecting nor opposing, seen in semi-skilled manual and clerical workers. This seems like a middle ground, where people don't really bring work into their leisure but also don't go out of their way to escape it.\n\nOption D is about students leaving essays until the last minute and asking for extensions. This seems completely off-topic. It might be a joke or something, but it's probably not the correct answer.\n\nNow, considering Parker's work in 1976, I think he was studying different social classes and their attitudes towards work and leisure. I recall that he identified different patterns, including the extension pattern, the separation pattern, and maybe another one.\n\nThe extension pattern, I think, is when people's leisure activities are extensions of their work activities. So, if someone works in a creative field, they might spend their leisure time painting or writing, even though they don't have to.\n\nWait, but option B says that this is characteristic of professionals and skilled workers. That makes sense because these people might enjoy their work and want to continue it in their free time.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, talks about clerical and unskilled manual workers wanting to escape from work in their leisure time. That seems like a separation pattern, where work and leisure are kept distinct.\n\nOption C mentions a neutral balance, which might be another pattern that Parker identified, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption D is definitely not related to Parker's work; it seems more like a comment on student behavior.\n\nLet me try to recall the specifics of Parker's study. He looked at different social classes and how they perceive and use their leisure time. The extension pattern is associated with higher social classes, where work and leisure blend together, while the separation pattern is more common among lower social classes, who want to distinguish their leisure time from their work time.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option B seems to be the correct description of the extension pattern: characteristic of professionals and skilled workers whose work interests spill over into leisure time.\n\nOption A sounds more like the separation pattern, where people want to escape from work in their leisure time.\n\nOption C might be referring to another pattern, but since the question is about the extension pattern, option B seems to be the right answer.\n\nI should probably double-check this, but based on my memory and understanding of Parker's work, I'm going to go with option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
