                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about exon skipping and see which type of mutation it's associated with. Let's see what each option means and how exon skipping fits into that.\n\nFirst off, what is exon skipping? Exons are the parts of a gene that code for proteins, and they're spliced together to form mature mRNA. Sometimes, during mRNA processing, certain exons are skipped, meaning they're not included in the final mRNA molecule. This can lead to different protein variants being produced, which is a normal process called alternative splicing. But when exon skipping happens due to a mutation, it can cause problems.\n\nOption A is nonsense mutations. These are mutations that introduce a premature stop codon in the mRNA, which can truncate the protein. Exon skipping might be related to this if skipping an exon leads to a frame shift or introduces a stop codon, but I'm not sure if that's the primary association.\n\nOption B is regulatory mutations. These affect how genes are expressed, maybe changing when or how much a gene is turned on, but not directly related to the splicing process. So, probably not the best fit here.\n\nOption C is RNA processing mutations. This seems promising because exon skipping is a part of RNA processing. Mutations that affect splicing factors or splice sites could cause exon skipping where it shouldn't happen or prevent skipping when it should. So, this sounds like a strong candidate.\n\nOption D is silent mutations. These are mutations that don't change the amino acid sequence because of the redundancy in the genetic code. They usually don't affect protein function, so it's less likely that they're directly associated with exon skipping.\n\nComparing all these, it seems like RNA processing mutations are most directly associated with exon skipping. Mutations in splice sites or splicing regulatory elements can alter which exons are included in the final mRNA, leading to exon skipping or inclusion when it shouldn't be.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. RNA processing mutations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
