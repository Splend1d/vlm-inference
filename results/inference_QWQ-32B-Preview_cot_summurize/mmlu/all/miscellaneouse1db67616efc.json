I need to remember if he played abroad at any point in his career.\n\nI know that in the 1990s, there were some NBA players who played in other countries, especially in Europe, during the off-season or sometimes even during the NBA season. So, maybe he played in another country in 1999.\n\nLet me think about his career timeline. Magic Johnson retired twice, first in 1991 after announcing he had HIV, and then came back in 1995, I believe. He played for the Lakers his entire career, from what I remember.\n\nWait, but there was a time when he played for the Detroit Pit Bulls in the Unified Basketball League in 1995, but that's not a professional league in the same sense as the NBA.\n\nI think in 1999, he was still playing in the NBA for the Lakers. I don't recall him playing in any other country that season.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. United States\n\nB. Sweden\n\nC. Israel\n\nD. Turkey\n\nI think the answer is A. United States, because that's where the NBA is.\n\nBut maybe he did a exhibition tour or something in one of these countries. I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I recall that sometimes NBA players play in other countries during the off-season, but the question specifies \"during the 1999 season,\" which probably means the regular professional season.\n\nI think the safest answer is A. United States.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
