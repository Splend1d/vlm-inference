We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature. Some of which were then but new discoveries, and others not so generally known and embraced, as now they are. \u2026\nWe barred all discourses of divinity, of state affairs, and of news, other than what concerned our business of Philosophy. These meetings we removed soon after to the Bull Head in Cheapside, and in term-time to Gresham College, where we met weekly at Mr. Foster's lecture (then Astronomy Professor there), and, after the lecture ended, repaired, sometimes to Mr. Foster's lodgings, sometimes to some other place not far distant, where we continued such enquiries, and our numbers increased.\nDr. John Wallis, Account of Some Passages of his Life, 1700\nThe passage may be used as evidence for the development of\n\nA. an independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\nB. the study of natural philosophy in the royal courts in the seventeenth century\nC. new universities for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\nD. the study of natural philosophy in the Church in the seventeenth century\n"

                    "text": "Let's see what this passage is about. It's from Dr. John Wallis, written in 1700, recalling his time in London around 1645. He mentions being acquainted with \"diverse worthy persons, inquisitive into natural philosophy, and other parts of human learning; and particularly of what has been called the 'New Philosophy' or 'Experimental Philosophy.'\" So, it seems like there was a group of people interested in exploring new ideas in science and philosophy.\n\nThey had a regular meeting schedule: \"We did by agreements \u2026 meet weekly in London on a certain day, to treat and discourse of such affairs.\" Their discussions were focused on various scientific topics: \"Our business was (precluding matters of theology and state affairs), to discourse and consider of Philosophical Enquiries, and such as related thereunto: as physic, anatomy, geometry, astronomy, navigation, statics, magnetics, chemics, mechanics, and natural experiments; with the state of these studies, as then cultivated at home and abroad.\"\n\nThey talked about a lot of cutting-edge topics for that time, like the circulation of the blood, the structure of the solar system, the use of telescopes, and experiments with air pressure. It's interesting that they excluded theology and state affairs from their discussions, focusing solely on philosophical and scientific inquiries.\n\nLater, they moved their meetings to different locations, including Gresham College, where they would attend lectures and continue their discussions afterward. This suggests that they were part of an academic community, perhaps even forming some sort of society dedicated to the study of natural philosophy.\n\nNow, looking at the question: \"The passage may be used as evidence for the development of\u2026\"\n\nOption A: \"an independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\"\n\nOption B: \"the study of natural philosophy in the royal courts in the seventeenth century\"\n\nOption C: \"new universities for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century\"\n\nOption D: \"the study of natural philosophy in the Church in the seventeenth century\"\n\nGiven the information in the passage, let's evaluate each option.\n\nOption A: An independent society for the study of natural philosophy. The passage describes a group of people who regularly meet to discuss scientific topics, excluding theology and state affairs. They have a structured meeting schedule and discuss a wide range of subjects related to natural philosophy. This sounds a lot like an independent society dedicated to the study and advancement of science. They meet at various locations, including Gresham College, but it doesn't seem like they are part of an official university or church institution.\n\nOption B: The study of natural philosophy in royal courts. There's no mention of royal courts in the passage. The meetings are in London, but there's no indication that they are affiliated with the monarchy or taking place in royal courts.\n\nOption C: New universities for the study of natural philosophy. While they do meet at Gresham College, which is an educational institution, there's no evidence here that they are developing new universities. Gresham College already exists, and they are using it as a meeting place, not founding a new university.\n\nOption D: The study of natural philosophy in the Church. Again, there's no mention of the Church in the passage. They explicitly exclude theological discussions from their meetings, suggesting that their activities are separate from church affairs.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A seems to be the most appropriate choice. The passage describes a group of individuals forming an independent society to study natural philosophy, without affiliation to royal courts, new universities, or the Church.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
