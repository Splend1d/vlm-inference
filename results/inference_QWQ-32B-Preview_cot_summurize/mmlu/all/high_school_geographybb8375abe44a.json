                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about cities. It's asking about a city that's more than twice as big as the next biggest city in a country. The options are global city, world leader city, megalopolis, and primate city. I think the answer is primate city, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I know that a global city is a city that has a major influence on global affairs, like New York or London. But the size compared to other cities in the country isn't necessarily a factor here. So, maybe not A.\n\nWorld leader city sounds similar to global city, but it's not a standard term I've heard before. Maybe it's similar to global city, focusing on influence rather than size compared to other cities in the country.\n\nMegalopolis refers to a very large city or a conurbation, like a group of cities that have merged together. For example, the East Coast of the US has a megalopolis stretching from Boston to Washington D.C. But this doesn't specifically relate to being more than twice as large as the next city in the country.\n\nPrimate city seems to fit the description. I recall that a primate city is the largest city in a country and is more than twice as large as the next largest city. It's a term used in geography to describe this kind of dominance within a country's urban hierarchy.\n\nLet me confirm this. According to the primacy law, a primate city is usually the capital and is more than twice as large as the next largest city. This seems to match the question perfectly.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D, primate city.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's quickly review the other options again.\n\nGlobal city: Emphasizes global influence, not necessarily size compared to other cities in the country.\n\nWorld leader city: Not a standard term; might be similar to global city.\n\nMegalopolis: Refers to a large urban area, but not specifically about being more than twice as large as the next city.\n\nPrimate city: Exactly matches the description in the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. primate city.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
