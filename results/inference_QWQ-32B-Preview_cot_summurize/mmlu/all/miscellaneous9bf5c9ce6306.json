The options are cat, skunk, walrus, or penguin.\n\nFirst, I need to recall or find information about Tennessee Tuxedo. I remember that he's an anthropomorphic animal, meaning he has human traits like walking on two legs and talking. He's often depicted wearing a tuxedo, hence his name.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Cat - Some cartoon characters are cats, like Sylvester from Looney Tunes. But I don't think Tennessee is a cat.\n\nB. Skunk - There's Pepe Le Pew, who's a skunk. But Tennessee Tuxedo doesn't seem like a skunk to me.\n\nC. Walrus - Walruses are big animals with tusks. I don't recall Tennessee having tusks.\n\nD. Penguin - Penguins are flightless birds that live in cold places. Sometimes they're portrayed wearing formal clothes in cartoons.\n\nWait a minute, there's a cartoon called \"Tennessee Tuxedo and His Pal Chumley\" or something like that. I think Tennessee is a penguin who likes to dress up in a tuxedo. Penguins are often associated with tuxedos because their black and white plumage resembles formal wear.\n\nLet me double-check. Chumley is his sidekick, who is also a penguin, but not as well-groomed as Tennessee. They appear in animated shorts, and Tennessee is known for his sophisticated demeanor and Chumley for his naive and often clumsy actions.\n\nSo, based on this, I believe Tennessee Tuxedo is a penguin. Therefore, the correct answer is D. penguin.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why it's not the other options:\n\n- Cat: Cats are common in cartoons, but Tennessee is specifically a bird, a penguin.\n\n- Skunk: Skunks have stripes, and Tennessee doesn't have stripes; he has a tuxedo pattern.\n\n- Walrus: Walruses have distinctive tusks and aren't typically portrayed as wearing tuxedos.\n\nPenguins, on the other hand, are often given human characteristics and clothing in cartoons, and their natural appearance already resembles a tuxedo.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D. penguin is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
