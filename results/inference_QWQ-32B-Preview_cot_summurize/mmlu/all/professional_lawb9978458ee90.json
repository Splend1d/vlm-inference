                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about grand jury proceedings, and I need to figure out which statement isn't true. The options are:\n\nA. The proceedings are conducted in secret.\n\nB. There is no right to counsel.\n\nC. There is a right to Miranda warnings.\n\nD. There is no right to have evidence excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a grand jury is and how it operates. A grand jury is a group of people empaneled by a court to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to indict someone for a crime, usually a felony. It's part of the criminal justice system, but it operates a bit differently from a trial jury.\n\nOption A says that proceedings are conducted in secret. I think that's correct. Grand jury proceedings are generally private and sealed, meaning that what happens in the grand jury room is confidential. This is to protect the integrity of the investigation and to encourage witnesses to testify freely without fear of retaliation or public scrutiny.\n\nOption B mentions that there is no right to counsel. I believe this is also accurate. In grand jury proceedings, the target or subject of the investigation usually does not have the right to have an attorney present during their testimony. However, they can consult with their attorney outside the grand jury room.\n\nOption C states that there is a right to Miranda warnings. Now, Miranda warnings are those familiar rights that police must read to a suspect in custody before interrogating them, like \"you have the right to remain silent,\" and so on. I'm not sure if Miranda warnings apply in grand jury proceedings. Grand juries are part of the judicial process, not the investigative process like police interrogations. So, perhaps this is not true.\n\nOption D says there is no right to have evidence excluded. In regular trials, there are rules about what evidence can be admitted, and sometimes evidence is excluded if it was obtained illegally or doesn't meet certain standards. In grand jury proceedings, the standard is lower, and the rules of evidence are more relaxed. So, it's possible that evidence that might be excluded in a trial can still be considered by a grand jury.\n\nGiven that, option C seems like the one that's not true. Grand jury witnesses aren't typically entitled to Miranda warnings because the grand jury is a judicial body, and the warnings are required only in the context of custodial police interrogations.\n\nTo be thorough, maybe I should double-check. Let's consider the purpose of Miranda warnings. They're designed to protect individuals from self-incrimination during police interrogations when they're in custody. In a grand jury setting, while testimony could be self-incriminating, the setting is different. Witnesses appear before a grand jury, often with a subpoena, and they're sworn to tell the truth. If they're testifying about someone else, they might incriminate that person, but not themselves necessarily.\n\nMoreover, if a grand jury witness is the target of the investigation and chooses to testify, they can invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refuse to answer questions. But they don't need Miranda warnings to know that.\n\nSo, it seems that Miranda warnings aren't given in grand jury proceedings because the context and the legal requirements are different.\n\nTherefore, the statement that isn't true is option C: There is a right to Miranda warnings.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
