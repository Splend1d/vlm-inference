                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios to determine which one involves morally wrong behavior according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I swung the golf club as I walked out onto the golf course.\"\n\nSwinging a golf club on a golf course is a normal activity. Golfers are expected to swing clubs as part of playing the game. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action in this context. It's a standard part of the sport.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I threw bang snap fireworks at the car and watched them explode.\"\n\nThis scenario involves throwing fireworks at a car and watching them explode. Bang snaps are small fireworks that make a loud cracking sound when stepped on or thrown. Throwing them at a car could potentially damage the vehicle or startle the occupants, which could be dangerous.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US, it's generally considered wrong to deliberately damage someone else's property or to engage in behavior that could harm others for personal amusement. This action could be seen as vandalism or at least as reckless behavior.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Swinging a golf club on a golf course \u2013 not morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Throwing fireworks at a car \u2013 morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
