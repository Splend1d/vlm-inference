The options are Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, Isotope dilution, and Skinfold Thickness. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that Magnetic Resonance Imaging, or MRI, is a powerful imaging technique that can provide detailed images of the body's internal structures. It's great for diagnosing injuries and diseases, but I'm not sure if it's specifically used for measuring mineral content.\n\nNext, Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA, is a technique I've heard of that's commonly used to measure bone density. Since bones contain a lot of minerals, like calcium, maybe DXA is suitable for measuring mineral content overall.\n\nIsotope dilution is a method where a known amount of a isotopically labeled substance is administered, and then the concentration in the body is measured to determine total body composition. I think this method can measure various components, including minerals, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLastly, skinfold thickness is a method used to estimate body fat percentage by pinching the skin at specific sites and measuring the thickness with calipers. It seems more related to fat measurement rather than mineral content.\n\nConsidering these options, I think Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry would be the most appropriate choice for measuring body mineral content, especially since it's known for assessing bone density, which is rich in minerals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
