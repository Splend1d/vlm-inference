Anchors achieve this by hooking onto the seabed and providing resistance against the forces acting on the ship.\n\nOption A, catching large fish, is not a proper use of an anchor. Fishing is typically done using specialized gear such as nets, lines, and traps, not anchors.\n\nOption B, calculating water depth, is also incorrect. While anchors can sometimes be used in a makeshift manner to measure depth, their primary function is not for depth measurement. Instead, echo sounders or lead lines are more appropriate tools for determining water depth.\n\nOption D, damaging other boats, is not a proper use of an anchor. Anchors are designed to interact with the seabed, not with other vessels. Deliberately using an anchor to damage another boat would be considered vandalism or sabotage and is illegal.\n\nIn summary, the proper nautical use of an anchor is to hold a ship in place, making option C the correct answer."
