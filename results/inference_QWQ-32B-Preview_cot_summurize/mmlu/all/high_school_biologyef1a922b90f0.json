                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"Which group is composed entirely of individuals who maintained that species are fixed (i.e., unchanging)?\"\n\nAnd there are four options:\n\nA. Aristotle, Cuvier, and Lamarck\n\nB. Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck\n\nC. Lyell, Linnaeus, and Lamarck\n\nD. Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier\n\nI need to figure out which of these groups consists only of people who believed that species don't change over time. Okay, let's start by recalling who these people are and what they contributed to science.\n\nFirst, Aristotle. He was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist who classified living things into a hierarchy based on complexity. He believed in the idea of a \"great chain of being,\" where species had fixed positions and didn't change into one another.\n\nNext, Cuvier. Georges Cuvier was a French naturalist and zoologist who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries. He's known for his work in comparative anatomy and for establishing the field of paleontology. Cuvier strongly opposed the idea of evolution and believed that species were fixed and that the earth had undergone multiple catastrophes that led to extinctions.\n\nThen, Lamarck. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was also a French naturalist who lived around the same time as Cuvier. He's famous for proposing one of the first comprehensive theories of evolution, which included the idea that characteristics acquired during an organism's lifetime could be passed on to its offspring. So, Lamarck believed that species could change over time.\n\nLinnaeus. Carl Linnaeus was a Swedish botanist, zoologist, and physician who developed the system of binomial nomenclature for naming organisms. He classified species into a hierarchical system but, like Aristotle, believed that species were fixed and unchanging.\n\nLyell. Charles Lyell was a British geologist who lived in the 19th century. He's known for his work \"Principles of Geology,\" which promoted the idea of uniformitarianism\u2014the concept that the same geological processes we see today have been acting consistently over time. Lyell's work influenced Charles Darwin and supported the idea of gradual change over long periods, which aligns more with the concept of evolution.\n\nOkay, so let's evaluate each option:\n\nOption A: Aristotle, Cuvier, and Lamarck.\n\nAristotle believed in fixed species, Cuvier did too, but Lamarck believed in evolution. So this group isn't entirely composed of fixed species advocates.\n\nOption B: Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck.\n\nLinnaeus and Cuvier believed in fixed species, but Lamarck did not. So again, not all members hold the view of fixed species.\n\nOption C: Lyell, Linnaeus, and Lamarck.\n\nLinnaeus believed in fixed species, but Lyell and Lamarck both supported ideas of change over time, even if Lyell wasn't directly an evolutionist, his uniformitarianism supported the possibility of gradual change, which contradicts the idea of fixed species.\n\nOption D: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier.\n\nAll three\u2014Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier\u2014believed in fixed species. Aristotle and Linnaeus had classification systems based on fixed hierarchies, and Cuvier explicitly opposed evolution.\n\nSo, it looks like option D is the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nIs there any chance that Lyell believed in fixed species? Well, Lyell's uniformitarianism suggests that the earth changes gradually over time, which could imply that species might change as well, although Lyell himself was cautious about accepting evolution. However, his ideas did influence Darwin, who proposed a mechanism for evolution.\n\nLamarck, as I recall, is one of the early proponents of evolution, so he definitely didn't believe in fixed species.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the only group where all three individuals maintained that species are fixed and unchanging.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
