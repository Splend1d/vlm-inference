                    "text": "So I've got this genetics problem here. It's about an X-linked recessive disorder that's in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and I'm told that the incidence in males is 1 in 100. I need to find out the expected incidence of affected homozygous females. The options are 1 in 1000, 1 in 4000, 1 in 10,000, or 1 in 40,000.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium works for X-linked recessive disorders. In autosomal dominant or recessive traits, Hardy-Weinberg helps us predict genotype frequencies based on allele frequencies, but for X-linked traits, it's a bit different because males and females have different numbers of X chromosomes.\n\nMales have only one X chromosome, so for an X-linked recessive disorder, if they have the recessive allele, they will be affected. Females have two X chromosomes, so they need two recessive alleles to be affected.\n\nGiven that, the incidence in males is q, because males are hemizygous for X-linked genes. So, if the incidence in males is 1 in 100, that means q = 1/100 = 0.01.\n\nNow, for females to be affected, they need to be homozygous recessive, which would be q\u00b2.\n\nSo, the expected incidence in affected homozygous females should be q\u00b2.\n\nGiven q = 0.01, q\u00b2 = (0.01)\u00b2 = 0.0001.\n\nTo express this as a ratio, 0.0001 is equivalent to 1 in 10,000.\n\nSo, the answer should be 1 in 10,000, which is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for X-linked traits, the frequency of affected males is equal to q, and the frequency of affected females is q\u00b2.\n\nSo, yes, if q = 0.01, then q\u00b2 = 0.0001, which is 1 in 10,000.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\nOh, but I remember that sometimes in X-linked traits, the Hardy-Weinberg equations are adjusted because of the difference in the number of X chromosomes between males and females. Maybe I need to consider the overall frequency in the population.\n\nLet me think differently. The frequency of the recessive allele is q.\n\nMales are hemizygous, so the frequency of affected males is q.\n\nFemales are diploid for the X chromosome, so the frequency of affected females is q\u00b2.\n\nBut in the population, the frequency of affected individuals would be different because there are more females than males in the population in terms of X chromosomes.\n\nWait, no. In human populations, the sex ratio is usually 1:1, so the frequency of affected males is q, and affected females is q\u00b2.\n\nSo, if q = 0.01, then q\u00b2 = 0.0001, which is 1 in 10,000.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the Hardy-Weinberg equation for X-linked traits.\n\nThe general Hardy-Weinberg equations for X-linked traits consider the frequencies of alleles in males and females differently.\n\nThe frequency of the recessive allele in males is q, and in females, it's also q, but the expression differs.\n\nThe frequency of affected males is q, and the frequency of carrier females is 2pq, and affected females are q\u00b2.\n\nBut in this case, since we're only interested in affected homozygous females, which are q\u00b2, and we already have q from the incidence in males, which is 0.01, so q\u00b2 is 0.0001, or 1 in 10,000.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\nMaybe I should look up the Hardy-Weinberg equations for X-linked traits to confirm.\n\nOkay, according to my genetics notes, for X-linked recessive disorders:\n\n- Frequency of affected males = q\n\n- Frequency of carrier females = 2pq\n\n- Frequency of affected females = q\u00b2\n\nGiven that, and knowing that q = 1/100 = 0.01, then q\u00b2 = 0.0001, which is 1 in 10,000.\n\nSo, the expected incidence of affected homozygous females is 1 in 10,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 1 in 10,000.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
