                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about sociologists' views on the 'epidemic' of anorexia in Western cultures, specifically focusing on Mary Bordo's perspective from 1993. So, the question is asking which option best describes Bordo's attribution for this phenomenon.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Mary Bordo wrote about anorexia in her work. I believe she is known for her critical analysis of cultural norms and their impact on body image and eating disorders. Her book \"Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body\" delves into how cultural ideals contribute to eating disorders, particularly anorexia.\n\nOption A suggests that anorexia is attributed to a generally ascetic, frugal lifestyle that can be taken to extremes. While asceticism and frugality might be related to restricted eating, I don't recall Bordo specifically pointing to these as the main culprits for the rise in anorexia cases.\n\nOption B mentions traditional images of women as emotional, domesticated, and unassertive. These stereotypes certainly play a role in shaping women's self-perception and societal expectations, but I think Bordo might see something more contemporary at play here.\n\nOption C proposes that anorexia is a result of the social construction of mental illness, where normal behaviors are pathologized. While there is merit to this idea, and certainly some elements of anorexia being medicalized, I don't think this fully captures Bordo's perspective.\n\nOption D talks about the new ideal of independent, self-assured femininity combined with cultural values of achievement and control. This seems more aligned with Bordo's analysis, as she often discusses how modern feminist ideals, while empowering in many ways, can also impose pressures that lead to disordered eating.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. Bordo, being a feminist scholar, likely examines how shifts in gender roles and expectations affect women's relationships with their bodies. In the context of Western cultures moving towards more independent and self-assured femininity, there might be a paradox where, despite progress in gender equality, women are still judged heavily on their appearance and feel pressure to achieve in multiple domains.\n\nAnorexia, in this view, could be seen as a manifestation of the struggle to meet these high standards, where control over one's body becomes a way to exert control in a world that otherwise feels overwhelming.\n\nMoreover, Bordo probably critiques the media and cultural industries for promoting unrealistic body ideals, which contribute to the development of eating disorders. The fashion industry, for example, has been notorious for hiring underweight models, which can set unattainable standards for young women.\n\nAlso, the fitness and health culture that emphasizes constant self-improvement and discipline might inadvertently foster an environment where extreme dieting and exercise become normalized.\n\nSo, considering all this, option D seems the most fitting. It acknowledges the positive aspects of modern femininity, such as independence and self-assurance, but also recognizes the dark side of these ideals when combined with a culture that values achievement and control to the extreme.\n\nOption A is too narrow and doesn't capture the cultural complexity that Bordo likely addresses. Option B refers to traditional roles, but Bordo might argue that even as society moves away from these roles, new pressures emerge. Option C is relevant but perhaps doesn't directly address the specific cultural factors at play in the context of anorexia.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D: the new ideal of independent, self-assured femininity, combined with cultural values of achievement and control.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider whether Bordo might have also pointed to other factors. For instance, does she discuss the role of family dynamics or individual psychology in her work? While these aspects could contribute to anorexia, the question seems to be focusing on sociocultural factors, so perhaps they are less relevant here.\n\nAdditionally, I should think about how Bordo's perspective might have been influenced by the historical context of 1993. At that time, there was a growing awareness of eating disorders and their cultural underpinnings, so her analysis would likely reflect the scholarly and popular discussions of that era.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my understanding of Mary Bordo's work and the options provided, I believe that D is the most accurate description of her attribution for the 'epidemic' of anorexia in Western cultures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
