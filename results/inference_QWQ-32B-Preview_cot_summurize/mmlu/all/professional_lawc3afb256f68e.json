                    "text": "Let's see. So, we have two brothers who own a piece of land together as joint tenants. They both signed a deed to sell the land to a buyer. The first brother gave the deed to the second brother and told him to take it to their lawyer for approval before giving it to the buyer. But instead, the second brother took the deed directly to the buyer and collected the sale price without the first brother's permission. The question is, is this deed good as to the first brother?\n\nOkay, so let's break this down. First, they owned the land as joint tenants, which means they both have equal rights to the property, and typically, for conveyance, both need to agree and be part of the transfer.\n\nNow, both brothers signed the deed as grantors, which means they both agreed to sell the property, right? But the first brother intended for the deed to go to the lawyer for approval first, before it was delivered to the buyer.\n\nBut the second brother took it upon himself to deliver the deed directly to the buyer and collected the sale price.\n\nSo, the key here is the delivery of the deed. In property law, for a deed to be effective, it needs to be delivered and accepted by the grantee (the buyer).\n\nOption A says no, the deed cannot bind the first brother because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed to the grantee at that time.\n\nOption B says yes, the transfer is valid from both partners because the second brother was the first brother's apparent agent for purposes of delivering the deed.\n\nOption C says yes, the deed was signed by both partners, proving their intent to sell to the buyer, and it was delivered at the time of signing by affixing their signatures to the document.\n\nOption D says no, the deed was invalid as to both grantors because the second brother stepped outside his scope of authority.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet's think about agency. Was the second brother acting as an agent for the first brother in delivering the deed?\n\nWell, the first brother gave the deed to the second brother with instructions to take it to the lawyer for approval first. So, the second brother was supposed to take it to the lawyer, not directly to the buyer.\n\nBut he deviated from those instructions and took it to the buyer instead.\n\nSo, was he acting within his authority as an agent?\n\nProbably not, because he didn't follow the instructions given to him by the first brother.\n\nIn agency law, if an agent acts outside his authority, the principal isn't bound by those actions.\n\nSo, in this case, the first brother might not be bound by the second brother's actions because he acted outside his authority.\n\nBut let's consider that both brothers signed the deed. Does that mean they both intended to sell the property?\n\nYes, but the first brother intended to have the lawyer approve it first.\n\nSo, perhaps the signing of the deed indicates their intent to sell, but the delivery is a separate act that needs to occur for the deed to be effective.\n\nAnd in this case, the delivery was done by the second brother without the first brother's permission.\n\nSo, maybe the first brother isn't bound by that delivery.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that, saying the deed cannot bind the first brother because he didn't participate in the delivery and didn't intend to deliver it at that time.\n\nOption B says that the second brother was the first brother's apparent agent, so the transfer is valid from both.\n\nBut, given that the second brother acted against the first brother's instructions, is he still an apparent agent?\n\nMaybe not.\n\nOption C says that the deed was delivered at the time of signing by affixing their signatures.\n\nBut typically, delivery of a deed requires not just signing it but also intending to transfer title and having the grantee accept it.\n\nSo, just signing it doesn't necessarily mean it's been delivered.\n\nOption D says the deed is invalid as to both grantors because the second brother stepped outside his scope of authority.\n\nBut, since both signed the deed, maybe only the first brother isn't bound by the second brother's unauthorized delivery.\n\nWait, perhaps the first brother is not bound, but the second brother is, since he delivered it himself.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nLet me look up some key points about deed delivery in property law.\n\nOkay, deed delivery generally requires:\n\n1. The grantor's intent to transfer title.\n\n2. The grantee's acceptance of the deed.\n\n3. The grantor's delivery of the deed to the grantee or to someone holding it for the grantee.\n\nIn this case, both brothers intended to sell the property by signing the deed.\n\nBut the first brother didn't intend to deliver it to the buyer at that time; he wanted the lawyer to approve it first.\n\nSo, his intent to deliver was conditional on the lawyer's approval.\n\nBut the second brother delivered it anyway, without that approval.\n\nSo, perhaps the first brother's intent to deliver was not present at the time of delivery by the second brother.\n\nTherefore, the deed might not bind the first brother.\n\nOn the other hand, since both signed the deed, maybe the signing is enough to bind both, regardless of the delivery.\n\nBut I think delivery is a separate act that needs to occur for the deed to be effective.\n\nAlso, in joint tenancy, typically, both owners need to concur on the transfer.\n\nSo, if one transfers without the other's consent, especially in this scenario, maybe it's not effective as to the one who didn't consent to the delivery.\n\nLet me consider agency principles again.\n\nIf the second brother was acting as an agent for the first brother, but he acted outside his authority, then the first brother isn't bound by that act.\n\nIn this case, the first brother instructed the second brother to take the deed to the lawyer first.\n\nSo, the second brother's authority was limited to taking it to the lawyer.\n\nBy taking it directly to the buyer, he exceeded his authority.\n\nTherefore, the first brother isn't bound by that act.\n\nBut the second brother delivered the deed to the buyer, so perhaps the deed is effective as to him.\n\nBut since they are joint tenants, and both need to convey their interest, if one doesn't intend to deliver, maybe the deed isn't effective as to him.\n\nWait, perhaps the deed is partially effective.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me look for a similar case or legal principle.\n\nI recall that in property law, delivery of a deed requires both an intent to transfer and physical delivery to the grantee.\n\nIn this case, both brothers intended to transfer, but the first brother's intent was conditional on the lawyer's approval.\n\nSince that condition wasn't met, his intent to deliver wasn't satisfied.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the deed isn't effective as to him.\n\nOption A seems to align with that.\n\nOption B suggests that the second brother was the first brother's apparent agent, so the transfer is valid from both.\n\nBut given that he acted outside his authority, maybe he's not an apparent agent in this instance.\n\nOption C says that signing the deed proves their intent to sell, and delivery occurred at the time of signing.\n\nBut again, delivery is a separate act from signing, requiring the intent to transfer and acceptance by the grantee.\n\nOption D says the deed is invalid as to both because the second brother stepped outside his authority.\n\nBut perhaps it's only invalid as to the first brother, since he didn't authorize the delivery.\n\nWait, maybe it's invalid as to both because both need to intend to deliver the deed.\n\nBut the first brother didn't intend to deliver it at that time.\n\nSo, perhaps the deed is invalid as to both.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider the buyer's perspective.\n\nThe buyer received the deed from the second brother and paid the sale price.\n\nFrom the buyer's standpoint, he might argue that both brothers signed the deed, and he received it, so he should be the owner.\n\nBut, if the first brother didn't intend to deliver the deed at that time, perhaps the buyer doesn't get clear title.\n\nThis could lead to a cloud on the title.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first brother can't be bound by the second brother's unauthorized delivery.\n\nSo, perhaps the deed is good as to the second brother but not as to the first brother.\n\nBut that seems problematic because in joint tenancy, the interests are intertwined.\n\nIf one joint tenant transfers their interest without the other's consent, it might sever the joint tenancy, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me see what the answer options are:\n\nA. No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.\n\nB. Yes, the transfer is valid from both partners because partner two was partner one's apparent agent for purposes of delivering the deed.\n\nC. Yes, the deed was signed by both partners, which proved their intent to sell to buyer, and it was delivered at the time of signing by affixing their signatures to the document.\n\nD. No, the deed was invalid as to both grantors because partner two stepped outside his scope of authority.\n\nGiven my analysis, option A seems the most accurate.\n\nThe first brother did not intend to deliver the deed at that time; he wanted the lawyer to approve it first.\n\nTherefore, his interest wasn't effectively conveyed.\n\nOption B is questionable because the second brother acted outside his authority, so he might not be an apparent agent in this instance.\n\nOption C is incorrect because signing the deed is not the same as delivering it; delivery requires intent to transfer and acceptance by the grantee.\n\nOption D says the deed is invalid as to both, but perhaps it's only invalid as to the first brother.\n\nBut, since both are joint tenants, maybe the deed is invalid as to both because both need to intend to deliver.\n\nI'm still leaning towards A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deed is partially effective, conveying the second brother's interest but not the first brother's.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that would work in joint tenancy.\n\nMaybe it severs the joint tenancy.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for my level of knowledge.\n\nI think the best answer is A: No, the deed cannot bind partner one because he did not participate in the deed delivery to the buyer and did not intend to deliver the deed up to the grantee at that time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
