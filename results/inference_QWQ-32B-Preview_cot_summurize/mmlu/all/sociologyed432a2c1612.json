Let me think about it.\n\nFirst, I know that sampling is a way to select a subset of individuals from a larger population to study. There are different types of sampling methods, like probability sampling and non-probability sampling.\n\nProbability sampling is where each member of the population has a known chance of being selected, like simple random sampling or stratified sampling. Cluster sampling is a type of probability sampling where the population is divided into clusters, and then clusters are randomly selected.\n\nNon-probability sampling, on the other hand, doesn't give each member of the population an equal chance of being selected. It's often used when it's difficult to get a list of the entire population or when the research is more exploratory.\n\nNow, 'snowballing' sounds like a method where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances. So, it's like starting with a few people and then having them refer others, kind of like a snowball effect where it grows larger as it rolls along.\n\nGiven that, snowball sampling seems like it would be a non-probability sampling method because it relies on referrals and doesn't give everyone in the population an equal chance of being selected.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. probability sampling\n\nB. non-probability sampling\n\nC. cluster sampling\n\nD. using the Christmas vacation constructively\n\nOption D seems out of place and doesn't relate to sampling methods, so I can rule that out.\n\nBetween A, B, and C, I think B. non-probability sampling is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider cluster sampling again. Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters and then randomly selecting entire clusters to study. Snowball sampling doesn't involve clustering; it's more about referrals. So, C doesn't seem to fit.\n\nTherefore, I'm fairly confident that B. non-probability sampling is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
