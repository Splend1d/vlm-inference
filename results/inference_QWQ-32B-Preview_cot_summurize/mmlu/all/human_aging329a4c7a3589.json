People who die young\n\nB. People who live to be 100 or older\n\nC. People with healthy immune systems\n\nD. People who also have high levels of Apo-E 4\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Apo-E 2 is. I know that Apo-E is a protein involved in fat metabolism and brain function. There are different forms or alleles of the Apo-E gene, like E2, E3, and E4, each with different effects on health.\n\nApo-E 2 is often associated with lower risk of certain diseases. For example, it's linked to a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease compared to Apo-E 4, which is associated with a higher risk. Also, Apo-E 2 is related to lower cholesterol levels, which might be beneficial for heart health.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Die young - If Apo-E 2 is associated with lower cholesterol and lower risk of Alzheimer's, it seems unlikely that it would be prevalent in people who die young.\n\nB. Live to be 100 or older - This seems more plausible because if Apo-E 2 confers some health benefits, it might be more common in centenarians.\n\nC. Have healthy immune systems - While Apo-E is involved in immune function, I'm not sure if Apo-E 2 specifically is more prevalent in people with healthy immune systems.\n\nD. Also have high levels of Apo-E 4 - This seems contradictory because Apo-E 2 and E4 are different alleles; people can have different combinations, but I don't think having E2 necessarily means having high levels of E4.\n\nConsidering this, option B seems the most likely. Apo-E 2 might be more common in people who live to be 100 or older due to its potential health benefits.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if there's any research on the prevalence of Apo-E 2 in centenarians.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that some studies have indeed looked into the Apo-E gene and its association with longevity. It appears that Apo-E 2 is more frequent in centenarians and long-lived individuals in some populations, possibly contributing to their longevity.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Live to be 100 or older.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
