Abu Bakr.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some background about Muhammad and the early days of Islam. Muhammad was a religious leader who founded Islam in the 7th century CE. He received revelations that later became the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Khadijah: She was Muhammad's first wife and one of his earliest supporters. She believed in him and his prophethood even before he received his first revelation. She provided emotional and financial support to him during the early years of his mission.\n\nB. Gabriel: In Islam, Gabriel (Jibril in Arabic) is the angel who delivered the revelations from God to Muhammad. So, Gabriel was the messenger who brought the divine messages to Muhammad, but did he declare Muhammad a prophet?\n\nC. Waraqah: He was a Christian monk and a cousin of Khadijah. According to some sources, when Muhammad shared his experience of receiving the first revelation with Khadijah, she took him to Waraqah, who recognized Muhammad's experience as prophetic and affirmed that Muhammad was indeed a prophet.\n\nD. Abu Bakr: He was one of Muhammad's closest friends and companions. He was among the earliest converts to Islam and was known for his strong belief in Muhammad's prophethood.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Waraqah, being a learned man and a Christian monk, was the one who recognized and affirmed Muhammad's prophethood based on his experience with the first revelation.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Waraqah.\n\nBut to make sure, let me cross-verify this information.\n\nIn the Islamic tradition, when Muhammad had his first revelation in the cave of Hira, he was frightened and went back home to Khadijah. Khadijah comforted him and took him to Waraqah ibn Nawfal, who was a scholar of Christian scriptures and the Hebrew language.\n\nWaraqah listened to Muhammad's account and identified the angel Gabriel as the one who had visited Muhammad, similar to how Gabriel had interacted with Moses and other prophets. Waraqah is said to have confirmed that Muhammad was indeed a prophet.\n\nTherefore, it was Waraqah who declared or affirmed Muhammad's prophethood based on his knowledge and understanding of religious scriptures.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. Waraqah.\n\nOption A, Khadijah, supported Muhammad and believed in him, but she didn't declare him a prophet in the sense of confirming his experience through scholarly knowledge.\n\nOption B, Gabriel, delivered the revelations but didn't declare Muhammad a prophet; rather, he was the messenger conveying God's word to Muhammad.\n\nOption D, Abu Bakr, was a follower who believed in Muhammad's prophethood but wasn't the one who declared it.\n\nHence, Waraqah's role in affirming Muhammad's prophethood makes him the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
