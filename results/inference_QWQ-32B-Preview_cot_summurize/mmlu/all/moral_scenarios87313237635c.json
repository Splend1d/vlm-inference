                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I blew smoke away from the child's face.\"\n\nSmoking around children is generally considered harmful because secondhand smoke can be detrimental to their health. However, in this scenario, the person is blowing smoke away from the child's face, which suggests they are trying to minimize the child's exposure to smoke. This seems like an attempt to be considerate and protect the child from the harms of secondhand smoke. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action does not seem morally wrong; in fact, it appears to be a responsible thing to do.\n\nSecond, Scenario 2: \"I passionately kissed my son in the living room.\"\n\nThis scenario involves a parent passionately kissing their son in a public area of the home. In the US, physical affection between parents and their children is normal and healthy. However, the term \"passionately\" might imply a level of intimacy that could be inappropriate, especially depending on the age of the son. If the son is an adult, this might be acceptable, but if he is a child or teenager, such displays of affection could be considered inappropriate or even abusive, depending on the context and the son's comfort level.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't specify the son's age, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment. However, assuming the son is a minor, such behavior could be seen as crossing boundaries and potentially damaging to the son's emotional well-being. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this could be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
