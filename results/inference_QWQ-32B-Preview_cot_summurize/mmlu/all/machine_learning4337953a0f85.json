                    "text": "Let's see. I have these two statements about neural network architectures, and I need to determine if they're true or false. The first statement is about highway networks and ResNets, and the second is about DenseNets and ResNets in terms of memory usage.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"Highway networks were introduced after ResNets and eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall when highway networks and ResNets were introduced. I think ResNets came out in 2015, and highway networks were introduced earlier, around 2015 as well, or maybe 2014. Wait, let me think again. I believe highway networks were introduced by Srivastava et al. in 2015, and ResNets by He et al. also in 2015. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact timelines. Maybe I should look that up, but since this is a quiz, I'll have to go with what I remember.\n\nAssuming that highway networks and ResNets were introduced around the same time, perhaps highway networks were introduced first, or maybe ResNets were inspired by highway networks. In any case, the statement says highway networks were introduced after ResNets, which might not be accurate.\n\nNext, the statement says highway networks \"eschew max pooling in favor of convolutions.\" I know that highway networks are known for introducing gating mechanisms to control the flow of information, but I don't recall specifics about their use of max pooling versus convolutions. I think they primarily use gating units to allow or block the flow of information, but I'm not sure about their stance on max pooling.\n\nGiven that I'm not entirely sure about the timeline and the specific architectural choices, I'll have to make an educated guess. Maybe Statement 1 is false because highway networks might have been introduced around the same time as ResNets, and their focus was more on gating mechanisms rather than replacing max pooling with convolutions.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"DenseNets usually cost more memory than ResNets.\"\n\nDenseNets are known for their dense connectivity, where each layer is connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. This means that each layer receives input from all preceding layers and passes its own feature-maps to all subsequent layers. This extensive connectivity can lead to a higher memory footprint because of the need to store feature-maps from multiple layers for concatenation.\n\nResNets, on the other hand, use skip connections or residual connections that allow gradients to flow directly through the network, which helps in training deeper networks without suffering from vanishing gradients. However, in terms of memory usage, ResNets are generally more memory-efficient compared to DenseNets because they don't have the same level of connectivity and therefore don't need to store as many feature-maps.\n\nSo, it makes sense that DenseNets would usually cost more memory than ResNets due to their dense connectivity. Therefore, Statement 2 seems to be true.\n\nPutting it all together, if Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, then the correct choice would be D. False, True.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely confident about Statement 1. Maybe I should consider that highway networks were introduced before ResNets, or perhaps they were contemporaneous. If highway networks were introduced before ResNets, then the statement is false. If they were introduced after, then it might be true.\n\nLooking back, highway networks were indeed introduced before ResNets. Srivastava et al.'s paper on highway networks was in 2015, and He et al.'s ResNets were also in 2015, but I think highway networks might have been a bit earlier. In any case, they are very close in terms of timeline.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the statement is false because highway networks were not introduced after ResNets. Additionally, highway networks are more about gating mechanisms rather than specifically eschewing max pooling in favor of convolutions.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true, leading to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
