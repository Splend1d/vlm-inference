Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"least to greatest\" means. It means arranging the numbers in ascending order, starting from the smallest number to the largest one.\n\nSo, looking at the numbers: 6, -1, 8, -3, -4.\n\nI know that negative numbers are smaller than positive numbers. So, any negative number will come before positive numbers when ordering from least to greatest.\n\nAmong the negative numbers, the one with the larger absolute value is actually smaller. For example, -4 is smaller than -1 because 4 is greater than 1.\n\nSimilarly, among positive numbers, it's straightforward: 6 is smaller than 8.\n\nSo, first, I should list all the negative numbers in order from smallest to greatest, and then list the positive numbers in order from smallest to greatest.\n\nLet's list the negative numbers: -4, -3, -1.\n\nAnd the positive numbers: 6, 8.\n\nNow, combining them: -4, -3, -1, 6, 8.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6, -1, 8, -3, -4\n\nThis starts with a positive number, which isn't correct because there are negative numbers smaller than positive ones.\n\nB. -4, -3, -1, 6, 8\n\nThis matches what I just arranged.\n\nC. -1, -3, -4, 6, 8\n\nThis has -1 before -3, which is incorrect because -1 is greater than -3.\n\nD. -3, -4, 6, -1, 8\n\nThis has -3 before -4, which is incorrect, and it places -1 after the positive numbers, which is also wrong.\n\nSo, the correct order should be: -4, -3, -1, 6, 8, which is option B.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check.\n\nNegative numbers: -4 is smaller than -3, which is smaller than -1.\n\nPositive numbers: 6 is smaller than 8.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it on a number line. On a number line, numbers increase as you move to the right.\n\nSo, starting from the leftmost (smallest), we have -4, then -3, then -1, then 6, and finally 8.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. -4, -3, -1, 6, 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
