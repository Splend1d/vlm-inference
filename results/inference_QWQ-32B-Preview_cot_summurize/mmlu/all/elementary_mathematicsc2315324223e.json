Multiplying 7 by 2x gives me 14x. So, 7(2x) = 14x. Now, comparing that to 9x, they are not the same. 14x is not equal to 9x unless x is zero, but generally, they are not equivalent. So, option A is not the answer.\n\nNext, option B: 3x + 5x and 15x.\n\nAdding 3x and 5x together gives me 8x. So, 3x + 5x = 8x. Comparing that to 15x, they are not the same. 8x is not equal to 15x unless x is zero, but again, generally, they are not equivalent. So, option B is not the answer.\n\nNow, option C: 4(2x - 6) and 8x - 24.\n\nFirst, I'll distribute the 4 in 4(2x - 6). Multiplying 4 by 2x gives 8x, and 4 times -6 is -24. So, 4(2x - 6) = 8x - 24. Comparing that to 8x - 24, they are exactly the same. So, option C is equivalent.\n\nLastly, option D: x + x + x + x and x^4.\n\nAdding x four times gives me 4x. So, x + x + x + x = 4x. Now, x^4 means x multiplied by itself four times, which is x * x * x * x. That's not the same as 4x. So, they are not equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
