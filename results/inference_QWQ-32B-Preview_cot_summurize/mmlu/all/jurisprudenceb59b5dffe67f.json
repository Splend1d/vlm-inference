                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out why John Finnis rejects David Hume's conception of practical reason. The options given are:\n\nA. That natural law corresponds to positive law.\n\nB. That Hume is a legal positivist.\n\nC. That syllogistic logic is false.\n\nD. That human reason can help us to determine what constitutes a worthwhile life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Hume's conception of practical reason is. Hume is known for his distinction between \"is\" and \"ought,\" where he argues that you can't derive moral obligations (ought) from factual statements (is). In terms of practical reason, Hume believed that reason is slave to the passions and cannot motivate action on its own. It's more about means to ends, but the ends themselves are determined by our desires and feelings.\n\nNow, John Finnis is a legal and moral philosopher who is associated with natural law theory. Natural law theory holds that there are certain moral principles that are universal and can be discovered through reason.\n\nOption A says that natural law corresponds to positive law. Positive law is the man-made law, like statutes and regulations. Finnis, as a natural law theorist, would likely argue that positive law should be informed by natural law, but they aren't always the same. So, I don't think this is the reason Finnis rejects Hume's conception.\n\nOption B says that Hume is a legal positivist. Legal positivism holds that law is separate from morality and is based on social facts. Hume can be seen as influencing legal positivism, but I'm not sure if Finnis rejects Hume solely on that ground. Finnis opposes legal positivism because it separates law from morality, but I need to see if that's directly related to Hume's conception of practical reason.\n\nOption C says that syllogistic logic is false. Syllogistic logic is a form of deductive reasoning. I don't think Finnis rejects Hume's practical reason on the basis that syllogistic logic is false. Hume himself was critical of certain uses of reason, but syllogistic logic is a separate issue.\n\nOption D says that human reason can help us determine what constitutes a worthwhile life. This seems more aligned with Finnis's view. Finnis, in his theory, identifies certain basic goods that are intrinsic goods, and reason can help us recognize and pursue these goods. Hume, on the other hand, emphasizes that reason is slave to the passions and can't tell us what our ends should be.\n\nSo, perhaps Finnis rejects Hume's conception because he believes that reason can indeed help us determine what constitutes a worthwhile life, contrary to Hume's view that reason is limited to means-ends calculations.\n\nLet me think about this again. Finnis is a natural law theorist, and natural law holds that there are objective moral truths that can be known through reason. Hume, with his \"is-ought\" problem, seems to deny that moral truths can be derived from factual statements, which might conflict with Finnis's view.\n\nBut more specifically regarding practical reason, Hume's view is that reason is instrumental and can't provide motivations on its own. Finnis, however, would likely argue that reason can identify goods and thus provide motivations for action.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is that Finnis believes reason can help us determine what is good and what constitutes a worthwhile life, whereas Hume thinks that such determinations are based on feelings and desires, not on reason alone.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most plausible reason why Finnis rejects Hume's conception of practical reason.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Natural law corresponds to positive law. This doesn't seem directly related to Hume's conception of practical reason. Hume's focus is more on the separation between facts and values, and the role of reason in practical matters.\n\nOption B: Hume is a legal positivist. While Hume's philosophy has influenced legal positivism, Finnis's rejection of Hume might not be solely based on that. Finnis has broader philosophical differences with Hume regarding practical reason and morality.\n\nOption C: Syllogistic logic is false. This seems unrelated to the specific issue of practical reason as conceived by Hume.\n\nOption D: Human reason can help us determine what constitutes a worthwhile life. This aligns with Finnis's natural law theory, which holds that there are objective goods that reason can discern.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. Finnis rejects Hume's conception of practical reason because he believes that human reason can help us determine what constitutes a worthwhile life, contrary to Hume's view that reason is merely instrumental and cannot provide such determinations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
