                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria (PKU). The options are 1%, 10%, 25%, or almost 100%. I know that PKU is a genetic disorder, but I'm not exactly sure how it affects the baby if the mother has it untreated.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what PKU is. Phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means a person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to have the disease. If both parents are carriers, there's a 25% chance their child will have PKU.\n\nBut in this case, it's about a mother with untreated PKU and the risk to her child. So, it's not about the child inheriting PKU, but rather about the effects of the mother's PKU on the developing fetus.\n\nI remember that PKU leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine, an amino acid, because there's a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is needed to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine. When phenylalanine levels get too high, it can be toxic to the body, especially to the brain, leading to intellectual disabilities and other problems.\n\nIf a woman with PKU becomes pregnant and doesn't manage her condition properly, meaning she doesn't keep her phenylalanine levels in check, it can be dangerous for the developing baby. Even if the baby doesn't inherit PKU, the high phenylalanine levels in the mother's blood can affect the baby.\n\nSo, the risk here is not about the baby inheriting PKU, but about the teratogenic effects of high phenylalanine levels on the fetus. This can lead to developmental problems, birth defects, and intellectual disabilities in the child.\n\nI think the risk is quite high if the mother's PKU is untreated during pregnancy. In fact, I believe it's almost certain that the child will have some abnormalities if the mother doesn't manage her phenylalanine levels.\n\nLet me see if I can find some supporting evidence. I recall that in women with PKU, if they adhere to a low-phenylalanine diet before conception and throughout pregnancy, the risk of complications for the baby is significantly reduced.\n\nOn the other hand, if the mother has high phenylalanine levels during pregnancy, the risk of having a child with developmental delays, heart defects, small head size, and other problems is very high.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that women with PKU who do not adhere to a low-phenylalanine diet during pregnancy have a very high risk\u2014up to 90% or more\u2014of having a child with intellectual disabilities and other complications.\n\nSome sources even suggest that the risk is almost 100% if the mother's phenylalanine levels are not controlled.\n\nTherefore, considering the options given\u20141%, 10%, 25%, or almost 100%\u2014I think the correct answer is almost 100%.\n\nIt's crucial for women with PKU to manage their phenylalanine levels before and during pregnancy to prevent these complications.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Almost 100%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
