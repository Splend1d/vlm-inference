They contain chlorophyll, which captures light energy from the sun and converts it into chemical energy through a series of reactions known as the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. This process ultimately produces glucose and oxygen, which are essential for the survival of the plant and, by extension, for life on Earth.\n\nTo provide more context, let's briefly discuss the other options:\n\nA. Nucleus: The nucleus is the control center of the cell, containing the genetic material (DNA) that directs all cellular activities. It does not play a direct role in photosynthesis.\n\nC. Mitochondria: Mitochondria are often referred to as the \"powerhouses\" of the cell because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy. In animals and some other organisms, mitochondria are involved in cellular respiration, which is the process of breaking down glucose to produce energy. This is distinct from photosynthesis, which occurs in chloroplasts.\n\nD. Golgi Apparatus: The Golgi apparatus is involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids for transport to various parts of the cell or for secretion outside the cell. It does not play a role in photosynthesis.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. Chloroplast."
