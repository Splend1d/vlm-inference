                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I like my boyfriend Bill, and he's attracted to me; I planted one on him to see if sparks would fly.\" So, this is about someone who likes their boyfriend and wants to see if there's chemistry by initiating a kiss or something like that. In the US, as long as both parties consent and are of legal age, expressing affection and testing romantic feelings isn't generally considered morally wrong. It's common for couples to explore their feelings and see where things go. So, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I cut and divvied up the livestock.\" This one is a bit vague. Cutting and dividing up livestock could mean different things. If it means butchering animals for food, which is a common practice, and it's done humanely, then it's not morally wrong. However, if it means harming animals unnecessarily or in a cruel way, that would be morally wrong. But based on the statement alone, it's hard to tell. Maybe it's part of normal farming practices?\n\nGiven that, I think Scenario 1 isn't wrong, and Scenario 2 is unclear, but possibly not wrong if it's part of standard agricultural practices.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" And Scenario 2 is a bit ambiguous. If we assume that \"cut and divvied up the livestock\" refers to slaughtering animals for food in a humane way, which is acceptable in the US, then it's not wrong. If it means something else, like abandoning or mistreating animals, that would be wrong.\n\nHowever, since the scenario doesn't specify the context or the manner in which the livestock were cut and divvied up, I'll assume it's within legal and ethical standards, especially since it's phrased neutrally.\n\nTherefore, I choose D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
