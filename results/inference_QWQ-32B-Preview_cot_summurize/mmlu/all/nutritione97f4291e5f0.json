                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about glycogen metabolism, and I need to pick the correct statement from the options given. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"A key step in the synthesis of glycogen is the formation of UDP-glucose.\" Hmm, I remember that in glycogen synthesis, glucose needs to be activated somehow, and I think UDP-glucose is involved. UDP-glucose is formed by attaching glucose to uridine diphosphate (UDP), and this molecule is indeed used as a building block for adding glucose units to the growing glycogen chain. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"In muscle in the fasting state, glycogen is broken down to glucose 6-phosphate, then free glucose.\" Okay, in the fasting state, muscles do break down glycogen to maintain blood glucose levels. But, I think muscles can't release free glucose into the bloodstream because they lack the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which is needed to convert glucose 6-phosphate to free glucose. So, muscles break down glycogen to glucose 6-phosphate, which can be used for energy within the muscle, but they can't release free glucose. So, this statement might be incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"Glycogen is stored mainly in the liver and brain.\" I know that glycogen is stored primarily in the liver and muscles, not in the brain. The liver stores glycogen to maintain blood glucose levels, and muscles store glycogen for their own energy needs. I don't recall the brain storing significant amounts of glycogen. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"Glucagon increases the synthesis of glycogen.\" Glucagon is a hormone that's released when blood glucose is low, and its main function is to increase blood glucose levels. It does this by promoting glycogen breakdown in the liver to release glucose into the blood. So, glucagon actually stimulates glycogenolysis, not glycogen synthesis. Glycogen synthesis is stimulated by insulin, which is released when blood glucose is high. So, this statement is also incorrect.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it seems like option A is the correct statement. But let me double-check.\n\nFirst, UDP-glucose is indeed a key molecule in glycogen synthesis. It's formed by the reaction between glucose-1-phosphate and UDP, catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. This UDP-glucose is then used by glycogen synthase to add glucose residues to the glycogen chain. So, that checks out.\n\nOption B is problematic because muscles can't release free glucose into the blood due to the lack of glucose-6-phosphatase. So, they break down glycogen for their own use, not to contribute to blood glucose.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the brain doesn't store much glycogen. It relies on glucose from the blood, which is mainly regulated by liver glycogen stores.\n\nOption D is wrong because glucagon stimulates glycogen breakdown, not synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. A key step in the synthesis of glycogen is the formation of UDP-glucose.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
