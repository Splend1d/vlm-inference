Let's look at each one:\n\nA. a measurable physiological change.\n\nI know that hypnosis can involve changes in physiology, like reduced heart rate or breathing changes, but is that the best description overall? Maybe it's part of it, but maybe there's more.\n\nB. an alteration in memory, mood, and perception.\n\nThis seems broad, but hypnosis does affect how people perceive things, their memories, and their emotions. This sounds promising.\n\nC. increased compliance to situational demands.\n\nI've heard that hypnosis makes people more suggestible, so they comply more with suggestions. Is this the main thing, though? Maybe it's a part of it, but perhaps not the whole picture.\n\nD. a state of \u201cartificial sleep.\u201d\n\nI think this is a common misconception. Hypnosis isn't really about sleeping; people are usually awake and aware during hypnosis. So, probably not the best description.\n\nLet me think about what hypnosis is. It's a trance state where people are more receptive to suggestions. It can affect their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. So, it probably involves changes in consciousness.\n\nOption B mentions alteration in memory, mood, and perception, which are all aspects of consciousness. That sounds like a comprehensive description.\n\nOption A is too narrow, focusing only on physiological changes, which are just one aspect.\n\nOption C is about compliance, which is part of it, but maybe not the fullest description.\n\nOption D is misleading, as hypnosis isn't about sleeping.\n\nSo, I think B is the best answer: an alteration in memory, mood, and perception.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
