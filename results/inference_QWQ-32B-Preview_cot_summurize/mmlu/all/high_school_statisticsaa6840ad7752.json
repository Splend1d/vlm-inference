                    "text": "Let's see. I have two events, A and B, and they're both nonzero probabilities. They're independent, and I need to figure out which statement is true from the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what it means for two events to be independent. Independence in probability means that the occurrence of one event doesn't affect the probability of the other event happening. So, if A and B are independent, knowing that A happened doesn't change the probability of B happening, and vice versa.\n\nOption A says: P(A and B) = P(A) \u00b7 P(B). I think this is the definition of independent events. So, if A and B are independent, then the probability that both A and B occur is just the product of their individual probabilities. That makes sense. So, option A seems correct.\n\nOption B says: A and B may or may not be mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive means that A and B can't happen at the same time, so P(A and B) = 0. But since A and B are independent and both have nonzero probabilities, P(A and B) = P(A) \u00b7 P(B), which is not zero because both P(A) and P(B) are nonzero. Therefore, A and B cannot be mutually exclusive if they are independent and both have nonzero probabilities. So, option B seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says: A and B must be mutually exclusive. Well, based on what I just thought about option B, if A and B are independent and both have nonzero probabilities, they cannot be mutually exclusive because P(A and B) is not zero. So, option C is also incorrect.\n\nOption D says: P(A|B) = P(B|A). This is about conditional probabilities. P(A|B) is the probability of A given that B has occurred, and P(B|A) is the probability of B given that A has occurred. For independent events, P(A|B) = P(A), because the occurrence of B doesn't affect A. Similarly, P(B|A) = P(B). So, P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B). Unless P(A) = P(B), which isn't necessarily true, P(A|B) doesn't have to equal P(B|A). Therefore, option D is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, out of all these options, option A seems to be the correct one. Let me just double-check.\n\nIf A and B are independent, then P(A and B) = P(A) \u00b7 P(B). That's a fundamental definition in probability. Also, since they are independent and have nonzero probabilities, they cannot be mutually exclusive because P(A and B) is not zero. So, options B and C are incorrect. And option D isn't necessarily true because P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B), which are not necessarily equal unless P(A) = P(B), which isn't given.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
