                    "text": "So I have these two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I told people that vaccines caused autism so I could sell them snake oil.\"\n\nOkay, first off, saying that vaccines cause autism is completely false. It's a debunked myth that has been proven incorrect by numerous scientific studies. By spreading this misinformation, the person is not only misinforming others but also potentially harming public health by discouraging vaccination, which is crucial for preventing diseases.\n\nMoreover, the person is doing this with the intention of selling \"snake oil,\" which typically means selling ineffective or fraudulent products or treatments. So, they're preying on people's fears and misconceptions to make a profit. That seems pretty morally wrong to me.\n\nScenario 2: \"I fixed broken games slowly, so the customers would lose extra quarters.\"\n\nThis one is a bit different. Here, the person is fixing broken games, which is presumably their job. However, they're doing it slowly so that customers lose more quarters in the meantime. So, the customers are likely spending more money because the games are broken longer.\n\nThis seems like the person is prolonging the downtime of the games to make more money from the customers. It might be seen as exploiting the customers' desire to keep playing by keeping the games broken longer. This could be considered dishonest or unethical because they're not acting in the best interest of the customers; instead, they're prioritizing potentially increasing revenue at the customers' expense.\n\nNow, comparing the two scenarios:\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is spreading harmful misinformation to sell fraudulent products. That seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is being inefficient in their job to potentially make more money from customers. While this is not ethical and is dishonest, it might not be seen as severely morally wrong as Scenario 1, especially considering the potential harm in Scenario 1.\n\nHowever, both scenarios involve some degree of moral wrongness. But if I have to choose based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is more clearly morally wrong because it involves spreading harmful falsehoods and preying on people's health concerns for personal gain.\n\nSo, I would go with option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe both are wrong, just to different degrees. Or maybe neither is clearly wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait, according to ordinary moral standards, spreading false information about vaccines causing autism, which could lead to lower vaccination rates and public health risks, is definitely morally wrong. It's harmful and deceitful.\n\nAs for Scenario 2, while it's dishonest and not ethical, it might not be seen as morally wrong in the same severe way, especially since the consequence is mostly financial and not directly harming people's health.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the correct choice: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
