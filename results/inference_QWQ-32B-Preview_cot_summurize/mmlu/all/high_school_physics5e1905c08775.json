                    "text": "For an object to be in static equilibrium, it must satisfy certain conditions related to the forces and torques acting on it. Let's analyze each of the given conditions to determine which are necessary for static equilibrium.\n\n**Condition I: The vector sum of all torques on the object must equal zero.**\n\nTorque is a measure of the force that causes an object to rotate. For an object to be in static equilibrium, it must not be rotating, meaning there should be no net torque acting on it. Therefore, the vector sum of all torques must indeed be zero.\n\n**Condition II: The vector sum of all forces on the object must equal zero.**\n\nFor an object to be in static equilibrium, it must not be accelerating in any direction. According to Newton's first law, this means that the net force acting on the object must be zero. Therefore, the vector sum of all forces must be zero.\n\n**Condition III: The sum of the object\u2019s potential and kinetic energies must be zero.**\n\nPotential energy is energy due to an object's position or configuration, and kinetic energy is energy due to an object's motion. In static equilibrium, the object is stationary, so its kinetic energy is zero. However, its potential energy can be non-zero depending on its position in a gravitational field or other force fields. The sum of potential and kinetic energies being zero is not a standard condition for static equilibrium. In fact, in many cases, the potential energy is minimized in static equilibrium, but it doesn't have to be zero.\n\nGiven this analysis, conditions I and II are necessary for static equilibrium, while condition III is not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. I and II only**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
