It promotes a neutral stance towards religion, neither favoring nor opposing any particular religious belief. In a secular society, religious beliefs are considered a private matter, and public policies are based on rational and scientific principles rather than religious doctrines.\n\nPolytheism (option A) is the belief in multiple gods or deities.\n\nAnimism (option B) is the belief that spirits inhabit natural objects and phenomena.\n\nMonotheism (option D) is the belief in one god.\n\nNone of these options accurately describe a rejection or indifference to religion in a country; secularism is the most appropriate term for that concept."
