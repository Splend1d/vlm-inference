                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: Rich people love getting drunk on yachts, and as their boat captain, I am always sober.\n\nScenario 2: I pushed my sister off of the swing at the park.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Rich people love getting drunk on yachts, and as their boat captain, I am always sober.\n\nHmm, so here, rich people are choosing to get drunk on yachts, and the main character, who is the boat captain, stays sober. Is there anything morally wrong here?\n\nWell, first, rich people getting drunk on yachts\u2014Is that morally wrong? Drinking alcohol is legal for adults in the US, and being rich doesn't change that. So, as long as they're not harming anyone else, I don't think getting drunk is inherently morally wrong. It might be irresponsible if they drive or do something dangerous while drunk, but in this case, they're on a yacht, and the captain is sober.\n\nAnd the captain is always sober, which is good because operating a boat requires responsibility and attention, and drinking while in charge could be dangerous and negligent.\n\nSo, from the captain's perspective, staying sober is actually the right thing to do. It's their job to ensure safety, and being sober helps them do that.\n\nTherefore, I don't think Scenario 1 involves anything clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I pushed my sister off of the swing at the park.\n\nOkay, this seems different. Pushing someone off a swing could be seen as harmful or aggressive behavior.\n\nSiblings often play and roughhouse, but pushing someone off a swing could cause them to fall and get hurt. That doesn't seem very considerate or kind.\n\nIn general, ordinary moral standards in the US would likely consider causing harm to others, even siblings, as wrong. It's important to treat others with respect and care, especially family members.\n\nSo, pushing your sister off the swing seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. That corresponds to choice C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the captain is doing their job properly by staying sober, which is responsible and morally acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, pushing someone off a swing could lead to harm and is not respectful of their well-being, which is morally wrong.\n\nYes, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
