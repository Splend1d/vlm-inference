I've noticed that older folks sometimes don't use the internet as much as younger people do. Maybe they don't have computers or smartphones, or they're not as comfortable using them.\n\nAlso, option A could be a factor. Some older people might have vision problems, so reading small text on a screen could be tough for them. Maybe the fonts aren't big enough or the contrast isn't good.\n\nOption C says that the internet is aimed at younger people. I'm not sure about that. I think the internet has content for all ages, but maybe the way it's designed or the platforms used are more appealing to younger users. So, if we provide information online, older people might not find it as user-friendly or relevant to their needs.\n\nAnd option D, about not being able to type, might be an issue for some older adults. Maybe they aren't familiar with keyboards or have physical difficulties that make typing hard.\n\nSo, overall, I think all these factors could make it challenging for people over 65 to access information that's only available online. That's why it's important to consider other ways to reach them, like printed materials or through community centers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
