                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"Find the number of elements in the indicated cyclic group: The cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25.\" And the options are A. 25, B. 5, C. 6, D. 30. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Z_30 is. Z_30 is the set of integers modulo 30. So, it's all the integers from 0 to 29, and we do addition modulo 30. Now, a cyclic subgroup generated by an element in this group would be all the multiples of that element, again under modulo 30.\n\nSo, the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 in Z_30 would be the set {25, 25+25 mod 30, 25+25+25 mod 30, ...} and so on, until we start repeating elements.\n\nLet me try to list out some elements:\n\n- Start with 25.\n\n- Next is 25 + 25 = 50 mod 30. 50 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 20, so 50 mod 30 is 20.\n\n- Next is 20 + 25 = 45 mod 30. 45 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 15, so 45 mod 30 is 15.\n\n- Next is 15 + 25 = 40 mod 30. 40 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 10, so 40 mod 30 is 10.\n\n- Next is 10 + 25 = 35 mod 30. 35 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 5, so 35 mod 30 is 5.\n\n- Next is 5 + 25 = 30 mod 30. 30 divided by 30 is 1 with a remainder of 0, so 30 mod 30 is 0.\n\n- Next is 0 + 25 = 25 mod 30, which brings us back to 25.\n\nSo, the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 in Z_30 is {25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0}. That's 6 elements.\n\nWait, but let's check if there are more elements. Starting from 25, we got 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0, and then back to 25. So, it cycles every 6 steps.\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in this cyclic subgroup is 6.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 6 is one of them.\n\nBut let me see if there's a better way to find this without listing out all the elements. I recall that in a cyclic group Z_n, the order of the subgroup generated by an element a is n divided by the greatest common divisor of a and n. In other words, |<a>| = n / gcd(a, n).\n\nIn this case, n is 30 and a is 25. So, gcd(25, 30) is 5.\n\nTherefore, the order of the subgroup is 30 / 5 = 6.\n\nThat matches what I found earlier by listing out the elements.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 6.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's quickly check the other options.\n\nA. 25: That's the generator, not the number of elements in the subgroup.\n\nB. 5: That's the gcd of 25 and 30, which we used in the formula.\n\nD. 30: That's the order of the whole group Z_30, but the subgroup is smaller.\n\nTherefore, C. 6 is indeed the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
