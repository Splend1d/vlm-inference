                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions of maximal and prime ideals.\n\n- A **prime ideal** \\( P \\) in a commutative ring \\( R \\) is an ideal such that if \\( a, b \\in R \\) and \\( ab \\in P \\), then either \\( a \\in P \\) or \\( b \\in P \\).\n\n- A **maximal ideal** \\( M \\) in a commutative ring \\( R \\) is an ideal that is not properly contained in any other ideal except \\( R \\) itself.\n\nNow, is every maximal ideal also a prime ideal?\n\nI think yes, because if \\( M \\) is a maximal ideal, and suppose \\( ab \\in M \\), but neither \\( a \\in M \\) nor \\( b \\in M \\). Then, the ideals generated by \\( M \\) and \\( a \\), denoted \\( M + (a) \\), would be larger than \\( M \\), and since \\( M \\) is maximal, \\( M + (a) = R \\). Similarly, \\( M + (b) = R \\).\n\nNow, consider the product \\( (M + (a))(M + (b)) \\). This product should contain \\( M \\cdot M + M \\cdot (b) + (a) \\cdot M + (a)(b) \\). Since \\( M \\) is an ideal, \\( M \\cdot M \\subseteq M \\), \\( M \\cdot (b) \\subseteq M \\), and \\( (a) \\cdot M \\subseteq M \\). Also, \\( ab \\in M \\), so \\( (a)(b) \\subseteq M \\). Therefore, \\( (M + (a))(M + (b)) \\subseteq M + M + M + M = M \\), which implies \\( R \\cdot R = R \\subseteq M \\), which is a contradiction because \\( M \\) is a proper ideal. Hence, our assumption that neither \\( a \\) nor \\( b \\) is in \\( M \\) must be false. Therefore, \\( M \\) is a prime ideal.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\( I \\) is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring \\( R \\), then \\( R/I \\) is a field.\n\nAgain, recalling that if \\( I \\) is a maximal ideal, then there are no ideals properly between \\( I \\) and \\( R \\). Now, consider the quotient ring \\( R/I \\). In \\( R/I \\), the ideals correspond to ideals in \\( R \\) containing \\( I \\). Since \\( I \\) is maximal, the only ideals containing \\( I \\) are \\( I \\) itself and \\( R \\), which correspond to the zero ideal and the whole ring \\( R/I \\). A ring whose only ideals are the zero ideal and itself is a field.\n\nTherefore, \\( R/I \\) is a field.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
