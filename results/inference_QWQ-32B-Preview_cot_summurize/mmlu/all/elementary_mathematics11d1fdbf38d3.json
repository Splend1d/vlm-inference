The options are given in problems per minute.\n\nFirst, I should understand what rate means here. Rate is basically how many problems she can solve in one minute. So, if she has 5 minutes, and she needs to solve 20 problems, I can calculate the rate by dividing the total number of problems by the total time she has.\n\nSo, rate = number of problems / time in minutes.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, rate = 20 problems / 5 minutes.\n\nThat gives me rate = 4 problems per minute.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the minimum rate she can work in order to finish in time. So, if she solves at least 4 problems per minute, she should be able to finish all 20 problems in 5 minutes.\n\nLet me double-check that. If she solves 4 problems each minute for 5 minutes, that's 4 * 5 = 20 problems, which is exactly what she needs to do.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 1 problem per minute\n\nB. 2 problems per minute\n\nC. 4 problems per minute\n\nD. 5 problems per minute\n\nOption C is 4 problems per minute, which is exactly what I calculated.\n\nBut the question is asking for the minimum rate. So, is there a lower rate that would still allow her to finish in time? Let's see.\n\nIf she solves at a rate of 3 problems per minute, then in 5 minutes she would solve 3 * 5 = 15 problems, which is less than 20. So, that's not enough.\n\nAt 4 problems per minute, she solves 20 problems in 5 minutes, which is perfect.\n\nIf she solves faster, say 5 problems per minute, she would solve 25 problems in 5 minutes, which is more than needed, but the question is about the minimum rate to finish in time.\n\nTherefore, the minimum rate she needs to work is 4 problems per minute.\n\nI think the answer is C. 4 problems per minute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
