It seems like it's about how parents share responsibility for their children after they split up. Let me read the options carefully.\n\nOption A says that fathers are more likely to be absent from their children's lives. But I think that might not be accurate because joint parenthood usually means both parents are involved.\n\nOption B mentions that one parent has total responsibility for the child's welfare and socialization. That sounds like custodial parenting, where one parent has primary custody.\n\nOption C says both parents are expected to cooperate in the continued care of their children. That sounds like joint parenthood to me, where responsibilities are shared.\n\nOption D talks about parents providing for all of their children in equal measure. I'm not sure what that means exactly, but it doesn't sound directly related to the shift from custodial to joint parenthood.\n\nI think the question is asking about the change from a system where one parent has main responsibility to one where both parents share responsibility. So, the shift is towards more involvement from both parents.\n\nLet me think about this again. Custodial parenting typically means one parent has primary custody, and the other has visitation rights. Joint parenthood, on the other hand, implies that both parents share custody and decision-making responsibilities.\n\nSo, the shift from custodial to joint parenthood would mean that both parents are more involved in their children's lives, rather than just one parent having total responsibility.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C seems to match this description: \"both parents are expected to cooperate in the continued care of their children.\"\n\nOption A suggests that fathers are more likely to be absent, but that contradicts the idea of joint parenthood, which aims for more involvement from both parents.\n\nOption B describes custodial parenting, not the shift to joint parenthood.\n\nOption D is a bit unclear, but it doesn't seem directly related to the shift in parenting styles after divorce.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option C: both parents are expected to cooperate in the continued care of their children.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there might be another interpretation.\n\nMaybe the shift to joint parenthood affects fathers' involvement. Perhaps it makes them more present, not less. So option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B is about one parent having total responsibility, which is the opposite of joint parenthood.\n\nOption D is unclear, and doesn't seem directly related to the shift from custodial to joint parenthood.\n\nSo, yes, option C seems to be the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
