                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have 0.25 moles of a weak, monoprotic acid dissolved in 0.25 liters of distilled water, and the resulting pH is 4.26. We need to find the pKa of this acid.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a weak acid is and how it behaves in water. A weak acid doesn't fully dissociate in water; instead, it reaches an equilibrium where some molecules dissociate into hydrogen ions (H+) and their conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is called Ka, and pKa is just the negative logarithm of Ka.\n\nThe general equation for a weak acid HA dissociating in water is:\n\nHA \u21cc H+ + A-\n\nWhere HA is the acid, H+ is the hydrogen ion, and A- is the conjugate base.\n\nThe expression for Ka is:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA]\n\nAnd pKa = -log(Ka)\n\nGiven that, I need to find pKa, but I don't directly know Ka. So, I need to find a way to relate the given information\u2014moles of acid, volume, and pH\u2014to Ka.\n\nFirst, let's find the concentration of the acid. We have 0.25 moles in 0.25 liters, so:\n\nConcentration of HA = moles/volume = 0.25 mol / 0.25 L = 1 M\n\nSo, the initial concentration of HA is 1 M.\n\nNext, we're given the pH, which is 4.26. pH is defined as:\n\npH = -log([H+])\n\nSo, [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-4.26)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n10^(-4.26) \u2248 5.495 x 10^(-5) M\n\nSo, at equilibrium, the concentration of H+ is 5.495 x 10^(-5) M.\n\nNow, in the dissociation of HA, for every H+ ion produced, one A- ion is also produced. Therefore, at equilibrium:\n\n[H+] = [A-] = 5.495 x 10^(-5) M\n\nThe concentration of HA that hasn't dissociated would be the initial concentration minus the amount that dissociated. So:\n\n[HA] = initial [HA] - [H+] = 1 M - 5.495 x 10^(-5) M\n\nSince 5.495 x 10^(-5) is much smaller than 1, we can approximate:\n\n[HA] \u2248 1 M\n\nNow, plug these into the Ka expression:\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA] \u2248 (5.495 x 10^(-5))^2 / 1 = (5.495 x 10^(-5))^2\n\nCalculate that:\n\n(5.495 x 10^(-5))^2 = 3.02 x 10^(-9)\n\nSo, Ka \u2248 3.02 x 10^(-9)\n\nNow, pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(3.02 x 10^(-9))\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nLog of 3.02 x 10^(-9) is log(3.02) + log(10^(-9)) \u2248 0.48 - 9 = -8.52\n\nBut pKa is -log(Ka), so:\n\nPka = -(-8.52) = 8.52\n\nWait a minute, that seems off. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, [H+] = 10^(-4.26) = 5.495 x 10^(-5) M, that seems correct.\n\nThen, [A-] = [H+] = 5.495 x 10^(-5) M\n\n[HA] \u2248 1 M (since dissociation is small)\n\nKa = [H+][A-]/[HA] = (5.495 x 10^(-5))^2 / 1 = 3.02 x 10^(-9)\n\nPka = -log(3.02 x 10^(-9)) = 8.52\n\nHmm, but the answer seems too high. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula that relates pH, pKa, and the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base, known as the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nBut in this case, since it's a pure solution of the acid, with no added base, [A-] is very small compared to [HA], so [A-]/[HA] is small, and the log of that would be negative, making pH less than pKa.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, pH is 4.26 and pKa came out to be 8.52, which is higher, consistent with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming [HA] is approximately 1 M. Maybe I need to account for the dissociation more accurately.\n\nLet's set up an ICE table:\n\nInitial:\n\n[HA] = 1 M\n\n[H+] = 0\n\n[A-] = 0\n\nChange:\n\n[H+] increases by x M\n\n[A-] increases by x M\n\n[HA] decreases by x M\n\nEquilibrium:\n\n[HA] = 1 - x\n\n[H+] = x\n\n[A-] = x\n\nThen, Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA] = x^2 / (1 - x)\n\nWe know x = [H+] = 5.495 x 10^(-5) M\n\nSo, Ka = (5.495 x 10^(-5))^2 / (1 - 5.495 x 10^(-5)) \u2248 (5.495 x 10^(-5))^2 / 1 = 3.02 x 10^(-9)\n\nSame as before.\n\nThen, pKa = -log(3.02 x 10^(-9)) = 8.52\n\nSo, the pKa is 8.52.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 4.26\n\nB. 8.52\n\nC. 7.52\n\nD. 3.66\n\nOption B is 8.52, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach, like using the definition of Ka in terms of dissociation constant and concentration.\n\nWait, another way is to recognize that for a weak acid in solution, the concentration of H+ is equal to the square root of (Ka * [HA]), when [HA] is much larger than [H+].\n\nSo, [H+] = sqrt(Ka * [HA])\n\nGiven [H+] = 5.495 x 10^(-5) M and [HA] \u2248 1 M,\n\nThen, Ka \u2248 [H+]^2 / [HA] = (5.495 x 10^(-5))^2 / 1 = 3.02 x 10^(-9)\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nTherefore, pKa = 8.52\n\nI think the answer is B. 8.52.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, is there any effect of water autoionization or anything like that? Given that [H+] is 5.495 x 10^(-5) M, which is much larger than the [H+] from water autoionization (1 x 10^(-7) M), it's negligible in this case.\n\nAlso, since the acid is monoprotic and weak, and we're dealing with a pure solution without any added base, this approach should be sufficient.\n\nSo, I conclude that the pKa of the acid is 8.52.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8.52} \\]"
