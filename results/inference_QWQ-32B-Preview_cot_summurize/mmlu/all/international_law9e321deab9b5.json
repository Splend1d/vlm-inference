There are a few options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nOption A says that treaties may only codify customary law. Hmm, that seems a bit limiting. While it's true that treaties often codify existing customary international law, they can also create new norms that weren't previously part of customary law. So, I don't think A is entirely accurate.\n\nOption B states that customary law is a different source of international law and it cannot be embodied in treaties. Well, I know that customary international law and treaties are both sources of international law, but I believe that customary law can be embodied in treaties. In fact, treaties often formalize and confirm existing customary laws. So, B seems incorrect.\n\nOption C suggests that treaties can 1) codify customary law, 2) 'crystallize' customary law, and 3) lead to the emergence of customary law. This sounds more comprehensive. Let me think about each point:\n\n1. Codify customary law: Yes, treaties often put established customary laws into written form.\n\n2. Crystallize customary law: This might mean that a treaty confirms and solidifies a practice that was developing but not yet fully established as customary law.\n\n3. Lead to the emergence of customary law: Perhaps treaties can influence the development of new customary laws over time as states follow the treaty provisions even if they haven't joined the treaty.\n\nThis option seems to cover multiple ways treaties interact with customary law.\n\nOption D says that customary law can emerge only from a few multilateral treaties. This seems too restrictive. Customary international law can emerge from state practice and the belief that such practice is legally required (opinio juris), regardless of whether it's based on treaties or not. So, D doesn't sound right.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C appears to be the most accurate description of how customary law relates to treaty provisions. It acknowledges that treaties can codify existing customary law, confirm developing practices, and even contribute to the emergence of new customary laws.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
