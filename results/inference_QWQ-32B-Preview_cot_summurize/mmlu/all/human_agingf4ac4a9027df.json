Study old age and older adults\n\nC. Are 100 or more years old\n\nD. Have not yet reached old age\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, I know that a centenarian is someone who has reached the age of 100 or more. So, option C seems like a strong candidate. But let me make sure about the other options to ensure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A says \"Were born before the centennial.\" Now, a centennial refers to a 100-year period or the celebration of a 100-year anniversary. So, if someone was born before a centennial, it would depend on which centennial we're talking about. For example, if we're talking about the centennial of a country's independence, then being born before that centennial wouldn't necessarily relate to their age now. This seems a bit vague and not directly related to their age being 100 or more. So, I think A is not the right answer.\n\nOption B says \"Study old age and older adults.\" That sounds more like gerontologists\u2014people who study aging and older adults. Centenarians aren't typically defined by their profession or area of study, so I don't think B is correct.\n\nOption D says \"Have not yet reached old age.\" Well, old age is generally considered to start around 65 or so, and centenarians are way beyond that. So, D doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct answer: Centenarians are people who are 100 or more years old.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll double-check the definition of centenarian. According to most dictionaries and sources, a centenarian is indeed a person who has reached the age of 100 years or more. So, yes, C is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
