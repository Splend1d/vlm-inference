I have these options:\n\nA. a persistent shortage of the good.\n\nB. an increase in total welfare.\n\nC. a persistent surplus of the good.\n\nD. elimination of deadweight loss.\n\nI remember that a price floor is when the government sets a minimum price for a good, right? So, it's like setting a price that can't go below a certain level. For example, minimum wage is a type of price floor for labor.\n\nNow, if the price is set above the equilibrium price, what happens? Well, at a higher price, suppliers are willing to supply more because they can get more money for each unit. But buyers might not want to buy as much because it's more expensive. So, supply increases, and demand decreases, which should lead to a surplus of the good.\n\nWait, but option A says a persistent shortage. That sounds like what happens with a price ceiling, where the price is set below the equilibrium, causing demand to exceed supply.\n\nSo, price floor should be C, a persistent surplus of the good.\n\nBut let me think about total welfare. Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. If there's a price floor above equilibrium, producer surplus increases because they get to sell at a higher price, but consumer surplus decreases because buyers pay more. So, overall welfare might not increase; there might be a deadweight loss.\n\nDeadweight loss is the loss in total welfare that occurs when the equilibrium is not achieved, right? So, if a price floor creates a surplus, that means some units that could have been traded at a lower price aren't being traded, which would be a deadweight loss.\n\nTherefore, option D, elimination of deadweight loss, doesn't seem right. In fact, it might create deadweight loss.\n\nOption B, an increase in total welfare, might not be accurate because while producers might benefit, consumers lose out, and there's possibly deadweight loss.\n\nSo, going back, it seems like C is the correct answer: a persistent surplus of the good.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nSuppose the price floor is set above the equilibrium price, which is the usual case. Suppliers want to supply more, consumers want less, so surplus.\n\nAlternatively, if the price floor is set below the equilibrium price, it's ineffective because the market will just set its own higher equilibrium price. So, only price floors above equilibrium matter.\n\nWait, but in some cases, if the price floor is below equilibrium, it doesn't affect the market, so no surplus or shortage.\n\nBut in this question, I think we're assuming the price floor is above equilibrium, which is the standard case.\n\nSo, yes, surplus is the likely outcome.\n\nTherefore, C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
