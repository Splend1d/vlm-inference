The options are:\n\nA. our relationships to noncitizens.\n\nB. consequentialist duties to promote the greatest good for the greatest number.\n\nC. membership in a legitimate self-governing community.\n\nD. nothing; we do not have special obligations to fellow citizens.\n\nI need to figure out which one Macedo thinks is the basis for our special obligations to our fellow citizens.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Macedo's argument is. I think Macedo is a political philosopher who discusses the idea of citizenship and the duties that come with it. I believe he argues that citizens have special obligations to each other because they are part of a self-governing community.\n\nLet me think about option A: our relationships to noncitizens. That seems unlikely because if anything, our obligations to noncitizens might be separate or perhaps even derivative from our obligations to fellow citizens. But Macedo is probably focusing on why we have special duties to our fellow citizens, not to noncitizens.\n\nOption B is about consequentialist duties, which aim to promote the greatest good for the greatest number. While consequentialism is a moral theory, I don't recall Macedo basing his argument on consequentialist grounds. He seems more focused on the nature of the political community and the relationships within it.\n\nOption C is membership in a legitimate self-governing community. This sounds familiar. Macedo might argue that because citizens are part of a self-governing community, they have special obligations to each other that are distinct from general moral duties to all human beings.\n\nOption D says that there are no special obligations to fellow citizens, which contradicts the premise of the question, which is that we do have special obligations to our fellow citizens.\n\nGiven this, I think the best answer is C: membership in a legitimate self-governing community. Macedo likely argues that our special obligations to fellow citizens arise from the fact that we are members of a self-governing community, where we have shared interests, institutions, and a collective decision-making process.\n\nTo confirm this, I might want to look back at some of Macedo's writings on citizenship and political obligation. He probably emphasizes the importance of the political community and the duties that come with being a member of it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he discusses the idea that in a self-governing community, citizens have duties to each other that are not owed to noncitizens, because of the shared project of self-government.\n\nI should also consider whether Macedo might be arguing from a consequentialist perspective, but I don't think that's his primary approach. He seems more concerned with the nature of the political relationship and the duties that arise from that relationship.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: membership in a legitimate self-governing community.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
