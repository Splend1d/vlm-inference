                    "text": "So I've got this question here about logical fallacies. It says: \"When someone tries to support a proposition with information that really has nothing to do with the claim being made, that person has probably committed which of the following fallacies?\" And then there are options: A. straw person, B. genetic fallacy, C. irrelevant conclusion, D. ignoratio elenchi.\n\nOkay, first off, I need to understand what each of these fallacies is. Let's start with the straw person fallacy, which is option A. A straw person fallacy happens when someone misrepresents their opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. So, it's like setting up a weak version of the argument and then knocking it down, as if you're attacking a straw dummy instead of the real thing. That doesn't seem to match the description in the question, which is about supporting a proposition with irrelevant information.\n\nNext, the genetic fallacy, option B. This is when someone argues that the origin of something determines its validity or value, regardless of the current evidence or quality. For example, saying that an idea is bad because it came from a certain person or group, without looking at the idea itself. Again, that doesn't directly relate to supporting a proposition with irrelevant information.\n\nOption C is irrelevant conclusion. This sounds promising because it mentions \"irrelevant.\" An irrelevant conclusion fallacy occurs when the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premises, or when the argument presented doesn't actually support the conclusion being drawn. This seems close to what the question is describing, but I should check the other option to be sure.\n\nOption D is ignoratio elenchi, which is a fancy Latin term. Ignoratio elenchi actually means \"ignoring of the disproof\" or more accurately, \"missing the point.\" It's when an argument distracts from the main issue by introducing irrelevant points, thereby failing to address the actual question or proposition at hand. This seems very much like what the question is describing.\n\nComparing options C and D, both seem relevant, but perhaps there's a subtle difference. Irrelevant conclusion might be more about the conclusion not following from the premises, while ignoratio elenchi is about distracting from the main issue with irrelevant points.\n\nWait a minute, I think ignoratio elenchi is specifically about presenting an argument that may be valid in itself but doesn't address the original proposition. For example, if someone is arguing about the merits of a policy, and the opponent starts talking about the politician's personal life, that's ignoratio elenchi because it diverts attention from the policy to irrelevant personal issues.\n\nOn the other hand, irrelevant conclusion might be more about the logical structure of the argument, where the premises don't support the conclusion.\n\nBut in common usage, especially in multiple-choice questions like this, ignoratio elenchi is often referred to as \"irrelevant conclusion.\" In fact, ignoratio elenchi is sometimes defined as presenting an argument that, even if valid, doesn't address the issue in question.\n\nGiven that, it seems like both C and D are pointing to the same type of fallacy, but perhaps D is more specific or classical.\n\nLooking back at the question: \"support a proposition with information that really has nothing to do with the claim being made.\" This sounds exactly like ignoratio elenchi, where someone supports their claim with irrelevant information, thus missing the point or ignoring the disproof.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. ignoratio elenchi.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's double-check the other options.\n\nStraw person (A) is about misrepresenting an opponent's argument, which isn't about introducing irrelevant information.\n\nGenetic fallacy (B) is about dismissing or accepting a claim based on its origin rather than its merit, which is different from supporting a proposition with irrelevant information.\n\nIrrelevant conclusion (C) is close, but ignoratio elenchi (D) seems to be a better fit because it directly refers to distracting from the main issue with irrelevant points.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. ignoratio elenchi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
