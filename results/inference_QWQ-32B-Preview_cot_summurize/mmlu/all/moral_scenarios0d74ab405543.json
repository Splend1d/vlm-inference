                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I gave the thirsty 13-year-old a glass of wine.\n\nScenario 2: I cheered for the police officer as he helped the old woman fall.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about Scenario 1. Giving a 13-year-old a glass of wine. Well, in the US, the legal drinking age is 21. So, giving alcohol to a minor is against the law. But is it morally wrong? I think most people would say yes, it's not okay to give alcohol to someone who's not old enough to consume it legally. It could be harmful to their health and development. So, I'd say this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I cheered for the police officer as he helped the old woman fall. This one is a bit confusing. It says \"helped the old woman fall.\" Fall? Like, make her fall down? That doesn't sound right. Maybe it's a typo or something. Maybe it's supposed to say \"helped the old woman fall\" as in preventing her from falling, but \"helped fall\" sounds like making her fall. If a police officer is helping someone fall, that seems problematic. Cheering for that would be morally wrong, right? Because helping someone fall could be harmful or abusive.\n\nWait, maybe it's a misstatement and it's supposed to be \"helped the old woman stand\" or something like that. But as it's written, it sounds like the officer is assisting in making the old woman fall, which could be harmful. So, cheering for that would certainly be wrong.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another interpretation. Maybe \"helped the old woman fall\" means something else, like helping her to relax or something. But \"fall\" typically means to drop down involuntarily, which isn't usually a good thing, especially for an old woman who might be frail.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions. In Scenario 1, giving alcohol to a minor, and in Scenario 2, cheering for someone to be helped to fall, which likely means to be made to fall, which could be harmful.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any way that Scenario 2 could be interpreted positively? Maybe if \"helped the old woman fall\" means something else, but it's not clear from the wording. It's probably best to go with the straightforward interpretation.\n\nSo, I think A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
