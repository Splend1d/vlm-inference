Let's see what each option says.\n\nOption A: \"Mothers who are living in poverty cannot afford to give their children the resources that other children enjoy.\" Hmm, this seems more like a socioeconomic issue rather than specifically about maternal deprivation. Bowlby was talking about the emotional bond between mother and child, not just about material resources. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B: \"Children deprived of an early, secure attachment to their mother are prone to suffer physically, intellectually, and socially in later life.\" Okay, this sounds familiar. Bowlby emphasized the importance of a secure attachment between the mother and the child in the early years. He believed that lacking this attachment could have negative effects on various aspects of the child's development later on. This seems like a direct statement of his thesis.\n\nOption C: \"'Mothering' is a socially constructed activity identified in the narratives of new mothers.\" This sounds more like a sociological or anthropological perspective, where practices of mothering are seen as culturally defined. Bowlby's work was more focused on psychology and the emotional needs of the child, so this doesn't align with his thesis.\n\nOption D: \"Deprivation is something children inherit, usually through their mother's side.\" This one is a bit confusing. It sounds like it's talking about inherited traits or perhaps genetic predispositions, which isn't what Bowlby was focusing on. His thesis was about the environmental experience of attachment, not about genetic inheritance.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, option B seems to be the most accurate reflection of Bowlby's maternal deprivation thesis. He argued that a lack of early, secure attachment to the mother could lead to problems in physical, intellectual, and social development later in life.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recall what I know about Bowlby's theory. John Bowlby was a psychologist who developed attachment theory, which emphasizes the importance of a primary attachment figure, typically the mother, in child development. His maternal deprivation thesis suggests that prolonged separation from the mother figure can have detrimental effects on the child's development.\n\nOption B directly ties into this idea by mentioning the deprivation of an early, secure attachment and the potential suffering in various areas of development later in life. The other options either misrepresent his ideas or talk about related but distinct issues.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
