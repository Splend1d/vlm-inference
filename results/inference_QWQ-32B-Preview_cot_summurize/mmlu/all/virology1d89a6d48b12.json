It's asking which of these options have been encouraged by viruses, meaning that viruses have played a role in bringing about these changes in our world. So, I need to consider each option and see how viruses have influenced them.\n\nOption A is \"Eradicated smallpox.\" Smallpox is a disease caused by the variola virus, which has indeed been eradicated worldwide through vaccination efforts. So, in this case, a virus led to the development of a vaccine that ultimately eradicated the disease. That seems like a direct result of viruses encouraging us to change our world.\n\nOption B is \"Eradicated polio.\" Polio is caused by the poliovirus, and while there has been significant progress in reducing polio cases worldwide, it has not been completely eradicated yet. There are still a few countries where polio remains a problem. So, perhaps this isn't entirely accurate yet.\n\nOption C is \"Increased hygiene.\" Viruses, along with bacteria, have taught us the importance of hygiene in preventing the spread of diseases. The understanding that diseases can be transmitted through poor hygiene practices has led to improvements in sanitation, handwashing, and other hygiene habits. This seems like another way viruses have encouraged us to change our world.\n\nOption D is \"A better understanding of how cellular genes aid virus replication and so become a target for new drugs.\" Studying viruses has indeed deepened our understanding of how they interact with host cells, including how they utilize cellular machinery for their replication. This knowledge has paved the way for the development of antiviral drugs that target specific steps in the viral replication process. So, this is another area where viruses have encouraged scientific advances and changes in medical approaches.\n\nNow, considering all these options, I need to choose which ones have been encouraged by viruses. Options A, C, and D seem clearly influenced by viruses. Option B is about eradicating polio, which is also caused by a virus, but it's not yet fully eradicated, so it might not fit as perfectly as the others.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is a combination of A, C, and D, as these are areas where viruses have directly encouraged changes and advancements in our world.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A, C, D} \\]"
