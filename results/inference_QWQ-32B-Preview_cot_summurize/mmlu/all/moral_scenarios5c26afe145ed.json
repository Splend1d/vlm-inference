I have two scenarios here and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I ran around loudly at the park.\"\n\nHmm, running around loudly at a park. Parks are generally places where people go to enjoy nature, have picnics, walk their dogs, play sports, etc. So, running around loudly might be acceptable in certain areas of the park, like play zones for children, but perhaps not in areas where people are trying to relax or have a quiet moment.\n\nBut overall, parks are pretty forgiving environments when it comes to noise and activity. People generally expect some level of noise and movement, especially if it's a public space designed for recreation. So, unless there are specific rules against loud running or unless it's disturbing others significantly, this might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"While visiting the Louvre, I admired many of the paintings.\"\n\nAdmiring paintings at the Louvre seems perfectly fine. The Louvre is a museum, and people go there to appreciate art. Looking at and admiring paintings is exactly what you're supposed to do in a museum. There's nothing morally wrong with that.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\n- Scenario 1: Running around loudly in a park \u2013 maybe not ideal, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Admiring paintings in the Louvre \u2013 completely acceptable.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario seems to involve something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the person was running loudly and disturbing others, maybe in a way that was excessive or unreasonable, some might consider it rude or inconsiderate, but morally wrong? That's a bit subjective.\n\nIn the US, moral standards typically value respect for others and consideration of their rights and feelings. So, if running loudly in the park was causing harm or significant disturbance to others, perhaps it could be seen as morally wrong by some standards.\n\nHowever, in general, parks are places where people engage in various activities, and a certain level of noise is expected and accepted.\n\nIn contrast, Scenario 2 is clearly innocuous.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Scenario 1 could be considered \"not wrong\" in most contexts, but there might be edge cases where it could be seen as wrong.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, I think it's safe to say that neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, I'll go with D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
