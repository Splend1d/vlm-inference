So, the question is about the Kappa Coefficient in the context of inter-scorer reliability, especially for essay tests or behavioral observation scales. Inter-scorer reliability is important when you have multiple people scoring the same thing, like essays or behaviors, to make sure they're all consistent and agreeing on the scores.\n\nNow, the Kappa Coefficient is a statistical measure that's used to assess the agreement between two raters who each categorize items into mutually exclusive categories. It's particularly useful when you're dealing with nominal data, which means data that is categorized without any intrinsic order.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Measure of agreement between 2 raters using nominal scales.\n\nB. Elapsed time in which target behaviors occur.\n\nC. Recording all behaviors with narrative description.\n\nD. Number of times target behavior occurs.\n\nOption A seems directly related to what I just explained. The Kappa Coefficient is indeed a measure of agreement between two raters who are using nominal scales. Nominal scales are categories without any particular order, like different types of behaviors or different essay topics.\n\nOption B talks about elapsed time, which sounds more related to timing how long a behavior occurs, not directly to inter-scorer reliability.\n\nOption C is about recording behaviors with a narrative description, which is more like qualitative observation, not a statistical measure of agreement.\n\nOption D is about the frequency of a behavior, which is counting how many times something happens, but again, not directly related to measuring agreement between raters.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is A. The Kappa Coefficient is a measure of agreement between two raters using nominal scales.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I understand what the Kappa Coefficient actually is. It's not just about agreement by chance; it adjusts for the agreement that would be expected by chance. So, it's a more robust measure than just percent agreement because it takes into account the probability that raters might agree by chance.\n\nFor example, if two raters are classifying essays into categories like 'excellent,' 'good,' 'fair,' and 'poor,' and they happen to agree on many essays, the Kappa Coefficient would tell us how much of that agreement is real, beyond what would be expected by chance.\n\nOther coefficients, like Cohen's Kappa, are specifically designed for this purpose. There are also versions for more than two raters, like Fleiss' Kappa.\n\nSo, in the context of essay tests or behavioral observation scales, where multiple raters might be scoring subjects into categories, the Kappa Coefficient is a crucial tool to ensure that the raters are reliably agreeing on their assessments.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Measure of agreement between 2 raters using nominal scales.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
