                    "text": "So here's this scenario: A regular customer leaves her car at an auto mechanic's shop with written instructions to check and tune up the engine, make sure the brakes are good, examine the tires, and check and repair all major systems because she's going to drive cross-country next week. She didn't see the mechanic or discuss the price or other details. When she picks up the car, there's a $5,000 bill on the dashboard, and all the services and parts seem fine, related to what she asked for. But she refuses to pay, saying there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for advance approval. The question is, can she be held responsible for these services?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because there's always an implication that the provider must get permission before doing work not approved.\n\nB. Yes, because the circumstances and past practice established an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent.\n\nC. No, because a contract cannot be based on implications and guesswork.\n\nD. Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what kind of contract this is. It seems like it's an implied contract, not a written or verbal one. Implied contracts are formed by the actions and circumstances of the parties involved, rather than explicit words or documents.\n\nGiven that she's a long-time regular customer, there might be a pattern of how things are done. Maybe in the past, she would leave instructions, and the mechanic would perform the services, and she would pay without issues. So, there could be an expectation based on prior dealings.\n\nOption A says no, because there's always an implication that the provider must get permission before doing work not approved. But in this case, she did approve the work by leaving written instructions. She didn't specify every single thing to be done, but she gave general instructions to check and tune up the engine, check brakes, tires, and major systems, and repair as necessary. So, it seems like she authorized the mechanic to perform these services, within the scope of what's typical for those tasks.\n\nOption B mentions an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent. Implied-in-law contracts, also known as quasi-contracts, are a bit different from implied-in-fact contracts. Quasi-contracts are imposed by law to prevent unjust enrichment, even if there was no actual agreement between the parties. However, in this scenario, it seems like there was an actual agreement, even if not formally documented. So, perhaps implied-in-fact contract is more appropriate.\n\nOption C says no, because a contract cannot be based on implications and guesswork. But contracts can be implied from the conduct of the parties. In fact, many service contracts are implied based on the provider performing services and the recipient accepting them. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds. This sounds plausible. The customer left instructions, which is an offer, and the mechanic performed the services, which is acceptance. The consideration is the services provided by the mechanic and the promise to pay by the customer.\n\nBut let's consider her argument that there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for advance approval. She might be arguing that the scope of the work was too broad or that the cost was excessive, and therefore, the mechanic should have sought her approval before proceeding.\n\nHowever, in the instructions, she asked to \"check and repair all major systems,\" which could encompass a lot of work, potentially leading to a high bill. She took the risk by not specifying limits or requesting an estimate beforehand.\n\nIn contract law, when one party performs services at the request of another, and the other party accepts those services, there's an implied contract to pay a reasonable amount for those services. This is especially true if there's a history of similar transactions.\n\nGiven that she's a regular customer, the mechanic might have relied on their past practice to perform the services as requested without needing explicit approval for each detail. She shouldn't be able to avoid paying for services she requested and accepted.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.\n\nOption B is close, but I think implied-in-fact contract is more appropriate than implied-in-law (quasi-contract). Quasi-contracts are used when there's no actual agreement, but here, there seems to be an actual agreement based on the instructions and the performance of services.\n\nOption A is incorrect because she did approve the work by leaving instructions. Option C is wrong because contracts can indeed be based on implications and conduct.\n\nSo, my final answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
