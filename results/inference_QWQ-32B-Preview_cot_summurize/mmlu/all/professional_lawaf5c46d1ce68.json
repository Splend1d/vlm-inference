                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a woman who owns a four-unit apartment building and she lives in one of them. One of her tenants moved out, so she put an ad in the local paper saying, \"Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred.\" Now, her preference is because she wants a mix of tenants in terms of gender and race, and the other rented units are to an African American man and a Pacific Islander woman.\n\nThe question gives us four statements and asks which one is true based on these facts. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.\" Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think the Fair Housing Act does prohibit discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, and disability. So, if she's preferring a white male, that could be seen as discriminating based on race and gender. But, she owns the building and lives in one of the units. Maybe there are some exceptions for owner-occupied buildings.\n\nOption B says: \"The woman's motive absolves her from any liability under the federal Fair Housing Act.\" So, she wants a mix of tenants, which seems like a reasonable goal, but is her method of achieving that acceptable under the law? Even if her intentions are good, does the law allow her to specify a racial or gender preference in her ad?\n\nOption C says: \"There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.\" Is it possible that nothing she did breaks any federal laws? Maybe there's an exception for small buildings or something.\n\nOption D says: \"Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.\" This seems similar to option A, but it specifically addresses the advertisement rather than her refusal to rent.\n\nLet me try to recall what the Fair Housing Act says. I believe it prohibits discrimination in housing based on certain protected characteristics, including race and gender. However, there are some exceptions, like for owner-occupied buildings with a certain number of units.\n\nIn this case, it's a four-unit building and she lives in one of them. I think the Fair Housing Act has an exception for owner-occupied buildings with up to a certain number of units. I think it's up to four units, but I'm not entirely sure. If the building qualifies for the exception, then maybe she's exempt from some provisions of the act.\n\nBut, I need to be careful here. Even if there is an exception for owner-occupied buildings, it might not cover all types of discrimination. Maybe some forms of discrimination are still prohibited even in smaller buildings.\n\nAlso, her motive is to have a mix of tenants in terms of gender and race. That seems laudable, but the way she's expressing it is by specifying \"white male preferred.\" Maybe there's a better way to achieve diversity without specifying a preference in the ad.\n\nLet me consider each option again.\n\nOption A: It says the Fair Housing Act makes it illegal to refuse to rent based on race or gender. That sounds correct, but I need to consider the exception for owner-occupied buildings.\n\nOption B: Her motive might be good, but does that excuse her from liability if she's breaking the law? I don't think so. Intent doesn't necessarily absolve someone from liability under anti-discrimination laws.\n\nOption C: Are there no violations? Maybe if the building is exempt from the Fair Housing Act due to being owner-occupied and having four or fewer units.\n\nOption D: Specifically addresses the advertisement, saying she couldn't state a racial or gender preference. Again, that sounds correct, but I need to consider the context of the building's status.\n\nI think I need to look up what the Fair Housing Act says about owner-occupied buildings. From what I recall, the exemption applies to buildings with up to four units where the owner lives in one of them. In such cases, the owner is exempt from the Fair Housing Act's provisions, but I'm not sure about the specifics.\n\nAssuming that this building qualifies for the exemption, then perhaps the woman is not violating the Fair Housing Act. But I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exemption doesn't cover racial or gender discrimination, only certain other types of discrimination.\n\nWait, I think the exemption for owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units excludes the owner from having to comply with the Fair Housing Act, but I need to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exemption only applies to certain types of discrimination, like familial status or disability, but not race or gender.\n\nI need to be careful here because I don't want to assume incorrectly.\n\nLet me think about the purpose of the Fair Housing Act.
