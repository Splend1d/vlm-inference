However, it's important to note that life expectancy can vary based on various factors such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status. For example, women generally have a higher life expectancy than men, and there are disparities in life expectancy among different racial and ethnic groups. Additionally, life expectancy has been declining in recent years due to factors such as the opioid epidemic and increases in certain chronic diseases. So, while 78 is the current average, it's essential to consider these variations and trends when discussing life expectancy in the United States."
