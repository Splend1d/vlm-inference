According to Article 1 of the convention, the state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications:\n\n1. A permanent population\n2. A defined territory\n3. Government\n4. Capacity to enter into relations with other states\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: It requires a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and a capacity to enter into foreign relations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while peaceful behavior is important in international relations, it is not a criterion for statehood as per the Montevideo Convention.\n\nOption B is incorrect because recognition by other nations is not a requirement for statehood under the Montevideo Convention, although it is often a consequence of meeting the statehood criteria.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the convention does not require \"stable and indissoluble borders.\" While defined territory is a criterion, the stability and indissolubility of borders are not specified in the convention.\n\nIt's important to note that the Montevideo Convention emphasizes that these criteria are the only ones necessary for statehood, and that the political existence of the state is independent of recognition by other states. This principle is known as \"declarative theory\" of statehood, as opposed to the \"constitutive theory,\" which holds that statehood requires recognition by other states."
