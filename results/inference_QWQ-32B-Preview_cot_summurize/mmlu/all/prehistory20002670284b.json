                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about human evolution and baby development. It's talking about the \"secondarily altricial condition\" of modern human babies. First, I need to know what \"altricial\" means. I think it refers to animals that are relatively underdeveloped and helpless at birth, needing a lot of parental care. So, \"secondarily altricial\" might mean that humans evolved to be more helpless at birth compared to our ancestors.\n\nThe question is asking which option best explains why this might have been an evolutionary solution. Let's look at each option:\n\nOption A says that the brain size of hominids hadn't grown for more than a million years, making it difficult for babies to walk. That doesn't make much sense to me. If brain size wasn't increasing, why would that affect babies' ability to walk? Plus, I thought human brain size has been increasing, especially in the last few million years.\n\nOption B says that being altricial allowed for bipedalism and independence from the mother at an earlier age. Wait, altricial means more dependency, not less. So, if babies are more helpless, they would need more care, not less. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nOption C says that being altricial allowed for further brain growth because bipedalism led to a narrower birth canal in females. Hmm, that sounds plausible. Bipedalism does require changes in the pelvis, which could make the birth canal narrower. If the baby's head can't get too big to pass through, maybe babies are born earlier, less developed, to accommodate that.\n\nOption D says that being altricial allowed the brain to grow nearly to adult size before birth because bipedalism led to a wider birth canal in females. But wait, I thought bipedalism leads to a narrower birth canal, not wider. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nLet me think again. Bipedalism does require a pelvis that's adapted for walking on two legs, which typically narrows the birth canal compared to our quadrupedal ancestors. So, if the birth canal is narrower, there's a limit to how big the baby's head can be at birth. Therefore, maybe humans are born earlier in development so that their heads are smaller and can pass through the narrower canal.\n\nThis seems consistent with option C, which says that being altricial allowed for subsequent growth of the brain since bipedalism narrowed the birth canal. So, by being born earlier, babies' heads are smaller at birth, but they can continue to grow their brains outside the womb.\n\nOption A doesn't make sense because brain size was actually increasing, not static. Option B is confusing because altriciality typically means more dependency, not less. Option D is incorrect because bipedalism narrows the birth canal, not widens it.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: it allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why being born less developed wouldn't hinder other aspects of development. Maybe there are trade-offs or other benefits.\n\nWell, one benefit is that by being born earlier, babies can continue to grow their brains outside the womb, potentially allowing for larger brain sizes than if they had to be born with fully developed brains that fit through the birth canal.\n\nAlso, human babies are born with a brain that is about 30% of its adult size, compared to other primates where babies are born with brains closer to 40-50% of adult size. This means human babies have more postnatal brain growth, which might be related to our altricial condition.\n\nMoreover, there's the concept of the \"obstetrical dilemma,\" which suggests that there's a trade-off between walking on two legs and giving birth to babies with large heads. To walk efficiently, women have a narrower pelvis, but this limits the size of the baby's head at birth. Therefore, babies are born earlier, less developed, to accommodate this.\n\nSo, overall, option C seems to align best with what I know about human evolution and the constraints of bipedalism on childbirth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
