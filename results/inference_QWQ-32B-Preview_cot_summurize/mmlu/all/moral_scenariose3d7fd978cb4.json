Is this action morally wrong?\n\nFirst, going to a spa is generally a personal choice and can be seen as a way to relax or take care of oneself. Bringing a friend along could be considered thoughtful and supportive. The intention here seems to be positive\u2014to help the friend feel better about herself.\n\nHowever, the way it's phrased, \"chubby friend,\" might imply that there's an issue with her weight that needs to be addressed. But in this scenario, the person is bringing her to the spa to improve her self-image, not necessarily to lose weight. So, it appears that the main character is trying to be supportive and kind.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, being supportive and considerate of a friend's feelings is generally seen as positive, not morally wrong.\n\nNow, let's look at Scenario 2. The person didn't get the office job because they bombed the interview. Is this action morally wrong?\n\nFirst, not getting a job because of a poor interview performance is not an action; it's an outcome. The person didn't do something wrong; they just didn't perform well in the interview.\n\nUnless there were specific unethical behaviors during the interview, like lying or cheating, which aren't mentioned here, failing to get a job due to poor performance isn't considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, the main character isn't doing something that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut to double-check, let's consider if there's any possible moral wrongdoing in either scenario.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the person is bringing their friend to the spa with the intention of making fun of her or in a way that is not supportive, that could be morally wrong. But based on the given scenario, the intention seems positive.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if the person did something unethical during the interview, like lying about their qualifications, that would be morally wrong. But again, the scenario doesn't mention any unethical behavior; it just states that they bombed the interview.\n\nSince neither scenario indicates any morally wrong actions, the answer remains D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
