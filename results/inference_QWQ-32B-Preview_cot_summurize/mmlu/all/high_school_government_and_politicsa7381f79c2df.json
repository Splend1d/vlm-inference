                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about congressional redistricting. So, we have four options here, and I need to figure out which one is true. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"The responsibility for redrawing congressional districts belongs to congressional committees.\" Hmm, I think I remember that redistricting is usually handled at the state level, not by congressional committees themselves. Maybe I'm wrong, but I recall that each state has its own process for redrawing district lines, often handled by the state legislature.\n\nOption B claims: \"It is a noncontroversial process because it has few political ramifications.\" That seems unlikely. Redistricting is often a highly political process, with parties trying to gain advantages by drawing district lines in certain ways. It's commonly associated with gerrymandering, which is a pretty controversial topic. So, I don't think this is true.\n\nOption C states: \"It occurs every 10 years to reflect changes in population according to the census.\" That sounds familiar. The census is conducted every 10 years, and redistricting is based on the census data to account for population shifts. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D says: \"The Supreme Court has ruled that legislators may not consider racial demographics when redrawing districts.\" I think I've heard something about the Supreme Court's rulings on this. I believe there are limitations on how much racial demographics can be considered in redistricting to prevent discrimination. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.\n\nAlright, let's try to recall some facts. First, redistricting is the process of redrawing the boundaries of congressional districts to account for population changes. This is important to ensure that each district has approximately the same number of people, which is a principle called \"one person, one vote.\"\n\nNow, who is responsible for redistricting? In most states, the state legislature is in charge of redrawing the district lines for both state and federal representatives. Sometimes, there are independent commissions that handle redistricting to try to remove political influence. So, option A seems incorrect because it's not congressional committees that redraw the districts, but rather state legislatures or commissions.\n\nOption B suggests that redistricting is noncontroversial with few political ramifications. That can't be right. Redistricting is often a highly politicized process because how the lines are drawn can significantly affect which party gains advantages in elections. Gerrymandering, which is the practice of drawing district lines to favor one party or group, is a major issue in many states and has been the subject of numerous legal battles.\n\nOption C says that redistricting occurs every 10 years based on the census. That aligns with what I know. The U.S. Constitution requires a census every 10 years, and the data from the census is used to reapportion congressional seats among the states and to redistrict within states. So, this seems accurate.\n\nOption D mentions a Supreme Court ruling about not considering racial demographics in redistricting. Well, the Supreme Court has indeed issued rulings related to race and redistricting. One important case is Shaw v. Reno (1993), which addressed racial gerrymandering. The Court has generally held that race cannot be the predominant factor in redistricting unless it is necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act. So, it's not that racial demographics cannot be considered at all, but there are restrictions on how they can be used.\n\nGiven all that, option C seems to be the correct statement. Redistricting does occur every 10 years based on the census to reflect population changes. The other options either misrepresent the process or attribute responsibilities incorrectly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
