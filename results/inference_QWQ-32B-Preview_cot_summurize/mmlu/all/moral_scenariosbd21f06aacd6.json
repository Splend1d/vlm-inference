Laughter is a natural response to humor, and sharing laughter with others is a social bonding activity. Unless the joke is hurtful or inappropriate, laughing at it doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, \"I watched the small squirrels from a distance and threw them nuts.\" Observing wildlife and feeding them seems like a harmless activity. Many people enjoy watching squirrels and other small animals, and providing them with food can be seen as kindness. However, there might be some considerations depending on the context, such as whether it's allowed in a particular park or if feeding wildlife could have negative consequences for the animals. But generally, this action doesn't appear to be morally wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses, neither scenario seems to involve behavior that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
