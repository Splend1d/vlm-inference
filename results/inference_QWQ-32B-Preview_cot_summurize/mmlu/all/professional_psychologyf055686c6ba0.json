                    "text": "Let's see. So, a psychologist is subpoenaed to testify at a deposition about a current therapy client. I need to figure out what this means for the psychologist. There are four options here:\n\nA. Must testify about the client as requested.\n\nB. Must appear at the deposition as requested.\n\nC. Must provide the requested documents.\n\nD. Can expect to receive a court order within 60 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a subpoena is. A subpoena is a legal document that orders someone to appear in court or at a deposition to give testimony or to produce evidence. So, if a psychologist receives a subpoena, it's a formal request from the court to either testify or provide documents.\n\nNow, considering that the psychologist is being subpoenaed to testify about a current therapy client, it seems like the main request here is for the psychologist to give testimony. So, option A says they must testify about the client as requested. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption B says they must appear at the deposition as requested. Appearing at the deposition is part of testifying, so this is also relevant.\n\nOption C says they must provide the requested documents. While subpoenas can request documents, the question specifies that the psychologist is subpoenaed to testify, which suggests that the primary request is for testimony, not necessarily for documents.\n\nOption D says they can expect to receive a court order within 60 days. I'm not sure what this means in this context. A subpoena is already a legal order, so I don't think another court order is expected within 60 days.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answers are either A or B. Let me think about the difference between A and B. Testifying involves not just appearing but also giving testimony about the client. Appearing at the deposition is a prerequisite for testifying, but the core of the request is to testify about the client.\n\nMoreover, in professional psychology, there are ethical considerations regarding client confidentiality. Psychologists are bound by ethical codes and possibly state laws that protect client privacy. So, when a psychologist receives a subpoena, they have to navigate between their legal obligations and their ethical responsibilities to protect client confidentiality.\n\nIn such cases, psychologists often take steps to protect their clients' privacy, such as seeking to quash the subpoena or seeking to limit the disclosure of information. They might also inform their clients about the subpoena and involve them in the process.\n\nHowever, the question is asking about what the subpoena means for the psychologist, not about the steps they should take in response.\n\nGiven that, I think the most direct answer is that the psychologist must testify about the client as requested. So, option A.\n\nBut let me double-check. If they receive a subpoena to testify, does that mean they must testify? Well, generally, yes, unless there are valid objections or reasons to quash the subpoena.\n\nBut the question is asking about what the subpoena means, and assuming that the subpoena stands, the psychologist would be required to testify.\n\nOption B says they must appear at the deposition as requested. Appearing is part of testifying, but testifying involves actually giving testimony.\n\nOption C is about providing documents, which might be part of the subpoena, but the question specifies that the psychologist is subpoenaed to testify about the client.\n\nOption D is unclear to me in this context.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is A: must testify about the client as requested.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
