                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about arms control. I need to identify which statement doesn't characterize arms control as a strategic policy. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Arms control is an example of cooperative security, designed to address the problems associated with the security dilemma.\" Hmm, that sounds right. Arms control often involves countries working together to limit certain types of weapons or their numbers, which can help reduce tensions and prevent arms races. So, this seems like a cooperative approach to security.\n\nOption B: \"Policies of arms control and disarmament were pursued during the Cold War in an attempt to achieve security.\" That's accurate too. During the Cold War, there were several arms control agreements between the US and the Soviet Union, like SALT I, SALT II, and INF Treaty, aimed at managing their nuclear arsenals and reducing the risk of nuclear war.\n\nOption C: \"Arms control does not challenge the central role of weaponry and military power in the international system, instead focusing on the problems produced by specific weapon systems and relationships.\" This one is a bit tricky. Arms control doesn't question the overall importance of military power in international relations; rather, it tries to manage certain aspects of it to make the system safer. So, this seems correct as well.\n\nOption D: \"After its successful application during the Cold War, arms control has retained its momentum and applicability in the contemporary security environment.\" Now, this is where I might have some doubts. While arms control was indeed successful during the Cold War in preventing nuclear conflict, I'm not sure if it has maintained the same level of momentum and applicability in today's security environment.\n\nThinking about the contemporary security landscape, there are new challenges like terrorism, cyber threats, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to non-state actors. These issues don't always fit neatly into traditional arms control frameworks, which were mostly bilateral and focused on state actors.\n\nAlso, the relationship between the US and Russia, which was central to Cold War arms control, has become more complex and strained in recent years. There have been violations of treaties, like the INF Treaty, and difficulties in negotiating new agreements.\n\nFurthermore, rising powers like China are increasingly important in global security, but they have not been as deeply involved in traditional arms control agreements.\n\nGiven these changes, it's questionable whether arms control has retained the same momentum and applicability as it had during the Cold War.\n\nComparing this with the other options, which seem accurate, I think option D is the one that doesn't characterize arms control as a strategic policy in the same way.\n\nSo, my answer would be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
