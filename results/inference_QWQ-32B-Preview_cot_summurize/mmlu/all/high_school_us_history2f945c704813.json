The quote provided gives some context about the historical treatment of immigrants in America, mentioning that even in colonial times, newcomers faced complaints and persecution. It also highlights how different groups, like the Irish and Germans in the mid-19th century, were targeted with abuse and propaganda, similar to what was happening in the early 20th century with southern and eastern Europeans.\n\nSo, the question is asking why there was a significant rise in immigration during 1880\u20131910. We have four options:\n\nA. Many Southern and Eastern Europeans turned to America for financial gain and political freedom.\n\nB. Irish farmers were forced to leave their homes due to agricultural disasters.\n\nC. Germans were seeking ways to avoid military conscription.\n\nD. The United States welcomed immigrants by providing housing and employment.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A. It mentions Southern and Eastern Europeans seeking financial gain and political freedom in America. Historically, this period saw a massive influx of immigrants from these regions, including Italians, Poles, Russians, Greeks, and others. These immigrants were often driven by economic hardships, political oppression, and persecution in their home countries. So, this seems like a plausible reason for the increase in immigration.\n\nOption B focuses specifically on Irish farmers being forced to leave due to agricultural disasters. While it's true that Ireland experienced the Great Famine in the mid-19th century, which led to mass emigration, this event primarily occurred before the time period in question (1845\u20131852). So, while Irish immigration was significant earlier on, it might not account for the sharp increase between 1880 and 1910.\n\nOption C mentions Germans seeking to avoid military conscription. While some Germans may have immigrated to the U.S. for this reason, it's not widely known as a major factor during this period. Germany did have mandatory military service, but it's unclear how significant this was compared to other motivations for immigration.\n\nOption D suggests that the U.S. welcomed immigrants by providing housing and employment. While it's true that the U.S. had opportunities for employment, especially with its growing industries and cities, there's no evidence that the government provided housing on a large scale during this period. Moreover, the quote provided indicates that immigrants faced hostility and discrimination, which contradicts the idea that they were warmly welcomed with support.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems to be the most comprehensive answer. It acknowledges the diverse backgrounds of immigrants during this period and the common motivations of seeking better economic opportunities and escaping political oppression.\n\nTo further support this, let's look at some historical context. The late 19th and early 20th centuries were marked by significant social and political changes in Europe. In southern and eastern Europe, many countries were undergoing industrialization, but this often led to economic hardship and unemployment. Additionally, political unrest, such as the rise of nationalism and socialism, as well as religious persecution, drove many to seek a better life abroad.\n\nIn the United States, the period from 1880 to 1910 coincided with rapid industrial growth, particularly in cities like New York, Chicago, and Boston. There was a high demand for labor in factories, mines, and other industries, which attracted immigrants seeking employment. The expansion of railroads and improvements in transportation also made it easier for people to travel to the U.S.\n\nFurthermore, the development of steamships reduced the cost and time of transatlantic travel, making immigration more accessible to a broader segment of the population. This technological advancement played a crucial role in the increase in immigration numbers.\n\nIt's also important to note that the U.S. had relatively open immigration policies during this time, with minimal restrictions on who could enter the country. The Naturalization Act of 1790 had limited citizenship to free white persons, but there were no significant federal laws limiting immigration until the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which targeted Chinese immigrants specifically. Therefore, for most Europeans, immigration to the U.S. was relatively unrestricted during this period.\n\nHowever, as the number of immigrants increased, so did the resistance and nativist sentiments among some segments of the American population. The quote provided reflects this tension, mentioning the \"Know-Nothings\" and their hostility towards immigrants, which parallels the attitudes expressed in the congressional reports around 1924.\n\nIn conclusion, the sharp increase in immigrants during 1880\u20131910 was primarily due to the push factors in southern and eastern Europe, such as economic hardship and political oppression, combined with the pull factors in the U.S., including employment opportunities and the promise of political freedom. Therefore, option A best accounts for this phenomenon.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
