                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question about Schopenhauer's attitude toward life. I remember that Schopenhauer was a pessimistic philosopher, so I think his view on life was pretty negative. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. He thought life was uncertain but worthwhile.\n\nWell, uncertainty is a part of life, but I don't recall Schopenhauer saying that life is worthwhile. In fact, I think he thought life was more of a burden.\n\nB. He thought life was hard but ultimately hopeful.\n\nAgain, he did think life was hard, but I don't think he saw any ultimate hope. He was pretty downbeat about the whole thing.\n\nC. He thought life was bereft of meaning.\n\nThis sounds more like it. Schopenhauer was known for his pessimism and his belief that life has no inherent meaning. He thought that people are driven by a blind will that causes suffering.\n\nD. He believed in an afterlife in which all misery vanishes.\n\nI don't think Schopenhauer believed in an afterlife like that. He was more of a realist, focusing on the suffering in this life without promising any relief beyond death.\n\nSo, based on what I know, option C seems the most accurate. Schopenhauer thought life was bereft of meaning. But to be sure, maybe I should double-check some key points of his philosophy.\n\nSchopenhauer's philosophy is centered around the idea of the \"will to live,\" which is an unconscious, irrational force that drives all living things. He saw this will as the source of all suffering because it perpetuates life and its inevitable pains and frustrations. He believed that the only way to find relief from this suffering was through negating the will, which could be achieved through asceticism or aesthetic contemplation.\n\nHe didn't really see life as worthwhile or hold out hope for improvement. He was critical of optimism and believed that suffering was an inescapable part of existence. He also didn't subscribe to the idea of an afterlife where misery vanishes; instead, he seemed to accept that life is characterized by suffering with no ultimate resolution.\n\nTherefore, his attitude toward life was that it is devoid of meaning, driven by a blind will that causes endless suffering. So, option C seems to capture that sentiment best.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider why the other options aren't fitting:\n\nOption A suggests that life is uncertain but worthwhile. While uncertainty is a given, Schopenhauer didn't view life as worthwhile. He thought that the more aware we are, the more we realize how full of suffering life is.\n\nOption B says life is hard but ultimately hopeful. Schopenhauer didn't offer much hope for improvement in life. His philosophy is more about accepting the inevitability of suffering and finding ways to transcend it, not about hoping for a better future.\n\nOption D proposes that he believed in an afterlife where all misery vanishes. Schopenhauer was more focused on this life and didn't put much stock in traditional religious concepts of an afterlife. He didn't offer comfort in a blissful hereafter; instead, he encouraged accepting reality as it is.\n\nIn conclusion, Schopenhauer's attitude toward life was that it is bereft of meaning, making option C the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
