Membership is currently confined to Latinos. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in their Congressional District.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, we have the Latino American Party, which was founded to promote the political power of Latino Americans. They have a membership that's open only to Latinos, and they require their members to vote only for the party's nominees. Recently, they expelled all non-Latino members because they felt that only Latinos could be trusted to honor that obligation. Now, the party wants to choose its own Latino candidate for governor through a mail ballot primary, along with selecting candidates for other positions.\n\nSome non-Latino citizens in the relevant congressional district are trying to get a federal court to stop the party from conducting this mail ballot primary. They're seeking an injunction to prevent it.\n\nThe question is asking what the federal court will most likely do. The options are:\n\nA. Grant relief because the primary would be proscribed by the Thirteenth Amendment.\n\nB. Grant relief because the primary would be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nC. Deny relief because the party's primary would be private action and not subject to restriction under the Constitution.\n\nD. Deny relief because a pre-primary election is not within the scope of federal election control.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's at stake here. The party is restricting its membership and its candidate selection process to Latinos only. Non-Latino citizens are objecting to this and want the court to stop it.\n\nLet's look at the amendments mentioned:\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment abolishes slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. I don't see a direct connection here to the party's actions.\n\nThe Fifteenth Amendment states that the right to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This seems more relevant because it's about voting rights and race.\n\nSo, option B suggests that the court would grant relief because the primary violates the Fifteenth Amendment. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption C says the court would deny relief because the party's primary is private action not subject to constitutional restrictions. Is that accurate?\n\nWell, political parties are considered private organizations in some respects, but their activities, especially those related to elections, can be subject to constitutional scrutiny. So, this might not hold up.\n\nOption D says the court would deny relief because pre-primary elections aren't within federal election control. But federal courts do have jurisdiction over elections, especially regarding constitutional rights like voting rights.\n\nSo, between A, B, C, and D, B seems the most likely.\n\nBut let's think deeper. The party is restricting its membership to Latinos only. Is that permissible?\n\nWell, the Supreme Court has addressed similar issues. In cases like California Democratic Party v. Jones (2000) and California Republican Party v. Jones (2000), the Court held that political parties have the right to decide who can participate in their primary elections.\n\nHowever, in other cases like Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Committee (1989), the Court has held that political parties cannot exclude members based on race.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory.\n\nLet me check Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Committee.\n\nIn Eu, the Court struck down a state law that allowed political parties to bar non-party members from voting in primary elections, but only if the party rules allowed it. The Court found that the law violated the First Amendment rights of association of the parties.\n\nBut in California Democratic Party v. Jones, the Court invalidated a California law that opened primary elections to all voters, regardless of party affiliation, because it interfered with the parties' right to associate and to exclude whom they please.\n\nHowever, in other cases, the Court has been clear that excluding people based on race is unconstitutional.\n\nFor example, in Nixon v. Herndon (1927), the Court struck down a Texas law that allowed political parties to discriminate on the basis of race.\n\nMore recently, in California Democratic Party v. Jones, the Court mentioned that political parties cannot exclude people from their primaries based on race, among other things.\n\nSo, if the Latino American Party is excluding non-Latinos based on race, that could be a problem under the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nBut, is ethnicity the same as race? Latino is an ethnic group, not a racial one, right? Wait, actually, Latino can encompass people of different races, but for the purposes of this question, I think it's being treated as a racial or ethnic category.\n\nGiven that, excluding non-Latinos might be seen as exclusion based on ethnicity, which could implicate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or the Voting Rights Act.\n\nBut the question specifically mentions the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\n\nLet me look back at the Fifteenth Amendment: \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\"\n\nSo, if the party is excluding non-Latinos based on race or color, that could violate the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nBut, is this a state action? The Fifteenth Amendment applies to state actors, not private parties.\n\nAh, that's an important point. The Fifteenth Amendment restricts the government from denying the right to vote based on race, but it doesn't directly apply to private organizations like political parties.\n\nHowever, political parties are somewhat unique because they play a integral role in the electoral process, which is a state function.\n\nSo, perhaps the exclusion based on race by the party could still be subject to constitutional scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which applies to state actors.\n\nWait, but the party is a private organization. Can it exclude whom it wants?\n\nWell, generally, private organizations can set their own membership criteria, but when it comes to activities that are integral to the electoral process, the courts might impose restrictions to prevent discrimination.\n\nAdditionally, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits racial discrimination in voting.\n\nBut the Voting Rights Act primarily applies to state actions, although it can also apply to private conduct that affects voting.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet's consider the scenario again. The party is conducting a mail ballot primary to select its candidates for various offices, including governor.\n\nNon-Latino citizens are trying to enjoin the party from conducting this primary because they are being excluded based on race or ethnicity.\n\nSo, the question is whether the party's exclusion of non-Latinos in its primary violates the Constitution, specifically the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nGiven that the Fifteenth Amendment prohibits racial discrimination in voting by state actors, and the party is a private entity, perhaps the amendment doesn't directly apply.\n\nHowever, because the primary is part of the electoral process, which is a state function, the party's actions might be subject to constitutional constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Thirteenth Amendment is relevant here. The Thirteenth Amendment abolishes slavery and involuntary servitude.\n\nBut I don't see how that applies to this situation.\n\nPerhaps the court would find that the party's actions are private and not subject to constitutional restrictions, as option C suggests.\n\nBut, considering the potential for racial discrimination, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, option D says that a pre-primary election isn't within the scope of federal election control. But federal courts do have jurisdiction over elections, especially regarding constitutional rights.\n\nI think the most plausible answer is B: grant relief because the primary would be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nEven though the party is private, the electoral process involves state action, and excluding people based on race in that context could violate the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, the court would likely grant relief to the non-Latino citizens seeking to enjoin the party from conducting the mail ballot primary in a discriminatory manner.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
