                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about finding the volume of a cube. The formula given is V = s^3, where V is the volume and s is the side length of the cube. The side length given is 2.3 centimeters. I need to find the volume in cubic centimeters and choose the correct answer from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I should make sure I understand what the formula means. The volume of a cube is equal to the side length multiplied by itself three times. So, if the side length is s, then V = s \u00d7 s \u00d7 s.\n\nGiven that s = 2.3 cm, I need to calculate 2.3 cm multiplied by itself three times.\n\nLet me do this step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 2.3 by 2.3.\n\n2.3 \u00d7 2.3 =\n\nI know that 2 \u00d7 2 is 4, and 0.3 \u00d7 0.3 is 0.09. But since both numbers are 2.3, I have to consider the decimal properly.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as (2 + 0.3) \u00d7 (2 + 0.3).\n\nUsing the distributive property:\n\n2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n\n2 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.6\n\n0.3 \u00d7 2 = 0.6\n\n0.3 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.09\n\nNow, add all these up: 4 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.09 = 5.29\n\nSo, 2.3 \u00d7 2.3 = 5.29\n\nNow, I need to multiply this result by 2.3 again to get V = 5.29 \u00d7 2.3\n\nLet me calculate 5.29 \u00d7 2.3.\n\nFirst, ignore the decimals and multiply 529 by 23.\n\n529 \u00d7 20 = 10,580\n\n529 \u00d7 3 = 1,587\n\nNow, add these two results: 10,580 + 1,587 = 12,167\n\nSince 5.29 has two decimal places and 2.3 has one decimal place, the total number of decimal places in the product should be 2 + 1 = 3 decimal places.\n\nTherefore, 5.29 \u00d7 2.3 = 12.167\n\nSo, the volume V = 12.167 cubic centimeters.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 5.29\n\nB. 6.9\n\nC. 8.027\n\nD. 12.167\n\nThe correct answer is D. 12.167\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, 2.3 \u00d7 2.3:\n\n2 \u00d7 2 = 4\n\n2 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.6\n\n0.3 \u00d7 2 = 0.6\n\n0.3 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.09\n\nTotal: 4 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.09 = 5.29. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 5.29 \u00d7 2.3:\n\n529 \u00d7 23 = (529 \u00d7 20) + (529 \u00d7 3) = 10,580 + 1,587 = 12,167\n\nWith three decimal places, it's 12.167. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the units. Since volume is in cubic centimeters, and each side is in centimeters, cubing it makes sense.\n\nAnother way to check is to see if the answer makes sense. A cube with side length 2 cm would have a volume of 8 cm\u00b3, and 2.3 is a bit more than 2, so the volume should be a bit more than 8. 12.167 is more than 8, which makes sense.\n\nAlso, option A is 5.29, which is what I got for s\u00b2, but I need s\u00b3, so that's too small.\n\nOption B is 6.9, which is also less than 8, so that can't be right.\n\nOption C is 8.027, which is just slightly more than 8, but since s is 2.3, which is 15% more than 2, the volume should be more than 15% more than 8. Let's see:\n\n1.15\u00b3 \u2248 1.52, so 8 \u00d7 1.52 = 12.16, which matches option D.\n\nSo, yes, D. 12.167 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
