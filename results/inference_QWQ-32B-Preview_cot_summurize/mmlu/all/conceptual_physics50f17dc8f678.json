When astronomers look at the light from a star, they can see specific patterns in the colors, which tell them what elements are present in the star's outer layers. It's like each element has its own unique fingerprint in the light.\n\nLet me think about the other options to make sure. Option A is the Doppler effect. I know that's about how the frequency of waves changes when there's motion involved, like when a police siren changes pitch as it passes by. So, that seems related to motion rather than identifying elements.\n\nOption B is molecular structure. That sounds more like chemistry, dealing with how atoms bond together to form molecules. But stars are made up of plasma, not molecules, so maybe that's not the right choice.\n\nOption C is temperature. Temperature does affect the color of light a star emits, but it's more about the overall color temperature, like whether it's red, yellow, or blue. It doesn't specifically tell us what elements are present, just the overall heat.\n\nSo, spectrum seems to be the most accurate answer because it allows scientists to see the specific wavelengths of light that are absorbed or emitted by different elements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
