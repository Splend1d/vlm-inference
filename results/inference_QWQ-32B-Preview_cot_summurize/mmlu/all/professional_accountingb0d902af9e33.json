                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Sussman Co. and their cash-basis financial statements for January. They've got a few activities listed, and I need to figure out how their cash-basis income for January would change if they restated things to the accrual basis. The options are A. $2,500, B. $3,700, C. $4,400, and D. $4,900.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between cash-basis and accrual-basis accounting. Cash-basis accounting recognizes revenues when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid. Accrual-basis accounting, on the other hand, recognizes revenues when they are earned and expenses when they are incurred, regardless of when the cash moves.\n\nSo, in this case, Sussman has prepared their statements on a cash basis, and I need to adjust that to accrual basis for January.\n\nLet's look at the activities:\n\n1. Credit sales of $5,600.\n\n2. Collections of $1,900 relating to January credit sales.\n\n3. Accrued salaries of $1,200.\n\nOkay, starting with credit sales. In cash-basis, they wouldn't record any revenue from credit sales until the cash is collected. But in accrual-basis, they recognize revenue when the sale is made, regardless of when the cash is collected.\n\nSo, for the $5,600 in credit sales, in accrual-basis, they would recognize $5,600 as revenue in January, even though only $1,900 was collected in January.\n\nIn cash-basis, they only recognize the $1,900 collected in January as revenue.\n\nTherefore, the difference for sales is $5,600 (accrual) - $1,900 (cash) = $3,700.\n\nSo, switching to accrual-basis would increase revenue by $3,700.\n\nNext, accrued salaries of $1,200.\n\nIn cash-basis, expenses are recognized when cash is paid. So, if they haven't paid the salaries yet, they wouldn't record the expense in January on a cash basis.\n\nBut in accrual-basis, they recognize expenses when they are incurred, so they would record the $1,200 salary expense in January, even if it hasn't been paid yet.\n\nTherefore, switching to accrual-basis would increase expenses by $1,200.\n\nNow, to find the effect on income, I need to consider both revenues and expenses.\n\nIncrease in revenue: $3,700\n\nIncrease in expenses: $1,200\n\nNet effect on income: $3,700 - $1,200 = $2,500 increase.\n\nWait, but let's double-check that.\n\nIncome = Revenue - Expenses\n\nCash-basis income: $1,900 (collected) - $0 (no expenses recorded yet) = $1,900\n\nAccrual-basis income: $5,600 (sales) - $1,200 (salaries) = $4,400\n\nDifference: $4,400 - $1,900 = $2,500 increase.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, considering only the changes:\n\nChange in revenue: +$3,700\n\nChange in expenses: +$1,200\n\nNet change in income: +$3,700 - $1,200 = +$2,500\n\nSo, the cash-basis income would increase by $2,500 when restated to accrual-basis.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. $2,500 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nIs there any other adjustment needed?\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Credit sales: accrue $5,600 revenue\n\n- Collections: already considered in the above calculation\n\n- Accrued salaries: accrue $1,200 expense\n\nAre there any other items that should be considered?\n\nThe problem mentions that these are the only activities for January, so I think that's all.\n\nTherefore, the increase in income due to restating to accrual-basis is $2,500.\n\nBut now I'm a bit confused because option C is $4,400, which is the accrual-basis income itself, not the increase.\n\nOption D is $4,900, which doesn't match anything in my calculations.\n\nOption B is $3,700, which is the increase in revenue, but that's not the net increase in income, because expenses also increase.\n\nSo, $3,700 increase in revenue - $1,200 increase in expenses = $2,500 net increase in income.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the accrual-basis income fully.\n\nIn cash-basis, income is $1,900.\n\nIn accrual-basis, income is $5,600 - $1,200 = $4,400.\n\nDifference is $4,400 - $1,900 = $2,500.\n\nSo, again, $2,500 increase.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet me try to prepare a simple income statement under both methods.\n\nCash-basis income statement:\n\nRevenue: $1,900 (collections)\n\nExpenses: $0 (no cash paid for salaries yet)\n\nIncome: $1,900\n\nAccrual-basis income statement:\n\nRevenue: $5,600 (credit sales)\n\nExpenses: $1,200 (accrued salaries)\n\nIncome: $4,400\n\nDifference in income: $4,400 - $1,900 = $2,500\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the adjustments:\n\n- To adjust from cash to accrual, add unbilled revenues and subtract unrecorded expenses.\n\nHere, unbilled revenues are the credit sales not yet collected, which is $5,600 - $1,900 = $3,700.\n\nAnd unrecorded expenses are the accrued salaries of $1,200.\n\nSo, to adjust cash-basis income to accrual-basis:\n\nCash-basis income: $1,900\n\nAdd unbilled revenues: +$3,700\n\nSubtract unrecorded expenses: - $1,200\n\nAccrual-basis income: $1,900 + $3,700 - $1,200 = $4,400\n\nAgain, the increase is $2,500.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a different approach, like using the balance sheet equation or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering the impact on retained earnings.\n\nBut I think the above approach is sufficient and correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. $2,500.\n\nBut now I'm a bit confused because the accrual-basis income is $4,400, which is option C, but the increase is $2,500, which is option A.\n\nMaybe I need to read the question again to make sure I'm answering what's being asked.\n\n\"By what amount will Sussman's cash-basis income for the month ended January 31 increase as a result of restating these activities to the accrual basis of accounting?\"\n\nSo, it's asking for the increase in income due to the restatement, which is the difference between accrual-basis income and cash-basis income.\n\nWhich, as calculated, is $2,500.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. $2,500.\n\nBut perhaps there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider if there are any other adjustments that need to be made.\n\nFor example, are there any prepaid expenses or unearned revenues that should be considered?\n\nThe problem only mentions credit sales and accrued salaries, so probably not.\n\nAlso, the collections relate to January credit sales, so it's all within January.\n\nNo mention of any beginning or ending balances that would require adjustments.\n\nTherefore, I think $2,500 is the correct increase in income.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if the accrued salaries affect the calculation differently.\n\nAccrued salaries are an expense that has been incurred but not yet paid.\n\nIn accrual-basis, you would record the expense in January, whereas in cash-basis, you wouldn't record it until paid.\n\nSo, the increase in expenses in accrual-basis is $1,200.\n\nAnd the increase in revenue is $3,700.\n\nNet increase in income is $2,500.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me by presenting options that match intermediate calculations.\n\nLike, $3,700 is the increase in revenue, $1,200 is the increase in expenses, $4,400 is the accrual-basis income, and $2,500 is the increase in income.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. $2,500.\n\nBut now I'm second-guessing because $4,400 is the actual accrual-basis income, which might be what they're asking for.\n\nWait, no, the question is \"by what amount will Sussman's cash-basis income ... increase as a result of restating these activities to the accrual basis.\"\n\nSo, it's the increase in income due to restatement, which is $2,500.\n\nBut perhaps they are asking for the accrual-basis income itself, which is $4,400.\n\nI need to read the question carefully again.\n\n\"By what amount will Sussman's cash-basis income ... increase as a result of restating these activities to the accrual basis of accounting?\"\n\nI think \"increase\" here refers to the difference between accrual-basis income and cash-basis income.\n\nSo, it's the amount by which the income increases when restated to accrual-basis.\n\nTherefore, it should be $2,500.\n\nHowever, to be absolutely sure, perhaps I should consider another approach.\n\nLet's consider the impact on the income statement line by line.\n\nCash-basis:\n\nRevenue: $1,900 (collections)\n\nExpenses: $0 (no cash paid for salaries)\n\nIncome: $1,900\n\nAccrual-basis:\n\nRevenue: $5,600 (sales)\n\nExpenses: $1,200 (salaries)\n\nIncome: $4,400\n\nDifference:\n\nRevenue: $5,600 - $1,900 = $3,700 increase\n\nExpenses: $1,200 - $0 = $1,200 increase\n\nNet income: $4,400 - $1,900 = $2,500 increase\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the concept of accruals and deferrals.\n\nIn this case, there are accrued revenues (credit sales not yet collected) and accrued expenses (salaries incurred but not yet paid).\n\nTo adjust from cash to accrual:\n\n- Add accrued revenues: $5,600 - $1,900 = $3,700\n\n- Add accrued expenses: $1,200\n\nNet adjustment: $3,700 - $1,200 = $2,500 increase in income.\n\nYes, this matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. $2,500.\n\nBut why is there an option C. $4,400, which is the accrual-basis income itself?\n\nMaybe to tempt those who misread the question and think they should select the accrual-basis income rather than the increase.\n\nTherefore, it's important to read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is A. $2,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
