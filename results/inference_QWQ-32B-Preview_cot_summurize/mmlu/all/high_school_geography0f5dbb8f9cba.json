The introduction of new languages\n\nB. The end of the Cold War\n\nC. The invasion by the Soviets\n\nD. The acceptance of many Eastern European countries into the EU\n\nFirst, I need to think about what happened in Eastern Europe over the last 25 years or so. The Cold War ended in 1991, so that's within the last quarter century. That was a big deal because it marked the end of the division between the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc.\n\nOption A is about the introduction of new languages. I don't recall any major introduction of new languages in Eastern Europe that would have caused destabilization and ethnic conflict. Languages have been around for a long time, and while language issues can be a source of conflict, I don't think introducing new languages was a significant factor in the last 25 years.\n\nOption B is the end of the Cold War. That seems plausible because the end of the Cold War led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the fall of communist governments in Eastern Europe. This period saw many countries undergoing significant political, economic, and social changes. With the collapse of central authority in some areas, old ethnic tensions resurfaced, leading to conflicts like the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s.\n\nOption C is the invasion by the Soviets. But the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, so any invasion by the Soviets would have been before that time. In the last quarter century, there hasn't been a Soviet invasion of Eastern Europe, as the Soviet Union no longer exists. So this option doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D is the acceptance of many Eastern European countries into the EU. While EU accession has brought about changes in these countries, it's generally seen as a stabilizing force. Joining the EU requires meeting certain criteria, including democratic governance and respect for human rights, which can help reduce ethnic conflicts. So, it's unlikely that EU acceptance greatly destabilized the region.\n\nConsidering these points, option B, the end of the Cold War, seems to be the factor that greatly destabilized Eastern Europe and led to ethnic conflict in the last quarter century. The power vacuum and the abrupt changes following the Cold War allowed longstanding ethnic tensions to erupt into violence in several countries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
