During its manufacturing operations, the manufacturer negligentlyallowed quantities of this substance to leak into the soil. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) orderedthat the premises, now owned by an appliance repair shop, be decontaminated. This order, and the subsequent cleanup efforts, received a high level of attention in the local media. An employee of the appliance repair shop has sued the manufacturer in negligence for damages for emotionaldistress. The employee claims to have suffered the distress as a consequence of learning that she has beenexposed for five years, while employed by the appliance repair shop at the premises affected by the EPA order,to the toxic contamination that has existed there. Her complaint does not allege that her emotional distress issevere, that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous, or that she has suffered any physicalconsequences. In that action the manufacturer has filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief maybe granted. What is the manufacturer's best argument in support of that motion?\n\nA.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out the best argument for the manufacturer in this case. So, there's a manufacturer that used a toxic chemical in their motors and negligently let it leak into the soil. The EPA ordered the premises to be decontaminated, and now an employee of the appliance repair shop that owns the premises is suing the manufacturer for emotional distress because she thinks she was exposed to the toxin for five years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the employee is claiming. She's saying she's suffering emotional distress just because she knows she was exposed to the toxic substance, but she's not claiming that her distress is severe, or that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous, or that she has any physical symptoms. So, her complaint is only about emotional distress based on her knowledge of exposure.\n\nThe manufacturer is moving to dismiss the case, saying that the employee hasn't stated a valid claim. I need to find the best argument for why the claim shouldn't hold up.\n\nOption A says that the employee's emotional distress isn't alleged to be severe. Maybe in some cases, for emotional distress claims, the distress has to be severe. I think in negligence claims for emotional distress, the distress might need to reach a certain threshold, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll keep this in mind.\n\nOption B says that the complaint doesn't allege that the manufacturer's conduct was extreme and outrageous. Now, I know that for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the conduct needs to be extreme and outrageous. But here, the employee is suing for negligence, not intentional tort. So, maybe this isn't relevant.\n\nOption C says that the complaint doesn't allege any physical consequences. In some jurisdictions, for a negligence claim based on emotional distress, the plaintiff might need to show some physical manifestation or impact. I think sometimes, courts require that there be some physical injury accompanying the emotional distress to make it compensable. So, this could be a possible argument.\n\nOption D says that the employee's proper remedy is against the repair shop, the current occupier of the premises. This suggests that the repair shop might be liable for whatever condition exists on the premises, and perhaps the manufacturer isn't responsible anymore because the premises have changed hands.\n\nLet me think about this. The manufacturer negligently allowed the toxin to leak into the soil. The EPA ordered decontamination, and now the premises are owned by the repair shop. The employee is claiming exposure while working at the repair shop.\n\nFirst, was the manufacturer negligent in allowing the toxin to leak? It seems so. The EPA ordered decontamination, which implies that there was contamination that needed to be cleaned up.\n\nNow, the employee is claiming emotional distress based on her belief that she was exposed to the toxin. She doesn't claim any physical harm, just emotional distress from knowing about the exposure.\n\nIn negligence claims for emotional distress, there are usually requirements. One common requirement is that there be some physical impact or manifestation of the emotional distress. This is sometimes called the \"physical impact rule.\" So, if the employee isn't alleging any physical consequences, that might be a problem for her claim.\n\nAlso, sometimes courts require that the emotional distress be severe enough to be compensable. If the complaint doesn't allege that the distress is severe, that could be an issue.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps the manufacturer could argue that any liability for the condition of the premises passed to the repair shop when they bought the property. So, if there are issues with the premises now, it's the repair shop's responsibility, not the manufacturer's.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the manufacturer was the one who caused the contamination through their negligence, so maybe they can't completely escape liability just because the property changed hands.\n\nI think the strongest argument for the manufacturer would be that the complaint doesn't allege any physical consequences, which might be required for a negligence claim based on emotional distress.\n\nSo, option C seems like the best argument.\n\nWait, but option A also mentions that the emotional distress isn't alleged to be severe. Maybe both A and C are relevant, but C might be more directly related to negligence claims.\n\nI should check if there's a requirement in negligence claims for emotional distress to show severity or physical consequences.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, for a negligence claim involving emotional distress, the plaintiff must show either a physical impact or a physical manifestation of the emotional distress. Sometimes, severity of the distress is also a factor.\n\nGiven that, option C seems particularly relevant because the complaint doesn't allege any physical consequences.\n\nOption A, about the distress not being severe, might also be relevant, but perhaps to a lesser extent.\n\nOption B, about the conduct being extreme and outrageous, seems more relevant to intentional infliction of emotional distress, not negligence.\n\nOption D suggests that the employee should sue the repair shop instead, but that might not necessarily invalidate her claim against the manufacturer, especially since the manufacturer was the one who caused the contamination.\n\nTherefore, the manufacturer's best argument for dismissal would be that the complaint doesn't allege any physical consequences, which may be required for a negligence claim based on emotional distress.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
