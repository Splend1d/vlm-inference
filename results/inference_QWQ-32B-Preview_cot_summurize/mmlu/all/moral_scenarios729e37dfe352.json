                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is a CIA agent who feels it's their duty to undermine their own country for the benefit of foreign powers. Now, the CIA is an intelligence agency of the United States, and its primary role is to collect and analyze information about foreign governments, organizations, and individuals to help protect national security. So, if someone is working for the CIA, their job is to serve and protect the United States.\n\nBut in this scenario, the agent is saying they need to undermine their own country for foreign powers. That sounds like espionage or treason, which are serious crimes in the US. Helping foreign governments against your own country is generally considered morally wrong because it puts the safety and interests of the US at risk.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character stops at a red light. This is a standard traffic rule in the US. Stopping at red lights helps ensure safety on the roads and prevents accidents. Following traffic laws is expected behavior and is generally seen as responsible and morally acceptable.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves actions that are against the law and harmful to the country, which would be considered morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves following the law and acting responsibly, which is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
