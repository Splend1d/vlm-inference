                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a lawsuit where the plaintiff is trying to get life insurance money, and the big question is when the insured person was born. We need to figure out which piece of evidence can't be used to prove the insured's correct date of birth.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: A family portrait engraved with the ages of the family members.\n\nHmm, a family portrait with ages engraved sounds interesting. If it has the ages of the family members, maybe it can give us an idea of how old the insured was at the time the picture was taken. But to determine the exact date of birth, we'd need more specific information. Ages alone don't tell us the exact birth date; they just tell us how old someone was at a particular time. So, this might not be directly helpful for proving the exact date of birth.\n\nOption B: A family bible with the insured's birth date inscribed on the cover.\n\nNow, a family bible is often considered a reliable source for important family dates, like births, marriages, and deaths. If the insured's birth date is inscribed on the cover, that seems like it could be a direct piece of evidence indicating when they were born. People often record such events in bibles, and it's usually done around the time the event occurs. So, this seems pretty admissible to prove the date of birth.\n\nOption C: A photocopy of the insured's birth certificate.\n\nA birth certificate is a official document that records a person's birth, including the date and place. It's probably the most straightforward and reliable proof of someone's date of birth. However, the question is about a photocopy. Now, in many legal contexts, photocopies of official documents might not be accepted unless they meet certain requirements, like being certified copies. But generally, a birth certificate, even if it's a photocopy, could still be considered evidence of the date of birth, especially if it's from a reliable source. So, this seems admissible as well.\n\nOption D: A sworn affidavit from the insured's brother verifying the insured's birth date.\n\nAn affidavit is a written statement sworn under oath, and it can be used as evidence in court. If the insured's brother is swearing to the insured's birth date, that could be considered hearsay, which is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception. However, in some jurisdictions, affidavits from family members may be accepted, especially if there's no reason to doubt their credibility. So, this could also be admissible.\n\nNow, looking back, the question is asking which of these is inadmissible to prove the insured's correct date of birth.\n\nOption A seems the weakest in terms of proving the exact date of birth because ages on a portrait don't specify the actual birth date; they just indicate how old someone was at a particular time. The other options\u2014 the family bible, the birth certificate photocopy, and the affidavit from the brother\u2014 all purport to provide direct information about the birth date.\n\nTherefore, I think option A, the family portrait engraved with the ages of the family members, is the least admissible piece of evidence for proving the insured's correct date of birth.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
