I need to pick the one that's a rodent. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that rodents are a group of mammals that are known for their teeth, specifically their incisors, which grow continuously and need to be worn down by gnawing. They're the largest group of mammals, and they include animals like mice, rats, squirrels, and others.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Bat - I think bats are mammals, but they're not rodents. I believe bats are in a group called Chiroptera. They're known for being able to fly. So, probably not a rodent.\n\nB. Wolverine - Hmm, wolverines are mammals too. I think they're related to weasels or something like that. I'm not sure, but I don't think they're rodents. Maybe they're in the Mustelidae family or something similar.\n\nC. Beaver - Now, beavers. I'm pretty sure beavers are rodents. They have those big teeth that they use to chew through wood, and they build dams and stuff. That sounds like typical rodent behavior.\n\nD. Koala - Koalas are marsupials, right? They carry their young in a pouch. They're native to Australia, and they mainly eat eucalyptus leaves. Definitely not a rodent.\n\nSo, based on what I know, the beaver is the rodent among these options.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Sometimes, there might be exceptions or things I'm not remembering correctly.\n\nBats: Definitely not rodents. They're flying mammals.\n\nWolverines: I think they're in the weasel family, which is part of the Carnivora order, not Rodentia.\n\nBeavers: Yes, they're in the Rodentia order, family Castoridae.\n\nKoalas: Marsupials, as I recall, which are a different infraclass from placentals like rodents.\n\nSo, yeah, the beaver is the rodent here.\n\nJust to make sure, I can remember that rodents have characteristics like ever-growing incisors that they need to gnaw on things to wear down. Beavers definitely do that with their large front teeth.\n\nAlso, rodents are known for their reproductive capabilities and are found in various environments.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Beaver.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
