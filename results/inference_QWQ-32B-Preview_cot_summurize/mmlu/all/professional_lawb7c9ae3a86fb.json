                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure this out. So, we have two cousins who own a piece of real estate together as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. That means that when one of them dies, the surviving cousin automatically gets the entire property, right? No need for probate or anything like that.\n\nNow, the first cousin decided to use his interest in the property as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note, which was later entered as a judgment against his interest in the real estate.\n\nA year later, the first cousin dies, and the second cousin wants to sell the property. But the mortgagee\u2014the person who lent the money\u2014files a lawsuit to stop the sale and enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin argues that any lien on the first cousin's interest was extinguished by the first cousin's death because of the right of survivorship.\n\nSo, the question is: Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.\n\nHmmm, I'm not sure about this. Just because one joint tenant incurs a lien, does that mean the other joint tenant somehow agrees to it? That seems unfair.\n\nB. Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\n\nThis seems plausible. Maybe the lien against one tenant's interest changes the nature of the ownership, breaking the joint tenancy.\n\nC. No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.\n\nThis is interesting. Maybe the action of one joint tenant can't affect the rights of the other without their consent.\n\nD. No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, and the joint tenancy was still fully intact.\n\nThis seems to suggest that nothing changed the joint tenancy, so the right of survivorship should apply fully.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what happens when a joint tenant encumbers their interest with a lien or mortgage?\n\nIn most jurisdictions, the right of survivorship remains intact even if one joint tenant has a lien or mortgage on their interest. So, when the first cousin died, the second cousin should have taken ownership of the entire property by virtue of the right of survivorship.\n\nBut, there's a lien on the first cousin's interest. Does that lien survive the death of the first cousin and attach to the property owned by the second cousin?\n\nThis is tricky. Some laws might provide that liens against a joint tenant's interest can continue even after their death, affecting the surviving tenant's interest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lien is extinguished upon the death of the joint tenant because the right of survivorship causes the surviving tenant to own the entire property free of the deceased tenant's liabilities.\n\nI recall that in some legal systems, joint tenancies are vulnerable to being severed by certain actions, like one tenant mortgaging their interest. Maybe that's relevant here.\n\nOption B suggests that a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and the right of survivorship. If that's the case, then when the first cousin mortgaged his interest, the joint tenancy was severed, and the co-ownership changed to a tenancy in common.\n\nIn a tenancy in common, each owner has a separate interest that can be sold or encumbered independently, and there's no right of survivorship. So, if the joint tenancy was severed, then when the first cousin died, his interest would pass according to his will or intestacy laws, not directly to the second cousin.\n\nIf the joint tenancy was severed, then the mortgagee's lien would attach to the first cousin's interest, and upon his death, the lien might attach to the heir or beneficiary who inherits that interest.\n\nBut in this scenario, the second cousin claims that the joint tenancy was still intact, implying that the right of survivorship applied, and he now owns the entire property.\n\nSo, did the mortgage or judgment lien sever the joint tenancy?\n\nI need to check the law on this. In many jurisdictions, certain actions by one joint tenant can sever the joint tenancy, converting it into a tenancy in common.\n\nCommon actions that sever a joint tenancy include:\n\n1. One tenant mortgaging their interest.\n\n2. One tenant selling their interest to a third party.\n\n3. A court ordering a partition of the property.\n\n4. A unilateral declaration by one tenant to abandon joint tenancy in favor of tenancy in common.\n\nSo, if mortgaging the interest severs the joint tenancy, then the right of survivorship no longer applies, and the first cousin's interest would pass according to his estate, subject to the lien.\n\nIn that case, when the first cousin died, his interest in the property, subject to the lien, would pass to his heirs or as directed by his will.\n\nBut in this scenario, the second cousin claims that the joint tenancy was still intact, meaning the right of survivorship applied, and he now owns the entire property.\n\nIf the joint tenancy was severed, then the second cousin doesn't automatically own the entire property; instead, he owns his original share, and the first cousin's share passes separately, subject to the lien.\n\nWait, but in option D, it says that the joint tenancy was still fully intact, implying that the right of survivorship applied, and the second cousin owns the whole property.\n\nBut if the mortgage or lien severs the joint tenancy, then option D wouldn't hold true.\n\nSo, does mortgaging one's interest in a joint tenancy sever the joint tenancy?\n\nI think it does in many jurisdictions. Therefore, the joint tenancy may have been severed when the first cousin mortgaged his interest.\n\nIf the joint tenancy was severed, then upon the first cousin's death, his interest in the property passes according to his will or intestacy laws, subject to the lien.\n\nTherefore, the second cousin doesn't automatically own the entire property by right of survivorship; instead, he owns his original share, and the first cousin's share is handled separately.\n\nIn that case, the mortgagee's lien would still attach to the first cousin's interest, and the mortgagee could enforce his interest against whoever inherits that interest.\n\nBut in this scenario, the second cousin is trying to sell the property, presumably as the sole owner.\n\nSo, if the joint tenancy was severed, and the first cousin's interest passes separately, but the second cousin is trying to sell the entire property, there might be a cloud on title or some dispute over ownership.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second cousin claims to own the entire property via the right of survivorship, but if the joint tenancy was severed, that might not be the case.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me consider option A: Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.\n\nI'm not sure about this. Why would the second cousin's assent be presumed? Did he do anything to indicate agreement to the lien? It doesn't seem like it from the scenario.\n\nSo, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption B: Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\n\nThis aligns with what I was thinking earlier. If the mortgage severs the joint tenancy, then the right of survivorship is destroyed.\n\nOption C: No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.\n\nThis seems like a stretch. Is it unconstitutional for one joint tenant to encumber their own interest? Probably not. Joint tenants have the right to dispose of their own interest, subject to the rules of the joint tenancy.\n\nOption D: No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.\n\nThis would be true only if the joint tenancy was not severed by the mortgage or lien.\n\nGiven all this, I think the key is whether the mortgage or lien severs the joint tenancy.\n\nIf it does, then the right of survivorship doesn't apply, and the first cousin's interest passes separately, subject to the lien.\n\nIf it doesn't sever the joint tenancy, then the right of survivorship applies, and the second cousin owns the entire property free of the lien.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, mortgaging one's interest in a joint tenancy does sever the joint tenancy, converting it to a tenancy in common.\n\nTherefore, option B seems most correct: Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\n\nThis means that the mortgagee's lien would still attach to the first cousin's interest, and upon his death, the lien would attach to whoever inherits that interest.\n\nThus, the mortgagee could enforce his interest against the estate or heirs of the first cousin, but not directly against the second cousin's interest.\n\nHowever, since the second cousin is trying to sell the property, and there might be a dispute over whether the joint tenancy was severed, the mortgagee might have grounds to intervene in the sale.\n\nAlternatively, if the joint tenancy was severed, the second cousin might only own his original share, and the first cousin's share is subject to the lien.\n\nBut in practice, this could get messy, with potential claims from the mortgagee against the first cousin's estate and possibly against the property itself.\n\nGiven all this, I think the court would likely enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property, at least to the extent of the first cousin's interest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
