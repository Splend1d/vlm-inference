The options are Homo habilis, Ardipithecus ramidus, Homo sapiens, and Australopithecus robustus.\n\nFirst, I recall that tool use is a significant milestone in human evolution, often linked to the development of larger brains and more complex behaviors.\n\nHomo habilis is often called \"Handy man\" because it's associated with the earliest known stone tools. That seems promising. Maybe the answer is A, Homo habilis.\n\nBut wait, Ardipithecus ramidus is an even older species, dating back to around 4.5 million years ago. I think there was some discussion about possible tool use in Ardipithecus, but I'm not sure if that's widely accepted.\n\nHomo sapiens, of course, are modern humans, who certainly use tools, but we're way down the line in terms of evolution. So option C seems too recent.\n\nAustralopithecus robustus is an extinct species that lived around 1.2 to 1.8 million years ago. I think they were more known for their robust build and possible herbivorous diet. I'm not sure if they're directly associated with tool use.\n\nLet me think again about Homo habilis. I remember from my anthropology class that Homo habilis lived around 2.8 to 1.5 million years ago and is credited with the earliest stone tools, known as the Oldowan industry.\n\nBut hold on, there have been some recent findings suggesting that tool use might predate Homo habilis. For example, in 2015, researchers found stone tools in Kenya dating back to 3.3 million years ago, which is before the emergence of Homo habilis. That makes me question whether Homo habilis was indeed the first to use stone tools.\n\nArdipithecus ramidus lived around 4.4 million years ago, and while there is some speculation about possible tool use based on bone markings, there isn't concrete evidence of stone tool manufacture.\n\nGiven that, maybe the answer is still Homo habilis, as the most established early tool user, even if there is some evidence suggesting earlier tool use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I know that tool use predates Homo habilis, in which case, maybe Ardipithecus ramidus could be considered.\n\nBut considering that Homo habilis is traditionally credited with the first stone tools, and the other options seem less likely, I'll go with A, Homo habilis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
