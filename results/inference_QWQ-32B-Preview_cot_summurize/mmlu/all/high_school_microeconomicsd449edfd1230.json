                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which statement is true about equilibrium in a purely competitive market for good X. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"A shortage of good X exists.\" I know that in equilibrium, supply equals demand, so there shouldn't be a shortage. Shortages happen when quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied, which is not the case at equilibrium. So, I think A is not correct.\n\nOption B says: \"The quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied of good X.\" That sounds familiar. In my economics class, I learned that equilibrium is where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. So, this seems like a likely correct answer.\n\nOption C says: \"A surplus of good X exists.\" Similar to option A, a surplus occurs when quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded, which again isn't the case at equilibrium. So, I don't think C is correct.\n\nOption D says: \"The government regulates the quantity of good X produced at the market price.\" In a purely competitive market, one of the key features is that there's no government intervention. Firms are price takers, and the market determines the price and quantity. So, I don't think D is correct either.\n\nBased on this, I believe that option B is the correct answer because equilibrium is defined as the point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
