                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about a famous radio personality who also voiced Shaggy on the cartoon 'Scooby-Doo'. The options are Rush Limbaugh, Casey Kasem, Larry King, and Howard Stern. I need to figure out which one of these personalities was associated with voicing Shaggy.\n\nFirst, I know that 'Scooby-Doo' is a popular animated TV series that has been around for a long time, and it features a character named Shaggy Rogers, who is Scooby-Doo's best friend and a member of the Mystery Inc. gang.\n\nNow, thinking about the voice actors for Shaggy, I recall that there have been different actors who have voiced Shaggy over the years, especially since the show has been ongoing for decades with various iterations and productions.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Rush Limbaugh - He's a conservative radio personality known for his political talk show. I don't think he's involved in voice acting for cartoons.\n\nB. Casey Kasem - He was a well-known radio personality, especially for hosting \"American Top 40,\" where he counted down the most popular songs in the US. I think I've heard somewhere that he was involved with 'Scooby-Doo.'\n\nC. Larry King - He was a famous talk show host, known for his interview show \"Larry King Live\" on CNN. While he was a prominent figure in media, I don't recall him being associated with 'Scooby-Doo.'\n\nD. Howard Stern - He's a shock jock and radio personality known for his provocative talk show. I don't think he's involved with voicing characters in family cartoons.\n\nGiven this, it seems like Casey Kasem is the most likely candidate. I think he voiced Shaggy in some iterations of 'Scooby-Doo.' But to be sure, maybe I should look up some information about the voice actors for Shaggy.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that Casey Kasem did indeed voice Shaggy in various 'Scooby-Doo' series from the 1960s through the 1980s. He was the original voice of Shaggy in the classic 'Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!' and continued to voice him in subsequent series like 'The New Scooby-Doo Movies,' 'Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics,' and others.\n\nSo, based on this information, the correct answer should be B. Casey Kasem.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that there have been other voice actors who have portrayed Shaggy in more recent iterations of the franchise, such as Matthew Lillard, who voiced Shaggy in the live-action films and some animated series from the 2000s. But given the time frame and the context of the question, which seems to be referring to a radio personality, Casey Kasem is the most appropriate answer.\n\nAdditionally, Casey Kasem was not only a radio personality but also had a career in voice acting, providing voices for various cartoon characters beyond Shaggy. So, his involvement in 'Scooby-Doo' aligns with both his radio career and his work in animation.\n\nIn conclusion, the famous radio personality who was also the voice of Shaggy on 'Scooby-Doo' is Casey Kasem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
