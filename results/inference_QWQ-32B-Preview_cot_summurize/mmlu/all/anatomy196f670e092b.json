                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out where an enlarged submandibular salivary gland would be palpable. So, first, I need to recall some anatomy. The submandibular gland is one of the major salivary glands in the mouth. There are three pairs: parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands.\n\nThe submandibular gland is located beneath the lower jaw, specifically under the mandible. It's called submandibular because it's below the mandible. Now, since it's located under the jaw, I'm thinking about where I can feel it.\n\nOption A says it should be palpable intraorally, which means inside the mouth. Option B says extraorally, meaning outside the mouth. Option C says both, and Option D says only detectable by radiographical examination.\n\nLet me think about this. The submandibular gland has a duct that opens inside the mouth, under the tongue, so part of it might be accessible intraorally. But since it's mainly located under the jaw, perhaps it's more palpable extraorally.\n\nI remember that during a physical exam, doctors sometimes palpate the salivary glands. For the submandibular gland, I think they palpate both inside and outside the mouth. So, maybe option C is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. Intraorally, you can feel the floor of the mouth, and the submandibular gland is located there, deep to the mylohyoid muscle. So, it should be palpable intraorally to some extent. Extraorally, you can feel it just below the jawbone, in the submandibular triangle.\n\nSo, it seems likely that an enlarged submandibular gland would be palpable both intra- and extraorally. Option C makes sense.\n\nOption D says it's only detectable by radiographical examination, which seems unlikely because salivary glands can be felt manually, especially if they are enlarged.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. To be palpable both intra- and extraorally.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
