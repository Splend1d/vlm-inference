                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about therapeutic cloning. It says, \"In therapeutic cloning, the goal is to...\" and then gives options A through D. I need to choose the correct purpose of therapeutic cloning.\n\nFirst, I should recall what therapeutic cloning is. I remember that cloning involves creating a copy of something, and in biology, it often refers to creating copies of organisms or their cells. Therapeutic cloning, specifically, is different from reproductive cloning, which aims to create a complete organism, like a baby.\n\nSo, option A says, \"produce and raise a child.\" That sounds like reproductive cloning, not therapeutic cloning. Therapeutic cloning is not about creating a new individual; it's about generating cells or tissues for medical purposes. So, I think A is incorrect.\n\nOption B mentions \"go down a slippery slope.\" I'm not sure what this means in the context of cloning. \"Slippery slope\" is a term often used in arguments to suggest that one step will lead to a series of negative consequences. It doesn't seem directly related to the goal of therapeutic cloning, so I'll likely skip this one.\n\nOption C says, \"treat disease.\" This rings a bell. I think therapeutic cloning is aimed at producing cells or tissues that can be used to treat diseases or injuries. For example, it could involve creating stem cells that match a patient's genetic makeup, which could then be used to repair damaged tissues without the risk of rejection by the immune system.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above.\" Given that C seems plausible, I don't think D is the right choice.\n\nLet me think again. Therapeutic cloning typically involves creating embryonic stem cells that are genetically identical to the donor's cells. These stem cells can then be directed to differentiate into specific cell types that could be used to treat various diseases, such as Parkinson's, diabetes, or spinal cord injuries.\n\nSo, the primary goal is indeed to treat disease by providing personalized cells for therapy. That makes option C the correct answer.\n\nI should also consider why the other options are incorrect. Option A is wrong because therapeutic cloning doesn't aim to create a new individual; it's about generating cells for treatment. Option B is unclear and doesn't seem relevant to the purpose of therapeutic cloning. Option D is incorrect because option C is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: treat disease.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
