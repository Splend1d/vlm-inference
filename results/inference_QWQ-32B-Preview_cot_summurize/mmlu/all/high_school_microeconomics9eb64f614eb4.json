Firms earn long-run economic profits.\n\nB. P = MR = MC = ATC.\n\nC. Firms spend money to differentiate and advertise their products.\n\nD. In the long run, the market is allocatively efficient.\n\nOkay, first I need to recall what monopolistic competition is. I think it's a market structure where there are many firms and many customers, and firms sell products that are somewhat different from each other. So, it's like a combination of monopoly and competition.\n\nLet me look at option A: Firms earn long-run economic profits. In perfect competition, in the long run, firms only earn normal profits, meaning economic profits are zero because of free entry and exit. In monopoly, firms can earn economic profits in the long run because of barriers to entry. Now, in monopolistic competition, there are few barriers to entry, so I think firms won't earn economic profits in the long run. So, maybe A is not true.\n\nOption B: P = MR = MC = ATC. Hmm, in perfect competition, in the long run, P = MC = ATC, and P = MR because the demand curve is horizontal. But in monopolistic competition, firms have some market power because their products are somewhat unique, so their demand curve is downward sloping, meaning P > MR. Also, in the long run, I think P > MC, and ATC is not necessarily equal to P. So, B doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C: Firms spend money to differentiate and advertise their products. Yeah, that sounds familiar. In monopolistic competition, firms try to make their products stand out from others by differentiating them through features, branding, advertising, and so on. So, they do spend money on differentiation and advertising to attract customers. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D: In the long run, the market is allocatively efficient. Allocative efficiency occurs when P = MC, meaning the price equals the marginal cost. In perfect competition, this happens in the long run, but in monopolistic competition, since P > MC, the market isn't allocatively efficient. So, D seems incorrect.\n\nBased on this, I think option C is the correct statement about monopolistic competition. Firms do spend money to differentiate and advertise their products to gain a competitive edge in the market.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
