                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this law problem. So, there's a traveler who checked into a hotel, and while he was in his room watching TV, a thief broke in, hit him, and stole his wallet. The traveler got hurt and had to stay in the hospital for three days. The lock on the room door met the local standards, which means it was up to code.\n\nNow, the traveler is suing the hotel for his injuries and the loss of his wallet. I need to decide which option is correct: A, B, C, or D.\n\nOption A says the traveler will prevail if the lock was defectively designed. But the problem says the lock complied with the local ordinance, which means it was designed according to the standards set by the local government. So, if it's up to code, it probably wasn't defectively designed. Maybe A isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B says the traveler will prevail because he was a business visitor on the hotel's property. Hmm, I think in law, a business visitor is someone who is on the property for the mutual benefit of themselves and the owner. In this case, the traveler is staying at the hotel, so yes, he's a business visitor. But does that mean the hotel is automatically liable for what happened?\n\nI remember that hotels have a duty to protect their guests from foreseeable harms, especially in their rooms. So, if a thief breaks in and causes harm, is that something the hotel should have prevented?\n\nOption C says the traveler won't prevail because the thief's act was an intervening cause. An intervening cause is like an event that happens after the initial action and contributes to the harm. In this case, the hotel provided a lock that met the standards, but the thief still managed to pick it. So, the thief's action might be considered an intervening cause that the hotel couldn't have anticipated or prevented.\n\nOption D says the traveler won't prevail if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock. The problem states that the lock complied with the local ordinance, which prescribes minimum security standards. So, it seems like the hotel did use reasonable care by following the local standards.\n\nBut, I'm a bit confused. If the hotel followed the standards, does that mean they're not liable for what happened? Or do they have a higher duty to protect their guests?\n\nLet me think about this differently. The traveler was injured in his room by a third party\u2014 the thief. In premises liability, the owner has a duty to protect invitees from third-party actions if those actions are foreseeable.\n\nSo, is theft and violence in hotel rooms foreseeable? It seems like it could be, especially depending on the location of the hotel.\n\nBut the lock met the local standards, so maybe the hotel did everything required by law to secure the room.\n\nWait, the problem says the lock complied with a local ordinance that prescribed minimum security standards for hotel locks. So, the hotel was following the law.\n\nDoes that mean they're not liable for the traveler's injuries and losses?\n\nOption A says the traveler will prevail if the lock was defectively designed. But if it met the local standards, maybe it wasn't defectively designed.\n\nOption B says the traveler will prevail because he was a business visitor. But just being a business visitor doesn't automatically mean the hotel is liable; they have to have breached their duty of care.\n\nOption C says the traveler won't prevail because the thief's act was an intervening cause. Maybe the thief's action breaks the chain of causation, meaning the hotel isn't responsible for what the thief did.\n\nOption D says the traveler won't prevail if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock. Since the lock met the local standards, it seems like the hotel used reasonable care.\n\nI think between C and D, D might be a better answer because it directly relates to the hotel's due diligence in selecting the lock.\n\nBut wait, if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock, does that absolve them of all liability? Or do they still have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their guests?\n\nMaybe I need to consider if the local ordinance relieves the hotel of liability. If the lock meets the minimum standards set by the ordinance, perhaps the hotel can't be held liable for failing to provide greater security.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the hotel has a higher standard of care owed to its guests, beyond just the minimum required by law.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, hotels have a higher duty to protect guests from foreseeable harms, especially in their rooms.\n\nSo, even if the lock met the minimum standards, maybe the hotel still could be liable if it's found that a better lock could have prevented the injury.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention anything about better locks or industry best practices; it only says the lock met the local standards.\n\nPerhaps, by complying with the local ordinance, the hotel has fulfilled its legal obligation, and therefore, the traveler won't prevail in the lawsuit.\n\nSo, option D seems plausible: the traveler won't prevail if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock.\n\nBut option C says the traveler won't prevail because the thief's act was an intervening cause.\n\nI need to understand the difference between C and D.\n\nAn intervening cause is an event that occurs after the defendant's action and contributes to the harm.\n\nIn this case, the hotel provided a lock that met the standards, but the thief still managed to break in and cause harm.\n\nSo, the thief's action could be seen as an intervening cause that the hotel couldn't have anticipated or prevented, especially since they complied with the law.\n\nBut, if the thief's action was foreseeable, then maybe the hotel still has liability.\n\nWait, the lock met the local standards, which suggests that the ordinance expects that such locks will provide adequate security.\n\nTherefore, if a thief picks the lock despite it meeting the standards, maybe it's not foreseeable that such an event would occur, given that the hotel followed the law.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hotel has a non-delegable duty to ensure the safety of its guests, and therefore, even if the lock was up to code, they could still be liable for the guest's injuries.\n\nBut, in reality, locks can be picked, and no lock is completely foolproof.\n\nSo, maybe the hotel can't be held liable for every possible theft or assault that occurs in a guest's room, especially if they've taken reasonable steps to secure the room as per local regulations.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: the traveler won't prevail if the hotel used reasonable care in selecting the lock.\n\nOption C is also tempting, but I think D is more directly related to the hotel's conduct and the standards they were required to meet.\n\nI should also consider that the traveler lost his wallet, which was stolen by the thief.\n\nIn terms of property loss, is the hotel liable for theft that occurs in a guest's room, even if the lock was up to code?\n\nProbably not, because guests are responsible for their own belongings, and hotels typically have disclaimer notices about keeping valuables safe.\n\nBut in this case, the traveler also suffered personal injuries from being hit over the head.\n\nSo, it's not just about the stolen wallet; there's also bodily harm involved.\n\nPerhaps the hotel could be liable for the traveler's injuries if they failed to provide adequate security, but since the lock met the local standards, maybe they've fulfilled their obligation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there were other security measures the hotel could have taken, such as having security personnel patrol the halls or installing peepholes in the doors.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention anything about those factors; it only focuses on the lock complying with the local ordinance.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it seems that the hotel used reasonable care by complying with the local standards, and thus, the traveler won't prevail in his claim.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
