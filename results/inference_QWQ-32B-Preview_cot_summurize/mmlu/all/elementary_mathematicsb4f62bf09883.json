                    "text": "So I have this multiplication problem: 2,816 multiplied by 7. I need to find the correct answer among these options: A. 14,572; B. 14,672; C. 19,612; D. 19,712. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I could try to multiply 2,816 by 7 directly. I'm a bit rusty on multiplying larger numbers, but I think I can manage it step by step. Let's break it down.\n\nStarting with the units place: 6 times 7 is 42. So, I'll write down 2 and carry over 4.\n\nNext, the tens place: 1 times 7 is 7, plus the carried-over 4 makes 11. So, I'll write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: 8 times 7 is 56, plus the carried-over 1 makes 57. Write down 7 and carry over 5.\n\nFinally, the thousands place: 2 times 7 is 14, plus the carried-over 5 makes 19. So, I'll write down 19.\n\nPutting it all together, it should be 19,712. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me try a different method to verify. Maybe I can use estimation to see if my answer makes sense. 2,816 is close to 3,000, and 3,000 times 7 is 21,000. But 2,816 is less than 3,000, so the product should be less than 21,000. 19,712 seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the distributive property to break it down further. Let's see:\n\n2,816 can be broken into 2,000 + 800 + 16.\n\nThen, multiply each part by 7:\n\n2,000 times 7 is 14,000.\n\n800 times 7 is 5,600.\n\n16 times 7 is 112.\n\nNow, add those products together: 14,000 + 5,600 is 19,600, plus 112 is 19,712. Okay, that matches my first calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's try another method. Maybe I can use multiplication by parts.\n\nConsider 2,816 as 2,800 + 16.\n\n2,800 times 7 is 19,600.\n\n16 times 7 is 112.\n\nAdding them up: 19,600 + 112 = 19,712. Again, the same result.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options, option D is 19,712, which matches my calculations. But I see that option C is 19,612, which is close but differs by 100. Maybe someone made a small mistake in adding.\n\nLet me check my addition again: 14,000 + 5,600 is indeed 19,600, and 19,600 + 112 is 19,712. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator if I had one, but since this is a pencil-and-paper test, I have to do it manually.\n\nAnother way to check is to perform the division to see if 19,712 divided by 7 gives me back 2,816.\n\nLet's try dividing 19,712 by 7.\n\n7 goes into 19 two times (14), subtract to get 5. Bring down 7 to make 57.\n\n7 goes into 57 eight times (56), subtract to get 1. Bring down 1 to make 11.\n\n7 goes into 11 one time (7), subtract to get 4. Bring down 2 to make 42.\n\n7 goes into 42 six times (42), subtract to get 0.\n\nSo, 19,712 divided by 7 is indeed 2,816. That confirms my multiplication.\n\nWait, but I see that option C is 19,612. Let's see what 19,612 divided by 7 is.\n\n19 divided by 7 is 2, remainder 5.\n\nBring down 6 to make 56.\n\n7 goes into 56 eight times, no remainder.\n\nBring down 1 to make 1.\n\n7 goes into 1 zero times, remainder 1.\n\nBring down 2 to make 12.\n\n7 goes into 12 one time, remainder 5.\n\nSo, 19,612 divided by 7 is 2,801.714..., which is not 2,816. That shows that 19,612 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 19,712, which is option D.\n\nBut just to be extra sure, let me check the multiplication once more.\n\n2,816 times 7:\n\n6 times 7 is 42, write 2, carry 4.\n\n1 times 7 is 7, plus carry 4 is 11, write 1, carry 1.\n\n8 times 7 is 56, plus carry 1 is 57, write 7, carry 5.\n\n2 times 7 is 14, plus carry 5 is 19, write 19.\n\nSo, 19,712. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. It's D. 19,712.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
