                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics question. So, we're trying to figure out which list contains only policies that will close an inflationary gap. An inflationary gap happens when the economy's total spending is more than what the economy can produce at full employment, leading to inflation. So, to close this gap, we need policies that will reduce total spending or increase production capacity.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each policy does:\n\n1. **Increase the money supply**: This typically leads to lower interest rates, which can stimulate borrowing and spending. So, it increases total spending, which would exacerbate an inflationary gap, not close it.\n\n2. **Decrease the money supply**: This usually raises interest rates, making borrowing more expensive and thus reducing spending. This should help to decrease total spending and help close an inflationary gap.\n\n3. **Run a federal budget deficit**: This means the government is spending more than it's earning in taxes. This increases total spending in the economy, which again would worsen an inflationary gap.\n\n4. **Increase taxes**: This reduces individuals' and businesses' disposable income, leading to less spending. So, it should help reduce total spending and close an inflationary gap.\n\n5. **Reduce government spending**: This directly decreases total spending in the economy, which is helpful in closing an inflationary gap.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n**A. Increase the money supply; run a federal budget deficit.**\n\n- Both of these policies increase total spending, which would make an inflationary gap worse, not better. So, this can't be the right answer.\n\n**B. Decrease the money supply; run a federal budget deficit.**\n\n- Decreasing the money supply helps reduce spending, which is good for closing the gap. But running a budget deficit increases spending, which is bad for closing the gap. So, this list contains both helpful and unhelpful policies.\n\n**C. Decrease the money supply; increase taxes; reduce government spending.**\n\n- Decreasing the money supply reduces spending.\n\n- Increasing taxes reduces disposable income and thus spending.\n\n- Reducing government spending directly decreases total spending.\n\nAll three of these policies are aimed at reducing total spending, which should help close an inflationary gap.\n\n**D. Increase the money supply; increase taxes; reduce government spending.**\n\n- Increasing the money supply increases spending.\n\n- Increasing taxes decreases spending.\n\n- Reducing government spending decreases spending.\n\nSo, this list has one policy that increases spending and two that decrease it. Therefore, it contains a policy that wouldn't help close the inflationary gap.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C seems to be the correct answer because all the policies in that list are aimed at reducing total spending, which is what you need to do to close an inflationary gap.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's make sure there isn't any confusion about the effects of these policies.\n\n- **Money supply**: Decreasing it raises interest rates, making borrowing more expensive and thus reducing investment and consumer spending.\n\n- **Taxes**: Increasing taxes reduces disposable income, leading to less consumption.\n\n- **Government spending**: Reducing it directly decreases total spending in the economy.\n\nAll of these actions should help to reduce aggregate demand, thereby helping to close an inflationary gap.\n\nOption A and B both include policies that increase spending, which is counterproductive for closing an inflationary gap. Option D has one policy that increases spending, which again is not helpful.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C: Decrease the money supply; increase taxes; reduce government spending.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
