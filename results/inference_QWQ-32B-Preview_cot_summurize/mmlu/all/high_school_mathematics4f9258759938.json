Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the \"ones digit\" is. It's just the last digit of the product, right? So, if I multiply all these numbers together, what will be the last digit of the result.\n\nOne way to approach this is to calculate the entire product and see what the last digit is. Let's try that.\n\nStart with 1: 1\n\nMultiply by 2: 2\n\nMultiply by 3: 6\n\nMultiply by 4: 24, so last digit is 4\n\nMultiply by 5: 4 times 5 is 20, so last digit is 0\n\nMultiply by 6: 0 times 6 is 0\n\nMultiply by 7: 0 times 7 is 0\n\nMultiply by 8: 0 times 8 is 0\n\nMultiply by 9: 0 times 9 is 0\n\nSo, the last digit is 0. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way to figure this out without calculating the entire product, especially since the numbers are small, but it might help for larger products.\n\nI recall that when you multiply numbers, the last digit of the product depends only on the last digits of the numbers being multiplied. So, I can look at the last digit of each number in the product:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nNow, multiply these last digits together and find the last digit of the result.\n\nBut wait, that's essentially what I did earlier. Is there a pattern or a shortcut here?\n\nI notice that one of the numbers is 5, and another is 2. When you multiply 5 and 2, you get 10, which has a last digit of 0. Then, multiplying any number by 0 gives 0. So, as soon as I have a 0 in the product, the entire product's last digit will be 0.\n\nThat seems like a faster way to think about it. So, if there's a 5 and a 2 in the multiplication, their product will introduce a 0, and that 0 will propagate through the rest of the multiplications.\n\nTherefore, the ones digit must be 0.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 0 is the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the product being 9 factorial, since \\(9! = 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1\\), which is the same as the given product. I know that 9! is 362880, and indeed, the ones digit is 0.\n\nSo, multiple ways to confirm that the answer is C. 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
