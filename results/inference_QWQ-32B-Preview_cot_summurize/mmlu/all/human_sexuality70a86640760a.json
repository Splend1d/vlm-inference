It's important to remember that everyone's experiences and ways of learning about sexuality can vary greatly. However, based on general trends and studies, it's likely that many girls learn about masturbation through a combination of sources, including self-discovery, discussions with peers, and accessing information through media or educational resources.\n\nIt's crucial to promote accurate and positive information about sexuality and masturbation, emphasizing consent, safety, and personal comfort. If you have more questions or need further information on this topic, I'm here to help.\n\n**Note:** This response is intended to provide a general perspective and should not be considered exhaustive or representative of all individuals' experiences."
