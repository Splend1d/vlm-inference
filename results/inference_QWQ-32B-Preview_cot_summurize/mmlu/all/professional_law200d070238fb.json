                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the constitutionality of a newly created agency to prevent gasoline price gouging. The agency has seven members: four appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. It's authorized to issue rules interpreting existing federal regulations and to issue \"cease and desist\" orders against retail gasoline sellers who intentionally engage in price gouging. Violations of these orders can lead to fines and imprisonment.\n\nWe need to identify the strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency from the given options:\n\nA. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.\n\nB. Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.\n\nC. Congress may not delegate enforcement of a federal law in any governmental body other than the U.S. Attorney General or the courts.\n\nD. Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.\n\nFirst, let's understand the constitutional principles involved here. The U.S. Constitution establishes a system of separation of powers among the three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial. Congress, as the legislative branch, makes the laws, while the executive branch enforces them, and the judicial branch interprets them.\n\nOne key principle related to this is the non-delegation doctrine, which holds that Congress cannot delegate its lawmaking powers to another branch of government or to administrative agencies. However, over time, the Supreme Court has allowed a degree of delegation as long as Congress provides an intelligible principle to guide the agency's exercise of authority.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A:** \"Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.\"\n\nThis touches on the non-delegation doctrine. Agencies often have the authority to interpret existing laws and regulations, as this is part of their role in implementing and enforcing the laws. As long as Congress provides adequate guidance, this delegation is generally permissible. So, while there might be some concerns, this isn't necessarily the strongest argument against the agency's authority.\n\n**Option B:** \"Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make 'cease and desist' orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.\"\n\nThis is more serious because it involves the agency having quasi-judicial powers. Agencies can issue cease and desist orders, but the question is whether they should have the power to impose penalties like fines and imprisonment. Traditionally, the power to impose criminal penalties is reserved for the judicial branch, through courts following due process.\n\nIf an agency can issue orders that, if violated, lead to criminal penalties, it could be seen as overstepping the bounds of the separation of powers. This seems like a strong constitutional argument.\n\n**Option C:** \"Congress may not delegate enforcement of a federal law in any governmental body other than the U.S. Attorney General or the courts.\"\n\nThis is a broad statement. While the Attorney General and the Department of Justice play a significant role in enforcing federal laws, it's not accurate to say that Congress can only delegate enforcement to them or the courts. In reality, many federal agencies have enforcement powers for the specific areas they regulate. For example, the SEC enforces securities laws, the EPA enforces environmental laws, and so on.\n\nTherefore, this argument seems too sweeping and not aligned with current practice and likely not a strong constitutional argument.\n\n**Option D:** \"Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.\"\n\nThis relates to the appointment powers within the executive branch. Typically, members of independent agencies are appointed by the President, often with the advice and consent of the Senate. Having Congress appoint members directly, especially a minority, could potentially raise questions about the independence and impartiality of the agency.\n\nHowever, in practice, there are instances where Congress has a role in appointments, such as the Senate's advice and consent role. But having the Speaker of the House appoint a member might be less common and could be seen as undermining the separation of powers.\n\nWhile this is a valid concern, it may not be as directly problematic as granting the agency the power to impose criminal penalties.\n\nComparing options B and D, option B seems to present a stronger constitutional argument because it\u6d89\u53ca\u5230agency\u884c\u4f7f\u672c\u5e94\u7531\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u95e8\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5211\u4e8b\u5904\u7f5a\u6743\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u76f4\u63a5\u89e6\u78b0\u4e86\u5206\u79bb\u6743\u529b\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002\u6388\u4e88\u673a\u6784\u53d1\u5e03\u505c\u6b62\u4ee4\u7684\u6743\u529b\uff0c\u8fdd\u53cd\u8be5\u4ee4\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f5a\u6b3e\u548c\u76d1\u7981\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7acb\u6cd5\u548c\u884c\u653f\u673a\u6784\u7684\u6743\u9650\uff0c\u4fb5\u5165\u4e86\u53f8\u6cd5\u9886\u57df\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u5baa\u6cd5\u53cd\u5bf9\u7406\u7531\u662fB: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make \"cease and desist\" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
