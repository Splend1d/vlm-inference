                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Academic skepticism. So, Augustine is making a claim about what Academic skepticism is, and we have four options to choose from. I need to figure out which one correctly describes Augustine's view.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Academic skepticism is. Academic skepticism was a school of thought in Ancient Greece that was founded by Arcesilaus and Carneades. They were known for their skeptical approach, questioning the possibility of certain knowledge. So, they were doubters, always questioning whether we can truly know anything for certain.\n\nNow, Augustine was a philosopher and theologian from the early Christian period. He engaged with various philosophical traditions, including skepticism. So, his view on Academic skepticism would be interesting to explore.\n\nOption A says that Augustine claims Academic skepticism is true and can be proven. Hmm, if Academic skepticism is about doubting the possibility of certain knowledge, and Augustine says it's true and can be proven, that seems contradictory. Because if skepticism is about doubt, how can it be proven? That doesn't make much sense.\n\nOption B says it's true but cannot be proven. Well, that seems more plausible. If Academic skepticism is about the limits of knowledge, perhaps Augustine thinks it's true that we can't have certain knowledge, but that this truth can't be proven itself. That seems consistent with skeptical positions.\n\nOption C says it's false but cannot be refuted. So, according to this, Academic skepticism is incorrect, but Augustine couldn't provide a refutation for it. That's an interesting position, but I'm not sure if that aligns with Augustine's thoughts.\n\nOption D says it's false and can be refuted. This would mean Augustine thinks Academic skepticism is incorrect and he can provide arguments against it.\n\nTo decide between these options, I need to think about Augustine's overall philosophical stance. Augustine was a Christian philosopher who sought to reconcile faith and reason. He valued knowledge and truth, so embracing skepticism, which casts doubt on the possibility of knowledge, might not align with his goals.\n\nGiven that, option A seems unlikely because it suggests that Augustine accepts skepticism as true and provable, which contradicts his pursuit of certain knowledge through faith and reason.\n\nOption B might be possible if Augustine saw some merit in skepticism but recognized its self-defeating nature\u2014since skepticism doubts everything, including itself, it can't be proven.\n\nOption C suggests that skepticism is false but can't be refuted. That might reflect a situation where Augustine thinks skepticism is wrong, but he can't definitively disprove it.\n\nOption D seems plausible if Augustine thought he could refute skepticism and show it to be false.\n\nConsidering Augustine's commitment to seeking truth and his belief in the possibility of knowledge through faith and reason, he is likely to view skepticism as problematic. Therefore, he might consider skepticism false and possibly refutable.\n\nBut to be precise, I need to recall specific statements Augustine made about skepticism. Unfortunately, I don't have immediate access to his works, but based on his general philosophy, I can make an educated guess.\n\nGiven that, I think option D is the most likely: Augustine claims that Academic skepticism is false and can be refuted. He probably saw skepticism as a position that can be challenged and overcome through his philosophical and theological arguments.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious because Augustine was also known for his nuanced approach to philosophical questions. He might have acknowledged the challenges posed by skepticism while ultimately rejecting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Augustine thought skepticism was true but couldn't be proven, which is option B. But that seems inconsistent with his overall project of establishing certain knowledge through faith and reason.\n\nAlternatively, option C suggests that skepticism is false but cannot be refuted. That might imply that Augustine thought skepticism was incorrect but that its claims were too vague or self-protective to be refuted directly.\n\nBut again, given Augustine's assertive stance in his writings, I suspect he would have tried to refute skepticism if he thought it was false.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option D: Augustine claims that Academic skepticism is false and can be refuted.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
