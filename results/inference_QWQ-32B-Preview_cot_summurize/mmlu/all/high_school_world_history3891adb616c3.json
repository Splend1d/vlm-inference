                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn fact, the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres was this, that the deed was done by a subject race \u2014 by black men who dared to shed the blood of their masters, and that of poor helpless ladies and children. Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\nA. was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\nB. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\nC. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\nD. seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\n"

                    "text": "So I'm looking at these two passages about the Cawnpore Massacre during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The first one is from a British journalist named William Howard Russell, and the second is from a historian named Rudrangshu Mukherjee. They seem to have different perspectives on the event.\n\nIn Russell's account, he describes the massacre as particularly aggravating because it was carried out by a subject race\u2014by Indians against British women and children. He mentions that it was a servile war, a war of religion, race, and revenge. It sounds like he's emphasizing the betrayal and the shock that British subjects would turn against them, especially in such a violent manner.\n\nOn the other hand, Mukherjee's passage seems to provide a different context. He talks about violence being an essential component of British rule in India and how the British had a monopoly on violence as part of their authority. The rebellion in 1857 challenged this monopoly by using violence against the British. Mukherjee also mentions that the British viewed Indians as inferior, almost like animals, which was part of their justification for ruling them.\n\nSo, when the question asks about the second passage's view on the Cawnpore Massacre, it's important to see how Mukherjee frames it. He doesn't directly discuss the massacre, but he does talk about the rebellion in general and the use of violence against the British.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Says that the massacre was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms. I don't recall Mukherjee mentioning anything about military customs or norms, so this might not fit.\n\nB. Views the massacre as a reaction to the systemic brute force used by the British in governing India. This seems plausible because Mukherjee talks about the British monopoly on violence and the hierarchical arrangement of races, with Indians being treated as inferior. So, perhaps the massacre was a response to that systematic oppression.\n\nC. Praises the massacre as a brave patriotic act against British colonial oppression. While Mukherjee does mention that the rebellion was about Indians trying to shake off foreign rule and reestablish their own power, he doesn't explicitly praise the massacre.\n\nD. Sees the massacre as the result of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy. Again, Mukherjee doesn't mention anything about the planning or timing of the massacre.\n\nGiven this, option B seems to align best with Mukherjee's perspective. He discusses the systematic nature of British violence and oppression, and how the rebellion, including the use of violence against the British, was a challenge to that system.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look back at Mukherjee's words. He says, \"the revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized.\" This suggests that the violence was a direct response to the British violence and their monopoly on it.\n\nHe also mentions that \"the bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.\" This indicates that the British were treated with a certain reverence or fear because of their perceived superiority, which was based on race.\n\nFurthermore, he states that \"power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence.\" So, the rebellion, including the massacre, can be seen as a reaction against this systematic use of violence to maintain control.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to capture this idea that the massacre was a reaction to the systemic brute force of British governance.\n\nOption C is tempting because Mukherjee does talk about the rebellion being about national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, but he doesn't explicitly praise the massacre. He's providing a historical analysis rather than a moral judgment.\n\nOption A isn't supported by the text, as there's no mention of local military customs or comparisons to Western norms.\n\nOption D also isn't supported, as there's no discussion of the planning or conspiracy behind the massacre.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B: can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
