                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this legal problem. It's about a defendant charged with involuntary manslaughter due to a vehicular homicide. There was a grand jury hearing where witnesses were subpoenaed, including the defendant. During the grand jury, a witness was asked if it's true that 20 minutes after the accident, he told the police that the defendant's car went through a red light. The witness said yes. Later, at the defendant's trial, the prosecutor wants to introduce the witness's statement from the grand jury hearing, and the defendant's attorney objects.\n\nI need to decide whether the objection will be granted or denied, and choose between options A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a grand jury is and how it relates to trial proceedings. A grand jury is a group of people empaneled to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to indict someone and proceed to trial. It's a preliminary hearing to screen accusations. The rules of evidence are more relaxed in grand jury proceedings compared to trials.\n\nIn this case, a witness testified before the grand jury that 20 minutes after the accident, he told the police that the defendant's car went through a red light. Now, the prosecutor wants to use this statement at the trial.\n\nThe defendant's attorney is objecting to the introduction of this statement. I need to consider why he's objecting and whether the objection is valid.\n\nOption A says the objection will be granted because the statement is hearsay not within any recognized exception. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the witness is testifying about what he told the police, which is an out-of-court statement. If the prosecutor is trying to prove that the defendant's car did go through a red light, then yes, this would be hearsay.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions to the hearsay rule that allow this statement to be admitted. For example, if it's considered a present sense impression or an excited utterance, it might be admissible. But in this scenario, it was 20 minutes after the accident, which might be too late for those exceptions.\n\nOption B says the objection will be granted because the questioning of the witness was leading. Leading questions are those that suggest the answer or guide the witness's testimony. In grand jury proceedings, leading questions are generally allowed, especially by the prosecuting attorney. So, even if the question was leading, that might not be a valid basis for objection at trial.\n\nOption C says the objection will be denied because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the witness's testimony was hearsay. This touches on the idea of preservation of objections. In many jurisdictions, objections not raised at the earlier proceeding might be waived, meaning they can't be raised later.\n\nHowever, hearsay is a fundamental evidentiary issue, and sometimes, even if not objected to earlier, it can still be raised at trial.\n\nOption D says the objection will be denied because the defendant's attorney did not object at the grand jury hearing that the questioning was leading. Again, leading questions are generally allowed in grand jury proceedings, so even if they weren't objected to, it might not affect the admissibility at trial.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the main issue is whether the witness's statement is hearsay and whether it falls under any exception.\n\nThe statement is: \"20 minutes after the accident, you told the police that the defendant's car went through the red light.\" This is the witness testifying about what he told the police, which is an out-of-court statement.\n\nIf the prosecutor is offering this to prove that the defendant's car went through the red light, then it's hearsay. There doesn't seem to be an exception that applies here, especially since it's a statement made 20 minutes after the event, which might not qualify as a present sense impression or an excited utterance.\n\nTherefore, option A seems plausible.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's any other basis for the objection. Option B mentions leading questions, but as I said, leading questions are generally allowed in grand jury proceedings.\n\nOption C suggests that because the defendant's attorney didn't object at the grand jury hearing to hearsay, the objection is waived. But in many jurisdictions, hearsay objections can be raised at any time because it goes to the admissibility of evidence.\n\nSimilarly, option D regarding leading questions seems less relevant because leading questions are permitted in grand jury proceedings.\n\nTherefore, I think the most appropriate answer is A: the objection will be granted because the statement is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps the statement could be considered as a statement against interest or something else, but it doesn't seem to fit those categories.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is being offered for a different purpose, not to prove that the defendant ran the red light, but for some other reason, like to show the witness's state of mind or something like that. But the question specifies that the prosecutor is seeking to introduce the statement to prove that the defendant's car went through the red light.\n\nTherefore, it seems clear that the statement is hearsay and doesn't fall under any exception, so the objection should be granted.\n\nI think A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
