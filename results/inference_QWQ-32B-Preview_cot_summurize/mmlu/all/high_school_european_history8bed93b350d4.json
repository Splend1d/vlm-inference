In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.\n\u2014John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559\nWhich of the following religions that started around the same time as Calvinism was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here that's asking about a religion that started around the same time as Calvinism, and it was destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism. The options are Huguenots, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and Anabaptists. I need to figure out which one of these fits the description.\n\nFirst, I need to recall when Calvinism started. I think John Calvin was a major figure in the Protestant Reformation, and he lived in the 16th century, around the 1500s. So, any religion that started around the same time would also be in that era.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Huguenots: I know that Huguenots were French Protestants, and they followed Calvinist theology. So, they are related to Calvinism, but I'm not sure if they were destroyed for supporting adult baptism and pacifism.\n\nB. Lutherans: Lutherans were started by Martin Luther, another key figure in the Protestant Reformation. Lutherans are known for their beliefs based on Luther's teachings, but I don't recall them being destroyed for adult baptism and pacifism.\n\nC. Presbyterians: Presbyterians are also associated with Calvinism, particularly through the works of John Knox in Scotland. Again, I don't think they were destroyed for those specific beliefs.\n\nD. Anabaptists: Now, Anabaptists are a group that emerged during the Reformation, and I think they are known for their beliefs in adult baptism and pacifism. Anabaptism emphasizes believer's baptism, meaning baptism should be performed only on those who have confessed their faith, not on infants. Also, many Anabaptist groups advocate for non-resistance or pacifism, meaning they refuse to participate in warfare.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the Anabaptists are the group that fits the description in the question. They were indeed persecuted and \"destroyed\" in various ways during that period for their beliefs, which included adult baptism and pacifism.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about the other options again:\n\n- Huguenots are French Calvinists, and while they faced persecution, their core beliefs align more with Calvinism, which doesn't emphasize adult baptism.\n\n- Lutherans, founded by Martin Luther, also don't emphasize adult baptism; they practice infant baptism.\n\n- Presbyterians, influenced by Calvinism, also practice infant baptism, not adult baptism.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits the criteria of supporting adult baptism and pacifism and being destroyed for these beliefs is the Anabaptists.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Anabaptists.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
