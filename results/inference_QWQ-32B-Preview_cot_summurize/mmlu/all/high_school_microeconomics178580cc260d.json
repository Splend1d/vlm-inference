                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about economics. So, the question is: \"Economics is a social science that...\" and we have four options to choose from. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"is primarily concerned with money.\" Now, money is certainly a big part of economics\u2014after all, it's a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Economists study how money affects transactions, inflation, and overall economic health. But is it the primary concern of economics? I'm not so sure. Economics seems to be about more than just money.\n\nOption B says: \"is primarily concerned with how resources are used.\" Hmm, this sounds familiar. I recall that economics deals with the allocation of scarce resources among competing uses. Scarcity is a fundamental concept in economics, and how societies decide what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom to produce it are central questions in the field. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption C states: \"relies solely on the scientific method for analysis.\" Economics does use scientific methods, including data collection, statistical analysis, and modeling, to test hypotheses and theories. However, the term \"solely\" might be too restrictive. Economists also use theoretical frameworks, qualitative analysis, and sometimes even thought experiments. So, while science is a big part of economics, it might not be the only approach.\n\nOption D says: \"is primarily concerned with maximizing spiritual well-being.\" This one seems a bit off track. Economics is generally associated with material well-being, such as production, consumption, and distribution of goods and services. Spiritual well-being is more related to fields like psychology, religion, or philosophy. While some might argue that economic well-being can contribute to overall happiness, which might include spiritual aspects, it's not the primary focus.\n\nComparing all these options, option B seems the most accurate. Economics is indeed primarily concerned with how resources are used, given their scarcity and the diverse needs and wants of society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
