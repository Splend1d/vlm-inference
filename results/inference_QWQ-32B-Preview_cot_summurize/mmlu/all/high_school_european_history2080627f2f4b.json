                    "text": "Let's see. This passage is from Elie Wiesel, who's a Holocaust survivor and he's talking about how he feels about the current generation of Germans in relation to the Holocaust. So, the question is asking what we can infer about Wiesel's beliefs regarding the current generation of Germans based on this passage.\n\nFirst, he says, \"I have never believed in collective guilt.\" That means he doesn't think that just because some Germans in the past did terrible things, all Germans, including those living now, are guilty. So, that rules out option A, which says they share their ancestors' guilt.\n\nHe also says, \"Only the guilty were guilty.\" Which reinforces that he believes guilt is personal and not passed down through generations.\n\nThen he says, \"Children of killers are not killers but children.\" So again, he's making a distinction between the actions of past generations and the current generation. They are not responsible for what their ancestors did.\n\nBut, he does say, \"But we may\u2014and we must\u2014hold it responsible, not for the past, but for the way it remembers the past.\" So, he's saying that the current generation has a responsibility in how they remember the past, not for what their ancestors did.\n\nHe goes on to say, \"And for what it does with the memory of the past.\" So, it's about what they do with that memory, how they handle it, and perhaps how they ensure that such things don't happen again.\n\nHe also mentions that remembering helps \"vanquish the ghosts that hover over its history\" and that it can help \"traumatize the living.\" So, it's important for Germans to remember properly to move forward and not repeat the mistakes of the past.\n\nLastly, he says, \"We remember Auschwitz and all that it symbolizes because we believe that, in spite of the past and its horrors, the world is worthy of salvation; and salvation, like redemption, can be found only in memory.\"\n\nSo, memory is key for salvation and redemption.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Shared their ancestors' guilt for the Holocaust.\n\nWe've already seen that Wiesel doesn't believe in collective guilt, so this isn't correct.\n\nB. Had a responsibility to remember the Holocaust.\n\nThis seems to align with what he's saying. He believes that the current generation has a responsibility in how they remember the past and what they do with that memory.\n\nC. Shared in the responsibility for the Holocaust.\n\nThis sounds similar to sharing guilt, which Wiesel doesn't support. He's clear that only the guilty are guilty, and current generations aren't responsible for the actions of their ancestors.\n\nD. Had no responsibility where the Holocaust was concerned.\n\nBut he does say that they have responsibility, just not for the past actions, but for remembering the past and what they do with that memory.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the best fit. Wiesel believes that the current generation of Germans has a responsibility to remember the Holocaust, not to carry the guilt of their ancestors, but to ensure that the memory is handled properly and that lessons are learned from it.\n\nIt's important to note that Wiesel is not assigning guilt to the current generation, but he is assigning them the task of remembering and learning from the past.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
