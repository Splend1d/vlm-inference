                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about fixed action patterns in animals. It says: \"A behavioral response called a fixed action pattern shown by animals...\"\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to remember what a fixed action pattern is. From what I recall, it's a type of innate behavior that's consistent and doesn't change much in response to the environment. It's something that animals do automatically, without having to learn it.\n\nOption A says: \"occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit off. If it's a fixed action pattern, shouldn't it happen the first time the animal encounters the stimulus, especially if it's innate?\n\nOption B says: \"occurs in the absence of sensory feedback.\" That doesn't make much sense to me because most behaviors are triggered by sensory inputs, right? So, if it's a fixed action pattern, it should still require some kind of sensory trigger, even if the response is innate.\n\nOption C says: \"is a motor response which once released may be terminated spontaneously.\" I think this is getting closer. Fixed action patterns are often characterized by the fact that once started, they are completed in their entirety, regardless of whether the original stimulus is still present. So, maybe they can be terminated spontaneously, but I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nOption D says: \"is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment.\" Well, fixed action patterns are typically triggered by a specific stimulus, often called a sign stimulus or releaser. So, \"a number of sensory signals\" might not be accurate. It's usually one specific trigger that sets off the entire sequence.\n\nLet me think about this again. Fixed action patterns are innate, stereotyped sequences of behavior that are released by a specific stimulus. Once started, they are carried to completion, even if the stimulus is removed.\n\nSo, option A seems incorrect because it suggests the behavior occurs the second time the animal is exposed to the stimulus. Innate behaviors should occur the first time the stimulus is presented.\n\nOption B says it occurs in the absence of sensory feedback. But, generally, behaviors are triggered by sensory inputs, so this doesn't sound right.\n\nOption C mentions that it's a motor response that may be terminated spontaneously. Actually, once a fixed action pattern is triggered, it continues to completion, regardless of whether the stimulus persists. So, maybe it's more accurate to say that it can't be easily stopped once started, rather than being terminated spontaneously.\n\nOption D says it's triggered by a number of sensory signals. But, from my understanding, it's usually triggered by a specific stimulus.\n\nMaybe I need to look back at my notes or a textbook to confirm.\n\nAlright, according to my biology textbook, fixed action patterns are innate behaviors that are unchangeable and are produced completely every time they are triggered by a specific sign stimulus.\n\nSo, for example, a bird incubating eggs\u2014once the sign stimulus is present, the bird will complete the entire sequence of behaviors associated with incubating eggs, regardless of whether the eggs are actually there.\n\nGiven that, option C seems closest to the mark because it says the motor response may be terminated spontaneously. But actually, fixed action patterns are typically completed once started, without regard to whether the stimulus persists.\n\nWait a minute, maybe none of the options are perfectly correct, but option C is the least incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is designed to test understanding of fixed action patterns, and the correct answer is C because it captures the idea that once started, they may continue to completion without needing further sensory input.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Maybe I should consider that fixed action patterns can be terminated if another more potent stimulus is presented, but generally, they tend to run to completion once triggered.\n\nGiven that, option C might be the best choice among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
