                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about information criteria. I need to determine which of the statements are true concerning information criteria. The statements are:\n\n(i) Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion.\n\n(ii) If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall.\n\n(iii) Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion.\n\n(iv) Akaike's information criterion is consistent.\n\nI have to evaluate each of these statements and see which ones are correct.\n\nFirst, let's look at statement (i): \"Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion.\"\n\nI know that adjusted R-squared is a modification of R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It's used to compare models with different numbers of predictors. Information criteria, like AIC and BIC, are also used for model selection and take into account both the goodness of fit and the complexity of the model.\n\nSo, is adjusted R-squared considered an information criterion? I'm a bit unsure here. I think it might be, because it serves a similar purpose, but I'm not completely sure.\n\nNext, statement (ii): \"If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall.\"\n\nHmm, this seems tricky. When you add an additional term to a model, the residual sum of squares (RSS) usually decreases because the model becomes more complex and can fit the data better. However, information criteria like AIC and BIC penalize model complexity. So, even if RSS decreases, the penalty for adding more parameters might cause the information criterion to increase.\n\nTherefore, I think this statement is not necessarily true. Adding a term that decreases RSS doesn't guarantee that the information criterion will decrease because of the penalty term.\n\nNow, statement (iii): \"Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion.\"\n\nAkaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz's Information Criterion (also known as Bayesian Information Criterion or BIC) are both used for model selection. AIC tends to select more complex models compared to BIC, especially in large samples. BIC has a stronger penalty for the number of parameters than AIC.\n\nSo, generally, AIC may select models with more parameters than BIC. But does AIC always lead to model orders at least as large as BIC? I think it's not always the case, but often it is. However, I need to confirm this.\n\nFinally, statement (iv): \"Akaike's information criterion is consistent.\"\n\nConsistency in the context of model selection means that as the sample size increases, the probability of selecting the true model approaches one. BIC is known for being a consistent criterion, while AIC is not consistent; it can still select an incorrect model even with large sample sizes.\n\nTherefore, statement (iv) seems false because AIC is not consistent.\n\nGiven my thoughts so far:\n\n- Statement (i): Unsure.\n\n- Statement (ii): Probably false.\n\n- Statement (iii): Not always true.\n\n- Statement (iv): False.\n\nLooking back, perhaps statement (i) is true since adjusted R-squared does serve as a criterion for model selection, similar to information criteria, but I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should look up the definitions to confirm.\n\nFirst, let's check what adjusted R-squared is. Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It increases only if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance and decreases when a predictor improves the model less than expected by chance.\n\nInformation criteria, like AIC and BIC, are statistics used to compare different models. They balance goodness of fit and model complexity.\n\nSo, while adjusted R-squared does adjust for complexity, it's not typically classified as an information criterion. Information criteria are more specifically defined statistics like AIC, BIC, etc. So, perhaps statement (i) is false.\n\nNext, statement (ii): \"If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall.\"\n\nAs I thought earlier, adding a term usually decreases RSS but increases the complexity penalty. Whether the overall information criterion decreases or increases depends on the trade-off between these two.\n\nFor AIC, which is defined as AIC = 2k - 2ln(L), where k is the number of parameters and L is the likelihood, adding a parameter increases k but also potentially increases L. So, it's not guaranteed that AIC will decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for BIC, which is BIC = k*ln(n) - 2ln(L), the penalty is even stronger.\n\nTherefore, statement (ii) is false.\n\nStatement (iii): \"Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion.\"\n\nGenerally, AIC tends to select more complex models than BIC, especially with large sample sizes. However, it's not always the case that AIC will select a larger model than BIC. In some situations, particularly with small sample sizes, BIC might select a larger model.\n\nSo, statement (iii) is not always true.\n\nStatement (iv): \"Akaike's information criterion is consistent.\"\n\nAs I recall, consistency in model selection means that as the sample size increases, the probability of selecting the true model approaches one. BIC is consistent, whereas AIC is not; AIC can still select an incorrect model with high probability even as the sample size increases.\n\nTherefore, statement (iv) is false.\n\nGiven this analysis, none of the statements seem to be always true. However, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider specific contexts or definitions more carefully.\n\nLet me double-check statement (i). Is adjusted R-squared considered an information criterion?\n\nUpon checking, information criteria are specific formulas used for model selection, like AIC, BIC, etc. Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors, but it's not typically classified as an information criterion. So, statement (i) is likely false.\n\nStatement (ii) is false, as adding a term that decreases RSS doesn't necessarily decrease the information criterion due to the penalty for complexity.\n\nStatement (iii) is not always true, as sometimes BIC can select larger models, especially with small sample sizes.\n\nStatement (iv) is false because AIC is not a consistent criterion.\n\nTherefore, none of the statements are always true. But that doesn't match any of the options provided. The options are:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nSince none of the statements are always true, perhaps the question is expecting a different answer based on specific interpretations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have some misconceptions here.\n\nLet me consider statement (iii) again. Does AIC always lead to model orders at least as large as BIC?\n\nIn general, AIC tends to select more parameters than BIC, but it's not always the case. There might be situations where BIC selects a larger model, especially with small sample sizes or specific data structures.\n\nTherefore, statement (iii) is not always true.\n\nSimilarly, statement (iv) is false because AIC is not consistent.\n\nStatement (ii) is false, as adding a term that decreases RSS doesn't necessarily decrease the information criterion due to the penalty.\n\nStatement (i) is false because adjusted R-squared is not typically considered an information criterion.\n\nGiven this, the correct answer should be that none of the statements are always true. However, since the options don't include \"none,\" perhaps the question is expecting that only (i) and (iii) can be true sometimes, but not always.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. all of the above\n\nGiven my analysis, none of these options seem correct because:\n\n- (ii) and (iv) are false.\n\n- (i) and (iii) are not always true.\n\n- Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D seem correct.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Which of the following statements are true concerning information criteria?\n\n(i) Adjusted R-squared is an information criterion\n\n(ii) If the residual sum of squares falls when an additional term is added, the value of the information criterion will fall\n\n(iii) Akaike's information criterion always leads to model orders that are at least as large as those of Schwarz's information criterion\n\n(iv) Akaike's information criterion is consistent\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. all of the above\"\n\nGiven my analysis:\n\n- (i): false\n\n- (ii): false\n\n- (iii): not always true\n\n- (iv): false\n\nTherefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D are correct. This suggests that maybe I have misinterpreted the statements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"information criteria\" in this context include adjusted R-squared, even if it's not strictly classified as an information criterion in some definitions.\n\nIf I consider adjusted R-squared as an information criterion, then statement (i) is true.\n\nRegarding statement (ii), perhaps in some specific cases, decreasing RSS does lead to a decrease in the information criterion, but not always.\n\nStatement (iii): AIC often leads to larger models than BIC, but not always.\n\nStatement (iv): AIC is not consistent.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the closest option is B. (i) and (iii) only, acknowledging that these statements can be true sometimes, but not always.\n\nHowever, I'm still not entirely confident about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects that (i) and (iii) are always true, but as I've analyzed, they are not.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the answer is B. (i) and (iii) only, but I would need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a mistake, and none of the options are entirely correct.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll go with B. (i) and (iii) only, recognizing that this might not be entirely accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
