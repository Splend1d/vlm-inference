                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about a defendant charged with first-degree murder and their right to a list of prospective jurors. The options are:\n\nA. upon court order.\n\nB. upon request.\n\nC. upon request and showing of good cause.\n\nD. under no circumstances.\n\nI need to think about the legal principles here. In criminal trials, especially for serious offenses like first-degree murder, the defendant has certain rights, including the right to a fair trial and the right to understand who the jurors are.\n\nFirst, I recall that the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to an impartial jury. But does that mean the defendant is entitled to a list of prospective jurors?\n\nI think about the purpose of having a list of jurors. It could help the defense in preparing for voir dire, where they can question potential jurors to see if there's any bias. Knowing the names and addresses might allow the defense to do some background research on these individuals.\n\nBut there are also reasons why a court might be cautious about releasing such information. For example, in high-profile cases, there could be concerns about juror safety or tampering.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. upon court order. This suggests that a judge has to decide whether to provide the list. It seems somewhat vague; it doesn't specify under what circumstances the court would issue such an order.\n\nB. upon request. This seems straightforward. If the defendant asks for the list, they should get it. But is there a general right to this information?\n\nC. upon request and showing of good cause. This adds an extra layer, where the defendant not only has to request the list but also demonstrate a valid reason why they need it.\n\nD. under no circumstances. This would mean that the defendant is never entitled to a list of prospective jurors.\n\nI need to think about case law or rules of criminal procedure that might address this.\n\nI recall that in many jurisdictions, there is a degree of privacy surrounding juror information, especially their addresses, to protect them from harassment or influence.\n\nHowever, the defendant's right to prepare for trial and to challenge jurors might outweigh these concerns to some extent.\n\nPerhaps there's a balance here. Maybe the defendant is entitled to certain information but not all.\n\nLet me consider option B, upon request. This seems too broad. If a defendant can always get the list just by asking, it might lead to abuses, like contacting jurors or intimidating them.\n\nOption C seems more reasonable. The defendant has to show good cause, meaning they need to demonstrate why they need the list. This could allow the court to assess the request on a case-by-case basis and decide whether the need outweighs any potential risks.\n\nOption A, upon court order, is similar to C but doesn't specify the need for good cause. It's more open-ended.\n\nOption D, under no circumstances, might be too restrictive. It could hinder the defendant's ability to prepare for trial adequately.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option C makes the most sense. The defendant should be able to request the list, but they need to show good cause why they need it. This way, the court can evaluate the request and decide whether the benefits to the defendant's case justify any risks to juror privacy or safety.\n\nI should also consider if there are any specific laws or rules that address this situation. For example, in some jurisdictions, there might be rules about disclosing juror information, especially in high-profile cases.\n\nSuppose this is a first-degree murder case, which is likely to be high-profile and sensitive. In such cases, courts might be more cautious about releasing juror information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a general rule that allows defendants to receive a list of prospective jurors upon request, without needing to show good cause.\n\nI need to think about the principles of discovery in criminal cases. Discovery rules vary by jurisdiction, but generally, defendants have the right to certain information from the prosecution, like witness lists and evidence.\n\nHowever, juror information might be treated differently due to the need to protect juror privacy and ensure their safety.\n\nI recall that in some cases, juror names are public, but their addresses and other personal information are kept private.\n\nPerhaps the defendant is entitled to the names of prospective jurors but not their addresses, or only limited information.\n\nBut the question specifies \"names and addresses,\" so it's asking about providing both pieces of information.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is the most appropriate. The defendant can request the list, but they need to show good cause why they need both names and addresses. The court can then decide whether the need justifies releasing that information.\n\nFor example, if the defense argues that they need the addresses to check for any potential biases or connections to the case, the court can consider that and decide whether that constitutes good cause.\n\nOn the other hand, if the request is made solely for the purpose of contacting jurors, which could be improper, the court can deny the request.\n\nTherefore, requiring both a request and a showing of good cause seems like a reasonable approach.\n\nI don't think option A, upon court order, is sufficient because it doesn't specify the standards the court should use in making that order. It's too vague.\n\nOption B, upon request, is too permissive and could lead to abuses.\n\nOption D, under no circumstances, is too restrictive and might impede the defendant's ability to prepare for trial.\n\nHence, option C appears to be the best balance between the defendant's rights and the need to protect juror privacy and safety.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
