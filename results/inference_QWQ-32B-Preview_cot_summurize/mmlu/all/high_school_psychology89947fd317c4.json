The options are social facilitation, conformity, deindividuation, and norms. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nSocial facilitation is when people perform better or worse on a task in the presence of others. It can be either an improvement in performance or a deterioration, depending on the task and the individual.\n\nConformity is when people change their behavior or beliefs to match those of a group or society.\n\nDeindividuation is when people lose their sense of individual identity and act in ways they normally wouldn't when in a group.\n\nNorms are the accepted standards of behavior within a group or society.\n\nNow, let's apply these definitions to the scenario with the runners.\n\nThe runners are picking up their pace when another runner comes into view. So, they're changing their behavior based on the presence of others. This sounds a lot like social facilitation because they're modifying their performance in response to the presence of another person.\n\nConformity would involve changing their behavior to match that of others, which might not necessarily be the case here. They're speeding up, but not necessarily doing what the other runner is doing.\n\nDeindividuation seems less likely because it typically involves losing one's sense of individuality in a group, and here, it's just one other runner coming into view.\n\nNorms would suggest that there's a standard behavior expected in the park, but again, the scenario is more about personal performance adjustment rather than adhering to a social standard.\n\nSo, social facilitation seems to be the most fitting answer here. The runners are likely experiencing a boost in performance when they see another runner, which causes them to pick up their pace.\n\nI think the answer is A. social facilitation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
