Hmm, I need to figure out which one is made from cacao seeds.\n\nFirst, I know that cacao seeds are used to make chocolate. I've heard that before. So, option C. chocolate seems like a likely answer. But I should double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A is marzipan. I think marzipan is made from almonds and sugar. I don't think it has anything to do with cacao seeds. So, probably not marzipan.\n\nOption B is soy sauce. I know that soy sauce is made from soybeans, wheat, and salt. Again, no connection to cacao seeds that I'm aware of.\n\nOption D is anchovies. Those are fish, right? Definitely not made from cacao seeds.\n\nSo, based on what I know, chocolate is the only option that is made from cacao seeds. But let me make sure. Maybe there's something I don't know about marzipan or soy sauce.\n\nWait, sometimes soy sauce has added flavors, but I don't think cacao seeds are used in it. And marzipan is pretty much almonds and sugar, maybe some rosewater or something, but not cacao seeds.\n\nAnchovies are fish preserved in salt, nothing to do with cacao seeds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. chocolate.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should confirm this. Maybe I can think about the process of making chocolate. I recall that cacao beans are harvested from the cacao tree, then they're fermented, dried, roasted, and ground into a paste called chocolate liquor, which is the basis for chocolate products.\n\nSo, yes, chocolate is directly made from cacao seeds.\n\nMaybe I can consider if any of the other options use cacao seeds in any part of their production. For example, is there a type of marzipan that includes chocolate? I don't think so. Soy sauce might have sugar, but not cacao seeds. Anchovies are completely different.\n\nTherefore, the answer is clearly C. chocolate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
