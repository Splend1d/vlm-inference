                    "text": "So I've got this fluid dynamics problem here. Let's see what it's asking. We have a horizontal pipe with negligible viscosity, meaning we can assume it's ideal and follow Bernoulli's principles. The flow is streamlined and has a constant flow rate. At point 1, the diameter is d and the flow speed is V. At point 2, the diameter narrows to d/3. I need to find out how the pressure at point 2 compares to the pressure at point 1.\n\nFirst, I remember that in fluid dynamics, there's the continuity equation, which relates the speed of the fluid to the cross-sectional area of the pipe. The continuity equation is:\n\nA1 * V1 = A2 * V2\n\nWhere A is the cross-sectional area, and V is the velocity at that point.\n\nGiven that the pipe is horizontal, the heights are the same, so the potential energy per unit volume is the same at both points. Also, since viscosity is negligible, we can apply Bernoulli's equation, which relates pressure, velocity, and height in an incompressible fluid:\n\nP1 + 0.5 * \u03c1 * V1\u00b2 + \u03c1 * g * h1 = P2 + 0.5 * \u03c1 * V2\u00b2 + \u03c1 * g * h2\n\nBut since h1 = h2, the \u03c1 * g * h terms cancel out. So, simplifying:\n\nP1 + 0.5 * \u03c1 * V1\u00b2 = P2 + 0.5 * \u03c1 * V2\u00b2\n\nRearranging to find P2 in terms of P1:\n\nP2 = P1 + 0.5 * \u03c1 * (V1\u00b2 - V2\u00b2)\n\nSo, to find P2 - P1:\n\nP2 - P1 = 0.5 * \u03c1 * (V1\u00b2 - V2\u00b2)\n\nNow, I need to find V2 in terms of V1 using the continuity equation.\n\nFirst, find the cross-sectional areas A1 and A2.\n\nThe area of a circle is A = \u03c0 * (d/2)\u00b2\n\nSo, A1 = \u03c0 * (d/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * d\u00b2 / 4\n\nA2 = \u03c0 * (d/6)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * d\u00b2 / 36\n\nNow, using continuity:\n\nA1 * V1 = A2 * V2\n\nSo, V2 = (A1 / A2) * V1 = (\u03c0 * d\u00b2 / 4) / (\u03c0 * d\u00b2 / 36) * V1 = (36/4) * V1 = 9 * V1\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the pipe narrows, the velocity should increase, not decrease. But according to this, V2 = 9 * V1. That seems too high.\n\nWait, no. If the diameter is d at point 1 and d/3 at point 2, then the area ratio is (d/2)^2 : (d/6)^2 = (d\u00b2/4) : (d\u00b2/36) = 9:1\n\nSo, A1 / A2 = 9\n\nTherefore, V2 = (A1 / A2) * V1 = 9 * V1\n\nYes, that makes sense because as the pipe narrows, the velocity increases to maintain the same flow rate.\n\nNow, plug V2 back into the pressure equation:\n\nP2 - P1 = 0.5 * \u03c1 * (V1\u00b2 - (9 * V1)\u00b2) = 0.5 * \u03c1 * (V1\u00b2 - 81 * V1\u00b2) = 0.5 * \u03c1 * (-80 * V1\u00b2) = -40 * \u03c1 * V1\u00b2\n\nSo, P2 - P1 = -40 * \u03c1 * V1\u00b2\n\nThat means P2 is less than P1 by 40 * \u03c1 * V1\u00b2\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. less than the pressure at Point 1 by 4 \u03c1v^2\n\nB. less than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \u03c1v^2\n\nC. more than the pressure at Point 1 by 4 \u03c1v^2\n\nD. more than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \u03c1v^2\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the answer should be B. less than the pressure at Point 1 by 40 \u03c1v^2\n\nBut wait, let's double-check the calculations to make sure.\n\nFirst, continuity equation:\n\nA1 * V1 = A2 * V2\n\nA1 = \u03c0 * (d/2)^2 = \u03c0 * d\u00b2 / 4\n\nA2 = \u03c0 * (d/6)^2 = \u03c0 * d\u00b2 / 36\n\nSo, V2 = (A1 / A2) * V1 = (\u03c0 * d\u00b2 / 4) / (\u03c0 * d\u00b2 / 36) * V1 = (36/4) * V1 = 9 * V1\n\nOkay, that's correct.\n\nNow, Bernoulli's equation:\n\nP1 + 0.5 * \u03c1 * V1\u00b2 = P2 + 0.5 * \u03c1 * V2\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\nP2 - P1 = 0.5 * \u03c1 * (V1\u00b2 - V2\u00b2) = 0.5 * \u03c1 * (V1\u00b2 - (9 V1)\u00b2) = 0.5 * \u03c1 * (V1\u00b2 - 81 V1\u00b2) = 0.5 * \u03c1 * (-80 V1\u00b2) = -40 \u03c1 V1\u00b2\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the pressure at point 2 is less than the pressure at point 1 by 40 \u03c1 V1\u00b2.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. The pipe is horizontal, so no height difference. Viscosity is negligible, so no energy loss due to friction. The fluid is incompressible, as density is constant. The flow is streamlined and has a constant flow rate, so everything seems to be in order.\n\nI think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
