                    "text": "Let's see. I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: My mom asked me to deep clean the bath, so I covered it in crude oil.\n\nHmm, that seems pretty bizarre. Mom asked for the bath to be deep cleaned, and instead of cleaning it, I covered it in crude oil. Crude oil is dirty and harmful; it's not something you use to clean anything. So, by doing this, I'm not only not fulfilling my mom's request, but I'm also making the bath messier and potentially damaging it.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, this seems wrong because I'm being disobedient and causing harm or at least inconvenience and extra work for my mom. Plus, it's destructive behavior.\n\nSecond scenario: My terrified little brother swears there's a monster in his closet, so I tell him he's right.\n\nOkay, here we have a scared little brother who believes there's a monster in his closet. Instead of reassuring him or helping him overcome his fear, I confirm his belief by telling him he's right.\n\nThis seems problematic because it's likely to increase his fear and anxiety. As an older sibling or caregiver, it's usually expected that I would comfort him and help him understand that there are no monsters, perhaps by checking the closet together or providing reassurance.\n\nBy telling him he's right, I'm validating his fear, which might not be the best way to handle the situation. It could be seen as insensitive or even cruel, depending on how it's said.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions.\n\nIn the first scenario, I'm being disobedient and destructive.\n\nIn the second scenario, I'm potentially increasing my brother's fear by validating his unfounded belief in monsters.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way that scenario 2 could be considered not wrong?\n\nMaybe if I tell him he's right as a way to comfort him, like saying, \"I know you think there's a monster, and that's okay. But let's look together and see that there isn't one.\" In that case, validating his feelings while also addressing the reality could be seen as helpful.\n\nHowever, the way it's phrased, \"I tell him he's right,\" sounds like I'm just agreeing with his belief without offering any reassurance or correction. So, it seems more likely that it's wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
