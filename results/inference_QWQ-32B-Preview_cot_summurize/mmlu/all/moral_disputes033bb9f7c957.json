                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to answer this question about Ashford's article. The question is: \"Ashford's article is meant to address a particular paralysis in the face of...\" and then it gives four options. I need to pick the one that best fits what Ashford is talking about.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what Ashford's article is about. I think it's related to global poverty and ethics, maybe something about our obligations to help those in need. I recall Peter Singer's arguments about how we have a moral duty to aid the poor, maybe by giving a significant portion of our income to charity.\n\nOption A is \"the sheer scope of global poverty.\" That sounds plausible. Global poverty is a massive issue, affecting billions of people. It's so big that it's hard to wrap your head around it, let alone know how to help effectively. So, maybe Ashford is addressing how people feel paralyzed because the problem is just too huge.\n\nOption B is \"having to choose between addressing immediate harm and addressing structural injustice.\" This seems like another possible reason for paralysis. Sometimes, people might feel stuck because they don't know whether to focus on providing immediate relief, like giving food to someone who's hungry, or working on longer-term solutions that address the root causes of poverty, like advocating for policy changes. It's tough to decide which approach is more effective or morally imperative.\n\nOption C is \"reconciling conflicting moral theories.\" This one seems a bit more abstract. There are many different ethical theories out there, like utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, and so on. Each theory might prescribe different courses of action in the face of global poverty. So, perhaps people are paralyzed because they're trying to figure out which moral theory to follow, or how to reconcile the differences between them.\n\nOption D is \"having to give up so much of our own wealth in light of Singer's arguments.\" Peter Singer is famous for his \"drowning child\" analogy, where he argues that if you see a child drowning in a pond, you have a moral obligation to save them, even if it means getting your expensive suit ruined. He extends this to global poverty, suggesting that we should be giving a substantial portion of our income to help those in need, since our surplus resources could save lives elsewhere.\n\nGiven that background, I need to think about which of these options best captures the particular paralysis that Ashford is trying to address in her article.\n\nLet me consider each one again.\n\nOption A: the sheer scope of global poverty. This makes sense because the scale of the problem can be overwhelming. It's easy to feel like no matter how much you do, it's not enough, so you end up doing nothing.\n\nOption B: choosing between immediate harm and structural injustice. This is also a significant issue. People might feel like they have to choose between short-term fixes and long-term solutions, and not know which one to prioritize.\n\nOption C: reconciling conflicting moral theories. This seems more academic, perhaps. While it's an important issue for ethicists, it might not be the primary source of paralysis for ordinary people trying to make decisions about how to help those in need.\n\nOption D: giving up so much of our own wealth. This is directly related to Singer's arguments. His position is quite demanding; he suggests that moral obligation requires us to give until it causes us marginal harm, meaning we should give until the next dollar we give causes us more disutility than it provides benefit to others. This can require giving a large portion of one's income, which is a tough ask.\n\nConsidering these, I need to think about which one Ashford is focusing on in her article. I recall that Ashford is critiquing Singer's position and trying to offer a different perspective on our obligations regarding global poverty.\n\nGiven that, option D seems particularly relevant. Ashford might be addressing the paralysis that arises from Singer's demanding requirements, where people feel that they cannot live up to such high standards, and therefore may feel paralyzed about what to do.\n\nAlternatively, she might be addressing the scope of the problem (option A), arguing that the enormity of global poverty shouldn't paralyze us into inaction.\n\nOption B also seems plausible, as choosing between immediate aid and structural changes is a common dilemma.\n\nOption C, about reconciling moral theories, might be a part of her discussion, but it seems more removed from the practical decisions people face.\n\nPerhaps Ashford is addressing multiple sources of paralysis, but if I have to pick one, I need to think about which one is the primary focus of her article.\n\nLet me think back to some key points in Ashford's article. I remember that she discusses the idea that Singer's approach focuses too much on individual actions and not enough on collective action and structural change. She might be arguing that focusing solely on individual giving can lead to paralysis because it doesn't address the systemic issues that cause poverty in the first place.\n\nIf that's the case, then option B seems most appropriate, as it deals with the choice between immediate harm (individual giving) and structural injustice (systemic change).\n\nAlternatively, she might be addressing the paralysis that comes from the overwhelming scope of the problem (option A), suggesting that we need to find manageable ways to make a difference without being overwhelmed.\n\nAlternatively, option D seems directly related to Singer's arguments about personal wealth, so if Ashford is critiquing his position, she might be addressing the paralysis that arises from feeling obligated to give so much.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should look back at the question more carefully. It's asking for the particular paralysis that Ashford's article is meant to address.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, I think option D is the best answer. Ashford is likely addressing the paralysis that people feel when confronted with Singer's arguments that they need to give up a significant portion of their wealth to help those in need. This demanding requirement can lead to feelings of being overwhelmed or unable to meet such high standards, resulting in inaction.\n\nTherefore, I will go with option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
