                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about a deed and a right-of-way. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nSo, there's a landowner who sold a parcel of land to a buyer, and in the deed, there's a clause that reserves a 40-foot strip along the east side of Winter Street for potential future use if a road is needed. Additionally, they had a side agreement that the seller would retain an absolute right to travel over that strip for certain purposes.\n\nLater, the buyer stops the seller from using the strip for travel, even though no road has been built yet. The seller sues, claiming that he still owns the 40-foot strip because it wasn't clearly conveyed in the deed.\n\nThe question is whether the court will consider outside evidence about the parties' intentions regarding this strip of land.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. No, the court will confine itself to what is in the four corners of the deed.\n\nB. No, because that would violate the parole evidence rule.\n\nC. Yes, because the court always has a right to reform the wording of a deed according to the court's interpretation of what it means.\n\nD. Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"four corners of the deed\" means. This refers to the idea that the deed is a complete agreement between the parties, and the court should not look beyond the written document to interpret the parties' intentions.\n\nThe parole evidence rule is something I've heard of in contract law. It generally prevents the admission of oral or written statements not included in the final written agreement, to prevent ambiguity and ensure certainty in contracts.\n\nIn this case, there's a deed, which is a legal document transferring property, and a side agreement. Deeds are typically considered integrated contracts, meaning they are intended to be complete and final expressions of the parties' agreement.\n\nOption A suggests that the court will only look at the deed itself and not consider any outside evidence. Option B mentions the parole evidence rule, which seems relevant here.\n\nOption C says that the court always has the right to reform the wording of a deed according to the court's interpretation. I'm not sure about that. Deed reformation is possible, but it usually requires evidence that the deed doesn't accurately reflect the parties' intentions due to a mutual mistake or fraud.\n\nOption D allows for considering outside information if the deed is ambiguous, especially regarding easements or rights-of-way.\n\nI need to think about whether the clause in the deed is clear or ambiguous. The deed says, \"Less and excepting a strip of land forty feet wide along the east side of Winter Street, all the way across said land, for use in the future if and when a road is needed for travel.\"\n\nThis seems to reserve a strip of land for potential future road use. But there's also a side agreement that the seller would retain an absolute right to travel over that strip for certain purposes.\n\nThe buyer is now preventing the seller from using the strip for travel, even without a road being built. The seller is claiming that he still owns the strip because it wasn't clearly conveyed.\n\nSo, is the deed clear that the strip is being reserved for future road use, or is it ambiguous about who owns the strip and what rights the seller has to use it?\n\nI think the deed is a bit ambiguous because it reserves the strip \"for use in the future if and when a road is needed,\" but there's also a separate side agreement giving the seller the right to travel over it.\n\nIn contract interpretation, if a document is ambiguous, courts may look to extrinsic evidence to determine the parties' intentions.\n\nSimilarly, in deed interpretation, if the language is unclear, courts might consider outside evidence to clarify the intentions of the parties.\n\nHowever, deeds are supposed to be integrated contracts, and the parole evidence rule generally applies to prevent contradiction or variation of the written terms.\n\nBut in the case of ambiguity, courts often allow parol evidence to interpret the ambiguous terms.\n\nSo, option D seems plausible because it acknowledges that if the deed is ambiguous, outside evidence can be considered to ascertain the parties' true intentions.\n\nOption C is too broad because it says the court always has the right to reform the wording. Deed reformation is an equitable remedy that requires specific grounds, like a mutual mistake or fraud, not just because the court wants to interpret the wording differently.\n\nOption B might be too absolute. While the parole evidence rule generally applies, it doesn't entirely bar consideration of outside evidence when there's ambiguity.\n\nOption A is that the court will confine itself to the four corners of the deed. But given that the deed seems ambiguous, and there's a separate side agreement, it might not be sufficient to rely solely on the deed.\n\nMoreover, the side agreement is a separate contract that might affect the rights of the parties regarding the strip of land.\n\nIn property law, easements and rights-of-way are important interests that can be created by implication or by express grant.\n\nIf the deed is unclear about the nature of the interest being reserved, and there's a separate agreement about the seller's right to travel over the strip, it seems reasonable that a court would consider that agreement to interpret the parties' intentions.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: Yes, because an ambiguously-worded easement or right-of-way can be supplemented by outside information to get at the true intention of the parties.\n\nThis approach aligns with general principles of contract interpretation, where ambiguity allows for the consideration of extrinsic evidence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
