                    "text": "Next-generation sequencing, or NGS, is a powerful technology that allows us to determine the order of DNA or RNA building blocks, called nucleotides, at a much faster rate and lower cost than traditional methods. It has revolutionized many areas of biological research and medicine. Let's look at the options provided to see how NGS is most often used.\n\nOption A suggests using NGS to identify a newly discovered virus. Indeed, NGS can be incredibly useful in virus discovery. When a new virus is found, sequencing its genome helps us understand its genetic makeup, which is crucial for developing diagnostic tests, vaccines, and treatments. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, NGS was instrumental in sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 virus, allowing researchers to track its spread and mutations.\n\nOption B proposes using NGS to search for drug-resistant mutants. This is another significant application of NGS. By sequencing the genomes of pathogens, such as bacteria or viruses, we can identify mutations that confer resistance to antibiotics or antiviral drugs. This information is vital for adjusting treatment strategies and controlling the spread of drug-resistant strains. For instance, NGS is used to monitor the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains.\n\nOption C mentions identifying quasi-species viruses. Quasi-species refer to a group of similar but not identical viruses that make up a population. Because viruses can mutate rapidly, a single infection may involve a diverse array of viral variants. NGS can capture this diversity by sequencing thousands to millions of DNA or RNA molecules in parallel, providing a detailed picture of the viral population within a host. This is particularly important for understanding virus evolution, transmission, and pathogenesis.\n\nOption D states that NGS cannot be used, which is clearly not the case, as options A, B, and C describe valid uses of NGS.\n\nNow, to determine which of these options represents the most common use of NGS, we need to consider the frequency and impact of each application.\n\nNGS is widely used in various fields, including basic research, clinical diagnostics, and public health. In the context of virology, all three options A, B, and C are relevant, but their prevalence may vary.\n\nVirus discovery (Option A) is undoubtedly important, especially in the face of emerging infectious diseases. However, it may not be the most frequent use of NGS compared to other applications.\n\nSearching for drug-resistant mutants (Option B) is crucial in managing infectious diseases and combating antimicrobial resistance. This is a ongoing effort in many laboratories worldwide.\n\nIdentifying quasi-species viruses (Option C) is essential for understanding viral evolution and disease progression. It is particularly relevant in chronic viral infections, such as HIV and hepatitis C, where viral diversity plays a key role in treatment response and disease outcome.\n\nConsidering these points, while all three options are valid uses of NGS, identifying quasi-species viruses (Option C) might be the most frequent application in virology research due to the inherent genetic diversity of many viruses and the importance of understanding this diversity in disease management.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the most common use of NGS can vary depending on the specific context, such as academic research, clinical settings, or public health surveillance.\n\nIn summary, NGS is frequently used in virology for various purposes, including identifying newly discovered viruses, searching for drug-resistant mutants, and characterizing viral quasi-species. Among these, identifying quasi-species viruses (Option C) is a critical and common application due to the genetic complexity of many viral infections.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
