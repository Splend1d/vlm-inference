                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two charged, massive particles that are isolated and only influenced by the forces between them. The net force between them is zero Newtons. We need to determine which statement is NOT true given this scenario.\n\nFirst, let's recall the types of forces involved here. Since the particles are charged, there is an electrostatic force between them, which follows Coulomb's law. Also, because they have mass, there is a gravitational force between them, governed by Newton's law of universal gravitation.\n\nThe net force being zero means that these two forces must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, the electrostatic force and the gravitational force are balancing each other out.\n\nLet's write down the expressions for these forces:\n\n1. Electrostatic force (Coulomb's law):\n\n\\[ F_e = k \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant (\\( \\approx 8.99 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{N m}^2/\\text{C}^2 \\))\n\n- \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are the charges of the particles\n\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between the particles\n\n2. Gravitational force (Newton's law of universal gravitation):\n\n\\[ F_g = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant (\\( \\approx 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{N m}^2/\\text{kg}^2 \\))\n\n- \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) are the masses of the particles\n\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between the particles\n\nFor the net force to be zero:\n\n\\[ F_e + F_g = 0 \\]\n\nSince forces are vectors, their directions matter. The electrostatic force can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the signs of the charges, while the gravitational force is always attractive.\n\nGiven that the net force is zero, the electrostatic force must be equal in magnitude to the gravitational force but opposite in direction. Therefore:\n\n\\[ F_e = -F_g \\]\n\nIn terms of magnitudes:\n\n\\[ |F_e| = |F_g| \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nThe \\( r^2 \\) terms cancel out:\n\n\\[ k |q_1 q_2| = G m_1 m_2 \\]\n\nThis equation relates the charges and masses of the particles.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n**A. The particles must have the same sign of charge.**\n\nFor the electrostatic force to balance the gravitational force, which is always attractive, the electrostatic force must be repulsive. This means that the charges must be of the same sign (both positive or both negative) so that they repel each other, counteracting the attractive gravitational force.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\n**B. If the distance between the particles changes, the force will no longer be 0 N.**\n\nInitially, the forces balance at a specific distance \\( r \\). If the distance changes, the magnitudes of both forces change according to \\( 1/r^2 \\), but their ratio remains the same as long as the charges and masses remain constant.\n\nWait a minute. Let's think about this.\n\nFrom the earlier equation:\n\n\\[ k |q_1 q_2| = G m_1 m_2 \\]\n\nThis equation doesn't depend on \\( r \\). So, if this condition is satisfied, the forces should balance at any distance \\( r \\), because both forces scale with \\( 1/r^2 \\) in the same way.\n\nTherefore, statement B seems incorrect because the force would remain zero at any distance if the condition \\( k |q_1 q_2| = G m_1 m_2 \\) is met.\n\n**C. The particles must have the same mass.**\n\nFrom the balancing equation:\n\n\\[ k |q_1 q_2| = G m_1 m_2 \\]\n\nThere is no requirement for \\( m_1 \\) to be equal to \\( m_2 \\). The masses can be different as long as the product \\( m_1 m_2 \\) is such that the equation holds given the charges.\n\nTherefore, statement C is not necessarily true.\n\n**D. Such a situation is impossible as the net force between the two particles cannot be 0.**\n\nWe've just derived that it is possible for the net force to be zero if the condition \\( k |q_1 q_2| = G m_1 m_2 \\) is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, statement D is incorrect.\n\nNow, the question is to identify which statement is NOT true.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Statement A seems correct.\n\n- Statement B seems incorrect based on my earlier reasoning.\n\n- Statement C seems incorrect because masses don't have to be the same.\n\n- Statement D is incorrect.\n\nBut the question says \"which of the following is NOT true?\" So we need to pick the statement that is false.\n\nGiven that, statement B is claiming that if the distance changes, the force will no longer be zero, but according to our reasoning, if the condition \\( k |q_1 q_2| = G m_1 m_2 \\) holds, the forces will remain balanced at any distance.\n\nTherefore, statement B is not true, making it the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nIf \\( k |q_1 q_2| = G m_1 m_2 \\), then \\( F_e = F_g \\) at any \\( r \\), since both fall off as \\( 1/r^2 \\) in the same way.\n\nHence, the net force remains zero regardless of the distance between the particles.\n\nTherefore, statement B is indeed incorrect, and that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
