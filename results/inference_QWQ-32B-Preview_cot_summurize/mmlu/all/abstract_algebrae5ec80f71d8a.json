                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** If a group has an element of order 10, then it has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.\n\nFirst, recall that in any group, the identity element has order 1. So, every group has an element of order 1. Therefore, if a group has an element of order 10, it definitely has an element of order 1.\n\nNow, let's consider an element \\( a \\) in the group with order 10. This means that \\( a^{10} = e \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity element, and 10 is the smallest positive integer with this property.\n\nWe can find other elements in the group by considering powers of \\( a \\). Specifically, for any integer \\( k \\), \\( a^k \\) is an element of the group.\n\nTo find an element of order 2, we can look for an element \\( b \\) such that \\( b^2 = e \\), and 2 is the smallest positive integer with this property.\n\nLet's consider \\( b = a^5 \\). Then,\n\n\\( b^2 = (a^5)^2 = a^{10} = e \\).\n\nSo, \\( b \\) has order 2, since \\( b^2 = e \\), and assuming that \\( a^5 \\) is not the identity (which it isn't, because the order of \\( a \\) is 10, so \\( a^5 \\) has order 2).\n\nSimilarly, to find an element of order 5, we can consider \\( c = a^2 \\). Then,\n\n\\( c^5 = (a^2)^5 = a^{10} = e \\).\n\nNow, we need to check if 5 is the smallest positive integer \\( m \\) such that \\( c^m = e \\). Suppose there exists a smaller positive integer \\( m < 5 \\) with \\( c^m = e \\). Then,\n\n\\( a^{2m} = e \\).\n\nSince the order of \\( a \\) is 10, this implies that 10 divides \\( 2m \\), so \\( 2m \\) is a multiple of 10. Therefore, \\( m \\) must be a multiple of 5. But \\( m < 5 \\), so the only possibility is \\( m = 0 \\), which is not positive. Hence, the smallest such \\( m \\) is 5, so \\( c \\) has order 5.\n\nTherefore, if a group has an element of order 10, it indeed has elements of orders 1, 2, and 5. So, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.\n\nThis statement is more nuanced. It's not always true that a group with elements of orders 2 and 3 will have an element of order 6.\n\nTo see why, consider the group \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), which is the direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the cyclic group of order 3. This group has order 6, and it is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\), which is cyclic. In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\), there is an element of order 6, namely 1 (since \\( 1 \\times 6 = 0 \\) modulo 6).\n\nHowever, consider another group of order 6: the symmetric group \\( S_3 \\). In \\( S_3 \\), there are elements of order 2 (transpositions) and elements of order 3 (3-cycles), but there is no element of order 6. The orders of elements in \\( S_3 \\) are 1, 2, and 3.\n\nTherefore, even if a group has elements of orders 2 and 3, it does not necessarily have an element of order 6. It depends on the group structure.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
