                    "text": "So I've got this question here: An employee expects greater consistency in the behavior of his boss than is warranted. The employee\u2019s expectation is best accounted for by which of the following?\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. overjustification hypothesis\n\nB. self-serving bias\n\nC. fundamental attribution bias\n\nD. self-verification theory\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I need to understand what each of these terms means and see which one best explains why the employee is expecting more consistency from their boss than is realistic.\n\nFirst up, the overjustification hypothesis. I think this has to do with motivation. It suggests that external rewards can decrease intrinsic motivation. For example, if someone is already enjoying their job, and then they start getting paid for it, their enjoyment might decrease because now they're doing it for the money. But in this question, it's about expecting consistency in behavior, so I'm not sure if this fits.\n\nNext, the self-serving bias. That's when people attribute their successes to their own abilities and efforts, and their failures to external factors. Like, \"I aced the test because I'm smart, but I failed because the teacher graded unfairly.\" Again, this seems more about how people explain their own outcomes rather than expectations about others' behavior.\n\nThe fundamental attribution bias, also known as the correspondence bias, is when people overemphasize personal characteristics and ignore situational factors in explaining others' behavior. For example, if someone is late, you might think they're irresponsible rather than considering that they had a flat tire. But is this about expecting consistency? Maybe partially, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLastly, self-verification theory. This is about people's desire for consistency in their self-concept. They seek feedback that confirms their self-view, whether positive or negative. So, if someone sees themselves as reliable, they might look for evidence that confirms this. But in this case, it's about the employee's expectation of the boss's behavior, not their own self-concept.\n\nHmm, none of these seem to fit perfectly, but I guess I need to choose the best one.\n\nLet me think differently. The employee is expecting more consistency from the boss than is warranted. Maybe this has to do with attributing the boss's behavior to their personality rather than considering that behaviors can vary based on different situations.\n\nWait, that sounds like the fundamental attribution bias. The employee is perhaps assuming that the boss's behavior is a stable trait rather than recognizing that it can change depending on circumstances.\n\nFor example, if the boss is usually punctual but arrives late one day due to traffic, the employee might think the boss is being inconsistent, not considering the external factor of traffic.\n\nSo, maybe the fundamental attribution bias is the answer.\n\nBut let's consider self-verification theory again. Maybe the employee has a certain view of the boss and is seeking consistency to confirm that view. For instance, if the employee thinks the boss is reliable, they might expect consistent behavior to verify that perception.\n\nThat seems plausible too.\n\nComparing the two, fundamental attribution bias seems more directly related to expectations of consistency in behavior based on personality traits, while self-verification theory is more about confirming one's view of someone else.\n\nI think the fundamental attribution bias is a better fit here because it specifically deals with how we attribute others' behavior to their personality rather than considering situational factors, leading to expectations of consistency that might not be warranted.\n\nSo, I'll go with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
