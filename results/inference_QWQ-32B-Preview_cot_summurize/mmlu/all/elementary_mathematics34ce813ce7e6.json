So, I need to find out what three fifths of 100 is and choose the correct answer from the options given.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"three fifths\" means. It's a fraction, right? Three fifths is written as 3/5. So, I need to find 3/5 of 100.\n\nTo find a fraction of a number, I can multiply the fraction by the number. So, it's 3/5 times 100.\n\nLet me write that down: (3/5) * 100.\n\nNow, how do I multiply a fraction by a whole number? I can keep the denominator the same and multiply the numerator by the whole number.\n\nSo, it would be (3 * 100) / 5.\n\nThat's 300 / 5.\n\nNow, I just need to divide 300 by 5.\n\n300 divided by 5 is 60.\n\nSo, three fifths of 100 is 60.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 5\n\nC. 20\n\nD. 60\n\nThe correct answer is D. 60.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I did this correctly. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way to think about fractions is to divide the whole into equal parts. So, if I have 100 and I want to divide it into five equal parts, each part would be 100 / 5 = 20.\n\nThen, three fifths would be three of those parts, so 3 * 20 = 60.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could convert the fraction to a decimal. Three fifths is 0.6, and then multiply 0.6 by 100, which is also 60.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the answer is 60.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
