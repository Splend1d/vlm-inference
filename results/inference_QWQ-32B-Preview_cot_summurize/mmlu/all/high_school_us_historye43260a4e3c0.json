Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nWhich of the following presidents would be most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here that refers to a speech by Calvin Coolidge, who was the 30th President of the United States. The speech is titled \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" and it was delivered on June 30, 1924. The question presents a quote from Coolidge where he talks about the importance of protecting the rights of citizens, especially their right to enjoy the fruits of their own labor, and how taxation should be handled with care to avoid infringing on that right. He sees taxation as a necessary tool for government but warns against excessive taxation, which he equates to tyranny.\n\nThe question then asks which of the following presidents would be most likely to share Coolidge's sentiments:\n\nA. Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\nB. Lyndon B. Johnson\n\nC. Ronald Reagan\n\nD. Barack Obama\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which of these presidents would align most closely with Coolidge's views on taxation and government economy.\n\nFirst, let's recall who Calvin Coolidge was and what his political philosophy entailed. Coolidge was a Republican and a firm believer in limited government, low taxes, and individual responsibility. He was known for his laissez-faire economic policies and his commitment to reducing the national debt and cutting government spending. His administration was marked by economic prosperity, known as the Roaring Twenties, although it was later followed by the Great Depression.\n\nNow, let's look at each of the presidents listed and see how their policies and beliefs compare to Coolidge's.\n\nA. Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR):\n\nFDR was a Democrat who served as president from 1933 to 1945. He is best known for his New Deal policies in response to the Great Depression, which involved significant government intervention in the economy, including increased spending on social programs and public works. FDR also raised taxes, particularly on the wealthy, to fund these programs. This is quite the opposite of Coolidge's philosophy of limited government and low taxes. So, it's unlikely that FDR would share Coolidge's sentiments.\n\nB. Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ):\n\nLBJ was a Democrat who served as president from 1963 to 1969. He is known for his Great Society programs, which expanded federal social programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and education initiatives. These programs required increased government spending and taxation. Again, this contrasts with Coolidge's belief in limited government and economy in taxation. So, LBJ probably wouldn't share Coolidge's views.\n\nC. Ronald Reagan:\n\nReagan was a Republican who served as president from 1981 to 1989. He is often associated with Reaganomics, which emphasized reducing taxes, particularly for higher income brackets, reducing government spending, and decreasing regulation of the economy. Reagan also advocated for a smaller federal government and more power to states. This aligns closely with Coolidge's philosophy of limited government and low taxes. So, Reagan seems like a strong candidate for sharing Coolidge's sentiments.\n\nD. Barack Obama:\n\nObama was a Democrat who served as president from 2009 to 2017. His administration implemented the Affordable Care Act, which expanded health insurance coverage through both public and private sectors, and involved increases in taxation on certain income levels to fund the program. Obama also generally supported higher taxes on the wealthy to fund social programs. This again contrasts with Coolidge's views on limited taxation and government economy.\n\nComparing all four options, Ronald Reagan's policies and beliefs most closely align with those expressed by Calvin Coolidge in the provided speech. Both valued limited government, low taxes, and fiscal conservatism. Therefore, the answer is C. Ronald Reagan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
