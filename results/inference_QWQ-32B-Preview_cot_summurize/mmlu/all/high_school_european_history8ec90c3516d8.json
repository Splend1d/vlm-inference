One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nThe ideas expressed by Voltaire, above, best illustrate which of the following characteristics of Enlightenment intellectuals?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this quote from Voltaire about the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, and I need to figure out which characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals it best illustrates. Let's see what each option says.\n\nOption A: Many were accomplished scientists, who added important pieces to human understanding of the universe.\n\nWell, Voltaire was known for his philosophical and literary works, but I'm not sure if he was a prominent scientist. He did have some interest in science, but I think his main contributions were in literature and philosophy. So maybe this isn't the best fit.\n\nOption B: They utilized new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets.\n\nVoltaire was known for his correspondence and writings, which were widely circulated. Salons were indeed important for the exchange of ideas during the Enlightenment, and printed materials became more accessible due to improvements in printing technology. So, this seems plausible, but let's look at the other options to be sure.\n\nOption C: Most rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism as the only credo of a rational man.\n\nHmm, Voltaire was known for his criticism of the church and religious institutions, but I don't think he was an atheist. He was more of a deist, believing in a higher power but not in organized religion. So, saying that most Enlightenment intellectuals rejected religion altogether might be an overstatement. Some were atheists, but not most, I believe.\n\nOption D: Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nThis seems really relevant. Voltaire was a proponent of tolerance and rationality. In this quote, he's reacting to a natural disaster and questioning why such tragedies happen, especially in a world governed by rational laws. He also mentions that perhaps the earthquake should teach people not to persecute each other, suggesting a connection between natural events and human behavior.\n\nLet's look back at the quote to see which themes stand out.\n\nVoltaire says, \"nature is very cruel... the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds.\" He's reflecting on the nature of the world and the role of natural laws in causing disasters. He mentions \"a wretched gamble is the game of human life,\" which suggests a sense of randomness or unpredictability in life.\n\nHe also says, \"What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\"\n\nHere, he's critiquing religious institutions, particularly the Inquisition, and suggesting that natural disasters should serve as a lesson against persecution and intolerance.\n\nSo, considering all this, option D seems to capture the essence of Voltaire's ideas in this quote. He's invoking scientific understanding (laws of movement) to question the nature of the world and to advocate for a more tolerant approach to social and cultural issues.\n\nOption B is also relevant because Voltaire was known for his correspondence and writings, which were means of communicating his ideas. However, the question is about which characteristic his ideas best illustrate, and in this quote, it's his belief in using scientific understanding to promote tolerance and objectivity that stands out.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: Many believed that the new scientific discoveries justified a more tolerant and objective approach to social and cultural issues.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
