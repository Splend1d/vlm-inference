                    "text": "Let's see. So, Sal meets Petunia for the first time, and she seems really outgoing and funny. He thinks she's a fun person, but actually, she's just happy because she won the lottery. I need to figure out which psychological concept best explains Sal's opinion.\n\nOption A is the mere-exposure effect. I think that's when people develop a preference for things just because they're familiar with them. But in this case, Sal just met Petunia, so it's not about familiarity. Maybe not A.\n\nOption B is self-serving bias. That's when people attribute their successes to internal factors and their failures to external factors, to protect their ego. But here, it's about Sal's perception of Petunia, not about his own successes or failures. Probably not B.\n\nOption C is equipotentiality. I'm not sure what that is. I think it might have something to do with different ways to achieve the same goal, but I'm not entirely sure. It doesn't seem directly related to Sal's perception of Petunia.\n\nOption D is the fundamental attribution error. I remember that's when people overestimate the role of personal characteristics and underestimate the role of situational factors in others' behavior. So, if Petunia is acting funny because she won the lottery, that's a situational factor, but Sal might be attributing her behavior to her personality instead.\n\nWait, in this scenario, Petunia is temporarily gleeful because she won the lottery, but Sal thinks she's just a funny person. So, Sal is attributing her behavior to her personality rather than considering the situational factor of winning the lottery.\n\nThat sounds like the fundamental attribution error. Sal is not taking into account the situation that might be causing Petunia's behavior; instead, he's assuming it's a characteristic of her personality.\n\nLet me double-check. The fundamental attribution error is also known as correspondence bias or over-attribution. It's a common social cognition bias where people don't account for situational influences on behavior.\n\nIn contrast, maybe if Sal considered that Petunia is acting funny because of the lottery win, that would be considering the situational factor. But he's not doing that; he's making a personal attribution.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's quickly recap the other options.\n\nMere-exposure effect is about familiarity, which doesn't apply here.\n\nSelf-serving bias is about attributing successes and failures, which isn't relevant to Sal's perception of Petunia.\n\nEquipotentiality doesn't seem directly related to this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental attribution error is the best explanation for Sal's opinion of Petunia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
