                    "text": "I've come across this question about facial flushing in East Asians and it mentions something about a deficiency of ALDH. The options are ALDH1, ALDH2, ALDH3, and ALDH4. I need to figure out which one is associated with this condition.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what facial flushing is and why it occurs in some East Asians. I know that facial flushing is a skin reaction where the face turns red, often due to embarrassment or alcohol consumption. In East Asians, it's particularly associated with drinking alcohol, and it's sometimes called \"Asian flush\" or \"alcohol flush reaction.\"\n\nI recall that this reaction is related to how the body metabolizes alcohol. Alcohol is broken down in the body through a series of enzymes. The first step is the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde by an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Then, acetaldehyde is further broken down to acetate by another enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).\n\nNow, the question mentions a deficiency of ALDH, so it's likely that the flushing is due to a problem with the ALDH enzyme, which is responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde.\n\nAmong the options, ALDH1, ALDH2, ALDH3, and ALDH4, I need to identify which one is primarily involved in alcohol metabolism.\n\nI think ALDH2 is the one mainly responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde in the body, especially in the context of alcohol metabolism. So, a deficiency in ALDH2 would lead to a buildup of acetaldehyde, which can cause facial flushing and other symptoms like nausea and rapid heartbeat.\n\nLet me double-check that. ALDH2 is indeed the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme that metabolizes acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism. Variants of the ALDH2 gene are common in East Asian populations, and these variants can reduce the enzyme's activity, leading to the alcohol flush reaction.\n\nSo, if ALDH2 is deficient or not working properly, acetaldehyde accumulates in the body, causing blood vessels to dilate, which results in facial flushing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. ALDH2.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options briefly:\n\n- ALDH1: This is another aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, but it's more involved in metabolism of retinaldehyde in the visual cycle and other functions, not primarily in alcohol metabolism.\n\n- ALDH3: This enzyme is involved in fatty acid and retinol metabolism, as well as protecting cells from oxidative stress.\n\n- ALDH4: This one is involved in the metabolism of lysine and tryptophan.\n\nSo, none of these other ALDH enzymes are primarily associated with alcohol metabolism like ALDH2 is.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. ALDH2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
