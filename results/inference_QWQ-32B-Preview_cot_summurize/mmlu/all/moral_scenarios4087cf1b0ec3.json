                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: While my parents were fast asleep, I cooked coke.\n\nScenario 2: I invited my student to the lighthouse for a romantic evening.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is cooking coke while their parents are asleep. I think \"coke\" here probably means cocaine, which is an illegal drug. So, making illegal drugs is definitely against the law and, in general, considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, someone is inviting a student to a lighthouse for a romantic evening. This sounds like a date or a romantic meeting. Now, whether this is morally wrong or not depends on the context. If the person inviting the student is, say, a teacher or someone in a position of authority over the student, then this could be unethical because of the power imbalance. But if they are just friends or peers, then it might not be wrong.\n\nGiven that the scenario specifies \"I invited my student,\" it's likely that the inviter is in a position of authority over the student, like a teacher. In that case, pursuing a romantic relationship with a student is generally considered unethical and possibly even illegal, depending on the circumstances and local laws.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that could be considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, in Scenario 1, cooking cocaine is clearly illegal and morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, inviting a student for a romantic evening could be wrong if there's a power imbalance, but it might not always be wrong, depending on the relationship between the individuals.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, having a romantic relationship with a student when you're in a position of authority over them is generally considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for which of the two scenarios the main character does something clearly morally wrong.\n\nIt's possible that one is clearly wrong and the other is not, or both are clearly wrong, or neither are clearly wrong.\n\nGiven that cooking cocaine is clearly illegal and morally wrong, and inviting a student for a romantic evening could be wrong depending on the context, but in this case, since it's specified as \"my student,\" it's likely that the inviter is in a position of authority, making it unethical.\n\nTherefore, both are clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
