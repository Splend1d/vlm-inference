                    "text": "I'm going through this multiple-choice question about Great Zimbabwe, and I need to figure out why archaeologists long suggested that the walls couldn't have been built by indigenous sub-Saharan people. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that the architecture was clearly built by Egyptians. Now, I know that there's a history of Egyptian influence in Africa, but Great Zimbabwe is in modern-day Zimbabwe, which is pretty far south. I'm not sure if Egyptian architecture is similar to that of Great Zimbabwe. I think Egyptian architecture is known for pyramids and temples, whereas Great Zimbabwe is known for its stone ruins and dry-stone technique. So, maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B mentions that historical records show it was constructed by early Dutch settlers. Hmm, Dutch settlers in Zimbabwe? I thought Dutch settlers, or rather, Dutch colonizers, arrived in South Africa quite a bit later. Great Zimbabwe was built centuries before the Dutch arrived in the region. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption C suggests that symbolic motifs incorporated into the walls indicate they were built by Indian traders. I'm aware that there was some trade across the Indian Ocean, and Indian influences might have reached East Africa, but Great Zimbabwe is inland. I don't recall any strong connections between Indian traders and the Great Zimbabwe civilization. So, this option seems less plausible.\n\nOption D states that they thought sub-Saharan Africans were incapable of such achievements. This rings a bell. I've read about cultural biases and eurocentric views in archaeology where some scholars doubted the capabilities of indigenous peoples to build such complex structures. They often attributed these achievements to external influences rather than acknowledging the ingenuity of the local people.\n\nGiven this context, it seems that option D is the most accurate. Archaeologists in the past may have held racist views that led them to believe that sub-Saharan Africans couldn't have built something as impressive as Great Zimbabwe, so they sought external explanations.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should look up some background information on Great Zimbabwe and the history of its archaeological interpretation.\n\nAlright, after a quick search, I see that Great Zimbabwe was indeed built by the Shona people, an indigenous Bantu-speaking group in southern Africa. However, during the colonial period, European archaeologists and historians often refused to believe that Africans could have built such a massive and complex structure without foreign influence. This was part of a broader trend of dismissing the capabilities of African peoples and attributing their achievements to external sources, like Egyptians, Phoenicians, or Arabs.\n\nSo, it's clear that option D is the correct answer. Archaeologists long suggested that the walls couldn't have been built by indigenous sub-Saharan people because of their biased beliefs about the capabilities of African peoples.\n\nIt's important to recognize how cultural biases can influence scientific interpretations and to strive for more inclusive and accurate understandings of history.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
