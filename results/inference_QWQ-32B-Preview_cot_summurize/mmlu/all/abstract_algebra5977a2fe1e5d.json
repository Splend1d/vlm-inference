                    "text": "So I have this problem here: find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q. The options are 0, 4, 2, and 6. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what this means.\n\nSo, field extensions and their degrees are part of abstract algebra, specifically in the study of fields. The degree of a field extension [F:K] is the dimension of F as a vector space over K. Here, F is Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)), and K is Q, the rational numbers.\n\nFirst, let's simplify sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). That's sqrt(6). So, Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) is the same as Q(sqrt(6)). So, I need to find [Q(sqrt(6)):Q].\n\nI recall that for quadratic extensions, like Q(sqrt(d)), where d is square-free, the degree is 2. Is that the case here? Well, 6 is square-free, right? Because 6 = 2*3, and neither 2 nor 3 is a square except for 1.\n\nWait, but let me think carefully. Is sqrt(6) already in Q? No, because sqrt(6) is irrational. So, adding sqrt(6) to Q gives us a larger field.\n\nNow, to find the degree of this extension, I need to find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(6) over Q and see its degree.\n\nLet me consider x = sqrt(6). Then, x^2 = 6, so x^2 - 6 = 0. So, the minimal polynomial is x^2 - 6, which is a degree 2 polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the extension should be 2.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this minimal polynomial is indeed minimal. It needs to be irreducible over Q.\n\nIs x^2 - 6 irreducible over Q? Well, it factors as (x - sqrt(6))(x + sqrt(6)), but sqrt(6) is not in Q, so yes, it's irreducible over Q.\n\nTherefore, the degree should be 2.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 2 is one of them. But maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe there's a tower of extensions here.\n\nWait, Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is a different extension. Here, it's Q(sqrt(6)), which is Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)), but it's not the same as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nI think Q(sqrt(6)) is a subfield of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), but they are not equal.\n\nWait, is Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) equal to Q(sqrt(6))?\n\nLet me see. If I have Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), that's the smallest field containing Q, sqrt(2), and sqrt(3). Whereas Q(sqrt(6)) is the smallest field containing Q and sqrt(6).\n\nIs sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) in Q(sqrt(6))? I don't think so.\n\nFor example, sqrt(2) is not in Q(sqrt(6)), because if it were, then sqrt(6)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(3) would also be in Q(sqrt(6)), which I don't think it is.\n\nSo, Q(sqrt(6)) is smaller than Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nIn fact, Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has degree 4 over Q, because [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q(sqrt(2))][Q(sqrt(2)):Q].\n\n[Q(sqrt(2)):Q] = 2, since minimal polynomial is x^2 - 2.\n\nThen, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q(sqrt(2))] is the degree of the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)).\n\nDoes sqrt(3) belong to Q(sqrt(2))? No, because otherwise sqrt(3) would be a linear combination of 1 and sqrt(2) with rational coefficients, which it's not.\n\nSo, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q(sqrt(2))] = 2, since minimal polynomial is x^2 - 3.\n\nTherefore, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q] = 2*2 = 4.\n\nBut Q(sqrt(6)) is a different extension.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought [Q(sqrt(6)):Q] = 2.\n\nIs there a relationship between Q(sqrt(6)) and Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))?\n\nWell, Q(sqrt(6)) is contained in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), because sqrt(6) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(3), which is in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, Q(sqrt(6)) is a subfield of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nNow, what is the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q(sqrt(6))?\n\nWell, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q(sqrt(6))][Q(sqrt(6)):Q].\n\nWe have [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q] = 4, and [Q(sqrt(6)):Q] = 2, so [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q(sqrt(6))] = 4/2 = 2.\n\nSo, that makes sense.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the basis of Q(sqrt(6)) over Q.\n\nSince [Q(sqrt(6)):Q] = 2, a basis is {1, sqrt(6)}.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe the problem is trying to trick me by mentioning sqrt(2)*sqrt(3), making me think of multiple square roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's some interaction between sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) that I'm missing.\n\nWait, but in Q(sqrt(6)), I only have sqrt(6), not necessarily sqrt(2) or sqrt(3).\n\nUnless, perhaps, in Q(sqrt(6)), I can express sqrt(2) or sqrt(3) in terms of sqrt(6).\n\nBut that doesn't seem possible, because sqrt(2) is not in Q(sqrt(6)), as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, suppose I try to write sqrt(2) in terms of sqrt(6).\n\nIf sqrt(2) were in Q(sqrt(6)), then sqrt(2) = a + b*sqrt(6), for some a, b in Q.\n\nThen, squaring both sides: 2 = (a + b*sqrt(6))^2 = a^2 + 2ab*sqrt(6) + 6b^2.\n\nThen, 2 = (a^2 + 6b^2) + 2ab*sqrt(6).\n\nBut sqrt(6) is irrational, so for this to hold, the coefficients must separately be equal.\n\nSo, a^2 + 6b^2 = 2, and 2ab = 0.\n\nFrom 2ab = 0, either a = 0 or b = 0.\n\nIf a = 0, then 6b^2 = 2, so b^2 = 1/3, so b = sqrt(1/3), which is not rational.\n\nIf b = 0, then a^2 = 2, so a = sqrt(2), which is also not rational.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(2) is not in Q(sqrt(6)).\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(3) is not in Q(sqrt(6)).\n\nTherefore, Q(sqrt(6)) is strictly smaller than Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nSo, my initial conclusion that [Q(sqrt(6)):Q] = 2 seems correct.\n\nBut why is the problem phrased as Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) instead of Q(sqrt(6))?\n\nMaybe to make it more confusing, or to see if I recognize that sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) = sqrt(6).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, is sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) always equal to sqrt(6)?\n\nIn real numbers, yes, because sqrt(a)*sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab) for a, b >= 0.\n\nBut in general, in fields where square roots might not behave nicely, is this still true?\n\nWell, in Q, where we're dealing with real numbers, it holds.\n\nBut perhaps in other fields, this identity doesn't hold.\n\nBut since we're in Q, which is a subset of real numbers, it should be fine.\n\nTherefore, Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(6)), and [Q(sqrt(6)):Q] = 2.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 2 is one of them.\n\nHowever, maybe the problem expects a different answer.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different way to interpret sqrt(2)*sqrt(3).\n\nIs there a possibility that sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) could generate a larger extension?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some extensions, sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) could be expressed differently.\n\nWait, but in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) = sqrt(6), as before.\n\nBut in Q(sqrt(6)), sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) = sqrt(6), which is already in the field.\n\nSo, I don't see how Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) could be larger than Q(sqrt(6)).\n\nTherefore, [Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)):Q] = [Q(sqrt(6)):Q] = 2.\n\nHence, the answer should be 2.\n\nBut the options include 4, which is the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q, but that's not what's being asked here.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem wants to see if I mix up these two extensions.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the degree is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
