                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a beam of light entering a glass window pane from the air, and it's asking about what changes happen to the light's properties. The options are:\n\nA. frequency and wavelength\n\nB. speed and wavelength\n\nC. speed only\n\nD. wavelength only\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what happens when light moves from one medium to another, like from air into glass. I remember that light changes speed when it enters a different medium, but I'm a bit fuzzy on exactly how that affects its frequency and wavelength.\n\nLet me think about the basic properties of light. Light is an electromagnetic wave, and it has properties like speed, frequency, and wavelength, which are related by the equation:\n\nspeed of light (c) = frequency (f) \u00d7 wavelength (\u03bb)\n\nSo, c = f \u00d7 \u03bb\n\nNow, when light enters a different medium, like from air into glass, its speed changes because the medium affects how fast light can travel through it. Glass has a higher refractive index than air, which means light slows down when it enters glass.\n\nSo, if the speed of light decreases, what happens to frequency and wavelength? According to the equation c = f \u00d7 \u03bb, if c decreases, and assuming f stays the same, then \u03bb must also decrease to keep the equation balanced.\n\nWait, but does frequency change or not? I think frequency remains the same because the frequency of light is determined by the source that emitted it, and it doesn't change as light travels through different media. So, if f stays the same and c decreases, then \u03bb must decrease proportionally.\n\nThat makes sense. So, in this case, both speed and wavelength change, but frequency remains the same.\n\nLet me double-check that. Is there any reason why frequency would change when light enters a new medium? I don't think so. Frequency is related to the energy of the photons, and that shouldn't change just because the light is moving through a different material.\n\nOkay, so frequency stays the same, and speed decreases, which in turn causes wavelength to decrease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that only speed and wavelength change, but frequency remains the same.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. frequency and wavelength\n\nB. speed and wavelength\n\nC. speed only\n\nD. wavelength only\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct one, as both speed and wavelength change, but frequency does not.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure about this. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nI recall that when light refracts, its direction changes, but that's related to its speed in different media, which is already covered by the speed changing.\n\nAlso, I've heard about dispersion, where different wavelengths bend by different amounts, but in this case, it's monochromatic light, meaning it's a single wavelength, so dispersion shouldn't be a factor here.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with option B.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A says frequency and wavelength change. But as I thought earlier, frequency should remain the same, only wavelength changes in response to the change in speed.\n\nOption C says speed only changes. But according to c = f \u00d7 \u03bb, if speed changes and frequency stays the same, wavelength must change as well.\n\nOption D says wavelength only changes. But that can't be right because wavelength is directly related to speed and frequency, and frequency isn't changing, so speed must change too.\n\nTherefore, the only logical choice is B, speed and wavelength change.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
