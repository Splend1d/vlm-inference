This is generally considered theft or fraud because they are taking advantage of someone else's financial resources without consent. In the US, using someone else's credit card without authorization is illegal and is also widely regarded as morally wrong. It violates principles of honesty and respect for others' property.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I refilled the shampoo bottle with shampoo and put it back in the shower.\"\n\nThis scenario describes refilling a shampoo bottle and returning it to its place in the shower. At first glance, this seems harmless, perhaps even helpful. However, the morality of this action depends on the context. If the shampoo belongs to the person refilling it, or if they have permission to use and maintain the shampoo, then there is no moral issue. However, if the shampoo belongs to someone else and the refiller is essentially replacing the product without permission, it could be seen as meddling or invasion of privacy. But generally, this action is not considered morally wrong unless there are specific circumstances that make it so.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 clearly involves morally wrong behavior, while Scenario 2 does not necessarily do so.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Wrong, Not wrong**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
