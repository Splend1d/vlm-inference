                    "text": "I think the answer is C. Orthodox. I've heard that Orthodox churches are known for their intricate icons, which are religious images used in worship and devotion. They play a significant role in the faith and are often found throughout the church, especially in the iconostasis, which is like a screen or wall covered in icons that separates the nave from the sanctuary. So, I believe Orthodox churches are particularly famous for their icons.\n\nBut let me double-check. Anglican churches, which are part of the Church of England and its offshoots, do have some icons, but they are not as central to their worship as in Orthodox churches. Catholic churches also have religious images, but again, not to the same extent as in Orthodoxy. Lutheran churches, founded by Martin Luther during the Protestant Reformation, have a more varied approach to icons; some Lutheran churches may have images, but others may avoid them due to Protestant iconoclasm.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm pretty sure that Orthodox churches are the main ones known for their icons. But maybe I should look it up to be absolutely sure.\n\nLet me search for \"which church is known for icons?\" Online, I find that Orthodox Christianity is indeed renowned for its use of icons in worship and theology. Icons are not just decorative; they are venerated and play a crucial role in Orthodox spirituality. The Catholic Church also has a tradition of using images, but the emphasis and the theological significance seem to be greater in Orthodoxy.\n\nAnother point is that during the Iconoclasm period in the 8th and 9th centuries, there was a debate within Christianity about whether icons should be used or destroyed. The Seventh Ecumenical Council ultimately affirmed the veneration of icons in the Eastern Church, which is now the Orthodox Church.\n\nSo, all of this leads me to confirm that the correct answer is C. Orthodox.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
