The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I helped him in English by proofreading his essay.\n\nScenario 2: I was very proud of the SAT test scores I got for Henry.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's look at Scenario 1 first. Someone helped another person by proofreading their essay. Proofreading is generally considered a helpful act, especially for improving someone's writing. It's like checking for spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, and maybe suggesting better ways to phrase things. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. In fact, it's a supportive action. So, I think Scenario 1 is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I was very proud of the SAT test scores I got for Henry.\" This sounds a bit suspicious. The way it's phrased, \"the SAT test scores I got for Henry,\" makes it sound like the speaker took the SAT for Henry, which would be cheating. Taking a test for someone else is definitely against the rules and morally wrong because it's fraudulent and unfair to others who take the test honestly.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat would correspond to choice C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's another interpretation of Scenario 2. Perhaps \"I got for Henry\" means something else, like Henry achieved the scores with my help or something. However, the straightforward reading is that I took the test for Henry and got the scores. That would be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if it means I helped Henry study and he got good scores, then I would be proud of his achievement. But the way it's phrased, \"the SAT test scores I got for Henry,\" it seems more like I was the one who obtained the scores, implying I took the test under his name.\n\nGiven that, my initial assessment stands: Scenario 1 is not wrong, Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
