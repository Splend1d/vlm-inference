This seems like a potentially dangerous action, as it could lead to harming the environment and possibly putting people's lives at risk. According to ordinary moral standards, being responsible and taking necessary precautions to prevent harm is important. So, not ensuring that the campfire is completely extinguished could be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character washed their dirty kid with a washcloth dipped in soap. This seems like a normal and responsible action for a caregiver. Keeping a child clean is a basic aspect of childcare and hygiene. There doesn't appear to be anything morally wrong with this scenario.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
