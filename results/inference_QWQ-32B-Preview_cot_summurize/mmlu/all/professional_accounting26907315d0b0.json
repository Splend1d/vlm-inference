                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question regarding how Goll Co. should account for its investments in Rose Co. and Jave Co. So, Goll has a 25% stake in Rose and an 18% stake in Jave. The key point here is that neither investment gives Goll the ability to significantly influence these companies' operations or financial policies. The question is asking which of these investments should be accounted for using the equity method.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the equity method is and when it's used. The equity method is an accounting technique used to record investments where the investor has significant influence over the investee but does not control it. Significant influence is generally thought to exist if the investor owns between 20% and 50% of the outstanding voting stock of the investee.\n\nIn this case, Goll has a 25% interest in Rose and an 18% interest in Jave. According to the general rule, a 25% ownership stake in Rose would typically indicate significant influence, as it's above the 20% threshold. On the other hand, an 18% stake in Jave is below the 20% threshold and might not be considered to provide significant influence.\n\nHowever, the question mentions that neither investment gives Goll the ability to exercise significant influence over either company's operating and financial policies. This seems contradictory to the ownership percentages, especially for Rose where Goll has a 25% stake, which is usually considered to provide significant influence.\n\nPerhaps there are other factors at play that prevent Goll from having significant influence despite the ownership percentages. For example, there might be multiple shareholders with similar stakes, or there could be voting agreements or other arrangements that dilute Goll's voting power.\n\nGiven that the question states neither investment provides significant influence, I think that overrides the ownership percentages. Therefore, neither investment should be accounted for using the equity method.\n\nBut let me double-check this. The equity method is based on the concept of significant influence, which is often associated with ownership between 20% and 50%. However, the text says that neither investment provides significant influence, despite the ownership percentages.\n\nSo, even though Goll has a 25% stake in Rose, which is typically within the range for significant influence, it's stated that this does not provide significant influence. Similarly, the 18% in Jave is below the threshold and doesn't provide significant influence either.\n\nTherefore, neither investment should be accounted for using the equity method.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Both Rose and Jave.\n\nB. Rose only.\n\nC. Jave only.\n\nD. Neither Rose nor Jave.\n\nI think the correct answer is D. Neither Rose nor Jave.\n\nBut I should consider if there's any other factor that might require using the equity method. For instance, if Goll has the ability to exercise significant influence through other means besides ownership percentage, but the question states that neither investment provides significant influence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if Goll has board representation or some other form of influence, but again, the question says neither investment provides significant influence.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is D. Neither Rose nor Jave should be accounted for using the equity method.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nd."
