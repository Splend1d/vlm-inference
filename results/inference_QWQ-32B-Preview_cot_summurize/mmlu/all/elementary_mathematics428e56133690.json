I remember that division can be thought of as how many times one number fits into another. So, 8 goes into 123 how many times?\n\nFirst, I can think about multiples of 8 that are close to 123. Let's see:\n\n8 times 10 is 80.\n\n8 times 15 is 120.\n\nWait, 8 times 15 is 120, which is less than 123.\n\nIf I do 8 times 16, that would be 128, which is more than 123. So, 15 times 8 is 120, and that's the largest multiple of 8 that's less than or equal to 123.\n\nNow, to find the remainder, I subtract 120 from 123.\n\n123 minus 120 is 3.\n\nSo, the quotient is 15 and the remainder is 3.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 15 remainder 7\n\nB. 15 remainder 3\n\nC. 16 remainder 5\n\nD. 16 remainder 1\n\nIt looks like option B matches what I got.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me try another approach. I can use long division.\n\nSo, dividing 123 by 8.\n\n8 goes into 12 one time, since 8 times 1 is 8.\n\nSubtract 8 from 12, which leaves 4.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 3, making it 43.\n\nNow, 8 goes into 43 how many times?\n\n8 times 5 is 40.\n\nSubtract 40 from 43, which leaves a remainder of 3.\n\nSo, the quotient is 15 and the remainder is 3.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of multiplication.\n\nIf 8 times 15 is 120, and 123 minus 120 is 3, then again, quotient is 15 and remainder is 3.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nLet me see if any of the other options make sense.\n\nOption A has a remainder of 7, which would be if the quotient was 15 and 8 times 15 is 120, plus 7 is 127, which is more than 123.\n\nSo, that can't be right.\n\nOption C has a quotient of 16 and remainder 5.\n\n8 times 16 is 128, plus 5 is 133, which is way more than 123.\n\nNot correct.\n\nOption D has quotient 16 and remainder 1.\n\n8 times 16 is 128, plus 1 is 129, still more than 123.\n\nNo, that doesn't work.\n\nSo, definitely, option B is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can check if 15 times 8 plus 3 equals 123.\n\n15 times 8 is 120, plus 3 is 123.\n\nPerfect, it matches.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
