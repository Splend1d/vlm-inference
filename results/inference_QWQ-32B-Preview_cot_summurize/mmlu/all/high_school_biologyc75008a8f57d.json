                    "text": "Let's see what photosynthesis needs. I remember that photosynthesis is how plants make their food using sunlight. So, it must require light for sure. Let me look at the options.\n\nOption A says glucose, light, CO2. Wait, but isn't glucose what plants produce during photosynthesis? So, do they need glucose to perform photosynthesis? That doesn't make sense. They need something to make glucose.\n\nOption B says light, CO2, and water. That sounds familiar. In photosynthesis, plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. So, this seems right.\n\nOption C says water, soil, and O2. Soil isn't directly involved in the photosynthesis process, as far as I know. It's more about the nutrients plants get from the soil. And O2 is a product of photosynthesis, not a reactant.\n\nOption D says O2, water, and light. Again, O2 is produced during photosynthesis, so it wouldn't make sense for plants to need oxygen to perform photosynthesis.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems correct: light, CO2, and water are what's needed for photosynthesis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
