                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what \"ticket splitting\" means based on these options. Let me see:\n\nOption A says: \"A presidential nominee selects a running mate who can appeal to voter groups whose support of the nominee is weak.\" So, this is about choosing a vice-presidential candidate to attract certain voter groups. That sounds more like a strategy for broadening appeal rather than splitting the ticket.\n\nOption B says: \"A voter chooses the presidential nominee of one major party, but chooses congressional nominees of the other major party.\" Hmm, this seems interesting. Ticket splitting, as I understand it, is when a voter selects candidates from different parties for different offices in the same election. So, if someone picks a Republican for president and a Democrat for Congress, that's splitting the ticket.\n\nOption C: \"A mayor orders the local police force to hand out fewer parking violations in the weeks leading up to the general election.\" This seems like a political maneuver to gain popularity before an election, but it's not directly related to ticket splitting. Ticket splitting is about voting for different parties for different offices, not about a politician's actions before an election.\n\nOption D: \"A delegate to a national party convention supports the front-runner but remains uncommitted on the party platform.\" This is about a delegate's stance at a convention. It doesn't seem directly related to ticket splitting, which is more about voter behavior in elections.\n\nBased on this, option B seems to best describe ticket splitting. It's about a voter choosing candidates from different parties for different offices in the same election.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
