                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about fiat money. So, the options are: A) Cigarettes used as money in prisons, B) Dollar bills, C) Gold coins, and D) Arrowheads used as a medium of exchange. I need to pick the one that best represents fiat money.\n\nFirst off, I should remember what fiat money is. Fiat money is a type of currency that has value because the government decrees it as legal tender, but it doesn't have intrinsic value itself. It's not backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver. So, it's basically money because the government says it is.\n\nOption A is cigarettes used as money in prisons. I've heard about this before. In prison systems, cigarettes often serve as a medium of exchange among inmates. But this seems more like a barter system or commodity money, where cigarettes have value because they are desirable goods in that environment. It's not backed by a government, so I don't think this is fiat money.\n\nOption B is dollar bills. Now, dollar bills are the currency used in the United States. Historically, the US dollar was backed by gold, but that's not the case anymore. Since the gold standard was abandoned, the US dollar is now fiat money. It has value because the government says it does and because people have faith in it. So, this seems like a strong candidate for fiat money.\n\nOption C is gold coins. Gold coins have intrinsic value because gold itself is valuable. They are considered commodity money because their value comes from the metal they are made of. So, this is not fiat money.\n\nOption D is arrowheads used as a medium of exchange. Arrowheads, in some historical contexts, were used as money, especially in Native American cultures. However, these were likely used based on their scarcity and cultural significance, making them more akin to commodity money or collectibles rather than fiat money.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems that dollar bills are the clear example of fiat money because they are established as legal tender by the government and do not have intrinsic value beyond the paper they are printed on.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. Cigarettes in prisons are a form of alternative currency, but they are not fiat because there's no governing body declaring them as legal tender within that system. Similarly, gold coins and arrowheads have their own intrinsic values or cultural significance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B) Dollar bills.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
