So, I need to find out how many subjects she studied.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much time she spent on each subject. Since it's equal for all subjects, and she spent 1/2 hour on science, that means each subject took 1/2 hour.\n\nNow, to find out how many subjects she studied, I can divide the total time spent on homework by the time spent per subject. So, total time is 3 hours, and each subject took 1/2 hour.\n\nSo, number of subjects = total time / time per subject = 3 / (1/2).\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, right? So, 3 divided by 1/2 is the same as 3 multiplied by 2/1, which is 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If she studied 6 subjects, each taking 1/2 hour, then total time would be 6 * 1/2 = 3 hours, which matches the total time she spent on homework.\n\nSo, the answer should be 6 subjects.\n\nBut let's look at the options:\n\nA. 4 subjects\n\nB. 2 subjects\n\nC. 6 subjects\n\nD. 5 subjects\n\nOption C is 6 subjects, which matches my calculation.\n\nWait, but the question says \"1 over 2 hour on science\", which clearly means 1/2 hour. Is there any chance it could mean something else? Maybe \"1 hour over 2 hours on science\"? But that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typing error and it's supposed to be \"one and a half hours\" on science. If that's the case, then it would be 1.5 hours per subject.\n\nBut the question clearly says \"1 over 2 hour\", which is 1/2 hour.\n\nSo, sticking with my original reasoning, the answer should be 6 subjects.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the equal amounts of time on all subjects. Maybe science took 1/2 hour, and the others took different times, but the question says equal amounts of time on all subjects.\n\nNo, it's clear that each subject took the same amount of time, and science is one of those subjects taking 1/2 hour.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{C}"
