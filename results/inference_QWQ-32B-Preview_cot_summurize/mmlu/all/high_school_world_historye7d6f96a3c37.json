                    "text": "Let's see what this quote is about. It mentions that invaders brought various plants and foods from Eurasia and Africa to America. Then it says that a Spanish nobleman could require his Indians to furnish his table with these things. The phrase \"his Indians\" is key here, and the question is asking about the economic practice referred to by that phrase.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"his Indians\" means in this context. It sounds like the Indians are under the control or ownership of the Spanish nobleman. So, perhaps it's a system where the nobleman has some authority over the Indians, and they have to provide labor or goods for him.\n\nOption A is slavery. Slavery is a system where people are owned as property and forced to work without pay. If \"his Indians\" means the nobleman owns them as slaves, that could be a possibility.\n\nOption B is indentured servitude. This is a system where people agree to work for a certain period in exchange for something, like passage to a new land. Indentured servants are bound to their master for a set time but are not owned as property.\n\nOption C is the encomienda system. I recall that this was a Spanish colonial system where the crown granted conquistadors or other settlers the right to demand labor and tribute from the local indigenous people. So, in this system, the Indians are under the protection or control of the encomendero, who is supposed to protect them and Christianize them in return for their labor and tribute.\n\nOption D is the apprentice system, which is about learning a trade or skill under the guidance of a master. It doesn't seem directly related to the context here.\n\nGiven the context of Spanish noblemen in the Americas and the reference to \"his Indians,\" it seems most likely that this is referring to the encomienda system. In this system, the nobleman, or encomendero, had the right to demand labor and tribute from the indigenous people in his encomienda.\n\nSlavery is a possibility, but in many Spanish colonies, especially in the areas where the encomienda system was in place, slavery was not the primary form of labor extraction. The encomienda system was more about controlling the labor and tribute of the indigenous population without outright ownership.\n\nIndentured servitude usually involved voluntary agreements, whereas the encomienda system was imposed on the indigenous people without their consent.\n\nThe apprentice system doesn't fit the context of providing labor for the nobleman's table.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be C, the encomienda system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
