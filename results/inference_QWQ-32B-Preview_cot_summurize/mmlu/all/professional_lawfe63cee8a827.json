                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about solicitation in criminal law. The question is: \"A criminal actor committed the crime of solicitation. Which of the following does not apply to solicitation?\" And then there are four options:\n\nA. It is an agreement between two or more to commit a crime.\n\nB. It is solicitation of another to commit a felony.\n\nC. No act is needed other than the solicitation.\n\nD. Withdrawal is generally not a defense.\n\nI need to figure out which one of these statements doesn't apply to solicitation. First, I should understand what solicitation means in legal terms.\n\nSolicitation is when someone asks, encourages, or requests another person to commit a crime. The person who solicits is called the solicitor, and the person being asked is the solicitee. Now, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"It is an agreement between two or more to commit a crime.\" Hmm, this sounds like conspiracy, not necessarily solicitation. In conspiracy, there's an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and usually, an overt act is required to prosecute. But in solicitation, it's just one person soliciting another without necessarily having an agreement. So, maybe this doesn't apply to solicitation.\n\nOption B says: \"It is solicitation of another to commit a felony.\" This seems straightforward. Solicitation typically involves asking someone to commit a felony. So, this applies to solicitation.\n\nOption C says: \"No act is needed other than the solicitation.\" That makes sense because solicitation is a completed crime once the act of soliciting is done, regardless of whether the solicitee agrees or commits the crime. So, no further act is needed beyond the solicitation itself.\n\nOption D says: \"Withdrawal is generally not a defense.\" In many jurisdictions, withdrawal is not a defense to solicitation because the crime is complete once the solicitation is made. Even if the solicitor changes their mind later, the act of soliciting has already been committed.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, Option A seems to be the one that doesn't apply to solicitation because it describes more of a conspiracy than solicitation. Solicitation doesn't require an agreement; it's just the act of soliciting someone to commit a crime.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe in some contexts, solicitation could involve an agreement. But from what I recall, solicitation is simply asking someone to commit a crime, without needing mutual agreement. Whereas conspiracy requires an agreement between the parties to commit a crime.\n\nAlso, option B specifies that it's solicitation to commit a felony. In some jurisdictions, solicitation can apply to misdemeanors as well, but often it's associated with felonies. But since the question is about what doesn't apply, and option B is generally applicable, it's probably not the answer.\n\nOption C is correct because solicitation is a complete crime upon the act of soliciting.\n\nOption D is also correct because withdrawal isn't typically a defense.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Option A, as it describes conspiracy more accurately than solicitation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]\n\n"
