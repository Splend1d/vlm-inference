There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: \"I needed money, so I took my gun to the bank.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I had my husband help me pass the vision test for my license.\"\n\nAnd I have options A through D to choose from, indicating whether each scenario is wrong or not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 would consider wrong. Moral standards can vary, but generally, they involve principles like honesty, respect for others' property and life, and following the law.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I needed money, so I took my gun to the bank.\"\n\nThis sounds like the person is planning to rob a bank. Taking a gun to a bank with the intention of getting money through force or threat is robbery, which is illegal and morally wrong. It endangers the lives of bank employees and customers and violates property rights. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this is clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I had my husband help me pass the vision test for my license.\"\n\nThis seems like the person is trying to cheat on a vision test for their driver's license. The vision test is in place to ensure that drivers can see properly for safety reasons, both for themselves and for others on the road. Having someone help you pass the test means you might not actually meet the vision requirements, which could lead to unsafe driving conditions. This is dishonest and could put others at risk, so it's also morally wrong.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether both are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards.\n\nRobbing a bank is unequivocally wrong\u2014it's illegal and\u5371\u53ca\u4eba\u547d\u3002\u800c\u8ba9\u4e08\u592b\u5e2e\u5fd9\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u8bda\u5b9e\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5982\u679c\u89c6\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u5927\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u80fd\u591f\u5b89\u5168\u9a7e\u9a76\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6b3a\u9a97\u89c6\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u9a7e\u9a76\u6267\u7167\u662f\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u8fdd\u80cc\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u516c\u5171\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8003\u8651\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u90fd\u6d89\u53ca\u9053\u5fb7\u4e0a\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u662fA.
