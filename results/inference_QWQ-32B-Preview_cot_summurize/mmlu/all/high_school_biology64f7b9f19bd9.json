                    "text": "So I've got this genetics problem here about minks and their fur color. It says that the gene for brown fur (B) is dominant over the gene for silver fur (b). So, that means if a mink has at least one B allele, it will have brown fur, and only if it has two b alleles will it have silver fur.\n\nThe question is asking for which set of genotypes, when crossed, could produce offspring with silver fur, but both parents have brown fur. So, both parents are brown, but they can have silver-furred offspring.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for both parents to have brown fur. That means both parents must have at least one B allele, right? So, their possible genotypes are BB or Bb.\n\nBut, the offspring have silver fur, which means they must have the bb genotype, right? So, both offspring must have received a b allele from each parent.\n\nSo, for both parents to be brown but able to produce a silver-furred offspring, they both must be carriers of the b allele. That means they both must be heterozygous, meaning their genotype is Bb.\n\nLet me think about it step by step.\n\nOption A is BB BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant for brown fur. If they have offspring, all offspring will be BB, which is brown fur. So, no silver-furred offspring here.\n\nOption B is BB Bb. One parent is homozygous dominant (BB), and the other is heterozygous (Bb). If they have offspring, possible genotypes are BB or Bb, both of which result in brown fur. So, no silver-furred offspring here either.\n\nOption C is Bb Bb. Both parents are heterozygous. So, when they have offspring, possible genotypes are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. So, there's a chance of having bb, which is silver fur.\n\nOption D is Bb bb. One parent is heterozygous (Bb), and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). So, possible offspring genotypes are Bb and bb. So, yes, there can be silver-furred offspring.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies that both parents have brown fur. So, the parent with bb genotype has silver fur, not brown. So, option D is invalid because one parent has silver fur.\n\nTherefore, the only valid option is C, where both parents are Bb, meaning both have brown fur, but they can produce offspring with bb genotype, which is silver fur.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nIn option C, both parents are Bb.\n\nPunnett square:\n\nParent 1: Bb\n\nParent 2: Bb\n\nPossible offspring:\n\n- BB (brown)\n\n- Bb (brown)\n\n- Bb (brown)\n\n- bb (silver)\n\nSo, indeed, there's a possibility of silver-furred offspring.\n\nIn option D, one parent is bb, which has silver fur, not brown, so it doesn't meet the condition that both parents have brown fur.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Bb Bb.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
