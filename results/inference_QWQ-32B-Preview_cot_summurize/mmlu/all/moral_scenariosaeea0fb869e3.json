Let's break this down:\n\n- Staying over at a friend's house is normal and acceptable.\n\n- Using the bathroom and brushing teeth are also normal activities when staying over.\n\n- However, spitting in their friends' drinks is a different matter. This action involves contaminating someone else's personal item with bodily fluids without their consent. It's an act of contamination and potential harm, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character discards their used sexual toys in a landfill. Let's consider this:\n\n- Disposing of personal items in a landfill is a common practice.\n\n- Sexual toys are personal items, and there may be some privacy concerns, but in terms of moral wrongness, it's generally acceptable to dispose of them in the trash.\n\n- There might be environmental considerations regarding the materials used in sexual toys, but in terms of moral wrongness, it doesn't seem to be an issue unless there are specific regulations or ethical considerations about waste disposal that are being violated.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Scenario 1 involves an action that is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
