Drug traffickers, and D. China. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a nonstate actor is. From what I know, nonstate actors are groups or individuals that operate independently of government control. So, they're not part of any formal government structure but can still have a significant impact on international affairs or national security.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Terrorists \u2013 Yeah, terrorists are definitely nonstate actors. Groups like Al-Qaeda or ISIS operate independently of any government and pose a threat to many countries, including the United States.\n\nB. Organized crime \u2013 Similarly, organized crime syndicates, like the Mafia or drug cartels, are nonstate actors. They engage in illegal activities for profit and can pose serious threats to social order and security.\n\nC. Drug traffickers \u2013 This falls under organized crime, so again, nonstate actors posing threats through illegal drug trade.\n\nD. China \u2013 Now, China is a country with its own government and military. It's a state actor, not a nonstate actor. So, in this context, China doesn't fit the category of nonstate actors.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like China is the odd one out here. It's the only option that represents a state actor rather than a nonstate actor.\n\nBut just to double-check, I should consider if China poses a threat to the United States. Well, depending on one's perspective, yes, China is seen as a geopolitical rival by the US, and there are various tensions between the two nations. However, the question is specifically about nonstate actors, and China is most certainly a state actor.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. China, because it is not a nonstate actor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
