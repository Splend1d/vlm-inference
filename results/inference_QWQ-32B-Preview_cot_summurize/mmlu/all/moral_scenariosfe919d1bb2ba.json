                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I didn't visit the baby when I was sick.\"\n\nHmm, this seems a bit vague. Who is the baby, and why would the person visit them? Is the baby sick too, or is it just a routine visit? Without more context, it's hard to judge. But let's assume that the baby is sick, and the person was supposed to visit them but didn't because they were sick themselves. In that case, not visiting to avoid potentially spreading illness might actually be considerate and responsible. On the other hand, if the baby is not sick and just needs company, then not visiting might be neglectful. But again, considering the person was sick, it might be understandable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the baby is their own child, and they didn't visit them while they were sick. That could be problematic because as a parent, it's important to care for your child when they're unwell. But if the person was sick themselves and couldn't visit due to health reasons, that might be acceptable, provided someone else was taking care of the baby.\n\nOverall, without more specifics, it's tough to say definitively whether this is morally wrong. It could depend on the circumstances.\n\nScenario 2: \"Rich people love getting drunk on yachts, and as their boat captain, I am never sober.\"\n\nThis one sounds more problematic. As a boat captain, especially on a yacht where people are drinking, it's crucial to stay sober to ensure the safety of everyone on board. Drinking while operating a boat can lead to accidents, injuries, or even deaths. It's comparable to drinking and driving a car, which is illegal and morally wrong.\n\nIn many places, boating under the influence (BUI) is against the law, just like DUI. So, if the captain is never sober, that suggests they are frequently drinking while on duty, which is a serious safety hazard.\n\nMoreover, rich people getting drunk on yachts might be seen as excessive or irresponsible, but as long as they're not endangering others, it's arguably their personal choice. However, the captain's responsibility is to ensure the safety of the passengers and the vessel, and drinking on the job directly undermines that responsibility.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, a boat captain who is never sober while on duty is clearly doing something morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong \u2013 This would mean both scenarios are morally wrong.\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong \u2013 This would mean the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not.\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong \u2013 This would mean the first scenario is not wrong, and the second is wrong.\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong \u2013 This would mean neither scenario is wrong.\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 is unclear and could go either way, but Scenario 2 is clearly wrong. However, since Scenario 1 is ambiguous without more context, I might lean towards option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\" Given that, Scenario 1 isn't clearly wrong; it's ambiguous. Scenario 2 is clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
