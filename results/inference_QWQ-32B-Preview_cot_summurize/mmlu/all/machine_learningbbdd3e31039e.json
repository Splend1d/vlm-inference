                    "text": "Let's see what these statements are about. The first one says that industrial-scale neural networks are normally trained on CPUs, not GPUs. And the second one says that the ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters.\n\nOkay, starting with Statement 1. I know that neural networks require a lot of computational power, especially when they're large and being trained on big datasets. I've heard that GPUs are really good for handling the matrix operations that neural networks involve, so I'm a bit surprised by this statement. Maybe it's about the past, but nowadays, isn't it common to use GPUs for training neural networks?\n\nLet me think about it. CPUs are general-purpose processors, while GPUs are designed for handling multiple tasks simultaneously, which is perfect for the parallel computations in neural networks. So, I believe that for industrial-scale training, where time and efficiency are crucial, GPUs are the preferred choice. In fact, companies like NVIDIA have made a name for themselves by providing powerful GPUs for machine learning and deep learning tasks.\n\nWait, but maybe there are some cases where CPUs are used for training. For example, if the network is not too large, or if the company has a lot of CPUs available. But for large-scale training, I think GPUs are standard.\n\nSo, I think Statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, Statement 2: ResNet-50 has over 1 billion parameters. ResNet is a well-known architecture for convolutional neural networks, especially in image recognition tasks. I remember that ResNet comes in different sizes, like ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101, where the number refers to the number of layers in the network.\n\nBut I doubt that ResNet-50 has over 1 billion parameters. I think that's too much. For example, I know that AlexNet has about 60 million parameters, and VGG-16 has around 138 million parameters. ResNet-50 is more complex than AlexNet but probably not that much more.\n\nI think ResNet-50 has around 25 million parameters. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look it up, but since this is a quiz, I'll have to go with my gut feeling.\n\nSo, I think Statement 2 is also false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. False, False.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nStatement 1: False, because GPUs are typically used for training industrial-scale neural networks due to their computational advantages.\n\nStatement 2: False, because ResNet-50 has approximately 25 million parameters, not over 1 billion.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
