                    "text": "I'm trying to understand why members of the astrovirus family are only recently being recognized as significant enteric viruses for humans. The options given are:\n\nA. The genome has been identified by the new method of deep sequencing\n\nB. A new vector has been discovered\n\nC. They infect a wide range of domestic animals and so contaminate meat\n\nD. Knowledge of their replication as positive sense ssRNA viruses is now complete\n\nFirst, I need to recall what astroviruses are. I know that astroviruses are a group of viruses that primarily cause gastroenteritis in humans and other animals. They are called \"astro\" viruses because their capsid has a star-like shape when viewed under an electron microscope.\n\nOption A mentions deep sequencing. I know that deep sequencing, also known as next-generation sequencing, is a technology that allows for rapid and massive sequencing of DNA and RNA. This has revolutionized virology by enabling the detection of novel viruses and variants that were previously unknown or difficult to identify with traditional methods. So, it's possible that through deep sequencing, more astrovirus genotypes have been identified, leading to a better understanding of their significance in human disease.\n\nOption B talks about a new vector being discovered. Vectors are organisms that transmit viruses from one host to another, like mosquitoes transmitting Zika virus. If a new vector for astroviruses has been found, that could mean they are being spread more widely or in new ways, making them more significant. However, I don't recall any recent discoveries of new vectors for astroviruses.\n\nOption C suggests that astroviruses infect a wide range of domestic animals, leading to contamination of meat. While it's true that astroviruses can infect various animals, including mammals and birds, and there is a possibility of zoonotic transmission, I'm not sure if this is the primary reason for their recent recognition as significant human enteric viruses. Moreover, foodborne transmission of astroviruses is possible, but I think person-to-person spread is more common.\n\nOption D mentions that knowledge of their replication as positive-sense ssRNA viruses is now complete. Astroviruses do have a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome, which means their genome can be directly translated by host cell ribosomes. Advances in understanding their replication cycle could certainly contribute to recognizing their significance, but I'm not sure if completing this knowledge is the main reason for their recent recognition.\n\nConsidering these points, I think Option A is the most plausible answer. Deep sequencing has likely played a crucial role in identifying and characterizing various astrovirus strains, leading to a better understanding of their prevalence and impact on human health. Before the advent of deep sequencing, many astrovirus infections might have been missed or misdiagnosed, especially in areas with limited diagnostic capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, deep sequencing allows for the detection of low-abundance viruses in complex samples, such as stool samples containing multiple microbial species. This could explain why astroviruses are now being recognized as more significant enteric pathogens\u2014they were underdiagnosed in the past due to limitations in detection methods.\n\nIn contrast, Options B and C seem less directly related to the recent recognition of astroviruses as significant human enteric viruses. While animal infection and potential meat contamination could be factors, the primary mode of transmission for human astroviruses is thought to be person-to-person via the fecal-oral route.\n\nOption D, regarding the completion of knowledge on their replication, is important for virology and potential antiviral development, but it may not be the direct reason for recognizing their significance in human disease.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the correct answer is A: The genome has been identified by the new method of deep sequencing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
