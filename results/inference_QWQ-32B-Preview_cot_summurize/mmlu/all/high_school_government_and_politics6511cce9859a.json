So, I need to identify which one among A, B, C, and D is not something that federal election laws are designed to achieve.\n\nFirst, I know that federal election laws are in place to regulate the election process, especially for federal offices like Congress and the presidency. These laws are meant to ensure fairness, transparency, and to prevent corruption or the appearance of it.\n\nOption A says \"require disclosure of campaign donations.\" I believe this is a key aspect of election laws. Disclosure helps voters know who is supporting which candidate, and it also helps in tracking where the money is coming from, which can be important for detecting any undue influence or corruption.\n\nOption C is \"limit campaign contributions.\" Again, this seems like something election laws would do. By setting limits on how much individuals or entities can contribute to a campaign, the laws aim to prevent any single donor from having too much influence over a candidate.\n\nOption D is \"require disclosure of campaign expenditures.\" This makes sense too. Just like with donations, knowing how campaign money is being spent is important for transparency. It helps ensure that funds are being used appropriately and not for personal gain or illegal activities.\n\nNow, option B says \"prevent campaigns from issuing 'attack' ads.\" Hmm, this is interesting. I'm not sure if federal election laws explicitly prevent attack ads. I know that attack ads are a common part of political campaigns, and while they might be controversial, I don't recall hearing about laws that ban them outright.\n\nMaybe the laws regulate certain aspects of attack ads, like truthfulness or disclosure requirements, but I don't think they completely prevent them. In fact, there have been many instances where candidates have run attack ads against their opponents.\n\nLet me think about this again. Perhaps the laws do try to rein in attack ads in some way. For example, there might be regulations about identifying who is responsible for the ad or restrictions on lying in ads. But outright prevention seems unlikely.\n\nComparing all the options, A, C, and D seem to be clear goals of federal election laws: disclosing donations and expenditures, and limiting contributions. Option B, preventing attack ads, doesn't seem to be a primary objective of these laws.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. Federal election laws are designed to achieve all of the following EXCEPT prevent campaigns from issuing \"attack\" ads.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
