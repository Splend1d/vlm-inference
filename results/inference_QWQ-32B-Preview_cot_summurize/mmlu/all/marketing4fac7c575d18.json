                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the external marketing environment. It says that there are six dimensions usually considered in this environment, and I need to identify which one among the options isn't part of it. The options are:\n\nA. Political considerations.\n\nB. Global factors.\n\nC. Socio-cultural aspects.\n\nD. Economics issues.\n\nHmm, I think I need to recall the standard components of the external marketing environment. I remember something called PESTLE or PESTLE analysis, which stands for Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental factors. Maybe that's related.\n\nLet me think about it. PESTLE analysis is a framework used to analyze the macro-environmental factors that could affect a business or organization. So, in marketing, the external environment would likely include similar factors.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. Political considerations \u2013 that sounds like the \"P\" in PESTLE.\n\nD. Economics issues \u2013 that's the \"E\" in PESTLE.\n\nC. Socio-cultural aspects \u2013 that should cover the \"S\" for social.\n\nB. Global factors \u2013 hmm, that's interesting. PESTLE includes political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors, but \"global factors\" isn't explicitly mentioned.\n\nWait, maybe global factors encompass some of these elements. For example, global political considerations, global economic trends, etc. So, perhaps global factors are a broader category that includes political and economic aspects on an international scale.\n\nBut the question is about the external marketing environment's dimensions, and it's asking for six dimensions. PESTLE has six components, but here only four options are provided, and one of them is not part of the usual external environment considerations.\n\nWait, maybe it's not PESTLE. Maybe there's another model with six dimensions. Perhaps STEP, which is a simpler version: Social, Technological, Economic, and Political. But that's only four dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, there's PEST analysis, which is Political, Economic, Social, and Technological. Again, four dimensions.\n\nSTEPE: Social, Technological, Economic, Political, and Ethical.\n\nThat's five. Still not six.\n\nThen there's PESTLE, which is six: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental.\n\nSo, perhaps the six dimensions referred to in the question are PESTLE.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Political considerations \u2013 that's Political in PESTLE.\n\nC. Socio-cultural aspects \u2013 Social in PESTLE.\n\nD. Economics issues \u2013 Economic in PESTLE.\n\nB. Global factors \u2013 this isn't directly in PESTLE. PESTLE includes political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors, but \"global factors\" is more of an overarching category that could include international political, economic, etc., factors.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is B. Global factors, because PESTLE already includes political, economic, social, etc., factors, and global factors might be considered as part of each of these dimensions rather than a separate dimension itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the six dimensions include global factors as a separate element. Maybe the six dimensions are:\n\n1. Political\n\n2. Economic\n\n3. Social\n\n4. Technological\n\n5. Legal\n\n6. Environmental\n\nAnd global factors could be considered under political, economic, social, etc.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up what the six dimensions of the external marketing environment are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different model altogether.\n\nWait, maybe the six dimensions are:\n\n1. Political\n\n2. Economic\n\n3. Socio-cultural\n\n4. Technological\n\n5. Legal\n\n6. Environmental\n\nIn that case, the options provided are A. Political, B. Global, C. Socio-cultural, D. Economic.\n\nSo, if the six dimensions include political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, legal, and environmental, then global factors wouldn't be one of them; instead, global factors might be considered within each of these dimensions.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Global factors.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because maybe global factors are considered separately in some models.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model being referred to includes global factors as a separate dimension.\n\nTo make sure, maybe I should consider that the six dimensions are:\n\n1. Political\n\n2. Economic\n\n3. Socio-cultural\n\n4. Technological\n\n5. Legal\n\n6. Environmental\n\nIn that case, global factors aren't a separate dimension but are incorporated into each of these dimensions.\n\nFor example, political considerations would include both domestic and global political factors.\n\nSimilarly, economic issues would include both local and global economic trends.\n\nSo, in that sense, global factors aren't a separate dimension but are part of each of the other dimensions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be B. Global factors.\n\nWait, but I feel like in some models, global factors are considered separately.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the six dimensions are:\n\n1. Political\n\n2. Economic\n\n3. Socio-cultural\n\n4. Technological\n\n5. Legal\n\n6. Environmental\n\nAnd global factors are considered across these dimensions rather than being a separate dimension.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the model includes:\n\n1. Political\n\n2. Economic\n\n3. Socio-cultural\n\n4. Technological\n\n5. Legal\n\n6. Environmental\n\nAnd global factors are considered under each of these headings.\n\nFor instance, political considerations would include international politics, economic issues would include global economic conditions, socio-cultural aspects would include global cultural trends, and so on.\n\nTherefore, global factors aren't a separate dimension but are integrated into each of the other dimensions.\n\nHence, the answer should be B. Global factors.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's a standard model with six dimensions that includes global factors as a separate dimension.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is based on a specific model presented in a textbook or course material.\n\nSince I don't have that context, I'll have to go with my best judgment.\n\nGiven that PESTLE is a common model with six dimensions (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental), and global factors are not explicitly one of them but are considered within each dimension, I think the answer is B. Global factors.\n\nSo, the dimension that isn't usually considered separately in the external marketing environment is global factors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
