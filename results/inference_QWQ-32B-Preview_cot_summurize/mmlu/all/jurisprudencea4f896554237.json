                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Posner and his views on the autonomy of law. So, first things first, I need to understand what \"autonomy of law\" means. From what I recall, it's the idea that law operates independently of other social institutions and influences, like politics, economics, and culture. It suggests that law has its own logic and development separate from these external factors.\n\nNow, Posner is known for his legal realism and economic analysis of law. So, he probably has some thoughts on whether law is truly autonomous or if it's influenced by other aspects of society, particularly economics.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. He denies that law develops independently of social and economic forces.\n\nB. He claims that law is economically immoral.\n\nC. He rejects a positivist account of law.\n\nD. He opposes any sociological analysis of the law.\n\nOption A seems directly related to the autonomy of law. If Posner denies that law develops independently of social and economic forces, that means he believes law is influenced by these forces, thereby challenging its autonomy.\n\nOption B, \"He claims that law is economically immoral,\" isn't something I recall from Posner's work. In fact, Posner is known for applying economic analysis to law, which suggests that he sees law through an economic lens, but not necessarily as immoral.\n\nOption C, \"He rejects a positivist account of law,\" could be relevant because legal positivism is associated with the idea of law's autonomy. If Posner rejects positivism, he might be rejecting the notion that law is separate from morality and other social influences. So, this could be another ground on which he denies the autonomy of law.\n\nOption D, \"He opposes any sociological analysis of the law,\" seems counterintuitive because Posner's approach is interdisciplinary, incorporating economics and sociology into legal analysis. So, it's unlikely that he opposes sociological analysis of law.\n\nGiven that the question asks for one of the grounds on which Posner denies the autonomy of law, both options A and C seem plausible. However, since it's a choose-one question, I need to decide which one is more directly related to the concept of autonomy.\n\nOption A specifically mentions that law doesn't develop independently of social and economic forces, which directly challenges the idea of autonomy. Option C, rejecting positivism, is more about the theoretical basis of law's autonomy.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is A. He denies that law develops independently of social and economic forces.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should consider the context in which Posner discusses autonomy of law. Posner is known for his critiques of legal formalism and the idea that law can be applied purely based on legal rules without considering the social and economic consequences. His emphasis on the practical effects of legal decisions and the role of economics in shaping law suggests that he sees law as intimately connected to these broader social and economic forces.\n\nMoreover, Posner has been critical of legal positivism, which holds that law is a system of rules that can be understood independently of moral or social considerations. By rejecting positivism, Posner is likely arguing that law cannot be separated from these other dimensions of society, thus denying its autonomy.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies \"one of them,\" and option A clearly states his denial of law's independence from social and economic forces, I think A is the most direct and appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
