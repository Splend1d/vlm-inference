                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about water potential in osmosis. So, we have an AP Biology student who's setting up an experiment with a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution placed into a beaker with a 0.6 M solution. The question is about water potential, and we have to choose the correct statement from the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what water potential is. Water potential (\u03a8) is a measure of the potential energy of water in a system. It determines the direction and movement of water due to osmosis. Water potential is composed of two main components: solute potential (\u03a8s) and pressure potential (\u03a8p). The formula that relates these is:\n\n\u03a8 = \u03a8s + \u03a8p\n\nSolute potential is influenced by the concentration of solutes in the solution. The more solutes present, the lower (more negative) the solute potential. Pressure potential can include both hydrostatic pressure and osmotic pressure, which can increase the water potential.\n\nNow, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.\" This is actually incorrect. Water moves from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential. So, this statement has it backwards.\n\nOption B states: \"Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.\" But we know that water potential is determined by both solute potential and pressure potential. So, this is too narrow; pressure potential also plays a role.\n\nOption C says: \"Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\" This aligns with the formula I mentioned earlier, \u03a8 = \u03a8s + \u03a8p. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption D tells us: \"Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.\" Again, this is similar to option A but focusing on pressure potential. Actually, water moves from higher water potential to lower water potential, which is influenced by both solute and pressure potentials.\n\nGiven this, option C seems to be the correct choice because it accurately describes how water potential is determined by both solute and pressure potentials.\n\nBut let's double-check by considering the experimental setup. The dialysis bag has a 0.5 M solution, and the beaker has a 0.6 M solution. Since the bag is permeable to water but not to solutes (assuming it's a standard dialysis tube), water will move to balance the solute concentrations.\n\nIn this case, the solute potential inside the bag is more positive (less negative) than in the beaker because it has a lower solute concentration. So, water will move into the bag to try to equalize the solute concentrations.\n\nThis movement is driven by the difference in water potential, which is a combination of solute and pressure potentials. As water enters the bag, it increases the pressure inside the bag, which can affect the pressure potential.\n\nTherefore, both solute and pressure potentials are at play here, supporting option C.\n\nAlso, option A is incorrect because water moves from higher to lower water potential, not the other way around.\n\nOption B is too limiting because it ignores pressure potential.\n\nOption D is mistaken in suggesting that water moves based solely on pressure potential differences, ignoring the solute potential component.\n\nHence, the correct answer is option C: \"Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
