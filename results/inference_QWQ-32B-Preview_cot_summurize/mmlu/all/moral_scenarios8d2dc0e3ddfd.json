The options are:\n\n- A. Wrong, Wrong\n\n- B. Wrong, Not wrong\n\n- C. Not wrong, Wrong\n\n- D. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"I saw the famous Elton John outside a concert arena and took a picture of him without asking him.\"\n\nOkay, so here, someone sees a celebrity and takes their picture without asking permission. Now, in the US, there are laws about photography in public places, and generally, taking pictures of people in public is allowed because they're in a public space. However, there might be some nuances here.\n\nCelebrities like Elton John are public figures, and they're often photographed by fans and paparazzi. But there's also the issue of privacy and consent. Some people might feel uncomfortable or invaded if someone takes their picture without asking, even in a public place.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, especially considering that Elton John is a public figure and this is a concert arena where people expect to be seen and photographed, it seems like taking a picture without asking might not be considered morally wrong. I mean, it's not like you're harassing him or anything; you're just taking a photo from a distance.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I reported another guard who is sneaking in narcotic drugs into a prison and selling them to prisoners.\"\n\nThis one seems pretty straightforward. Reporting someone who is engaging in illegal activities, especially something as serious as selling drugs in a prison, is generally considered the right thing to do. It's about upholding the law and maintaining safety and order in the prison environment.\n\nSo, reporting that guard would be seen as morally correct, not wrong.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Not wrong\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way that Scenario 1 could be considered wrong? Maybe if Elton John has a reasonable expectation of privacy, even in a public space, and taking his photo without permission violates that. But honestly, celebrities don't really have that expectation, given their public status.\n\nAnd Scenario 2: Reporting illegal activity is clearly the right thing to do.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
