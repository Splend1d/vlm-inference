The options are dendrite, glial cell, nerve center, and synapse. I think I remember something about synapses, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see.\n\nFirst, what is a neuron? It's a cell that's part of the nervous system, right? It's responsible for transmitting information throughout the body. Now, neurons have different parts, like dendrites, axons, and synapses. So, let's think about each option.\n\nOption A is dendrite. Dendrites are like the receiving parts of a neuron. They receive signals from other neurons and transmit them to the cell body. So, they receive impulses, but they don't necessarily transmit them to another neuron directly. That seems more like a part of receiving rather than transmitting to another neuron.\n\nOption B is glial cell. Glial cells are support cells in the nervous system. They provide support and protection for neurons, but they don't transmit impulses themselves. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C is nerve center. I think a nerve center might refer to a part of the brain or spinal cord where neurons come together, but it's not a specific point of transmission between two neurons. Maybe I'm misunderstanding that term.\n\nOption D is synapse. I think a synapse is the junction between two neurons where impulses are transmitted. So, when an impulse reaches the end of one neuron, it crosses the synapse to reach the next neuron. That sounds right.\n\nLet me double-check. So, dendrites receive signals, the cell body processes them, and the axon transmits them away from the cell body. At the end of the axon, there are terminal buttons or axon terminals, which release neurotransmitters across the synapse to the dendrites of the next neuron.\n\nSo, the synapse is literally the gap between two neurons where the impulse is transmitted chemically via neurotransmitters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D, synapse.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\n- Dendrite: receives impulses, not where they're transmitted to another neuron.\n\n- Glial cell: supports neurons, doesn't transmit impulses.\n\n- Nerve center: not sure exactly what that is, but it doesn't sound like the specific point of transmission between two neurons.\n\n- Synapse: the junction where impulses are transmitted from one neuron to another.\n\nYes, synapse is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
