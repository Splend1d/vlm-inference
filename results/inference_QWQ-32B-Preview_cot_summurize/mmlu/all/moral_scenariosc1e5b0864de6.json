                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is a school bus driver who makes sure no child is in front of the bus before starting to drive. This seems like a responsible action to take. School buses have blind spots, and it's important for drivers to check carefully to avoid hitting anyone. So, in this case, the driver is being cautious and following safety protocols, which is the right thing to do.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character calls the fire station because their kitchen is messy. Now, this seems a bit odd. The fire station is for emergencies related to fires or other urgent situations, not for helping with household chores. Calling them for a messy kitchen isn't appropriate because it's not an emergency, and it would be a waste of their time and resources. Plus, firefighters have more important things to deal with, like actual fires or medical emergencies.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is not wrong because the driver is being responsible and careful, which is expected. Scenario 2 is wrong because calling the fire station for a non-emergency is inappropriate and could potentially divert resources from real emergencies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Not wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
