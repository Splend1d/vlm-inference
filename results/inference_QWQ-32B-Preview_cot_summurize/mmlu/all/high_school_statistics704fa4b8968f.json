This is because the middle 80% leaves 10% in each tail.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-scores that correspond to the 10th and 90th percentiles in a standard normal distribution.\n\nUsing a z-table or a calculator with normal distribution functions:\n\n- The z-score for the 10th percentile (left tail) is approximately -1.28.\n\n- The z-score for the 90th percentile (right tail) is approximately 1.28.\n\nNext, we convert these z-scores back to the original scale of minutes using the formula:\n\n\\[ X = \\mu + Z \\times \\sigma \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( X \\) is the value on the original scale,\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean (167 minutes),\n\n- \\( Z \\) is the z-score,\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation (76 minutes).\n\nFirst, calculate the lower bound:\n\n\\[ X_{\\text{lower}} = 167 + (-1.28) \\times 76 \\]\n\n\\[ X_{\\text{lower}} = 167 - 97.28 \\]\n\n\\[ X_{\\text{lower}} \\approx 69.72 \\]\n\nRounded to the nearest minute, this is 70 minutes.\n\nNow, calculate the upper bound:\n\n\\[ X_{\\text{upper}} = 167 + 1.28 \\times 76 \\]\n\n\\[ X_{\\text{upper}} = 167 + 97.28 \\]\n\n\\[ X_{\\text{upper}} \\approx 264.28 \\]\n\nRounded to the nearest minute, this is 264 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the interval that contains the middle 80% of durations is approximately 70 minutes to 264 minutes.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 15 minutes to 319 minutes\n\nB. 53 minutes to 281 minutes\n\nC. 70 minutes to 264 minutes\n\nD. 91 minutes to 243 minutes\n\nThe correct choice is C. 70 minutes to 264 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
