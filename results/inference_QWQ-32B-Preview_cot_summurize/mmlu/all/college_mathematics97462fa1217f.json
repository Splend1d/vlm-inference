                    "text": "So I have this problem: I need to find the point on the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3 that is closest to the origin. The options are A. (0, 0, 1), B. (3/7, 3/14, 9/14), C. (7/15, 8/15, 1/15), and D. (5/6, 1/3, 1/3). I'm not totally sure how to approach this, but I think I can use the idea that the shortest distance from a point to a plane is along the normal to the plane.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the normal vector to the plane is. For a plane given by the equation ax + by + cz = d, the normal vector is (a, b, c). So in this case, the normal vector is (2, 1, 3). That makes sense.\n\nNow, if I imagine a line starting from the origin and going in the direction of the normal vector, the point where this line intersects the plane should be the closest point on the plane to the origin. So, I need to find the intersection point of this line and the plane.\n\nTo find the parametric equations of the line, I can use the direction vector (2, 1, 3) and a point on the line, which is the origin (0, 0, 0). So the parametric equations would be:\n\nx = 2t\n\ny = t\n\nz = 3t\n\nwhere t is a parameter.\n\nNow, I need to find the value of t where this line intersects the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3. So, I can substitute the parametric equations into the plane equation:\n\n2*(2t) + (t) + 3*(3t) = 3\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n4t + t + 9t = 3\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n14t = 3\n\nSo, t = 3/14\n\nNow, plug this value of t back into the parametric equations to find the coordinates of the intersection point:\n\nx = 2*(3/14) = 6/14 = 3/7\n\ny = 3/14\n\nz = 3*(3/14) = 9/14\n\nSo, the point should be (3/7, 3/14, 9/14), which is option B.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if this makes sense. Is there another way to confirm this?\n\nAnother approach could be to use the formula for the distance from a point to a plane. The distance d from a point (x0, y0, z0) to the plane ax + by + cz + d = 0 is given by:\n\nd = |ax0 + by0 + cz0 + d| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\n\nBut in this case, since I'm looking for the point on the plane closest to the origin, and I already have the plane equation 2x + y + 3z = 3, which is the same as 2x + y + 3z - 3 = 0, I can use this formula with (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 0, 0):\n\nd = |2*0 + 1*0 + 3*0 - 3| / sqrt(2^2 + 1^2 + 3^2) = | -3 | / sqrt(4 + 1 + 9) = 3 / sqrt(14)\n\nSo, the distance from the origin to the plane is 3 / sqrt(14). But I already found the point (3/7, 3/14, 9/14), and I can calculate its distance from the origin to see if it matches.\n\nDistance from origin to (3/7, 3/14, 9/14):\n\nd = sqrt( (3/7)^2 + (3/14)^2 + (9/14)^2 ) = sqrt( 9/49 + 9/196 + 81/196 )\n\nTo add these, I need a common denominator, which is 196:\n\n9/49 = 36/196\n\nSo, d = sqrt(36/196 + 9/196 + 81/196) = sqrt(126/196) = sqrt(126)/sqrt(196) = sqrt(126)/14\n\nNow, sqrt(126) can be simplified: 126 = 9*14, so sqrt(126) = 3*sqrt(14)\n\nTherefore, d = 3*sqrt(14)/14\n\nWait, earlier I had d = 3 / sqrt(14), which is equivalent to 3*sqrt(14)/14 after rationalizing the denominator. So, it matches. That's a good check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use calculus to minimize the distance. Let's see.\n\nThe distance from the origin to a point (x, y, z) is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). But since the point lies on the plane 2x + y + 3z = 3, I can express one variable in terms of the others using the plane equation.\n\nLet me solve the plane equation for y:\n\ny = 3 - 2x - 3z\n\nNow, substitute this into the distance formula:\n\nd = sqrt(x^2 + (3 - 2x - 3z)^2 + z^2)\n\nThis seems a bit messy, but maybe I can minimize d^2 to avoid dealing with the square root. So, let's set f(x, z) = x^2 + (3 - 2x - 3z)^2 + z^2\n\nTo find the minimum, I can take partial derivatives with respect to x and z and set them to zero.\n\nFirst, partial f / partial x:\n\n2x + 2*(3 - 2x - 3z)*(-2) = 2x - 4*(3 - 2x - 3z) = 2x - 12 + 8x + 12z = 10x + 12z - 12\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n10x + 12z = 12\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n5x + 6z = 6  --> equation (1)\n\nNow, partial f / partial z:\n\n2z + 2*(3 - 2x - 3z)*(-3) = 2z - 6*(3 - 2x - 3z) = 2z - 18 + 12x + 18z = 12x + 20z - 18\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n12x + 20z = 18\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n6x + 10z = 9  --> equation (2)\n\nNow, solve the system of equations:\n\n5x + 6z = 6   (1)\n\n6x + 10z = 9  (2)\n\nLet me solve equation (1) for x:\n\n5x = 6 - 6z\n\nx = (6 - 6z)/5  --> equation (3)\n\nPlug this into equation (2):\n\n6*(6 - 6z)/5 + 10z = 9\n\nMultiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n6*(6 - 6z) + 50z = 45\n\n36 - 36z + 50z = 45\n\n36 + 14z = 45\n\n14z = 9\n\nz = 9/14\n\nNow, plug z back into equation (3):\n\nx = (6 - 6*(9/14))/5 = (6 - 54/14)/5 = (84/14 - 54/14)/5 = (30/14)/5 = (30/14)*(1/5) = 30/70 = 3/7\n\nNow, find y using the plane equation:\n\ny = 3 - 2x - 3z = 3 - 2*(3/7) - 3*(9/14) = 3 - 6/7 - 27/14\n\nConvert to fourteenths:\n\n3 = 42/14\n\n6/7 = 12/14\n\n27/14 remains the same\n\nSo, y = 42/14 - 12/14 - 27/14 = (42 - 12 - 27)/14 = 3/14\n\nSo, the point is (3/7, 3/14, 9/14), which matches what I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the projection formula. The vector from the origin to the point on the plane can be found by projecting the vector from the origin to any point on the plane onto the normal vector of the plane.\n\nWait, but I'm starting from scratch here. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider that the closest point on the plane to the origin is where the vector from the origin to that point is perpendicular to the plane, meaning it's parallel to the normal vector.\n\nSo, the vector from the origin to the point is (x, y, z), and it should be parallel to the normal vector (2, 1, 3). Therefore, (x, y, z) = k*(2, 1, 3) for some scalar k.\n\nSo, x = 2k, y = k, z = 3k\n\nNow, since the point lies on the plane, it must satisfy the plane equation:\n\n2*(2k) + (k) + 3*(3k) = 3\n\n4k + k + 9k = 3\n\n14k = 3\n\nk = 3/14\n\nTherefore, x = 2*(3/14) = 3/7\n\ny = 3/14\n\nz = 3*(3/14) = 9/14\n\nAgain, the point is (3/7, 3/14, 9/14), which is option B.\n\nLet me just double-check if this point actually lies on the plane:\n\n2*(3/7) + (3/14) + 3*(9/14) = 6/7 + 3/14 + 27/14 = 12/14 + 3/14 + 27/14 = 42/14 = 3\n\nYes, it satisfies the plane equation.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's check the other options to see if they lie on the plane and calculate their distances.\n\nOption A: (0, 0, 1)\n\nPlug into the plane equation: 2*0 + 0 + 3*1 = 3, which is correct.\n\nDistance from origin: sqrt(0 + 0 + 1) = 1\n\nOption B: (3/7, 3/14, 9/14)\n\nWe already did this, distance is 3*sqrt(14)/14\n\nOption C: (7/15, 8/15, 1/15)\n\nCheck plane equation: 2*(7/15) + 8/15 + 3*(1/15) = 14/15 + 8/15 + 3/15 = 25/15 = 5/3, which is not equal to 3. So, this point doesn't even lie on the plane. Therefore, it can't be the correct answer.\n\nOption D: (5/6, 1/3, 1/3)\n\nCheck plane equation: 2*(5/6) + 1/3 + 3*(1/3) = 5/3 + 1/3 + 1 = 5/3 + 1/3 + 3/3 = 9/3 = 3, which is correct.\n\nDistance from origin: sqrt( (5/6)^2 + (1/3)^2 + (1/3)^2 ) = sqrt(25/36 + 1/9 + 1/9) = sqrt(25/36 + 4/36) = sqrt(29/36) = sqrt(29)/6\n\nNow, compare the distances:\n\nOption A: 1 = sqrt(14)/sqrt(14) = sqrt(14)/sqrt(14)\n\nOption B: 3*sqrt(14)/14 = (3/14)*sqrt(14)\n\nOption D: sqrt(29)/6\n\nI need to compare these distances to see which one is the smallest.\n\nFirst, let's compare option B and option A.\n\nOption B: 3*sqrt(14)/14\n\nOption A: 1\n\nTo compare 3*sqrt(14)/14 and 1:\n\nIs 3*sqrt(14)/14 < 1?\n\n3*sqrt(14) < 14\n\nsqrt(14) < 14/3 \u2248 4.666...\n\nBut sqrt(14) \u2248 3.74, which is less than 4.666..., so yes, option B is closer than option A.\n\nNow, compare option B and option D.\n\nOption B: 3*sqrt(14)/14\n\nOption D: sqrt(29)/6\n\nLet's square both to avoid dealing with square roots:\n\n(3*sqrt(14)/14)^2 = 9*14 / 196 = 126 / 196 = 63/98\n\n(sqrt(29)/6)^2 = 29 / 36\n\nNow, compare 63/98 and 29/36.\n\nTo compare these fractions, cross-multiply:\n\n63 * 36 vs. 98 * 29\n\n63*36 = 2268\n\n98*29 = 2842\n\nSince 2268 < 2842, 63/98 < 29/36, which means option B has a smaller distance than option D.\n\nTherefore, option B is indeed the closest point to the origin on the plane.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{3}{7}, \\frac{3}{14}, \\frac{9}{14} \\right)} \\]"
