The options are Ways and Means, Judiciary, Ethics, and Rules. I think the Rules Committee is the one that handles the procedures for debating and amending bills, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look into what each committee does to make sure.\n\nFirst, let's consider the Ways and Means Committee. I know that this committee deals with taxation, tariffs, and other revenue-related issues. It's important for setting fiscal policies, but I don't think it's involved in setting the rules for how bills are debated.\n\nNext, the Judiciary Committee. This one handles laws related to justice, civil rights, and the administration of justice. While it's crucial for legal matters, I don't recall it having a role in determining the procedural rules for bill discussions.\n\nThe Ethics Committee is responsible for enforcing ethical standards and conducting investigations into potential misconduct by members of the House. Again, its focus is on ethical behavior, not on setting debate procedures.\n\nFinally, the Rules Committee. From what I remember, this committee sets the conditions under which bills are considered by the full House. It can limit or expand the amendments that can be offered during floor debates. This sounds like it aligns with determining the procedure for debating and amending bills.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should look up the functions of each committee. Let's start with the Rules Committee. According to the House of Representatives website, the Rules Committee's primary function is to regulate the flow of bills from committees to the floor and to establish the conditions under which those bills are debated and amended. That definitely matches the description in the question.\n\nLet me check the other committees just to be thorough. The Ways and Means Committee is indeed focused on tax and trade issues, as I thought. The Judiciary Committee deals with legal and constitutional matters. The Ethics Committee handles ethical standards and conduct. None of these seem directly related to setting debate procedures.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that the Rules Committee is the one that determines the procedure by which bills are debated and amended in the House of Representatives.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
