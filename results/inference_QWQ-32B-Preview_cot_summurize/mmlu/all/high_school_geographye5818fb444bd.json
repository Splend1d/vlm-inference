It says, \"The latitude and longitude coordinates of a place are an example of...\" and then it gives four options: A. a formal region, B. a functional region, C. an absolute location, and D. a relative location.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what latitude and longitude coordinates are. I know that they are a way to pinpoint exact locations on Earth using a grid system. Latitude lines run east to west and measure the distance north or south of the Equator, while longitude lines run north to south and measure the distance east or west of the Prime Meridian. So, together, they give a precise spot on the globe.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. A formal region, I think, is an area defined by certain characteristics like culture, language, or climate. For example, Europe is a formal region because it has common cultural and historical traits.\n\nB. A functional region is an area organized around a node or focal point. Like a city and its surrounding suburbs, where people commute to work in the city. So, it's organized around that central point.\n\nC. An absolute location is the exact spot on Earth, usually given by coordinates like latitude and longitude.\n\nD. A relative location is where a place is in relation to other places. For example, saying that the library is next to the park.\n\nGiven these definitions, it seems like latitude and longitude coordinates would be an absolute location because they pinpoint exactly where something is, without relating it to other places.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that coordinates could relate to the other options?\n\nWell, coordinates could be used to define a formal region by specifying the boundaries where certain characteristics are found. For example, you could use coordinates to outline the area where a particular language is spoken. But in that case, the coordinates are being used to define the region, not being the region itself.\n\nSimilarly, for a functional region, coordinates could indicate the location of the central node, like the main city in a metropolitan area, but again, the coordinates are just identifying that point, not being the region.\n\nRelative location is about relationships between places, so coordinates don't fit there because they are absolute references, not relative ones.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is that latitude and longitude coordinates are an example of an absolute location.\n\nI think option C is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
