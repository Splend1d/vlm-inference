The State governments, where the system of slavery exists, are complete slavery organizations. The church organizations in those States are equally at the service of slavery; while the Federal Government, with its army and navy, from the chief magistracy in Washington, to the Supreme Court, and thence to the chief marshalship at New York, is pledged to support, defend, and propagate the crying curse of human bondage. The pen, the purse, and the sword, are united against the simple truth, preached by humble men in obscure places.\"\nFrederick Douglass, 1857\nFrederick Douglass was most influenced by which of the following social movements?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Frederick Douglass and the social movement that most influenced him. The quote provided is from 1857, and it's clear that Douglass is discussing the pervasive influence of slavery in various aspects of American society, including state governments, churches, and the federal government. He paints a picture of a highly organized system that seems almost invincible in its support for slavery.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these social movements represents:\n\nA. The First Great Awakening was a religious revival in the 1730s and 1740s that emphasized personal salvation and a direct relationship with God, leading to the formation of new Protestant denominations.\n\nB. The Second Great Awakening occurred in the early to mid-19th century and was characterized by a focus on moral reform, including movements against slavery, alcohol, and other social issues. It also led to the growth of evangelical Protestantism.\n\nC. Manifest Destiny was the belief that the United States was destined to expand across the continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It was used to justify westward expansion and often entangled with issues of slavery.\n\nD. Popular Sovereignty was the idea that residents of a territory should decide for themselves whether to allow slavery within their borders. It was a key concept in the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854.\n\nGiven that Douglass is speaking in 1857, during the height of the antislavery movement, and considering his emphasis on the organized nature of slavery and the need for moral reform, I think the Second Great Awakening is the most likely influence.\n\nThe Second Great Awakening was a period of religious and social reform that coincided with Douglass's active years as an abolitionist. It was during this time that many social reform movements gained momentum, including abolitionism, women's rights, and temperance. Douglass himself was involved in several of these movements, but his primary focus was on ending slavery.\n\nMoreover, the Second Great Awakening saw the rise of evangelical Protestantism, which played a significant role in the abolitionist movement. Many abolitionists, including Douglass, drew moral and religious arguments against slavery, seeing it as a sin that needed to be eradicated.\n\nIn contrast, the First Great Awakening, while important for religious revival, predates Douglass's time and didn't have the same focus on social reform issues like slavery.\n\nManifest Destiny, while contemporaneous with Douglass's activism, was more about expansionism and less about moral reform regarding slavery, although it was often connected to the spread of slavery into new territories.\n\nPopular Sovereignty was a political concept that allowed territories to decide on slavery, which abolitionists like Douglass opposed because it could lead to the expansion of slavery.\n\nTherefore, considering the time period and Douglass's focus on moral and social reform against slavery, the Second Great Awakening seems to be the social movement that most influenced him.\n\nHowever, to ensure I'm not missing anything, I should consider if there are any other factors that might suggest a different answer.\n\nFor instance, Douglass was also influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment and the concept of natural rights, which were part of the intellectual foundation of the American Revolution. But these are more philosophical influences rather than social movements.\n\nAdditionally, Douglass was involved in the women's rights movement and other social reforms, but the core of his work was abolitionism, which is most directly associated with the Second Great Awakening.\n\nAnother point to consider is that the abolitionist movement had different branches\u2014some more radical and some more gradual in their approaches. Douglass was known for his radical stance, advocating for immediate emancipation and equal rights for African Americans. The Second Great Awakening was associated with moral reform and often supported radical changes to society, which aligns with Douglass's views.\n\nIn conclusion, while Douglass was influenced by multiple movements and ideas, the social movement that most directly influenced his antislavery activism was the Second Great Awakening.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
