She tells you that she has not had a menstrual period for the past 6 months. She is a college student who is in good health, has not had any medical illnesses or surgery, and has never been pregnant. She is currently sexually active and uses barrier contraception. She reports that during the past year her menses had become very irregular prior to complete cessation 6 months ago. She also notes that she has gained about 9 kg (20 lb) in the past 6 months and has had an increasing problem with acne and a troublesome growth of hair on her thighs and abdomen. She has been somewhat depressed about this, and her grades have declined. She reports that one of her sisters also had this problem prior to getting married. Physical examination shows a mildly obese young woman who has scattered facial acne, mild male pattern hair growth on the abdomen, and an essentially normal pelvic examination except for slight enlargement of the uterus and both ovaries. This patient's history is most consistent with which of the following?\n\nA. Androgen-producing ovarian tumor\nB. Cushing syndrome\nC. Hypothyroidism\nD. Polycystic ovarian syndrome\n"

                    "text": "So I have this case here about a 19-year-old woman who's come in for her annual check-up and cervical cytology. She mentions that she hasn't had a menstrual period for the past 6 months, which is a bit concerning. Let's see what else is going on.\n\nFirst off, she's a college student in good health, no history of medical illnesses or surgery, and she's never been pregnant. That's important to note because pregnancy is often the first thing to consider in cases of amenorrhea, but since she's been using barrier contraception and hasn't been pregnant before, it's less likely.\n\nShe's been sexually active and using barrier contraception, which is good. Her menses had become irregular over the past year before stopping completely 6 months ago. So, it sounds like she had oligomenorrhea leading up to amenorrhea.\n\nAdditionally, she's gained about 9 kg (20 lbs) in the past 6 months, which is significant, especially for someone who was previously not obese. She also mentions increasing acne and hair growth on her thighs and abdomen. She's somewhat depressed about these changes, and her grades have declined. Interesting that her sister had a similar problem before getting married, which might suggest a familial tendency or something environmental that both sisters were exposed to.\n\nOn physical examination, she's mildly obese, which correlates with her weight gain. She has scattered facial acne and mild male-pattern hair growth on the abdomen. The pelvic exam is essentially normal except for slight enlargement of the uterus and both ovaries.\n\nSo, we need to consider what could be causing her amenorrhea, weight gain, acne, and hirsutism.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Androgen-producing ovarian tumor\n\nB. Cushing syndrome\n\nC. Hypothyroidism\n\nD. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)\n\nOption A: Androgen-producing ovarian tumor. This is possible, especially if there's an ovarian mass producing androgens, which could lead to hirsutism, acne, and irregular periods. However, the physical exam shows slight enlargement of both ovaries, not a specific mass, which makes this less likely. Typically, a tumor would cause a unilateral ovarian enlargement.\n\nOption B: Cushing syndrome. This is caused by excessive cortisol levels, which can lead to weight gain, acne, and menstrual irregularities. However, Cushing syndrome also causes other signs like moon face, stretch marks, high blood pressure, and diabetes. The patient doesn't mention any of these symptoms, and her presentation seems more focused on hirsutism and menstrual issues.\n\nOption C: Hypothyroidism. This can cause menstrual irregularities, weight gain, and depression, but it's less likely to cause hirsutism and acne. In fact, hypothyroidism often leads to thinning hair rather than hirsutism. So, this seems less likely.\n\nOption D: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). This is a common endocrine system disorder among women of reproductive age. It's characterized by irregular periods, hirsutism, acne, and often obesity. The name comes from the polycystic appearance of the ovaries in ultrasound, which is consistent with the slight enlargement of both ovaries noted in the exam.\n\nGiven all this, PCOS seems to fit the patient's symptoms best. The irregular periods leading to amenorrhea, weight gain, acne, hirsutism, and family history (sister had similar issues) are all suggestive of PCOS.\n\nLet me double-check. Androgen-producing ovarian tumor could cause similar symptoms, but the bilateral ovarian enlargement makes it less likely, as tumors are usually unilateral. Cushing syndrome doesn't typically cause hirsutism as a primary symptom, and hypothyroidism wouldn't explain the hirsutism and acne.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent diagnosis is polycystic ovarian syndrome.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
