                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The expression given is (i + 1)(5 \u2013 5i)(5 + 5i). I need to simplify this and see which option it matches: A. 50 + 50i, B. 50 \u2013 50i, C. 25 + 25i, or D. 25 \u2013 25i.\n\nFirst, I notice that there are complex numbers involved here. Remember, i is the imaginary unit, where i\u00b2 = -1. The expression has three factors: (i + 1), (5 \u2013 5i), and (5 + 5i). Maybe I can simplify this by multiplying these factors in a smart order.\n\nI see that (5 \u2013 5i) and (5 + 5i) are complex conjugates. There's a property that says when you multiply a complex number by its conjugate, you get a real number. Specifically, (a \u2013 bi)(a + bi) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. So, let's apply that here.\n\nLet a = 5 and b = 5, then (5 \u2013 5i)(5 + 5i) = 5\u00b2 + (5)\u00b2 = 25 + 25 = 50.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to (i + 1)(50).\n\nNow, distributing 50 to both terms inside the parentheses: 50 * i + 50 * 1 = 50i + 50.\n\nThat seems straightforward. So, the result is 50 + 50i.\n\nLooking back at the options, that matches option A.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to approach this to confirm? Maybe I can multiply the factors in a different order.\n\nLet's try multiplying (i + 1) and (5 \u2013 5i) first, and then multiply the result by (5 + 5i).\n\nFirst, multiply (i + 1)(5 \u2013 5i):\n\nUse the distributive property: i*(5) + i*(-5i) + 1*(5) + 1*(-5i) = 5i \u2013 5i\u00b2 + 5 \u2013 5i.\n\nRecall that i\u00b2 = -1, so \u20135i\u00b2 = \u20135*(-1) = 5.\n\nSo, 5i + 5 + 5 \u2013 5i.\n\nCombine like terms: (5 + 5) + (5i \u2013 5i) = 10 + 0i = 10.\n\nNow, multiply this result by (5 + 5i): 10*(5 + 5i) = 50 + 50i.\n\nAgain, I get 50 + 50i.\n\nHmm, both methods give me the same answer. That gives me more confidence that A is correct.\n\nIs there another approach I can take to verify this further?\n\nPerhaps I can expand all the terms at once.\n\nSo, (i + 1)(5 \u2013 5i)(5 + 5i) = (i + 1)[(5 \u2013 5i)(5 + 5i)].\n\nWe already know (5 \u2013 5i)(5 + 5i) = 50.\n\nSo, (i + 1)*50 = 50i + 50, which is 50 + 50i.\n\nOr, thinking in terms of the properties of complex numbers, since (5 \u2013 5i) and (5 + 5i) are conjugates, their product is a real number, and multiplying that by (i + 1) should give a complex number with both real and imaginary parts.\n\nIn this case, 50*(1 + i) = 50*1 + 50*i = 50 + 50i.\n\nEverything points to option A being the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and all methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is A. 50 + 50i.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
