Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how rounding works. When rounding to the nearest 10, I look at the digit in the ones place. If it's 5 or higher, I round up; if it's below 5, I round down.\n\nSo, for 836, the digit in the ones place is 6. Since 6 is higher than 5, I should round up.\n\nNow, rounding up from 836 to the nearest 10 would mean increasing the tens digit by one and making the ones digit zero. So, 830 becomes 840.\n\nWait, but 836 is between 830 and 840. Since the ones digit is 6, which is greater than or equal to 5, I round up to 840.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If I have 836, and I'm rounding to the nearest 10, I should look at the number line. Between 830 and 840, 836 is closer to 840 because 835 would be right in the middle, and anything above that goes to 840.\n\nSo, 836 rounded to the nearest 10 should be 840.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 800, which is way off. B is 830, which is too low. C is 840, which matches what I think is correct. D is 870, which is too high.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 840.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider another approach. I can subtract 836 from both 830 and 840 and see which one is closer.\n\n836 - 830 = 6\n840 - 836 = 4\n\nSo, 840 is closer to 836 by 4 units, whereas 830 is 6 units away. Therefore, rounding to the nearest 10 would indeed be 840.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it. The answer is C. 840.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{840} \\]"
