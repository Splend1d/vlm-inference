So, I'd go with option B, New York.\n\nBut let me double-check. I remember that FIT is a college in New York that focuses on fashion and design. They have programs in fashion design, merchandising, and other related fields. Plus, New York is a major fashion capital, so it makes sense.\n\nJust to be sure, I'll quickly look it up. Okay, according to various sources, the Fashion Institute of Technology, or FIT, is indeed located in New York City. It's part of the State University of New York system.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B, New York.\n\nBut wait, there might be other places with similar names. For example, there could be fashion institutes in other cities, but the original Fashion Institute of Technology is in New York.\n\nLet me check if there are any other FITs in different cities. Hmm, I see that there is a Fashion Institute of Technology in Australia, but that's in Melbourne. So, option D is Melbourne, which has its own FIT.\n\nBut the question is about the Fashion Institute of Technology, and without specifying which one, I think it's referring to the more well-known one in New York.\n\nAlternatively, if it's referring to any Fashion Institute of Technology, then both New York and Melbourne would have them.\n\nBut given the options, and considering that FIT in New York is very renowned globally, I think the expected answer is B, New York.\n\nMoreover, Paris is known for fashion, but I don't think there's a Fashion Institute of Technology there. Maybe there are other fashion schools, like those associated with Chloe or other brands, but I don't know of a Fashion Institute of Technology in Paris.\n\nLos Angeles also has fashion schools, but again, FIT is primarily associated with New York.\n\nSo, my final answer is B, New York.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
