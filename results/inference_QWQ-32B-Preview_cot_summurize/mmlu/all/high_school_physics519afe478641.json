                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what happens to the normal force when the angle of an inclined plane increases, and the box isn't sliding. The options are that it increases linearly, decreases linearly, doesn't change, or decreases nonlinearly. I think I need to recall how forces work on an incline.\n\nFirst, I know that when a box is on an inclined plane, there are a few forces acting on it: the gravitational force, which pulls it straight down; the normal force, which is perpendicular to the surface of the plane; and possibly friction, which would be parallel to the surface and opposing any potential motion.\n\nSince the box isn't sliding, it means that the forces are balanced. So, the component of the gravitational force parallel to the plane must be equal to the frictional force, and the component perpendicular to the plane must be equal to the normal force.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I have a box on a flat surface, the normal force is equal to the full gravitational force because there's no angle. As I tilt the surface, the normal force should adjust based on the angle.\n\nI think the normal force is equal to the gravitational force multiplied by the cosine of the angle of inclination. Is that right? Because the component of gravity perpendicular to the plane is mg cos(theta), where mg is the gravitational force and theta is the angle.\n\nIf that's the case, then as theta increases, cos(theta) decreases, so the normal force decreases. But is this a linear decrease or nonlinear?\n\nLet me think about the graph of cosine. Cosine decreases from 1 at theta = 0 to 0 at theta = 90 degrees, but it's not a straight line; it's a curve. So, would that mean the normal force decreases nonlinearly?\n\nWait, but in the options, it says \"decreases linearly\" and \"decreases nonlinearly.\" If cosine is a nonlinear function, then the normal force decreases nonlinearly.\n\nBut let me double-check. The normal force N = mg cos(theta). So, N is proportional to cos(theta). Since cos(theta) is a nonlinear function of theta, N decreases nonlinearly with increasing theta.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. decreases nonlinearly.\n\nBut I remember that for small angles, cosine can be approximated linearly, but the question doesn't specify small angles, so I think the general case is nonlinear.\n\nJust to be sure, let's consider some values. At theta = 0, cos(0) = 1, so N = mg.\n\nAt theta = 30 degrees, cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 \u2248 0.866, so N \u2248 0.866 mg.\n\nAt theta = 45 degrees, cos(45) = sqrt(2)/2 \u2248 0.707, so N \u2248 0.707 mg.\n\nAt theta = 60 degrees, cos(60) = 0.5, so N = 0.5 mg.\n\nAt theta = 90 degrees, cos(90) = 0, so N = 0.\n\nIf I plot these points, it's clear that it's not a straight line; it's a curve. So, indeed, the decrease is nonlinear.\n\nI think I've got it. The normal force decreases nonlinearly as the angle increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
