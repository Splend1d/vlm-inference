                    "text": "So I've got this question here about negative externalities in production and how to achieve the socially optimal quantity of output. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a negative externality is. A negative externality occurs when the production or consumption of a good causes harm to a third party that's not reflected in the market price. For example, pollution from a factory affects the health of nearby residents, but the factory doesn't pay for those health costs.\n\nNow, the question is about the production side, so it's specifically about negative externalities in production. That means the harm is being caused during the making of the good, like the pollution example.\n\nThe question is asking for the socially optimal quantity of output. What does that mean? Well, the socially optimal quantity is where the social cost equals the social benefit. Social cost includes both the private cost to the producer and the external cost to society. Social benefit is the value that consumers place on the good.\n\nIn a free market, producers only consider their private costs and benefits, not the external costs. So, they produce up to the point where their marginal private cost equals the marginal benefit (which is represented by the demand curve). But because there's an external cost, the marginal social cost is higher than the marginal private cost.\n\nTherefore, in the presence of a negative externality, the market quantity is higher than the socially optimal quantity. That's because the market doesn't account for the external harm being caused.\n\nSo, to achieve the socially optimal quantity, we need to somehow internalize the external cost, meaning make the producer pay for the harm they're causing.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Free market capitalism. Well, as we just established, the free market leads to overproduction in the case of negative externalities. So, this isn't going to give us the socially optimal quantity.\n\nB. Placing limits on the quantity that can be produced. This sounds promising. If the government sets a cap on production, it could limit output to the socially optimal level.\n\nC. Government purchases of the good. Hmm, not sure about this. If the government buys the good, it might increase demand, which could lead to more production, exacerbating the externality.\n\nD. Setting a minimum on the quantity that can be produced. This seems counterintuitive because, as we've seen, the problem is overproduction, so setting a minimum would likely make things worse.\n\nOkay, so between options B and C, B seems more plausible.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Are there better ways to achieve the socially optimal quantity?\n\nWell, in economics, there are a few standard approaches to dealing with negative externalities:\n\n1. Taxes: The government can impose a tax on the producer equal to the external cost. This makes the producer's marginal private cost equal to the marginal social cost, so they'll produce at the socially optimal quantity.\n\n2. Subsidies: Sometimes subsidies can be used, but typically for positive externalities, not negative ones.\n\n3. Regulations: Setting standards or limits on production or the amount of externality produced.\n\n4. Property rights and litigation: Allowing affected parties to sue the producer for the harm caused.\n\n5. Tradable permits: Allowing firms to buy and sell the right to produce a certain amount of the externality.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Free market capitalism: As discussed, this doesn't account for externalities.\n\nB. Placing limits on the quantity that can be produced: This resembles regulations or quotas, which can limit production to the socially optimal level.\n\nC. Government purchases of the good: This seems more related to increasing demand, which wouldn't help with a negative externality.\n\nD. Setting a minimum on the quantity that can be produced: This would likely increase production, making the externality worse.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the most direct way to achieve the socially optimal quantity.\n\nBut wait, is there a better way? For example, imposing a tax (which isn't one of the options) would also lead to the socially optimal quantity. However, since it's not listed, we have to choose among the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether you understand that limiting quantity can achieve the same result as taxing, but through a different mechanism.\n\nIn the case of a tax, the producer internalizes the externality by paying for the social cost, which adjusts the marginal cost curve upward to match the marginal social cost.\n\nIn the case of quantity limits, the government directly restricts production to the level where marginal social cost equals marginal benefit.\n\nBoth approaches can theoretically lead to the socially optimal quantity, but they work differently in practice.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I think B is the best answer.\n\nOption C, government purchases, doesn't make much sense in this context. If the government buys the good, it might increase the quantity produced, which would exacerbate the negative externality.\n\nOption D, setting a minimum on production, would also likely increase production, again making the externality worse.\n\nSo, to summarize, in the presence of a negative externality in production, the socially optimal quantity can be achieved by placing limits on the quantity that can be produced.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
