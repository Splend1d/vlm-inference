                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: A company makes 5 blue cars for every 3 white cars it makes. If the company makes 15 white cars in one day, how many blue cars will it make? The options are A. 9, B. 13, C. 17, and D. 25.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The problem says that the company makes cars in a certain ratio: 5 blue cars for every 3 white cars. So, the ratio of blue to white cars is 5:3.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many blue cars are made when there are 15 white cars. Hmm, ratios can be tricky, but I think I can handle this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the ratio means. For every 3 white cars, there are 5 blue cars. So, if there are more white cars, I need to scale up the ratio accordingly.\n\nLet me think about it in terms of multiples. If 3 white cars correspond to 5 blue cars, then 1 white car would correspond to 5/3 blue cars. But, since we're dealing with 15 white cars, I can multiply both sides of the ratio by the same factor to get to 15 white cars.\n\nLet's see, 3 white cars are in the ratio, and we have 15 white cars. So, the multiplier must be 15 divided by 3, which is 5. So, if I multiply both sides of the ratio by 5, I should get the number of blue cars corresponding to 15 white cars.\n\nLet me do that: 5 blue cars times 5 is 25 blue cars, and 3 white cars times 5 is 15 white cars. So, if the company makes 15 white cars, it should make 25 blue cars.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options, D is 25, which seems to match. But let me double-check if I did this correctly.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to set up a proportion. If 5 blue cars are to 3 white cars as x blue cars are to 15 white cars, then I can write it as 5/3 = x/15.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply: 5 * 15 = 3 * x, which gives me 75 = 3x. Then, dividing both sides by 3, x = 25.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, it seems like the company makes 25 blue cars when it makes 15 white cars.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using equations or something else.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of blue cars as b and white cars as w. According to the problem, b/w = 5/3.\n\nGiven that w = 15, I can plug that into the equation: b/15 = 5/3.\n\nThen, solving for b, I get b = (5/3)*15 = (5*15)/3 = 75/3 = 25.\n\nAgain, I get 25 blue cars. So, it seems consistent.\n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? Maybe if the ratio was considered differently, but I don't think so. The problem clearly states \"5 blue cars for every 3 white cars,\" which is a direct ratio of 5:3.\n\nLet me also consider if there is any possibility of a mistake in the options provided. The calculations seem straightforward, and 25 appears to be the correct answer based on the ratio and the given number of white cars.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's think about it in terms of actual cars. If the company makes cars in batches where each batch consists of 5 blue cars and 3 white cars, then for every batch, there are 5 blue and 3 white cars.\n\nIf the company makes multiple batches, the total number of white cars would be 3 per batch, and blue cars 5 per batch.\n\nSo, if they make x batches, then white cars = 3x and blue cars = 5x.\n\nGiven that white cars = 15, then 3x = 15, so x = 5 batches.\n\nTherefore, blue cars = 5x = 5*5 = 25.\n\nOnce again, I arrive at 25 blue cars.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from multiple angles, and each method leads me to the same conclusion that the company makes 25 blue cars when it makes 15 white cars.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
