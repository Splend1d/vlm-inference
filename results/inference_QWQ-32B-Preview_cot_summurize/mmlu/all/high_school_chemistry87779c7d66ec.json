                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a sample of helium gas. It starts with a volume of 5.00 liters at a temperature of 127 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 875 millimeters of mercury. Then, it's heated at constant pressure until it reaches a volume of 10.00 liters, and I need to find the final temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall the gas laws because the problem involves changes in volume and temperature at constant pressure. I think Charles's Law might be applicable here since it deals with the relationship between volume and temperature at constant pressure.\n\nCharles's Law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature when pressure is held constant. Mathematically, that's V1/T1 = V2/T2, where V1 and T1 are the initial volume and temperature, and V2 and T2 are the final volume and temperature.\n\nBut wait, temperature needs to be in Kelvin, not Celsius. So, I'll need to convert the initial temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. The conversion is T(K) = T(\u00b0C) + 273.15.\n\nGiven that, the initial temperature is 127\u00b0C, so in Kelvin that's 127 + 273.15 = 400.15 K.\n\nThe initial volume V1 is 5.00 L, and the final volume V2 is 10.00 L. I need to find T2.\n\nPlugging into Charles's Law:\n\nV1/T1 = V2/T2\n\nSo, 5.00 L / 400.15 K = 10.00 L / T2\n\nNow, solve for T2:\n\nT2 = (10.00 L * 400.15 K) / 5.00 L\n\nLet's do the math:\n\nT2 = (4001.5 K*L) / 5.00 L = 800.3 K\n\nNow, I need to convert this back to Celsius:\n\nT(\u00b0C) = T(K) - 273.15 = 800.3 K - 273.15 = 527.15\u00b0C\n\nRounding to the nearest degree, that's 527\u00b0C.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 454\u00b0C\n\nB. 527\u00b0C\n\nC. 45\u00b0C\n\nD. 181\u00b0C\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I missed something. Let's see:\n\n- The pressure is constant, so Charles's Law is indeed appropriate.\n\n- I correctly converted the initial temperature to Kelvin.\n\n- The volumes are given in liters, but since they're directly proportional, the units cancel out.\n\n- The calculation seems straightforward: T2 = (V2 * T1) / V1 = (10 * 400.15) / 5 = 800.3 K, which is 527.15\u00b0C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the fact that helium is a monatomic gas, but in this case, since we're only dealing with volume and temperature at constant pressure, the type of gas shouldn't matter as long as it behaves ideally.\n\nWait, the problem mentions helium gas, and it's assumed to behave ideally, which is a reasonable assumption for helium under these conditions.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, but since pressure is constant and the number of moles doesn't change, it simplifies to V/T = constant, which is essentially Charles's Law.\n\nSo, I don't think I need to use the ideal gas law here; Charles's Law is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature should be 527\u00b0C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have overlooked.\n\n- Is the process really at constant pressure? The problem says it is heated at constant pressure, so yes.\n\n- Are there any volume changes due to the temperature change? Yes, that's what's being described.\n\n- Is the gas ideal? Helium is pretty close to an ideal gas under normal conditions.\n\n- Did I make any calculation errors? Let's check the math again:\n\nT2 = (10.00 L * 400.15 K) / 5.00 L = (4001.5 K*L) / 5.00 L = 800.3 K\n\nThen, 800.3 K - 273.15 = 527.15\u00b0C.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the initial and final states and see if there's another way to relate them.\n\nInitial state:\n\nV1 = 5.00 L\n\nT1 = 400.15 K\n\nP1 = 875 mm Hg\n\nFinal state:\n\nV2 = 10.00 L\n\nT2 = ?\n\nP2 = 875 mm Hg (constant pressure)\n\nUsing the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, and since n and R are constant, P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2.\n\nBut since P1 = P2, this simplifies to V1/T1 = V2/T2, which is again Charles's Law.\n\nSo, no need to complicate it further.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature is 527\u00b0C, which corresponds to option B.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
