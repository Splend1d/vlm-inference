                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal problem about a shop owner suing a distributor, and then the distributor bringing in a third-party defendant, which is a wholesaler, and now there's a motion to dismiss a counterclaim. It's all about jurisdiction, specifically subject-matter jurisdiction in federal court. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, there's the main lawsuit: shop owner vs. distributor. The shop owner is from State A, suing in a federal district court in State A for $100,000 in damages because the distributor provided defective goods. The distributor is incorporated in State B with its principal place of business in State C.\n\nSo, in federal court, for diversity jurisdiction, you need complete diversity\u2014no plaintiff can share citizenship with any defendant, and the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000.\n\nHere, shop owner is from State A, distributor is from State B and State C (incorporated in B, principal place of business in C). I think for a corporation, its citizenship is where it's incorporated and where it has its principal place of business. So distributor is a citizen of State B and State C.\n\nSo, shop owner (State A) vs. distributor (State B and State C). There's diversity because A is different from B and C. Amount is $100,000, which is over $75,000. So, federal court has diversity jurisdiction over the main claim.\n\nNow, the distributor brings in a third-party defendant, the wholesaler, alleging that the wholesaler has a duty to indemnify the distributor for any damages the shop owner recovers. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A.\n\nSo, wholesaler is a citizen of State B and State A.\n\nNow, the wholesaler asserts a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue. The distributor moves to dismiss this counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nOkay, so we need to see if the federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this counterclaim.\n\nFirst, what's the relationship between the main claim and the counterclaim? The counterclaim is by the wholesaler against the distributor for $60,000 for payment for the goods.\n\nNow, in federal court, there's something called supplemental jurisdiction, which allows the court to hear claims that are somehow related to the main claim, even if they wouldn't normally have jurisdiction over them.\n\nBut in this case, we need to see if there's independent jurisdiction over the counterclaim or if supplemental jurisdiction applies.\n\nLet's look at independent jurisdiction first. For diversity jurisdiction, we need complete diversity and amount in controversy\u8d85\u8fc7$75,000.\n\nHere, distributor is from State B and State C, wholesaler is from State B and State A.\n\nSo, distributor (B and C) vs. wholesaler (B and A). They share citizenship in State B. So, no complete diversity. Therefore, no diversity jurisdiction over the counterclaim.\n\nNow, what about supplemental jurisdiction?\n\nSupplemental jurisdiction allows the court to hear claims that are part of the same case or controversy as the main claim, even if they don't have independent jurisdiction over them.\n\nBut there are limits to supplemental jurisdiction. One limit is that the court cannot exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim by citizens of the forum state against a non-citizen, or something like that. I think it's more nuanced.\n\nWait, the exact rule is that the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims that form part of the same case or controversy, but it cannot do so if the claim is one that could not have been originally heard by the court, like a claim between citizens of the same state.\n\nIn this case, the main claim is shop owner (A) vs. distributor (B and C), which has diversity. Now, the counterclaim is wholesaler (B and A) vs. distributor (B and C).\n\nSo, the counterclaim is between entities that share citizenship in State B. So, no diversity jurisdiction for the counterclaim.\n\nBut since it's part of the same transaction or occurrence as the main claim, federal court might hear it under supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nBut I think there's a rule that supplemental jurisdiction doesn't extend to claims between co-defendants where there's no independent jurisdiction.\n\nWait, let's see. The wholesaler is a third-party defendant brought in by the distributor.\n\nSo, the shop owner sued the distributor, and the distributor sued the wholesaler.\n\nThen, the wholesaler asserts a counterclaim against the distributor.\n\nSo, it's a bit complicated.\n\nI think the key is whether the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim.\n\nGenerally, federal courts can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over counterclaims between defendants if the counterclaim is part of the same case or controversy.\n\nBut in this case, since there's no diversity between wholesaler and distributor, and amount is $60,000, which is under $75,000, so no diversity jurisdiction.\n\nBut since it's part of the same transaction or occurrence, maybe supplemental jurisdiction applies.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.\n\nWait, the wholesaler is from State A and State B, distributor is from State B and State C. So, they share State B, but wholesaler has State A as well. Not sure if their principal places of business are diverse, but I think the relevant thing is citizenship.\n\nB. No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.\n\nThis suggests that supplemental jurisdiction applies.\n\nC. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.\n\nThis suggests that without diversity, and without supplemental jurisdiction, the court doesn't have jurisdiction.\n\nD. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.\n\nWait, shop owner is from State A, wholesaler is from State A and State B. So, they share State A, meaning no diversity between them.\n\nBut the counterclaim is between distributor and wholesaler, not shop owner and wholesaler.\n\nWait, but the shop owner sued the distributor, who brought in the wholesaler, who counterclaimed against the distributor.\n\nSo, the counterclaim is between distributor and wholesaler.\n\nBut the shop owner is involved in the case, so perhaps the relationships are complex.\n\nI think the key is whether there's supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim.\n\nGiven that the counterclaim is between entities that share citizenship in State B, and the amount is $60,000, which is under the $75,000 threshold, there's no diversity jurisdiction.\n\nBut since it's part of the same transaction or occurrence as the main claim, supplemental jurisdiction might apply.\n\nHowever, there's a limit to supplemental jurisdiction\u2014generally, it can't be used to hear claims that don't meet the jurisdictional requirements on their own, but are part of the same case or controversy.\n\nIn practice, federal courts often exercise supplemental jurisdiction over counterclaims between defendants if they arise from the same transaction or occurrence.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's allowed in this specific scenario.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.\n\nI don't think that's correct because their citizenship isn't diverse; they share citizenship in State B.\n\nB. No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.\n\nThis might be correct if supplemental jurisdiction does apply.\n\nC. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.\n\nThis suggests that without diversity, and without supplemental jurisdiction, the motion to dismiss should be granted. But if supplemental jurisdiction applies, then this wouldn't be correct.\n\nD. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.\n\nBut the counterclaim is between distributor and wholesaler, not shop owner and wholesaler. So, this seems irrelevant.\n\nGiven that, I think option B might be correct\u2014supplemental jurisdiction allows the court to hear the counterclaim.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident.\n\nAlternatively, option C could be correct if supplemental jurisdiction doesn't apply.\n\nI think I need to look up the exact rules on supplemental jurisdiction in this context.\n\nUpon reviewing the federal rules, particularly 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367, which deals with supplemental jurisdiction, it states that in cases where the federal court has original jurisdiction, it can also hear other claims that are part of the same case or controversy, even if they don't meet the jurisdictional requirements on their own.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions. For example, the court cannot exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims by plaintiffs against defendants that they would not otherwise have jurisdiction over.\n\nIn this case, the main claim is shop owner vs. distributor, which has diversity jurisdiction. Then, distributor brings in wholesaler as a third-party defendant. Wholesaler then asserts a counterclaim against distributor.\n\nGiven that the counterclaim is between distributor and wholesaler, and there's no diversity between them (both are citizens of State B), and the amount is $60,000, which is under the $75,000 threshold, there's no independent jurisdiction.\n\nBut since it's part of the same transaction or occurrence as the main claim, supplemental jurisdiction might apply.\n\nHowever, some courts might hold that supplemental jurisdiction doesn't extend to counterclaims between co-defendants where there's no independent jurisdiction.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, and looking back at the options:\n\nA. No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.\n\nThis doesn't make sense because their citizenship isn't diverse; they share State B.\n\nB. No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.\n\nThis could be correct if supplemental jurisdiction applies.\n\nC. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.\n\nThis could be correct if supplemental jurisdiction doesn't apply.\n\nD. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.\n\nThis seems irrelevant because the counterclaim is between distributor and wholesaler.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is C. Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.\n\nThe reasoning is that there's no diversity jurisdiction over the counterclaim, and supplemental jurisdiction may not extend to this situation, so the motion to dismiss should be granted.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. It's a tricky question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
