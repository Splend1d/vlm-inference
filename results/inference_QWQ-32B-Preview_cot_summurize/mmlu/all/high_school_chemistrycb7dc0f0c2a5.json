                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about a reaction that's nonspontaneous under standard conditions but becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures. I need to figure out what that tells me about the standard Gibbs free energy change, \u0394G, and maybe about the enthalpy change, \u0394H, and the entropy change, \u0394S.\n\nFirst, I know that for a reaction to be spontaneous, the Gibbs free energy change, \u0394G, needs to be negative. Under standard conditions, the reaction is nonspontaneous, which means \u0394G is positive. So, \u0394G > 0 under standard conditions.\n\nBut at higher temperatures, the reaction becomes spontaneous, so \u0394G becomes negative. So, there's a temperature dependence here.\n\nI recall that the Gibbs free energy change is related to enthalpy and entropy by the equation:\n\n\u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u0394H is the enthalpy change of the reaction\n\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n\n- \u0394S is the entropy change of the reaction\n\nGiven that \u0394G changes sign with temperature, from positive at standard conditions to negative at higher temperatures, that suggests that the term T\u0394S is playing a significant role here.\n\nLet me think about how \u0394G changes with temperature. If I rearrange the equation:\n\n\u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S\n\nI can see that as temperature increases, the term T\u0394S becomes larger. If \u0394S is positive, then increasing T makes -T\u0394S more negative, which could make \u0394G more negative, favoring spontaneity. If \u0394S is negative, increasing T makes -T\u0394S more positive, which would make \u0394G larger positive, making the reaction less spontaneous.\n\nBut in this case, the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures, meaning \u0394G becomes negative. So, the -T\u0394S term must be making \u0394G more negative as T increases. That suggests that \u0394S is positive because T is positive, and a positive \u0394S would make -T\u0394S negative, which subtracted from \u0394H would make \u0394G more negative.\n\nWait, but the reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions, meaning \u0394G > 0 at standard temperature (usually 298 K). Then, at higher temperatures, \u0394G becomes negative.\n\nSo, let's consider the standard conditions first:\n\n\u0394G\u00b0 = \u0394H\u00b0 - T\u00b0\u0394S\u00b0 > 0\n\nAnd at higher temperature, T':\n\n\u0394G' = \u0394H\u00b0 - T'\u0394S\u00b0 < 0\n\nSince T' > T\u00b0, and \u0394G' < 0 while \u0394G\u00b0 > 0, that implies that \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0 must have opposite signs.\n\nLet me see: if \u0394H\u00b0 is positive and \u0394S\u00b0 is positive, then at low T, \u0394G\u00b0 = positive \u0394H\u00b0 - T\u00b0*positive \u0394S\u00b0. If \u0394H\u00b0 is larger than T\u00b0\u0394S\u00b0, then \u0394G\u00b0 is positive. At higher T, T'\u0394S\u00b0 becomes larger, so \u0394G' = \u0394H\u00b0 - T'\u0394S\u00b0 could become negative if T'\u0394S\u00b0 exceeds \u0394H\u00b0.\n\nSimilarly, if \u0394H\u00b0 is negative and \u0394S\u00b0 is negative, then \u0394G\u00b0 = negative \u0394H\u00b0 - T\u00b0*negative \u0394S\u00b0 = negative \u0394H\u00b0 + T\u00b0\u0394S\u00b0. If negative \u0394H\u00b0 is smaller than T\u00b0\u0394S\u00b0, then \u0394G\u00b0 is positive. At higher T, T'\u0394S\u00b0 becomes larger positive, so \u0394G' = negative \u0394H\u00b0 + T'\u0394S\u00b0 could become more positive, which contradicts the given that the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures. So, this scenario doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but the question says the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures, meaning \u0394G' < 0. So, in the case where \u0394H\u00b0 is negative and \u0394S\u00b0 is negative, \u0394G' would be negative \u0394H\u00b0 + T'\u0394S\u00b0. For \u0394G' to be negative, negative \u0394H\u00b0 + T'\u0394S\u00b0 < 0. But since \u0394S\u00b0 is negative, T'\u0394S\u00b0 is negative, so it's negative \u0394H\u00b0 minus something positive, which could be more negative, but according to the standard condition, \u0394G\u00b0 = negative \u0394H\u00b0 + T\u00b0\u0394S\u00b0 > 0. Then at higher T, T'\u0394S\u00b0 is more negative, so \u0394G' = negative \u0394H\u00b0 + more negative, which would make \u0394G' more positive, not negative. So, this doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, the only scenario that fits is \u0394H\u00b0 positive and \u0394S\u00b0 positive.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nAt standard temperature T\u00b0:\n\n\u0394G\u00b0 = \u0394H\u00b0 - T\u00b0\u0394S\u00b0 > 0\n\nAt higher temperature T':\n\n\u0394G' = \u0394H\u00b0 - T'\u0394S\u00b0 < 0\n\nGiven that T' > T\u00b0, and \u0394H\u00b0 is positive, \u0394S\u00b0 is positive.\n\nSo, \u0394H\u00b0 - T\u00b0\u0394S\u00b0 > 0, but \u0394H\u00b0 - T'\u0394S\u00b0 < 0.\n\nThis implies that T'\u0394S\u00b0 > \u0394H\u00b0, while T\u00b0\u0394S\u00b0 < \u0394H\u00b0.\n\nSince T' > T\u00b0, and \u0394S\u00b0 is positive, this makes sense.\n\nTherefore, under standard conditions, \u0394H\u00b0 > 0 and \u0394S\u00b0 > 0, and \u0394G\u00b0 > 0.\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0 and \u0394G = 0\n\nB. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S < 0 and \u0394G > 0\n\nC. \u0394H < 0, \u0394S < 0 and \u0394G > 0\n\nD. \u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0 and \u0394G > 0\n\nSo, option D matches: \u0394H > 0, \u0394S > 0, and \u0394G > 0 under standard conditions.\n\nBut wait, the reaction becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures, which fits with \u0394H > 0 and \u0394S > 0.\n\nOptions A, B, and C have \u0394S < 0, which, as I reasoned earlier, would not lead to the reaction becoming spontaneous at higher temperatures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
