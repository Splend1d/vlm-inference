                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out if the homeowner has a viable claim against the snowblower manufacturer for damages. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the homeowner was injured when the automatic cutoff switch failed to function on his snowblower. He had owned the snowblower for a year, and during that time, the cutoff switch had been working fine. So, initially, there was no issue with the product.\n\nThen, something changed. The snowblower was improperly repaired by a mechanic. The operating manual had a clear warning against making alterations to the switch mechanism, specifically the alteration that the mechanic ended up making. However, the mechanic didn't have the manual available when he did the repair.\n\nNow, the question is whether the homeowner can hold the manufacturer liable for his injuries.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the homeowner was contributorily negligent in failing to furnish the snowblower's manual to the mechanic.\n\nThis suggests that the homeowner share some blame because he didn't provide the manual to the mechanic. Maybe the homeowner should have made sure the mechanic had access to the manual to prevent such alterations.\n\nB. No, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration of the snowblower by a third party.\n\nThis option implies that since a third party (the mechanic) made an improper alteration to the snowblower, which led to the failure, the manufacturer isn't liable. The alteration broke the causal link between the product and the injury.\n\nC. Yes, because a defect in the snowblower caused the homeowner's injury.\n\nThis suggests that there was something wrong with the snowblower itself, making the manufacturer liable for any injuries resulting from that defect.\n\nD. Yes, because the manufacturer should have made the manual available to repair personnel.\n\nThis option proposes that the manufacturer had a responsibility to ensure that repair personnel had access to the manual, and by not doing so, they are liable for any injuries that result from improper repairs.\n\nLet's analyze these options more deeply.\n\nFirst, was there a defect in the snowblower? Initially, the cutoff switch was working fine for a year. It only failed after the mechanic made an improper alteration. So, it seems that the failure was due to the alteration, not a pre-existing defect in the product.\n\nOption C suggests that a defect in the snowblower caused the injury, but based on the information provided, the defect was introduced by the mechanic's alteration, not by the manufacturer.\n\nOption A blames the homeowner for not providing the manual to the mechanic, implying that if the manual had been available, the mechanic wouldn't have made the alteration. This could be seen as contributory negligence on the homeowner's part.\n\nOption B states that since the injury resulted from a substantial alteration by a third party, the manufacturer isn't liable. This makes sense because the alteration likely changed the product in a way that wasn't intended by the manufacturer, potentially voiding any warranties or liability.\n\nOption D suggests that the manufacturer should have made the manual available to repair personnel, implying a responsibility to ensure that repairs are done correctly.\n\nBut let's think about product liability principles. Generally, manufacturers are liable for defects in their products that cause injuries to consumers. However, if the product is altered after it leaves the manufacturer's control, and the alteration causes the injury, the manufacturer may not be liable. This is known as the \"substantial alteration\" defense.\n\nIn this case, the mechanic made an alteration to the switch mechanism, which is precisely what the manual warned against. Since the alteration was substantial and directly related to the part that failed, it's likely that the manufacturer could argue that the alteration broke the chain of causation between the product's condition at the time of sale and the injury.\n\nAdditionally, the homeowner may be seen as contributorily negligent for not providing the manual to the mechanic, especially since the manual contained clear warnings about not altering the switch mechanism.\n\nOn the other hand, one could argue that the manufacturer should have taken steps to ensure that repair personnel had access to the manual, to prevent such alterations from happening. This is what option D suggests.\n\nHowever, in most jurisdictions, once a product leaves the manufacturer's control, and is altered in a way that isn't foreseeable, the manufacturer isn't liable for injuries resulting from those alterations.\n\nIn this scenario, the alteration was specifically warned against in the manual, which suggests that the manufacturer was aware of the potential for such alterations and had taken steps to prevent them by including warnings.\n\nGiven all this, it seems that the most reasonable answer is option B: no, because the injury resulted from a substantial alteration of the snowblower by a third party.\n\nThe alteration by the mechanic changed the product in a way that wasn't intended by the manufacturer, and this alteration directly caused the failure of the cutoff switch, leading to the homeowner's injury.\n\nTherefore, the manufacturer likely wouldn't be liable for the homeowner's injuries in this case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
