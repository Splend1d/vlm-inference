                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the example that demonstrates operant conditioning. First, I should remember what operant conditioning is. It's a type of learning where behavior is modified by its consequences, right? So, it's about how rewards or punishments affect whether a behavior is repeated or not.\n\nOption A: Milo starts at the sound of a buzzer because it sounds similar to his alarm clock. This seems more like classical conditioning, where a stimulus triggers a reflexive response. The buzzer is like the conditioned stimulus, and starting at the sound is the conditioned response, similar to how his alarm clock wakes him up. So, this isn't operant conditioning.\n\nOption B: Paula gets promoted and promises not to lose touch with her employees. Here, getting promoted is probably a reward for her performance or behavior in the company. Her vow to stay connected might be a result of wanting to maintain that positive relationship with her employees, perhaps to keep her promotion or to feel good about her leadership. This could be operant conditioning if her behavior of staying connected is reinforced by positive feedback from her employees or continued success in her role.\n\nOption C: Rebecca cancels her credit card to avoid the annual fee but plans to reinstate it next year. This seems like a decision based on cost-benefit analysis. She's avoiding a negative consequence (the fee) by canceling the card, but plans to reverse that action later. It's more about managing finances than about behavior being modified by consequences in a learning context.\n\nOption D: Ashmed speaks louder on the phone to his mother because she's hard of hearing. This is more about adjusting communication based on the recipient's needs. It's not necessarily about the consequences affecting whether he repeats this behavior in the future, unless perhaps his mother appreciates it and reinforces his behavior. But it's not clearly operant conditioning.\n\nComparing these, option B seems most aligned with operant conditioning. Paula's behavior (staying connected with employees) is likely reinforced by positive consequences (good relationships, job satisfaction, possibly further promotions), which encourages her to continue that behavior.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
