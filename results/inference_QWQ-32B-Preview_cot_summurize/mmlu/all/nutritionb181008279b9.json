                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about protein digestibility. So, we have four options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"The digestibility of plant proteins is generally less good compared to animal proteins.\" Hmm, I've heard something about this before. Plant proteins often contain anti-nutritional factors like phytates and lectins, which can interfere with digestion. Also, plant proteins might not have all the essential amino acids in the same proportions as animal proteins, which could affect their digestibility. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B says: \"The digestibility of meat protein is less good compared with plant proteins.\" Wait a minute, this seems to contradict option A. If plant proteins have those anti-nutritional factors, then meat proteins should be more digestible, right? Meat proteins are usually more similar to human proteins in amino acid composition, which might make them easier to digest and absorb. So, this option doesn't align with what I know.\n\nOption C says: \"Digestibility can only be measured at the terminal ileum.\" Now, I need to think about how digestibility is measured. The terminal ileum is the last part of the small intestine, and it's where most nutrient absorption occurs. So, measuring digestibility at the terminal ileum might make sense because it reflects how much of the protein has been broken down and absorbed before reaching the large intestine. But is it the only place where digestibility can be measured? Maybe not. There might be other methods to assess protein digestibility.\n\nOption D says: \"Digestibility can only be measured as faecal digestibility.\" Faecal digestibility refers to measuring the amount of undigested protein that comes out in the feces. So, if you eat a certain amount of protein and then measure how much protein is excreted in the feces, you can calculate how much was digested. This seems like a common method, but again, is it the only way? Probably not. There might be other approaches, like measuring nitrogen balance or using markers to track protein digestion.\n\nConsidering all this, option A seems to be the most accurate statement based on what I know about protein sources and their digestibility. Plant proteins often have lower digestibility compared to animal proteins due to various factors. Options B, C, and D either contradict known facts or are too restrictive in their assertions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
