Sovereignty means being able to enter into treaties and join the UN.\n\nC. Sovereignty means freedom to determine one's own affairs without external interference.\n\nD. Sovereignty means possessing the right to defend oneself.\n\nI need to pick the best definition among these. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that sovereignty is a big concept in international relations and political science. It's basically about a state's independence and authority.\n\nOption A says sovereignty means being recognized by all other states. Hmm, that sounds important because without recognition, a state might not be able to participate in the international community. But is recognition the essence of sovereignty? Maybe not entirely. I think sovereignty is more about the inherent right to govern oneself rather than just being acknowledged by others.\n\nOption B mentions the ability to enter into treaties and join the UN. These are certainly privileges of sovereign states. To enter treaties and be a member of the UN, a state needs to be recognized as sovereign. But again, is this the definition of sovereignty? It seems more like consequences or manifestations of sovereignty rather than the core definition.\n\nOption C states that sovereignty is freedom to determine one's own affairs without external interference. This sounds very fundamental. It touches on the idea that a sovereign state has the authority to make its own decisions regarding its internal and external affairs without being influenced or controlled by other states. This seems like a solid definition.\n\nOption D says sovereignty means possessing the right to defend oneself. While self-defense is certainly a right of sovereign states, is this the entirety of sovereignty? It seems somewhat narrow. Sovereignty involves more than just the right to defend oneself; it includes the right to govern, make laws, conduct foreign policy, and so on.\n\nComparing all these options, option C seems to capture the essence of sovereignty most accurately. It emphasizes the autonomy and independence of a state in determining its own affairs without external interference. This aligns with how sovereignty is generally understood in international law and politics.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or if one option is part of another. For example, the right to defend oneself could be seen as part of the broader freedom to determine one's own affairs. Similarly, being able to enter into treaties is a way to exercise one's sovereignty in foreign affairs.\n\nHowever, the core idea remains that sovereignty is about a state's independence and self-governance. Recognition by other states and the ability to participate in international organizations are consequences of sovereignty rather than definitions of it.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option C: Sovereignty means freedom to determine one's own affairs without external interference.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
