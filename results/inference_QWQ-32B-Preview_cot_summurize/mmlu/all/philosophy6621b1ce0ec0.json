I remember that Butler was an 18th-century Anglican bishop and philosopher, known for his work in moral philosophy. His most famous work is \"Fifteen Sermons Preached at the Rolls Chapel.\"\n\nButler is known for his theory of conscience and his idea that moral truths are known through reflection and conscience. He believed that human nature is complex and that there are different principles or passions within us, but conscience is the highest authority in moral decision-making.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Our strongest inward principle.\n\nThis seems plausible because sometimes we might be driven by the strongest desire or passion. However, Butler emphasizes that conscience is superior to particular passions or inclinations. So, perhaps this isn't the best choice.\n\nB. Our highest inward principle.\n\nThis sounds promising. Butler often refers to conscience as the highest judge of moral actions. He argues that conscience has a unique authority and should guide our actions above other principles or passions.\n\nC. All of our inward principles.\n\nThis seems too broad. Butler acknowledges that there are multiple principles within us, but he doesn't suggest that we should act in accordance with all of them equally. Instead, he seems to prioritize conscience over other principles.\n\nD. The commands of God.\n\nWhile Butler was a theologian, and religion played a role in his moral philosophy, he didn't base morality solely on divine commands. He believed that moral truths could be known through reason and conscience, independent of specific religious doctrines.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems the most accurate. Butler's view is that acting virtuously consists of acting in accordance with our highest inward principle, which is conscience.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
