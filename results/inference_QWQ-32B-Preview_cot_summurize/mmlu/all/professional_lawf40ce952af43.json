The bakery sued the mill in a federal court in State A for breach of contract, seeking $100,000 in damages. The contract between the bakery and the mill contained a clause designating State B courts as the sole venue for litigating disputes arising under the contract. Under precedent of the highest court in State A, forum-selection clauses are unenforceable as against public policy; under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, such clauses are enforceable. The mill has moved to transfer the case to a federal court in State B, citing the forum-selection clause in the parties' contract and asserting the facts that the flour was produced in State B and that the majority of likely witnesses are in State B. Is the court likely to grant the mill's motion?\n\nA. No, because State A law treats forum- selection clauses as unenforceable.\nB. No, because the mill should have instead filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue.\nC. Yes, because federal common law makes the forum-selection clause controlling.\nD.

                    "text": "This is a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step. So, we have a bakery in State A suing a mill in State B for breach of contract over flour quality. The contract has a forum-selection clause choosing State B courts as the sole venue for disputes. Now, there's a conflict because State A's highest court says these clauses are unenforceable due to public policy, but the U.S. Supreme Court says they are enforceable.\n\nThe mill wants to move the case from the federal court in State A to one in State B, citing the forum-selection clause and that most witnesses and the flour production are in State B.\n\nFirst, we need to think about what law applies here. Since it's a federal court, federal procedural laws usually govern. In particular, transfers of venue are typically governed by federal law, specifically 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), which allows for transfer to a more convenient forum.\n\nBut here, there's a forum-selection clause, which might have its own rules. The U.S. Supreme Court has generally favored enforcing these clauses, unless there's a strong showing that the forum chosen is unfair or unreasonable.\n\nNow, State A's highest court says these clauses are unenforceable as against public policy. But in federal court, federal law usually prevails over state law in these procedural matters, especially when it comes to forum-selection clauses.\n\nSo, option A says no, because State A law makes forum-selection clauses unenforceable. But since this is federal court, federal law might supersede State A's law.\n\nOption B says no, because the mill should have filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue instead of a motion to transfer. But actually, a forum-selection clause can be invoked either way\u2014either to challenge venue or to seek a transfer. So, this seems like a weak argument.\n\nOption C says yes, because federal common law makes the forum-selection clause controlling. This seems plausible, given that the U.S. Supreme Court favors enforcing these clauses.\n\nOption D says yes, because federal law governs transfers of venue, and it would be more convenient to litigate in State B.\n\nBetween C and D, both seem plausible, but D adds the convenience factor, which is also considered under \u00a7 1404(a).\n\nHowever, the primary basis here is the forum-selection clause. Federal courts generally enforce these clauses unless there's a strong reason not to. The fact that the U.S. Supreme Court says they are enforceable weighs heavily in favor of transferring the case to State B.\n\nAlso, considering that the contract was between parties in different states, and the dispute is over a contract, this falls under federal diversity jurisdiction.\n\nMoreover, the clause designates State B as the sole venue, and State B has a connection to the dispute since the flour was produced there and most witnesses are there.\n\nTherefore, it seems likely that the court would grant the mill's motion to transfer the case to State B.\n\nSo, among the options, C and D both seem correct, but C focuses more on the forum-selection clause being controlling, which aligns with the Supreme Court's stance.\n\nBut D also considers the convenience factor, which is relevant under \u00a7 1404(a).\n\nPerhaps the best answer is D, because it encompasses both the federal law governing transfers and the convenience factors.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider that forum-selection clauses are generally enforceable under federal law, and the Supreme Court has held that they should be upheld unless enforcement would be unreasonable or unjust.\n\nIn this case, there's no indication that enforcing the clause would be unreasonable or unjust. The mill is in State B, the flour was produced there, and most witnesses are there, so it seems reasonable to litigate there.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to grant the motion to transfer.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Yes, because federal law governs transfers of venue, and it would be more convenient for the witnesses and parties to litigate the claim in State B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
