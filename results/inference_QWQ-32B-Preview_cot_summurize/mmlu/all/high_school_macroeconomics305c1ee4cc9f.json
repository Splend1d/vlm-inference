                    "text": "So the CPI has gone from 120 to 150, and I need to figure out by what percentage prices have risen. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that CPI stands for Consumer Price Index, and it's a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. So, if the CPI increases, that means prices are going up, right?\n\nOkay, so from 120 to 150, that's an increase. I need to calculate the percentage increase. I think the formula for percentage increase is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{new value} - \\text{old value}}{\\text{old value}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{150 - 120}{120} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{30}{120} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 0.25 \\times 100\\% = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nWait, that says 25%. But let's double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard that you can calculate the percentage change using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{new value}}{\\text{old value}} \\right) \\times 100\\% - 100\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, let's try that:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage change} = \\left( \\frac{150}{120} \\right) \\times 100\\% - 100\\% = 1.25 \\times 100\\% - 100\\% = 125\\% - 100\\% = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nOkay, same answer, 25%. So, according to this, prices have risen by 25%.\n\nBut let's look at the options again:\n\nA. risen 20 percent.\n\nB. risen 25 percent.\n\nC. fallen 30 percent.\n\nD. risen 30 percent.\n\nOption B seems to be the correct answer based on my calculations. But wait, maybe I should consider something else.\n\nI recall that CPI is a index where the base year is usually set to 100, and changes in the index reflect changes in price levels. So, if the CPI increases from 120 to 150, it means that prices have increased by the difference between these two values relative to the base.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the ratio of the new CPI to the old CPI and then subtract one to get the percentage change.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage change} = \\left( \\frac{150}{120} \\right) - 1 = 1.25 - 1 = 0.25 = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nAgain, 25%. Okay, I'm getting consistent results here. So, the correct answer should be B. risen 25 percent.\n\nBut why is there an option for risen 30 percent? Maybe some people calculate it differently. Let's see.\n\nPerhaps they are calculating the percentage change differently, like taking the difference (30) and dividing by the new value instead of the old value.\n\nWait, that would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage change} = \\left( \\frac{30}{150} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 20\\%\n\\]\n\nWhich is option A. But that's not correct for percentage increase. That's actually percentage decrease if you were going from 150 to 120.\n\nSo, no, that doesn't make sense. The correct way is to divide the difference by the old value, which is 30/120 = 0.25, or 25%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are considering the CPI itself as a percentage of the base year. So, if CPI is 150, that means prices are 150% of the base year, and 120 means prices are 120% of the base year.\n\nSo, the percentage increase from 120% to 150% would still be:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{150 - 120}{120} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this. The correct answer is B. risen 25 percent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nWait, maybe considering inflation rates or something else, but no, the question is straightforward: the CPI went from 120 to 150, what is the percentage increase in prices.\n\nI've calculated it three different ways, all leading to 25%. So, I'm confident that B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
