Hmm, I think Sheryl Swoopes was one of the early MVPs, but I'm not sure about the exact year.\n\nLet me think about this. In 1999, the WNBA was still in its early years, right? I know that Sheryl Swoopes was a founding member of the league and she won MVP in the first few seasons. I think she won it in 1998, but I'm not sure about 1999.\n\nWhat about Lisa Leslie? She was a dominant player in the WNBA, and I believe she won multiple MVP awards. Maybe it was in 1999. Yolanda Griffith was also a strong player, but I don't recall her winning MVP that early in her career.\n\nRebecca Lobo, she was a key player on the UConn women's basketball team and was drafted into the WNBA, but I don't think she won MVP in 1999.\n\nWait a minute, 1999 was a big year for women's basketball because of the World Championship, where the USA team won gold. I think Sheryl Swoopes was on that team, along with Lisa Leslie and Rebecca Lobo.\n\nMaybe I should look up the WNBA MVP winners from that time period to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to eliminate some options. Rebecca Lobo had a good career, but I don't recall her being the MVP in 1999. Yolanda Griffith was a solid player, but again, I don't think she won MVP that year.\n\nBetween Sheryl Swoopes and Lisa Leslie, I'm leaning towards Lisa Leslie. I think she won her first MVP around that time.\n\nLet me see, Lisa Leslie was a four-time WNBA MVP, if I remember correctly. Her first MVP was in 2001, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it was Sheryl Swoopes who won in 1998, and then Lisa Leslie later on.\n\nActually, looking back, Sheryl Swoopes was the WNBA's first MVP in 1997, and then maybe again in 1998.\n\nSo, in 1999, it might have been someone else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Yolanda Griffith had a standout year in 1999 and won the MVP.\n\nI'm getting confused now. Maybe I should just guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with Lisa Leslie.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
