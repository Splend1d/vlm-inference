Fixed interval\n\nD. Variable ratio\n\nI remember that reinforcement schedules affect how behaviors are learned and how well they hold up when the reinforcement stops. Extinction resistance refers to how long a behavior continues even after the reinforcement is removed.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each schedule means:\n\n1. **Continuous reinforcement (CRF):** Reinforcement is provided every time the desired behavior is exhibited.\n\n2. **Fixed ratio (FR):** Reinforcement is given after a set number of responses.\n\n3. **Fixed interval (FI):** Reinforcement is provided after a set amount of time, provided at least one response has been made during that interval.\n\n4. **Variable ratio (VR):** Reinforcement is delivered after an average number of responses, but the exact number varies.\n\nNow, regarding extinction resistance:\n\n- **Continuous reinforcement** typically leads to rapid learning but also rapid extinction once the reinforcement stops. This is because the organism has learned that the behavior always leads to reinforcement, so when it no longer does, the behavior stops quickly.\n\n- **Fixed ratio schedules** tend to produce a high rate of response with a brief pause after reinforcement, and they are fairly resistant to extinction. The behavior continues even after reinforcement stops, but not as persistently as with variable ratio schedules.\n\n- **Fixed interval schedules** usually result in a scalloped response pattern, with responses increasing as the interval progresses. Extinction with FI schedules is moderately resistant; the behavior doesn't disappear immediately but diminishes over time.\n\n- **Variable ratio schedules** are known for producing very high response rates and extremely resistant behavior to extinction. The variability in the number of responses required for reinforcement makes the behavior very persistent.\n\nGiven this, the schedule that results in the least resistance to extinction should be the one where behavior stops more quickly once reinforcement is removed. That seems to be continuous reinforcement, as it leads to rapid extinction.\n\nBut let's double-check:\n\n- CRF: Fast learning, fast extinction.\n\n- FR: Moderate learning, moderate extinction resistance.\n\n- FI: Slower learning, moderate extinction resistance.\n\n- VR: Slowest learning, most resistant to extinction.\n\nSo, indeed, continuous reinforcement would result in behavior that is least resistant to extinction.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Continuous.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
