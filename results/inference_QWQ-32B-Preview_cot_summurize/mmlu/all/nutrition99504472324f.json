So, I need to consider what typically changes in the body as people age.\n\nOption A is \"a reduction in lean body mass.\" I know that as people age, they tend to lose muscle mass, which is part of lean body mass. This is often referred to as sarcopenia. So, that seems like it happens with increasing age.\n\nOption B is \"a reduction in bone density.\" Again, osteoporosis is a condition that becomes more common with age, leading to reduced bone density. So, this also seems like it occurs with increasing age.\n\nOption C is \"an increased appetite.\" Now, I'm not sure about this one. As people age, their metabolism changes, and some might eat less because of reduced physical activity or changes in smell and taste. But I've also heard that some older adults might have increased appetite due to certain medications or health conditions. However, generally speaking, appetite tends to decrease with age.\n\nOption D is \"impaired immune function.\" This is known as immunosenescence, where the immune system becomes less efficient at fighting off infections and diseases as we age. So, this definitely occurs with increasing age.\n\nComparing all these options, A, B, and D are all recognized changes that happen as people get older. Option C, \"an increased appetite,\" doesn't seem to be a typical change with aging; in fact, it's more common for appetite to decrease.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. An increased appetite does not occur with increasing age; instead, appetite generally decreases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
