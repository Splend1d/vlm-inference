                    "text": "Let's see. I need to identify which option is not an example of connective tissue. I know that connective tissue is one of the four main types of tissue in the body, and it includes things like fat, bone, and, well, connective tissues that hold everything together.\n\nOption A is ligaments. I think ligaments connect bones to other bones, so they should be connective tissue. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nOption B is muscle. Now, muscles are tissues that contract and help us move, but I'm not sure if they're considered connective tissue. I think muscles are a separate type of tissue called muscle tissue. There are different types of muscle tissue: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles. So, maybe muscle isn't a connective tissue.\n\nOption C is blood. I've heard that blood is a type of connective tissue because it consists of cells suspended in a liquid matrix, which is plasma. So, blood should be considered connective tissue.\n\nOption D is cartilage. Cartilage is a flexible tissue that's part of the skeletal system, and I believe it's also a type of connective tissue.\n\nSo, if I have to choose which one is not a connective tissue, it might be muscle, option B. But let me double-check.\n\nConnective tissue includes things like:\n\n- Adipose tissue (fat)\n\n- Bone tissue\n\n- Blood\n\n- Cartilage\n\n- Tendons and ligaments\n\n- Are muscles included in connective tissue? I don't think so. Muscles are made of muscle cells that have the ability to contract, which is different from the functions of connective tissue.\n\nConnective tissue is mainly involved in supporting, connecting, and surrounding other tissues and organs. Muscle tissue, on the other hand, is specialized for contraction and movement.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, muscle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
