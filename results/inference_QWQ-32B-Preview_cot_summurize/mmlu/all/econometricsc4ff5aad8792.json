                    "text": "Let's see, I need to figure out which disadvantages of the Dickey-Fuller/Engle-Granger approach are true according to the options given. So, first things first, I need to recall what the Engle-Granger two-step method is all about.\n\nEngle-Granger is a way to test for cointegration between two or more non-stationary time series. It involves first estimating a long-run relationship between the variables and then testing the residuals for a unit root to see if they are stationary, which would indicate cointegration.\n\nOkay, so looking at option (i): \"Only one cointegrating relationship can be estimated.\" I think this is correct because the Engle-Granger approach is designed for testing cointegration between two variables or, in the case of multiple variables, it tests for one cointegrating relationship at a time. If there are multiple cointegrating relationships, this method might not capture them all. So, (i) seems to be a disadvantage.\n\nOption (ii): \"Particularly for small samples. There is a high chance of the tests suggesting that variables are not cointegrated when they are.\" I believe this is referring to the power of the test. In small samples, the Dickey-Fuller test used in the second step might have low power, meaning it may fail to reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration even when cointegration exists. So, yes, this is a known issue with the Engle-Granger approach, especially in small samples.\n\nOption (iii): \"It is not possible to make inferences on the cointegrating regression.\" Hmm, this one is a bit tricky. In the Engle-Granger method, you do estimate a cointegrating regression in the first step, and you can make inferences about the coefficients of that regression. However, because the residuals are then tested for a unit root, which is asymptotic in nature, there might be some issues with the standard inference procedures in small samples. But strictly speaking, you can still make inferences, albeit potentially with some limitations. Maybe this is more about the reliability of those inferences in small samples rather than not being able to make them at all. I need to think carefully here.\n\nOption (iv): \"The procedure forces the researcher to specify which is the dependent variable and which are the independent variables.\" This is an important point. In the Engle-Granger approach, you need to specify a dependent variable and regress it on the other variables to get the residuals for the unit root test. This can be problematic because the choice of the dependent variable can affect the results. In other words, the cointegrating relationship might depend on which variable is chosen as the dependent one, which can lead to different inferences about cointegration. So, this is indeed a disadvantage.\n\nNow, considering all these points, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nI think (i), (ii), and (iv) are clearly disadvantages of the Engle-Granger approach. Option (iii) is a bit more nuanced, but since you can still make inferences, even if they are unreliable in small samples, I'm not entirely sure if \"it is not possible\" is the right way to phrase it. Maybe it would be better worded as \"inferences on the cointegrating regression may be unreliable in small samples.\"\n\nGiven that, perhaps (iii) isn't strictly correct, and the answer should be C. But I'm a bit unsure about (iii). Let me think differently. Maybe the question is considering that in the Engle-Granger framework, the cointegrating regression is estimated without taking into account the possibility of errors being non-stationary, which could affect the standard errors and hence the inferences. In that case, it might be valid to say that inferences on the cointegrating regression are problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the Engle-Granger method doesn't provide a joint estimation framework for the cointegrating relationship and the error correction model, which could lead to less efficient estimates and potentially invalid inferences.\n\nGiven this, maybe (iii) is also a valid disadvantage, and the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but option D includes all four, including (iii). If (iii) is indeed a disadvantage, then D would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects that (iii) isn't strictly true because inferences can be made, even if they are suboptimal. In that case, A would be the answer.\n\nI need to decide based on what I know about the Engle-Granger method.\n\nLet me recall: In the first step, you estimate the cointegrating regression using OLS, and then in the second step, you test the residuals for a unit root. The issue is that the residuals might not be properly accounted for in terms of their distribution, especially in small samples, which could affect the validity of hypothesis tests on the coefficients.\n\nMoreover, the asymptotic properties of the estimators in the Engle-Granger framework might not hold well in small samples, leading to unreliable inferences.\n\nSo, while it's possible to make inferences, their reliability is questionable, especially in small samples.\n\nGiven that, I think (iii) is a valid disadvantage, making C the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, option D includes all four points. If (iii) is a disadvantage, then D would be the answer.\n\nWait, no, option C is (i), (ii), and (iii) only, excluding (iv). But I think (iv) is also a disadvantage, as discussed earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is D, including all four disadvantages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers (iii) not to be a disadvantage because inferences are possible, even if they are not optimal.\n\nIn that case, A would be the answer, including only (ii) and (iv).\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me look at each option again:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nI think (i), (ii), and (iv) are definitely disadvantages of the Engle-Granger approach.\n\nOption (iii) is more about the quality of inferences rather than whether they can be made at all.\n\nPerhaps the question is worded to suggest that inferences cannot be made, which isn't entirely accurate because they can be made, but with caveats.\n\nIn that case, (iii) might not be strictly correct, and the answer would be A.\n\nAlternatively, if the question means that the inferences are unreliable or not straightforward, then (iii) could be considered a disadvantage.\n\nGiven the phrasing, \"it is not possible to make inferences,\" which is too strong, perhaps (iii) isn't accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A: (ii) and (iv) only.\n\nBut I need to be careful because I might be misinterpreting the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is designed to select all correct answers, in which case I need to choose D.\n\nWait, the question says, \"Which of the following are disadvantages...?\" implying that multiple options might be correct.\n\nGiven that, and considering my earlier thoughts, I think D is the correct answer.\n\nAll four points are indeed disadvantages of the Engle-Granger approach:\n\n(i) It can only estimate one cointegrating relationship at a time.\n\n(ii) It has low power in small samples, leading to a higher chance of Type II errors.\n\n(iii) Inferences on the cointegrating regression may be unreliable due to the two-step procedure.\n\n(iv) It requires specifying a dependent variable, which can affect the results.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
