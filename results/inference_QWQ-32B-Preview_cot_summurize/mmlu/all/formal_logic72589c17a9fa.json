Here's the text again:\n\n\"It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients. The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes. Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.\n\nB. The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.\n\nC. Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nD. It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what a conclusion is in an argument. The conclusion is the main point the arguer is trying to make, and it's usually supported by other statements, which are the premises.\n\nSo, in this passage, Freud is talking about observations in patients and peers, mentioning something about weakened intelligence due to emotions. Then he talks about the arrogance of consciousness and how it blocks unconscious complexes. Finally, he says that because of this, it's difficult to convince people of the unconscious and teach them things that contradict their conscious knowledge.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. \"It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.\"\n\nThis seems like an observation or a premise. He's noting that he sees a similar issue in peers and patients.\n\n2. \"The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.\"\n\nAgain, this seems like another premise. He's explaining that consciousness has defense mechanisms that block unconscious complexes.\n\n3. \"Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\"\n\nThis sentence starts with \"Because of this,\" which suggests it's concluding based on the previous points.\n\nSo, options C and D are similar, but C includes the \"Because of this\" part, while D is just the statement.\n\nOption A is the first sentence, which seems more like an observation or premise.\n\nOption B is the second sentence, which also seems like a premise explaining why it's hard to convince people.\n\nOption C is the third sentence, which appears to be the conclusion based on the first two premises.\n\nOption D is similar to part of option C but without the \"Because of this\" phrase.\n\nGiven that, I think the conclusion is option C, because it's the statement that follows from the preceding premises. It's the main point he's trying to make, which is that it's difficult to convince people of the unconscious and teach them things that contradict their conscious knowledge, based on the observations and explanations provided earlier.\n\nOption D is similar but misses the causal connection indicated by \"Because of this.\"\n\nSo, my answer would be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
