I remember learning that basketball was invented there by James Naismith in 1891. So, I believe the correct answer is C. Springfield Massachusetts.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the other options. Canton, Ohio, is home to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which is for American football, not basketball. Cooperstown, New York, is where you'll find the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, which is for baseball. And Lawrence, Kansas, is known for its association with the University of Kansas and their basketball program, but I don't think the Hall of Fame is there.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm confident that the answer is C. Springfield Massachusetts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
