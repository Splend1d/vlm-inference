                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a figure skater spinning and I need to figure out which direction she's facing after spinning 2250 degrees to her right, starting from facing north. The options are north, south, east, or west.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to spin 2250 degrees to the right. Since she's spinning to her right, that means she's rotating in a clockwise direction. She starts facing north, so I need to figure out where she ends up after rotating clockwise by 2250 degrees.\n\nI know that a full circle is 360 degrees, so spinning 360 degrees would bring her back to north. Spinning another 360 degrees would be 720 degrees, back to north again, and so on. So, to find out her final direction, I should probably find out how many full circles she makes and what the remainder is.\n\nLet me calculate how many full circles are in 2250 degrees. I'll divide 2250 by 360.\n\n2250 \u00f7 360 = 6.25\n\nSo, she makes 6 full circles, which would bring her back to north each time, and then an additional 0.25 of a circle. Since 0.25 \u00d7 360 = 90 degrees, she spins an extra 90 degrees clockwise from north.\n\nStarting from north, spinning 90 degrees clockwise would point her to east.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If she spins 90 degrees clockwise from north, she should be facing east. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the full rotation. After 6 full circles, she's back to north, and then an additional 90 degrees clockwise takes her to east.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of modulo arithmetic. The direction she's facing after spinning \u03b8 degrees clockwise can be found by calculating \u03b8 modulo 360, and then determining the direction based on that remainder.\n\nSo, 2250 mod 360.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n2250 \u00f7 360 = 6 with a remainder of 90, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 2250 mod 360 = 90 degrees.\n\nNow, starting from north, 90 degrees clockwise is east.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the standard compass directions:\n\n- North: 0 degrees\n\n- East: 90 degrees\n\n- South: 180 degrees\n\n- West: 270 degrees\n\nSo, 90 degrees clockwise from north is east.\n\nBut wait a minute, I should consider whether spinning to the right means clockwise or counterclockwise. In navigation and mathematics, clockwise is to the right, so I think I'm correct there.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using negative angles, since spinning to the right is clockwise, which is positive in standard position.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is solid. She spins 2250 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to 90 degrees after completing 6 full rotations. Starting from north, 90 degrees clockwise lands her facing east.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. east.\n\nBut let me check if there's any trick here that I'm missing. The question seems straightforward. She spins a total of 2250 degrees to her right, starting from north, and we need to find her final direction.\n\nI've accounted for the full rotations and the remaining angle, and it seems clear that she ends up facing east.\n\nI don't think there's any ambiguity in the question. The directions are north, east, south, west, and spinning clockwise from north, 90 degrees would be east.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is B. east.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
