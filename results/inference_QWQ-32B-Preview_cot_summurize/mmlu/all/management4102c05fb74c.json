Two equal partners share resources.\n\nC. Two unequal partners join together.\n\nD. Two unequal partners become one after a buyout.\n\nHmm, I need to think about what an acquisition really means. I know that acquisitions are common in business, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics.\n\nFirst off, what is an acquisition? From what I remember, an acquisition is when one company buys another company. So, it's like one company takes over another company. That makes sense. It's different from a merger, where two companies combine equally, right?\n\nSo, in an acquisition, it's not about two equal partners coming together. It's more about one company taking over another company. That would suggest that options A and B might not be correct because they mention equal partners deciding to work together or sharing resources. That sounds more like a partnership or a joint venture, not an acquisition.\n\nOption C says \"Two unequal partners join together.\" Well, that might be closer, but it still sounds a bit vague. Joining together could mean various things, not necessarily an acquisition.\n\nOption D says \"Two unequal partners become one after a buyout.\" That sounds a lot like an acquisition to me. One company buys out the other, and they become a single entity.\n\nLet me double-check. In an acquisition, one company purchases another company, and the acquired company ceases to exist as a separate entity. The acquiring company integrates the acquired company into its operations.\n\nSo, comparing that to the options:\n\nA. Two equal partners decide to work together. That sounds more like a strategic alliance or partnership.\n\nB. Two equal partners share resources. Again, sounds like resource sharing or joint ventures.\n\nC. Two unequal partners join together. This might be closer, but it's still not specific about one buying the other.\n\nD. Two unequal partners become one after a buyout. This aligns well with the definition of an acquisition.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. Two unequal partners become one after a buyout.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any scenarios where equal partners can be involved in an acquisition. But generally, acquisitions involve unequal partners: the buyer and the seller.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
