                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this researcher who's growing ferns in her lab, and after a few generations, she spots a new variant with a distinct look. Interesting. Now, when she tries to breed the original ferns with this new variant, no offspring are produced. But when she breeds the new variants together, they produce more of the same variant. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. It seems like there's some kind of reproductive isolation between the original ferns and the new variant. Because they can't produce offspring together, that suggests they've become reproductively separate species, in a way.\n\nLet me think about the options given:\n\nA. Adaptive radiation - That's when one species rapidly evolves into diverse forms, each adapted to a specific environment. But here, it's just one new variant appearing in the lab, not a radiation of multiple forms.\n\nB. Divergent selection - That's when different environments select for different traits, leading to divergence in populations. But in this case, it's all happening in the lab, so the environment is presumably the same for both the original and the new variant.\n\nC. Equilibrium - That usually refers to a stable state where things aren't changing much. But here, there's a new variant that's different from the original, so that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nD. Polyploidy - That's when an organism has more than two sets of chromosomes, often due to whole-genome duplications. Polyploidy can lead to reproductive isolation because polyploid individuals might not be able to breed with diploid ones.\n\nWait a minute, ferns are known for their ability to undergo polyploidy. Maybe that's what happened here. The new variant could be polyploid, which would explain why it can't breed with the original diploid ferns but can reproduce with others of the same ploidy level.\n\nLet me double-check. Polyploidy is common in plants, especially in ferns and some flowering plants. It's a mechanism that can lead to new species because the polyploid plants are often sterile with their diploid parents but can reproduce among themselves.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the new variant might be a polyploid form of the original fern, which can't produce viable offspring with the diploid original but can reproduce with other polyploids of the same kind.\n\nThat makes sense. The other options don't seem to fit as well. Adaptive radiation isn't really applicable here since it's not a diversification into multiple forms. Divergent selection requires different environments, which isn't the case in a lab setting. Equilibrium doesn't explain the appearance of a new variant. So, polyploidy seems to be the most plausible explanation.\n\nI think the answer is D. Polyploidy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
