                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about hypothesis testing with a 5% significance level, and I need to determine which of the statements are correct. The options are:\n\n(i) The significance level is equal to the size of the test.\n\n(ii) The significance level is equal to the power of the test.\n\n(iii) 2.5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test.\n\n(iv) 5% of the total distribution will be in each tail rejection region for a 2-sided test.\n\nAnd then there are choices A through D to select which statements are correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these terms means.\n\nThe significance level, often denoted by alpha (\u03b1), is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In this case, \u03b1 = 0.05 or 5%.\n\nNow, the size of the test is the maximum probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. So, for a test with a significance level of 5%, the size of the test should also be 5%. Therefore, statement (i) seems correct.\n\nNext, the power of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. This is different from the significance level, which deals with the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null when it's true. So, statement (ii) seems incorrect because the significance level is not equal to the power of the test.\n\nFor a two-sided test, the rejection region is split between both tails of the distribution. If the significance level is 5%, then typically, 2.5% of the distribution would be in each tail. So, statement (iii) seems correct, and statement (iv) would be incorrect because it suggests 5% in each tail, which would total 10%, not 5%.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. In a two-sided test with a 5% significance level, the total area in the rejection regions is 5%, divided equally between the two tails, so 2.5% in each tail. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, statement (iii) is correct, and statement (iv) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are (i) and (iii), which corresponds to choice B.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't any confusion here. Is there any scenario where the significance level is not equal to the size of the test? I think in general, for a test conducted at a 5% significance level, the size of the test is indeed 5%. So, (i) seems correct.\n\nAnd for power, that's definitely separate from the significance level, so (ii) is incorrect.\n\nAnd for a two-sided test, with \u03b1 = 0.05, each tail gets \u03b1/2 = 0.025, or 2.5%, so (iii) is correct, and (iv) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
