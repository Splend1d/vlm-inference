                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the constitutionality of a federal statute that makes Pennsylvania Avenue a one-way street, exclusively for members of Congress to ease their commute. We need to assess the validity of this statute in light of existing local ordinances and constitutional powers.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the context. Pennsylvania Avenue is located in Washington, D.C., which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress according to the Constitution. The Constitution states in Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, that Congress has the power \"To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States.\"\n\nGiven this exclusive legislative power, option A suggests that the statute is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia. This seems plausible at first glance, but we should consider whether there are any limitations to this power.\n\nOption B mentions that it is a proper exercise of Congress's enumerated property power. Congress does have authority over federal properties, but designating a street's traffic flow might not directly relate to property management. This option seems less straightforward.\n\nOption C states that the statute is invalid because the Washington, D.C., City Council has exclusive power over public thoroughfares. However, since Congress has exclusive legislation power over D.C., it's unlikely that the City Council has exclusive control over such matters. This option seems weaker.\n\nOption D argues invalidity due to a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce. For this, we'd need to see if the statute unduly affects interstate commerce. The purpose is to facilitate Congress members' travel, which doesn't seem directly related to interstate commerce. Thus, this option also seems less likely.\n\nDigging deeper, while Congress has broad powers over D.C., it's possible that there are constraints or that certain powers have been delegated to the local government. The Home Rule Act of 1973 granted the District a degree of self-governance, including authority over local affairs. However, Congress retains ultimate authority and can override local decisions.\n\nIn this case, the City Council had previously designated Pennsylvania Avenue as a two-lane street. Congress then enacts a statute to make it one-way solely for members' convenience. This seems like an exercise of Congress's legislative power over D.C., but it might also be seen as an intrusion into local matters, especially given the Home Rule Act.\n\nHowever, considering Congress's exclusive legislative power, it likely has the authority to override local ordinances, especially when it comes to matters affecting the functioning of the federal government, such as facilitating members' access to the Capitol.\n\nMoreover, the purpose of the statute is to benefit members of Congress in their official duties, which could be considered a legitimate governmental interest.\n\nRegarding option D, there's no clear indication that this statute would burden interstate commerce discriminatorily. The statute's purpose is internal to governmental operations, not to regulate commerce.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement seems to be option A: the statute is valid because Congress has exclusive power over the District of Columbia.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other constitutional principles that might invalidate the statute.\n\nOne could argue that such a statute is an improper exercise of power if it serves only the private interests of Congress members without a broader public purpose. However, since Congress members' efficient access to the Capitol could be seen as serving the public interest, this argument might not hold.\n\nAnother angle could be equal protection, if the statute benefits only certain individuals, but again, as officials essential to the functioning of government, Congress members might be justified in receiving such accommodations.\n\nIn conclusion, given Congress's exclusive legislative power over D.C., and absent any clear constitutional prohibitions, the statute appears valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
