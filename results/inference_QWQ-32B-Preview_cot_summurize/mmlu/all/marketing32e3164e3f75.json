Penetration pricing.\n\nPenetration pricing is a pricing strategy where a company sets a low initial price for a product or service to attract a large number of customers and gain market share quickly. The goal is to penetrate the market deeply by offering a price that is lower than competitors', making the product more attractive to price-sensitive customers.\n\nHere's why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Premium pricing: This strategy involves setting high prices for products or services that are perceived as high-quality or luxurious. It targets customers who are willing to pay more for superior quality or status symbols.\n\nB. Price skimming: This is a strategy where a company sets high prices for a new product when it is first introduced and then gradually lowers the price over time. It aims to capture more profit from early adopters who are less price-sensitive.\n\nC. Economy pricing: This strategy focuses on keeping costs low and passing the savings on to customers through low prices. It often involves minimizing features and focusing on efficiency to offer a basic product at a low cost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Penetration pricing."
