                    "text": "De Broglie's hypothesis is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that suggests particles can exhibit wave-like properties. Specifically, it relates the linear momentum of a particle to its wavelength through a particular constant. Let's explore this relationship step by step to determine which constant is involved.\n\nFirst, recall that in classical physics, waves are characterized by their wavelength and frequency, while particles are described by their mass and velocity. De Broglie proposed that these two aspects are interconnected for particles at the quantum scale.\n\nThe key equation that emerges from De Broglie's hypothesis is:\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength associated with the particle,\n\n- \\(h\\) is Planck's constant,\n\n- \\(p\\) is the linear momentum of the particle.\n\nThis equation shows a direct relationship between the particle's momentum and its wavelength, with Planck's constant serving as the proportionality constant.\n\nNow, let's consider each option provided:\n\nA. Planck\u2019s constant\n\nPlanck's constant (\\(h\\)) is a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics, first introduced by Max Planck in his work on blackbody radiation. It relates the energy of a photon to its frequency and appears in various quantum mechanical equations, including the uncertainty principle and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nGiven the equation \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\), it is clear that Planck's constant is the constant that relates the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle.\n\nB. Boltzmann\u2019s constant\n\nBoltzmann's constant (\\(k_B\\)) relates the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas to the temperature of the gas. It appears in the ideal gas law and other thermodynamic equations. While it is an important constant in statistical mechanics, it is not directly involved in the relationship between a particle's momentum and its wavelength.\n\nC. The Rydberg constant\n\nThe Rydberg constant is a physical constant that appears in the Rydberg formula, which describes the wavelengths of spectral lines of hydrogen-like atoms. It is significant in atomic physics but does not relate to the general relationship between a particle's momentum and wavelength as proposed by De Broglie.\n\nD. The speed of light\n\nThe speed of light (\\(c\\)) is a fundamental constant in physics, most famously appearing in Einstein's theory of relativity and in electromagnetic theory. While it is crucial in many areas of physics, it does not directly relate a particle's momentum to its wavelength in the way De Broglie's hypothesis does.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Planck\u2019s constant\n\nThis constant bridges the gap between the particle and wave nature of matter, as proposed by De Broglie, and is central to the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
