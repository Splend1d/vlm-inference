                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about the representativeness heuristic. So, the representativeness heuristic is when people judge the probability of something based on how much it resembles the typical case. In the context of judging another person's characteristics, it might mean assuming someone has certain traits because they fit a stereotype or a typical profile.\n\nThe question is asking about a problem with relying on this heuristic for judgments about others. The options are:\n\nA. causes over-reliance on statistical data.\n\nB. doesn't take base rate data into account.\n\nC. overestimates the degree to which dispositional factors affect behavior.\n\nD. doesn't take into account the limitations of working memory.\n\nI need to think about which of these is a issue with using the representativeness heuristic.\n\nOption A says it causes over-reliance on statistical data. But actually, the representativeness heuristic often leads people to ignore statistical data, especially base rates. So, this seems backwards.\n\nOption B says it doesn't take base rate data into account. Base rates are important in statistical judgments, and the representativeness heuristic is known for causing people to neglect base rates. So, this seems like a plausible answer.\n\nOption C says it overestimates the degree to which dispositional factors affect behavior. Dispositional factors are internal characteristics of a person, like their personality traits. Maybe the heuristic leads people to attribute behaviors too much to a person's disposition and not enough to situational factors. This sounds similar to the fundamental attribution error, but I'm not sure if it's directly related to the representativeness heuristic.\n\nOption D says it doesn't take into account the limitations of working memory. I'm not sure how the representativeness heuristic relates to working memory limitations. Maybe it's about how much information people can juggle when making a judgment, but I don't think that's the primary issue with this heuristic.\n\nLet me think again. The representativeness heuristic is about judging based on similarity to a prototype or stereotype. So, it might lead people to ignore other important information, like base rates or the role of situational factors.\n\nComparing options B and C, B seems more directly related to the heuristic itself, as neglecting base rates is a well-known flaw of the representativeness heuristic. Option C might be more related to attribution errors rather than the heuristic itself.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: doesn't take base rate data into account.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
