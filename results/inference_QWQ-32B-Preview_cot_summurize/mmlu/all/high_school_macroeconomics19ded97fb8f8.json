                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the characteristic that's specific to a centrally planned economic system. Okay, so first, what's a centrally planned economy? It's where the government plays a big role in deciding what goods and services are produced, how they're produced, and who gets them. It's like the opposite of a free market where everything is determined by supply and demand.\n\nOption A says, \"Resources are allocated based on relative prices.\" That sounds like something you'd hear in a market economy, right? In a free market, prices signal what's in demand and what's not, and resources flow to where they can be most profitable. So, that doesn't sound like a centrally planned economy where the government makes those decisions.\n\nOption B says, \"The circular flow of goods and services minimizes the role of the federal government.\" Hmm, circular flow is a model that shows how money and goods travel through an economy. In a market economy, the government's role is minimized, but in a centrally planned economy, the government's role is maximized. So, this seems opposite to what a centrally planned economy is.\n\nOption C says, \"Private ownership of resources is fundamental to economic growth.\" Again, this sounds like a principle of a market economy where private ownership and incentives drive production and innovation. In a centrally planned economy, resources are often owned by the state, not privately.\n\nOption D says, \"Government planners decide how best to produce goods and services.\" That sounds exactly like what happens in a centrally planned economy. The government has planners who figure out what products are needed, how to produce them, and how to distribute them.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, D seems to be the one that characterizes a centrally planned economic system.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In a centrally planned economy, the government makes most of the decisions about production and allocation, right? So, resources aren't allocated based on prices like in a market economy. Instead, planners decide based on their assessment of what's best for the economy.\n\nAlso, in such systems, private ownership is limited or non-existent because the means of production are owned by the state. So, option C is more aligned with a market economy.\n\nOption B mentions minimizing the role of the federal government, which again is more characteristic of a market economy.\n\nTherefore, option D is the correct choice because it accurately describes the role of government planners in a centrally planned economy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
