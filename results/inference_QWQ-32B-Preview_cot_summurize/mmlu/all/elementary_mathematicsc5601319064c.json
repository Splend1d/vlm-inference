                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: 13 over 4 equals x over 7. So, that's written as 13/4 = x/7. I need to solve for x. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have two fractions set equal to each other, like a/b = c/d, you can cross-multiply to solve for the unknown. So, in this case, I can cross-multiply 13 and 7, and 4 and x.\n\nThat means 13 times 7 equals 4 times x. So, 13 * 7 = 4x.\n\nLet me calculate 13 times 7. 13 * 7 is 91. So, 91 equals 4x.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x, so I'll divide both sides by 4. So, x equals 91 divided by 4.\n\nLet me do that division. 4 goes into 9 two times, that's 8, subtract from 9, you get 1. Bring down the 1, so it's 11. 4 goes into 11 two times, that's 8, subtract from 11, you get 3. Bring down the 0, so it's 30. 4 goes into 30 seven times, that's 28, subtract from 30, you get 2. Bring down the next 0, so it's 20. 4 goes into 20 five times exactly, with no remainder.\n\nSo, x equals 22.75.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 22.75\n\nB. 23.25\n\nC. 24.25\n\nD. none of these\n\nIt looks like option A is 22.75, which matches my answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nStarting again: 13/4 = x/7.\n\nCross-multiplying: 13 * 7 = 4 * x \u21d2 91 = 4x.\n\nThen, x = 91 / 4.\n\nLet me verify 91 divided by 4.\n\n4 * 22 = 88.\n\n91 - 88 = 3.\n\nSo, 22 with a remainder of 3, which is 0.75, so indeed 22.75.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions. Since 13 is to 4 as x is to 7, I could also solve it by finding the equivalent fraction.\n\nLet me try that method.\n\n13/4 = x/7.\n\nTo find x, I can multiply both sides by 7.\n\nSo, 7 * (13/4) = x.\n\nThat's the same as (7 * 13) / 4.\n\n7 * 13 is 91, divided by 4 is 22.75.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's confirmed. x equals 22.75.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. 22.75.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
