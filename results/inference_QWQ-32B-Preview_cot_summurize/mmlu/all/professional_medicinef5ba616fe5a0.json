                    "text": "Let's see. So, this 54-year-old woman had a painful dental procedure and was prescribed codeine for pain relief. She's been taking it every 4 hours as instructed, but she's still experiencing severe jaw pain. Moreover, other family members have also had poor pain control with codeine. We need to figure out the most likely reason for this therapeutic failure from the given options.\n\nFirst, let's recall what codeine is and how it works. Codeine is an opioid analgesic, which means it's used to relieve pain. It works by binding to opioid receptors in the central nervous system, which reduces the perception of pain.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Decreased absorption of codeine\n\nB. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine\n\nC. Deficiency of \u03ba receptors\n\nD. Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine\n\nLet's consider each one.\n\nOption A: Decreased absorption of codeine. If the codeine isn't being absorbed properly from the gastrointestinal tract, then it wouldn't reach the bloodstream in sufficient quantities, and thus wouldn't be effective in relieving pain. However, if this were the case, we might expect that other orally administered medications would also not work well for her, but the question doesn't provide information about that. Also, the fact that other family members have similar experiences might suggest a genetic component, but absorption issues are more related to individual factors like gastrointestinal problems.\n\nOption B: Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine. Codeine is actually a prodrug, meaning it needs to be metabolized in the liver to its active form, which is morphine. The enzyme responsible for this metabolism is CYP2D6. If someone has decreased metabolism, meaning they don't convert codeine to morphine efficiently, they won't get the pain relief they need. This could be due to genetic variations in the CYP2D6 enzyme, leading to poor metabolizers. Since other family members have similar experiences, there might be a genetic component here.\n\nOption C: Deficiency of \u03ba receptors. Opioid receptors include \u03bc, \u03ba, and \u03b4 receptors. Codeine primarily acts on \u03bc-opioid receptors, not \u03ba receptors. So, a deficiency in \u03ba receptors wouldn't likely affect codeine's efficacy. Therefore, this seems less plausible.\n\nOption D: Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine. If codeine binds more to plasma proteins, less of it would be free to cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to opioid receptors. This could reduce its effectiveness. However, again, if this were the case, it might be an individual issue, but the fact that other family members have similar experiences suggests a genetic component, which could be possible with plasma protein binding, but it's less commonly associated with genetic variations compared to metabolic enzymes.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems the most likely explanation. Poor metabolism of codeine to morphine due to genetic variations in CYP2D6 could explain why the patient and other family members experience poor pain control with codeine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
