                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this situation involving a deed and some conveyances, and I need to figure out why the brother might prevail in a dispute over the property against the grantor's children. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grantor conveyed his property to his brother for life, and then to the heirs of his brother, for one dollar. The life interest is worth $20,000, and the total property is worth $50,000. The brother accepted the deed but didn't record it right away.\n\nNow, four years later, the grantor tries to convey the property in fee simple absolute to his two sons as a gift, and they record this deed.\n\nSoon after, the brother finds out that the sons are about to take possession, so he promptly records his own deed.\n\nSo, the question is, in a dispute between the brother and the grantor's children over ownership, if the brother prevails, it would be because of which option: A, B, C, or D?\n\nLet's look at each option.\n\nOption A says: \"the brother paid valuable consideration for his deed.\" Well, the brother paid one dollar, and it acknowledges receipt of that consideration. But in property law, consideration isn't always about the amount; it's about whether something of value was exchanged. Here, one dollar is nominal consideration, but it's still consideration. However, in this jurisdiction, the recording statute seems to protect subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. So, while the brother did pay consideration, that might not be the direct reason he prevails.\n\nOption B: \"the brother recorded his deed before the grantor's children sought to oust him from the land.\" Recording is important here because the recording statute says that unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. So, the timing of recording could be crucial.\n\nOption C: \"the grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute.\" Well, the sons did record their deed, and they are subsequent purchasers who paid value (it was a gift, but presumably, they didn't pay money, but in some jurisdictions, a gift can be considered valuable consideration). However, I need to think about whether they have notice of the brother's prior deed.\n\nOption D: \"the grantor's knowledge is imputed to his children.\" This refers to the concept of constructive notice or imputed notice. If the grantor knew about the brother's deed, his knowledge might be imputed to his children, meaning they would be charged with notice of the prior deed.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nFirst, the brother received a deed from the grantor, paid one dollar, but didn't record it. Then, four years later, the grantor tries to convey the same property to his sons in fee simple absolute, and the sons record this deed.\n\nNow, the brother records his deed promptly after learning that the sons are about to take possession.\n\nThe recording statute says that unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice.\n\nSo, the brother's deed wasn't recorded initially. The sons came later, paid value (even if it was a gift, it might still count), and recorded their deed.\n\nBut the brother recorded his deed before the sons sought to oust him.\n\nI need to think about who has priority here.\n\nIn race-notice recording statutes, like the one described here, the first to record a deed is protected against subsequent purchasers, provided the subsequent purchasers didn't have notice of the prior unrecorded instrument.\n\nSo, in this case, the brother recorded first, but after the sons had already recorded their deed.\n\nWait, no. The brother recorded his deed promptly after learning that the sons are about to take possession. So, the sons recorded first, then the brother recorded his deed.\n\nBut according to the recording statute, the brother's unrecorded deed is void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice.\n\nSo, the sons recorded first, after the brother had an unrecorded deed.\n\nBut the brother recorded before the sons sought to oust him.\n\nI think the key here is the timing of the recording and the notice.\n\nIf the sons recorded their deed after the brother's deed was already executed but before they took possession, and the brother recorded his deed promptly upon learning of their intention to take possession, it might suggest that the sons had notice or constructive notice of the brother's deed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the race-notice statute prioritizes the first to record, regardless of the existence of prior unrecorded deeds, as long as the subsequent purchaser didn't have notice.\n\nWait, let's look back at the recording statute: \"unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice.\"\n\nSo, the brother's unrecorded deed is void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice.\n\nThe sons paid value (even if it was a gift, perhaps the value is the grantor's intent to convey to them), and they didn't have notice of the brother's deed.\n\nBut the brother recorded his deed before the sons sought to oust him.\n\nDoes this mean that the brother's recording prior to the sons' attempt to oust him somehow affects the priority?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the brother's recording after the sons' recording doesn't affect priority, because the sons recorded first.\n\nBut perhaps there's a argument for the brother's prior deed and his recording, even if after the sons', still gives him priority because he had a prior interest.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nOption A: the brother paid valuable consideration. Well, he paid one dollar, which is consideration, but in the context of the recording statute, the key is whether the subsequent purchasers paid value and lacked notice.\n\nOption B: the brother recorded his deed before the grantor's children sought to oust him from the land. This might be relevant because recording before the adverse action is taken could strengthen his position.\n\nOption C: the grantor's sons are not protected by the recording statute. But they did record their deed, and they paid value, so why wouldn't they be protected?\n\nOption D: the grantor's knowledge is imputed to his children. If the grantor knew about the brother's deed, his knowledge might be imputed to the sons, meaning they had constructive notice of the brother's interest.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is D: the grantor's knowledge is imputed to his children.\n\nHere's why: if the grantor knew about the brother's deed, and that knowledge is imputed to the sons, then the sons would be charged with notice of the brother's interest, even if they didn't actually know about it.\n\nTherefore, they wouldn't qualify as subsequent purchasers without notice, and the recording statute wouldn't protect them against the brother's prior unrecorded deed.\n\nThus, the brother could prevail because the grantor's knowledge is imputed to his children, meaning the children had constructive notice of the brother's deed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's option B: the brother recorded his deed before the grantor's children sought to oust him from the land.\n\nThis could suggest that the brother's recording, even after the sons' recording, somehow gives him priority because he recorded before they took adverse action.\n\nBut in race-notice recording statutes, typically, the first to record has priority against subsequent purchasers who also record, provided the subsequent purchasers lack notice of the prior unrecorded instrument.\n\nSo, if the sons recorded after the brother had an unrecorded deed, but before they took possession, and then the brother recorded his deed before they sought to oust him, it might be that the brother's earlier deed, coupled with his timely recording before the adverse action, gives him priority.\n\nHowever, I think the more straightforward answer is option D: the grantor's knowledge is imputed to his children.\n\nThis is because, in conveyance law, a grantor's knowledge of prior interests can be imputed to the grantee, meaning the grantee is charged with constructive notice of those interests.\n\nTherefore, if the grantor knew about the brother's deed, his knowledge is imputed to the sons, meaning they had notice of the brother's interest, and thus, they are not protected by the recording statute as \"subsequent purchasers without notice.\"\n\nAs a result, the brother's unrecorded deed is not void as to the sons, and he can prevail in the ownership dispute.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D: the grantor's knowledge is imputed to his children.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the grantor didn't know about the brother's deed, then the sons would lack notice and be protected by the recording statute, rendering the brother's unrecorded deed void as to them.\n\nBut if the grantor knew about the brother's deed, and that knowledge is imputed to the sons, then the sons have constructive notice, and the recording statute doesn't protect them against the brother's prior interest.\n\nTherefore, the brother can prevail based on the imputation of the grantor's knowledge to the sons.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider option B: the brother recorded his deed before the sons sought to oust him.\n\nMaybe this suggests that the brother's recording, even after the sons' recording, is effective because he recorded before they took adverse action, which could be seen as a race-notice provision where timing of recording relative to adverse action is important.\n\nHowever, in standard race-notice recording statutes, it's the timing of recording relative to other recordings, not just actions.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is more accurate.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: the grantor's knowledge is imputed to his children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
