                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about painting tools, and I need to figure out which one has bristles on it. The options are: easel, knife, brush, and palette. Hmm, let's think about each one.\n\nFirst, an easel. I know that an easel is like a stand that artists use to hold their canvas upright so they can paint on it. I've seen them in art supplies stores and in paintings of artists outdoors. But bristles? I don't think easels have bristles. They're just frames that hold the canvas.\n\nNext, a knife. In painting, I think a knife is used for mixing colors or applying paint in a certain way. Maybe it's like a putty knife or something similar. But again, bristles? Knives are usually smooth blades, so probably no bristles there.\n\nNow, a brush. Oh, this seems likely. Paintbrushes have bristles, right? I've used brushes for painting before, and they have those tiny hairs that help apply the paint to the canvas. I think different types of brushes have different kinds of bristles, like synthetic or natural hair. So, this sounds like the correct answer.\n\nLastly, a palette. A palette is what artists use to mix their paints. It's usually a flat surface, sometimes with a hole for the artist's thumb to hold it. I've seen palettes made of different materials like wood, plastic, or even metal. But bristles? No, palettes don't have bristles; they're just mixing boards.\n\nSo, putting it all together, among easel, knife, brush, and palette, the tool that has bristles is the brush. I'm pretty confident about that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
