Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what f(x) = 2 means. This tells me that no matter what x I plug into the function f, it always returns 2. So, f(1) = 2, f(2) = 2, f(3.5) = 2, f(-10) = 2, etc. It's a constant function.\n\nNow, the question is asking for f(x + 2). Given that f(x) is always 2, regardless of what x is, I should expect that f(x + 2) is also 2. Because no matter what you put inside f(), as long as it's a real number, it returns 2.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Suppose x is 1, then x + 2 is 3. So, f(1 + 2) = f(3) = 2. Similarly, if x is 0, then x + 2 is 2, and f(2) = 2. If x is -2, then x + 2 is 0, and f(0) = 2. In all cases, f(x + 2) equals 2.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a trick here. Is there any scenario where f(x + 2) wouldn't be 2? Well, since f is defined for all real numbers and always returns 2, I can't think of any such scenario.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n\nA. 2 - that's what I think it is.\n\nB. 4 - that would be if f(x + 2) = 2 * 2, but there's no indication that the function is multiplicative.\n\nC. 0 - that would be if f(x + 2) = 2 - 2, but again, no indication of that.\n\nD. 1 - that would be if f(x + 2) = 2 / 2, but same thing, no indication.\n\nI think the key here is understanding that f is a constant function. So, f(x) = 2, f(x + 2) = 2, f(x - 5) = 2, etc. The input doesn't affect the output because it's constant.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider the definition of a function. A function assigns exactly one output to each input. In this case, no matter the input, the output is always 2.\n\nTherefore, the value of f(x + 2) is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]\n\nI'm confident with this answer. It's straightforward once you understand that f is a constant function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
