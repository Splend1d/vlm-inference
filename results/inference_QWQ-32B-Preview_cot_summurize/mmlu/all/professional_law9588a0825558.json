                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about proving discriminatory classification by the government. The key here is understanding what's needed to show that the government intended to discriminate. The options provided are:\n\nA. A law that is discriminatory on its face.\n\nB. A discriminatory application of a facially neutral law.\n\nC. A discriminatory effect.\n\nD. A discriminatory motive.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for a law to be \"discriminatory on its face.\" This typically means that the language of the law itself explicitly discriminates against a particular group. For example, a law that says only people of a certain race can vote would be discriminatory on its face.\n\nOption B mentions a \"discriminatory application of a facially neutral law.\" This refers to a situation where the law doesn't appear to discriminate based on its text, but it's applied in a way that targets a specific group. For instance, a law against loitering that's only enforced against certain racial groups would be an example of discriminatory application.\n\nOption C is \"discriminatory effect.\" This suggests that even if the law isn't explicitly discriminatory, it has a disproportionate impact on a particular group. For example, a voting requirement that doesn't mention race but effectively disenfranchises a racial group could be considered to have a discriminatory effect.\n\nFinally, option D is \"discriminatory motive.\" This refers to the intent behind the law\u2014that the government passed the law with the purpose of discriminating against a certain group.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these cannot be used to show intent to discriminate. In other words, which one isn't sufficient to prove that the government intended to discriminate?\n\nLet's think about each option:\n\nA. If a law is discriminatory on its face, it's pretty clear that the government intended to discriminate. The language itself shows the intent.\n\nB. Discriminatory application of a neutral law also demonstrates intent because it shows that even though the law doesn't discriminate on its face, it's being applied in a biased manner.\n\nC. Discriminatory effect, however, is different. While a discriminatory effect can be evidence of intent, it's not always directly indicative of intent. Sometimes, laws can have unintended consequences that disproportionately affect certain groups without the government intending to discriminate.\n\nD. Discriminatory motive directly points to intent, as it refers to the purpose behind the law.\n\nSo, considering this, it seems like discriminatory effect might not always be sufficient to prove intent, especially if the discriminatory effect was unintentional. Therefore, perhaps option C is the answer.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. In legal terms, can a discriminatory effect ever be used to prove intent?\n\nI recall that in some cases, courts do consider discriminatory effect as evidence of intent, but it's not conclusive on its own. There might be situations where a law has a discriminatory effect but was enacted without any intent to discriminate.\n\nFor example, a policy that requires high school diploma for a job might disproportionately affect certain racial groups, but the intent might have been to ensure qualified candidates rather than to discriminate.\n\nTherefore, while discriminatory effect can be a factor in proving intent, it's not always sufficient by itself to demonstrate that the government intended to discriminate.\n\nComparing this to the other options, which more directly indicate intent, it seems that discriminatory effect is the weakest link in proving intentional discrimination.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. A discriminatory effect.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options might not prove intent.\n\nOption A: A law discriminatory on its face clearly shows intent.\n\nOption B: Discriminatory application also shows intent in the application, even if the law itself is neutral.\n\nOption D: Discriminatory motive directly refers to intent.\n\nSo, indeed, C seems to be the one that doesn't necessarily prove intent on its own.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. A discriminatory effect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
