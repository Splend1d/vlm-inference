                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about estimating the rotational correlation time for a protein based on some given data about a smaller molecule. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem gives me the Stokes equation for the rotational correlation time of a spherical object in a liquid:\n\n\u03c4c = (4\u03c0\u03b7r\u00b3)/(3kBT)\n\nwhere:\n- \u03c4c is the rotational correlation time\n- \u03b7 is the viscosity of the liquid\n- r is the radius of the object\n- kB is the Boltzmann constant\n- T is the temperature in Kelvin\n\nI'm given that for a small molecule with a relative molecular mass (Mr) of 100 in water at 298 K, \u03c4c is 50 picoseconds (ps). Now, I need to estimate \u03c4c for a small protein with Mr = 8400, assuming that Mr is proportional to the molecular volume.\n\nAlright, so first things first, I need to understand the relationship between molecular mass and volume. The problem says to assume that Mr is proportional to the molecular volume. That makes sense because, generally, larger molecules have more atoms and thus take up more space.\n\nSo, if Mr is proportional to volume, and volume for a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3, then I can say that Mr is proportional to r\u00b3.\n\nMathematically, Mr \u221d r\u00b3\n\nWhich means r \u221d Mr^(1/3)\n\nOkay, so the radius is proportional to the cube root of the molecular mass.\n\nNow, looking back at the Stokes equation, \u03c4c is proportional to r\u00b3 because it's directly in the numerator.\n\nSo, \u03c4c \u221d r\u00b3\n\nBut since r \u221d Mr^(1/3), then \u03c4c \u221d (Mr^(1/3))\u00b3 = Mr\n\nWait a second, that seems off. Let's double-check that.\n\nIf r \u221d Mr^(1/3), then r\u00b3 \u221d (Mr^(1/3))\u00b3 = Mr\n\nSo, \u03c4c \u221d r\u00b3 \u221d Mr\n\nTherefore, \u03c4c is proportional to Mr.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if \u03c4c is proportional to Mr, then as Mr increases, \u03c4c increases linearly. But I have a feeling that might not be the case, or maybe it is, and I just need to trust the math here.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe I should consider the actual constants.\n\nGiven that \u03c4c = (4\u03c0\u03b7r\u00b3)/(3kBT)\n\nAnd if Mr \u221d r\u00b3, then r\u00b3 = constant * Mr\n\nSo, \u03c4c = (4\u03c0\u03b7)/(3kBT) * (constant * Mr)\n\nTherefore, \u03c4c is directly proportional to Mr.\n\nSo, \u03c4c = constant * Mr\n\nWhere constant is (4\u03c0\u03b7)/(3kBT)\n\nNow, for the small molecule, Mr = 100, \u03c4c = 50 ps\n\nSo, 50 ps = constant * 100\n\nTherefore, constant = 50 ps / 100 = 0.5 ps\n\nNow, for the protein, Mr = 8400\n\nSo, \u03c4c = 0.5 ps * 8400 = 4200 ps\n\nWait, but 4200 ps is 4.2 nanoseconds (ns), since 1 ns = 1000 ps.\n\nSo, \u03c4c = 4.2 ns\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. 420 ns\nB. 42 ns\nC. 4.2 ns\nD. 420 ps\n\nOption C seems to match.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check my calculation.\n\nGiven that for Mr = 100, \u03c4c = 50 ps\n\nSo, constant = \u03c4c / Mr = 50 ps / 100 = 0.5 ps per unit Mr\n\nThen for Mr = 8400, \u03c4c = 0.5 ps * 8400 = 4200 ps = 4.2 ns\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again. Is it reasonable to assume that \u03c4c is directly proportional to Mr?\n\nI recall that in reality, the rotational correlation time does increase with the size of the molecule, but is it a linear relationship?\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the viscosity \u03b7 might not be constant, or perhaps there are other factors at play.\n\nWait, but in this problem, the liquid is water in both cases, so \u03b7 should be the same.\n\nAlso, the temperature is the same (298 K), so kB T is the same.\n\nTherefore, the only variable changing is r, which is related to Mr via Mr \u221d r\u00b3.\n\nSo, \u03c4c \u221d r\u00b3, and r \u221d Mr^(1/3)\n\nTherefore, \u03c4c \u221d Mr\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because if Mr increases, r increases, but how does that affect \u03c4c?\n\nLet me see: \u03c4c = (4\u03c0\u03b7r\u00b3)/(3kBT)\n\nSo, \u03c4c is directly proportional to r\u00b3.\n\nAnd since Mr \u221d r\u00b3, then \u03c4c \u221d Mr.\n\nYes, so \u03c4c should be directly proportional to Mr.\n\nTherefore, \u03c4c = (50 ps / 100) * 8400 = 0.5 ps * 8400 = 4200 ps = 4.2 ns\n\nSo, the answer should be 4.2 ns, which is option C.\n\nBut maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the diffusion coefficient.\n\nI know that for a sphere in a fluid, the diffusion coefficient D is given by Stokes-Einstein equation:\n\nD = kB T / (6\u03c0\u03b7r)\n\nAnd the relationship between diffusion and correlation time can be complex, but I think sticking to the given Stokes equation is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the rotational correlation time is related to the moment of inertia.\n\nThe moment of inertia I for a sphere is (2/5)mr\u00b2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nGiven that the problem provides the Stokes equation and asks to assume Mr is proportional to volume, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the estimated \u03c4c for the protein is 4.2 ns.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4.2 \\text{ ns}} \\]"
