                    "text": "I'm trying to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q. The options are 0, 4, 2, and 6. I know that the degree of a field extension is the dimension of the larger field as a vector space over the smaller one, but I'm not sure how to apply that here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) means. This is the smallest field that contains the rational numbers Q and both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3). So, it should include all elements that can be made by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing elements of Q, sqrt(2), and sqrt(3).\n\nI think I can build this field step by step. Start with Q, then adjoin sqrt(2) to get Q(sqrt(2)), and then adjoin sqrt(3) to get Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). So, the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q should be the product of the degrees of these individual extensions, provided that each extension is Galois or at least algebraic and separable.\n\nFirst, find the degree of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q. Since sqrt(2) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - 2, which is irreducible over Q (by Eisenstein's criterion with p=2), the degree of this extension is 2.\n\nNext, find the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q(sqrt(2)). I need to find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)). Does sqrt(3) satisfy a polynomial of degree less than 2 over Q(sqrt(2))?\n\nSuppose sqrt(3) is in Q(sqrt(2)), then sqrt(3) = a + b sqrt(2) for some rationals a and b. Squaring both sides, 3 = a^2 + 2ab sqrt(2) + 2b^2. For this to hold, the coefficients must satisfy:\n\na^2 + 2b^2 = 3\n\nand\n\n2ab = 0\n\nFrom 2ab = 0, either a=0 or b=0.\n\nIf a=0, then 2b^2 = 3, so b^2 = 3/2, but b is rational, and 3/2 is not a perfect square in Q, so no solution.\n\nIf b=0, then a^2 = 3, but again, sqrt(3) is not rational, so no solution.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(3) is not in Q(sqrt(2)), so the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)) must have degree greater than 1. Since sqrt(3) satisfies x^2 - 3=0, which is a degree 2 polynomial, and it's minimal because sqrt(3) is not in Q(sqrt(2)), the degree of this extension is 2.\n\nTherefore, the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] * [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] = 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nWait, but the options include 6, which is higher than 4. Maybe I'm missing something. Is there a way that the degree could be 6?\n\nLet me consider the tower law again. The tower law states that for fields K \u2286 L \u2286 M, [M : K] = [M : L] * [L : K]. In this case, K = Q, L = Q(sqrt(2)), M = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). So, [M : K] = [M : L] * [L : K].\n\nI've calculated [L : K] = 2 and [M : L] = 2, so [M : K] = 4.\n\nBut maybe there's a different way to approach this. Perhaps I should consider the basis elements of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q.\n\nStarting from Q, adjoin sqrt(2), basis is {1, sqrt(2)}.\n\nThen adjoin sqrt(3), basis over Q(sqrt(2)) is {1, sqrt(3)}.\n\nSo, the overall basis over Q is {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6)}.\n\nBecause:\n\n- 1 is in Q.\n\n- sqrt(2) is adjoined first.\n\n- sqrt(3) is adjoined next.\n\n- sqrt(6) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(3).\n\nSo, any element in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) can be written as a linear combination of these four elements with coefficients in Q.\n\nTherefore, the degree should be 4.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) over Q. If I can find its minimal polynomial, the degree of that polynomial would be the degree of the extension.\n\nLet x = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3).\n\nThen, x - sqrt(2) = sqrt(3).\n\nSquare both sides: x^2 - 2x sqrt(2) + 2 = 3.\n\nSo, x^2 - 1 = 2x sqrt(2).\n\nSquare again: (x^2 - 1)^2 = 4x^2 * 2.\n\nSo, x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 = 8x^2.\n\nThus, x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = 0.\n\nSo, the minimal polynomial is x^4 - 10x^2 + 1, which is degree 4, confirming that the degree of the extension is 4.\n\nBut why is 6 an option? Maybe there's a mistake in assuming that [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the extension.\n\nWait, maybe if I consider Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)), is that different from Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))?\n\nActually, it turns out that Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). This is because sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) generates both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) over Q.\n\nSo, in this case, the degree is still 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q, which is indeed 4.\n\nBut maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nLooking back, the problem says \"the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q\", and the options are 0, 4, 2, 6.\n\nGiven that, and my calculations, the degree should be 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach or a theorem I'm missing that could make the degree 6.\n\nWait, maybe considering that Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6)), but that doesn't change the degree, as sqrt(6) is already in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the Galois group. The Galois group of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q has order equal to the degree of the extension.\n\nThe automorphisms are determined by where they send sqrt(2) and sqrt(3). Each can be sent to either itself or its negative, provided that the relations are preserved.\n\nSo, possible automorphisms:\n\n1. identity: sqrt(2) -> sqrt(2), sqrt(3) -> sqrt(3)\n\n2. sqrt(2) -> -sqrt(2), sqrt(3) -> sqrt(3)\n\n3. sqrt(2) -> sqrt(2), sqrt(3) -> -sqrt(3)\n\n4. sqrt(2) -> -sqrt(2), sqrt(3) -> -sqrt(3)\n\nSo, there are 4 automorphisms, which again suggests that the degree is 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the extensions are linearly disjoint, but in this case, they are not, because sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both algebraic over Q, and their degrees multiply because the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)) is still degree 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the primitive element theorem, which states that for finite separable extensions, there exists an element that generates the entire extension. In this case, sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) is such an element, and its minimal polynomial is degree 4, as previously found.\n\nGiven all this, I think the degree is 4.\n\nHowever, since 6 is an option, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe if I consider Q(sqrt(2) * sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(6)), which is a different extension.\n\nThe degree of Q(sqrt(6)) over Q is 2, since sqrt(6) satisfies x^2 - 6 = 0, and this is irreducible over Q.\n\nBut Q(sqrt(6)) is not the same as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), because Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) contains both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), whereas Q(sqrt(6)) only contains sqrt(6).\n\nSo, Q(sqrt(6)) is a subfield of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n\nIn fact, Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(6)), since sqrt(3) = sqrt(6)/sqrt(2).\n\nBut anyway, the degree is still 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the splitting field of (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3), which is Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), and its degree is 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem itself, or in the options provided.\n\nGiven all the above, I think the correct answer is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{4}\\]"
