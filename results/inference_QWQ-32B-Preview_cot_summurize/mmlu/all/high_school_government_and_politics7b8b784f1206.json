This privilege is intended to facilitate communication between elected officials and the people they represent. It is not related to gerrymandering, which is the manipulation of electoral district boundaries for political advantage, nor to pork-barrel legislation, which refers to the allocation of government spending for localized projects secured solely to bring money to a representative's district. The Sixteenth Amendment pertains to the federal income tax and has no connection to mailing privileges for Congress members."
