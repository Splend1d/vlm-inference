                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about Wernicke's aphasia. So, aphasia is a disorder that affects a person's ability to communicate, right? There are different types, and Wernicke's is one of them. I remember that it has something to do with language comprehension.\n\nThe question is: A person with Wernicke's aphasia has impaired language comprehension and... and then it gives four options:\n\nA. nonfluent and unintelligible speech.\n\nB. nonfluent but intelligible speech.\n\nC. fluent but unintelligible speech.\n\nD. fluent and intelligible speech.\n\nI need to choose the correct combination of speech characteristics that go along with impaired comprehension in Wernicke's aphasia.\n\nFirst, let's recall what \"fluent\" and \"unintelligible\" mean in this context. Fluent speech means that the person can speak smoothly and at a normal rate, without many pauses or difficulties in producing speech sounds. Unintelligible speech means that what they say doesn't make sense or can't be understood by others.\n\nNow, Wernicke's aphasia is associated with damage to Wernicke's area, which is in the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. This area is involved in language comprehension.\n\nFrom what I've learned, people with Wernicke's aphasia have difficulty understanding language, both spoken and written. But interestingly, their speech production can still be fluent. However, their speech might not make much sense because they may use incorrect words or even create new words (neologisms). So, their speech is fluent but unintelligible.\n\nLet me think about option A: nonfluent and unintelligible speech. Nonfluent speech would mean that the person has difficulty getting words out, maybe lots of pauses, struggling to find the right words. That sounds more like Broca's aphasia, which is characterized by impaired speech production but relatively preserved comprehension.\n\nOption B is nonfluent but intelligible speech. Again, this seems more aligned with Broca's aphasia, where speech is labored but when they do speak, the words make sense.\n\nOption C is fluent but unintelligible speech, which matches what I recall about Wernicke's aphasia.\n\nOption D is fluent and intelligible speech, which would suggest that the person has no significant language impairments.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the correct answer is C. Fluent but unintelligible speech.\n\nBut let me double-check. I recall that in Wernicke's aphasia, the person may speak in long sentences that sound fluent, but they might not relate to the message they're trying to convey. They might substitute wrong words or use neologisms, making their speech hard to understand.\n\nAlso, since comprehension is impaired, they may not realize that what they're saying doesn't make sense.\n\nIn contrast, Broca's aphasia affects speech production more than comprehension. So, their speech is nonfluent, but when they do speak, the content is relatively meaningful.\n\nAnother type is global aphasia, which affects both comprehension and speech production severely.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Wernicke's aphasia: impaired comprehension, fluent but unintelligible speech.\n\n- Broca's aphasia: impaired speech production, relatively preserved comprehension.\n\n- Global aphasia: severe impairments in both comprehension and speech production.\n\nGiven this, I'm confident that the answer is C. Fluent but unintelligible speech.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
