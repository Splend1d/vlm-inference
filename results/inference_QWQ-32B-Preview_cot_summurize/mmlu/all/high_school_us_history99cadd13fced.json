But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset.

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from William Bradford\u2019s \u201cHistory of Plymouth Plantation,\u201d and it\u2019s talking about the early interactions between the Pilgrims and the Native Americans. There\u2019s this Indian named Samoset who approaches them and speaks to them in broken English, and he ends up being helpful by giving them information about the local area and other tribes.\n\nNow, the question is: Why did the Pilgrims travel to America and settle at Plymouth? And there are four options:\n\nA. They were hoping to escape crushing debts in England.\n\nB. They hoped to find gold or establish a lucrative trade in furs.\n\nC. They were religious Separatists looking for a place to freely practice their faith.\n\nD. They were ordered to establish an outpost to watch the French in Canada.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about what I know about the Pilgrims and why they came to America.\n\nFirst off, I remember that the Pilgrims were a group of English people who wanted to separate from the Church of England because they didn't agree with its practices. They were seeking religious freedom and a place where they could practice their own form of worship without persecution.\n\nOption A says they were hoping to escape crushing debts in England. While it's possible that some individuals might have had debt issues, I don't think that was the primary reason for the Pilgrims' journey. Their main motivation was religious in nature.\n\nOption B suggests they hoped to find gold or establish a lucrative trade in furs. Again, while economic opportunities were probably a factor for some settlers, especially in other colonies like Jamestown, the Pilgrims at Plymouth were more focused on establishing a new life based on their religious beliefs.\n\nOption C states that they were religious Separatists looking for a place to freely practice their faith. This aligns perfectly with what I know about the Pilgrims. They left England to escape religious persecution and to practice their faith without interference.\n\nOption D says they were ordered to establish an outpost to watch the French in Canada. I don't recall any information suggesting that the Pilgrims had a military or surveillance mission. Their purpose was more about creating a new community based on their religious principles.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is C: they were religious Separatists looking for a place to freely practice their faith.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider the context provided in the passage. It mentions that the Indians were skulking around them, and there was initial wariness on both sides. Then Samoset approaches them and provides useful information. This suggests that the Pilgrims were establishing a settlement and trying to understand their new environment and the local inhabitants.\n\nNothing in this passage suggests that they were there for economic gain, to escape debt, or for military purposes. It seems consistent with their being a group seeking to build a new life based on their religious beliefs.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
