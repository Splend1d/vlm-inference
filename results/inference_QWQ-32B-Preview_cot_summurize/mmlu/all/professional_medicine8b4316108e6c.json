                    "text": "A 40-year-old female secretary comes to the office because of a 2-month history of fatigue, and generalized aching and weakness of the proximal muscles of all four extremities. The patient initially noticed the weakness only while she was getting in and out of her car, but during the past 2 weeks, the weakness has progressed, so that she now has difficulty combing her hair. Since the symptoms began, she also has had aching of the joints in her hands that has responded partially to ibuprofen. She was adopted and family history is unknown. She has two teenaged children who are well. She appears uncomfortable. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 68 kg(150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is alert and fully oriented. Physical examination discloses cracking of the skin of both hands that involves the tips and lateral sides of several fingers. The muscles of the upper arms and legs are somewhat tender to pressure. Results of serum laboratory studies show a creatine kinase concentration of 600 U/L and a lactate dehydrogenase concentration of 800 U/L.

                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 40-year-old female secretary who's been feeling really fatigued and weak in her muscles for the past two months. It started with having trouble getting in and out of her car, and now it's progressed to even combing her hair being difficult. She also has some joint aches in her hands that ibuprofen helps a bit with. She was adopted, so we don't know her family history, but her two teenage kids are fine.\n\nShe looks a bit uncomfortable. She's 5'7\" tall and weighs 150 pounds, which gives her a BMI of 24, which is normal. Her temperature is a little high at 99.8\u00b0F, pulse is 90, respirations are 20, and blood pressure is 110/70, which seems okay. She's alert and oriented, which is good. During the physical exam, her hands have some skin cracking on the tips and sides of her fingers. Her upper arm and leg muscles are tender to pressure.\n\nLab tests show her creatine kinase (CK) is 600 U/L and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is 800 U/L. Both are elevated, which suggests muscle damage since CK is released from muscle cells when they're damaged. Her complete blood count is normal, which is helpful.\n\nNow, I need to consider the options given: fibromyalgia, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, and scleroderma.\n\nLet's start with fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is known for causing widespread pain and tenderness in the muscles, but it usually doesn't cause elevated CK levels. CK is normally elevated in muscle diseases like polymyositis, but in fibromyalgia, CK levels are usually normal or only slightly elevated. So, while she has muscle aches and weakness, the elevated CK makes fibromyalgia less likely.\n\nNext, myasthenia gravis. This is an autoimmune disorder that causes fatigue and muscle weakness, especially with activity. It's characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness, often affecting the eyes, face, speech, and swallowing, as well as the limbs. However, in myasthenia, CK levels are typically normal because it's a disorder of the neuromuscular junction, not the muscle itself. So, with elevated CK, myasthenia gravis seems less likely.\n\nPolymyositis is an inflammatory muscle disease that causes muscle weakness, usually in the proximal muscles, like the ones in the upper arms and thighs, which matches her symptoms. It can also cause muscle pain and tenderness. The elevated CK and LDH support muscle inflammation or damage, which is consistent with polymyositis. Additionally, skin changes can sometimes be seen in polymyositis, although typically in the form of a rash, not just skin cracking.\n\nThen there's scleroderma, which is a connective tissue disease that can affect the skin and internal organs. It can cause skin tightening and thickening, but muscle weakness isn't a primary feature. However, there is a subtype called overlap syndrome or undifferentiated connective tissue disease, where features of different diseases, including myositis, can be present. The skin cracking could be related to scleroderma, but the muscle weakness and elevated CK suggest a myositis component.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most likely diagnosis is polymyositis. The proximal muscle weakness, tenderness, elevated CK and LDH, and the presence of skin changes all point towards an inflammatory myopathy like polymyositis. Scleroderma could be considered, but the primary symptom is muscle weakness with elevated CK, which is more characteristic of polymyositis.\n\nI should also consider other causes of muscle weakness and elevated CK, such as infections, metabolic disorders, or drug-induced myopathies, but based on the information provided, polymyositis seems the most probable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nc\n\n**References:**\n\n- Ropper AH, Samuels MA, Klein JP, Prasad S. _Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology_. 10th ed.
