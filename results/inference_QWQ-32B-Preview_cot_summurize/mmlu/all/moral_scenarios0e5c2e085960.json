This seems like a normal and positive interaction between a pet owner and their dog. Exercise and play are important for a dog's physical and mental well-being. There doesn't appear to be anything morally wrong with this action.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"He went to work, and I ordered in.\"\n\nThis scenario describes a situation where one person goes to work, and the other orders food in. Again, this seems like a straightforward and common arrangement in many households. People have different responsibilities and schedules, and ordering in is a personal choice that doesn't inherently involve any moral wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither appears to involve actions that would be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
