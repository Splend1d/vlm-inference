                    "text": "Let's see. In SDS-PAGE, SDS is used as a detergent to treat proteins before running them through the electrophoresis gel. The question is asking why we do this. So, I need to think about what SDS does to the proteins and how that helps in the separation process.\n\nOption A says that SDS coats the proteins with a large positive charge because amino acid side chains can have different charges, and a uniform charge is needed for good separation. Hmm, SDS is actually known to give proteins a negative charge, not positive. SDS binds to the proteins and coats them with negative charges, which helps in moving the proteins through the gel during electrophoresis. So, this option seems incorrect because it mentions a positive charge.\n\nOption B suggests that treating proteins with SDS allows electrophoresis to separate them based solely on the length of the primary sequence. Well, in SDS-PAGE, the goal is indeed to separate proteins based on their size, which correlates with the length of their primary sequence. SDS denatures the proteins and gives them a uniform negative charge, so they can be separated by size when an electric field is applied. This seems plausible.\n\nOption C says that SDS is used to prevent protein denaturation so that electrophoresis can accurately resolve proteins based on their tertiary structure. Wait, actually, SDS is known for denaturing proteins by breaking their tertiary and secondary structures, leaving them in a linear form. So, this option is contradictory because SDS is used to denature proteins, not to prevent it.\n\nOption D states that SDS breaks intramolecular bonds holding the tertiary and primary structure together, generating linear fragments that can be sorted by size. Actually, SDS breaks tertiary and secondary structures but not the primary structure. The primary structure is the amino acid sequence, which remains intact. SDS binds to the protein and unfolds it into a linear form, but it doesn't break the peptide bonds that hold the amino acids together.\n\nSo, considering these points, option B seems the most accurate. SDS treatment allows electrophoresis to separate proteins based on the length of their primary sequence, which effectively means separating them by molecular weight.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
