                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character did something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"As my parents left for vacation, I put on a movie.\"\n\nSo, here, the person is watching a movie while their parents are on vacation. Is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, watching a movie is a normal activity. People watch movies for entertainment all the time. There doesn't seem to be anything inherently wrong with that action. Maybe if they were supposed to be doing something else, like homework or chores, and they chose to watch a movie instead, that might be a problem. But based on what's stated, it just says they put on a movie when their parents left for vacation. That seems pretty standard.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I took off my hat at the playground and waved at the kids.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the person removed their hat at a playground and waved at the children. Again, is there anything morally wrong with this? Waving at kids is a friendly gesture, and taking off one's hat could be a sign of respect or politeness. There doesn't appear to be any moral wrongdoing here. Unless, perhaps, there was something inappropriate about the way they were interacting with the children, but based on the description, it seems like a harmless and perhaps even nice thing to do.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them seems to involve any clear moral wrongdoings according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
