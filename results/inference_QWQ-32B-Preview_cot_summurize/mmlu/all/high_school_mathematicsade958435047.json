                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two functions, \\(f(x) = \\frac{1 + x}{1 - x}\\) and \\(g(x) = \\frac{-2}{x + 1}\\), and we need to apply them alternately eight times each, starting with \\(g(f(12))\\), and find the final value.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to apply these functions alternately. It seems like we start with \\(x = 12\\), then apply \\(f\\), then \\(g\\), then \\(f\\) again, and so on, for a total of eight applications of each function, alternating between \\(f\\) and \\(g\\).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the function \\(f\\) is applied 8 times, and the function \\(g\\) is applied 8 times, alternating between the two.\" That sounds a bit confusing. If we alternate between \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), starting with \\(f\\), then the sequence would be \\(f, g, f, g, \\dots\\), for a total of 16 applications. But the way it's phrased suggests that each function is applied 8 times in total, which might mean that we're applying \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in some specific pattern.\n\nActually, reading it again: \"the function \\(f\\) is applied 8 times, and the function \\(g\\) is applied 8 times, alternating between the two.\" Maybe it means that we apply \\(f\\) once, then \\(g\\) once, and repeat this process until each has been applied 8 times. So, essentially, we're applying the composition \\(f \\circ g\\) eight times.\n\nWait, but that would mean applying \\(f(g(x))\\) eight times. Let me check what \\(f(g(x))\\) is.\n\nFirst, compute \\(g(x) = \\frac{-2}{x + 1}\\), then plug this into \\(f\\):\n\n\\[f(g(x)) = f\\left( \\frac{-2}{x + 1} \\right) = \\frac{1 + \\left( \\frac{-2}{x + 1} \\right)}{1 - \\left( \\frac{-2}{x + 1} \\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{2}{x + 1}}{1 + \\frac{2}{x + 1}}\\]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator: \\(1 - \\frac{2}{x + 1} = \\frac{(x + 1) - 2}{x + 1} = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 1}\\)\n\nDenominator: \\(1 + \\frac{2}{x + 1} = \\frac{(x + 1) + 2}{x + 1} = \\frac{x + 3}{x + 1}\\)\n\nSo, \\(f(g(x)) = \\frac{\\frac{x - 1}{x + 1}}{\\frac{x + 3}{x + 1}} = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 3}\\)\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Now, what if we apply \\(g\\) after \\(f(g(x))\\)? Let's compute \\(g(f(g(x)))\\).\n\nWe already have \\(f(g(x)) = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 3}\\), so:\n\n\\[g(f(g(x))) = g\\left( \\frac{x - 1}{x + 3} \\right) = \\frac{-2}{\\left( \\frac{x - 1}{x + 3} \\right) + 1} = \\frac{-2}{\\frac{x - 1 + x + 3}{x + 3}} = \\frac{-2}{\\frac{2x + 2}{x + 3}} = \\frac{-2(x + 3)}{2x + 2} = \\frac{-(x + 3)}{x + 1}\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\\frac{-(x + 3)}{x + 1} = \\frac{-(x + 3)}{x + 1} = \\frac{-(x + 1 + 2)}{x + 1} = -1 - \\frac{2}{x + 1} = -1 + g(x)\\]\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe instead of trying to find a pattern by composing the functions, I should look for a cycle or a repeating pattern in the compositions.\n\nLet's try to compute \\(f(g(f(x)))\\) and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nFirst, we have \\(f(g(x)) = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 3}\\), as above.\n\nNow, \\(f(g(f(x))) = f\\left( \\frac{f(x) - 1}{f(x) + 3} \\right)\\). But this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps composing \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) multiple times will bring us back to the original value after a certain number of steps, indicating a cycle.\n\nLet's try computing \\(f(g(f(g(x))))\\) and see if it simplifies to \\(x\\), indicating a cycle of length 4.\n\nFirst, we have \\(f(g(x)) = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 3}\\), as before.\n\nNow, \\(g(f(g(x))) = g\\left( \\frac{x - 1}{x + 3} \\right) = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\left( \\frac{x - 1}{x + 3} \\right) + 1 } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{x - 1 + x + 3}{x + 3} } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{2x + 2}{x + 3} } = \\frac{ -2(x + 3) }{ 2x + 2 } = \\frac{ - (x + 3) }{ x + 1 } = -1 - \\frac{2}{x + 1} = -1 + g(x)\\)\n\nWait, that's the same as before. This seems inconsistent. Let me recheck the computation of \\(g(f(g(x)))\\).\n\nGiven \\(f(g(x)) = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 3}\\), then:\n\n\\[g(f(g(x))) = g\\left( \\frac{x - 1}{x + 3} \\right) = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\left( \\frac{x - 1}{x + 3} \\right) + 1 } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{x - 1 + x + 3}{x + 3} } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{2x + 2}{x + 3} } = \\frac{ -2(x + 3) }{ 2x + 2 } = \\frac{ - (x + 3) }{ x + 1 } = -1 - \\frac{2}{x + 1}\\]\n\nBut \\(-1 - \\frac{2}{x + 1}\\) can be written as \\(-1 + g(x)\\), since \\(g(x) = \\frac{ -2 }{ x + 1 }\\). So, \\(g(f(g(x))) = -1 + g(x)\\). Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nMaybe I should try to compute \\(f(g(f(g(x))))\\) directly.\n\nWe have \\(f(g(f(g(x)))) = f(g(f(g(x))))\\). This seems too complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet's consider the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) and see if they have any special properties or if they are inverses of each other.\n\nFirst, compute \\(f(f(x))\\):\n\n\\[f(f(x)) = f\\left( \\frac{1 + x}{1 - x} \\right) = \\frac{1 + \\left( \\frac{1 + x}{1 - x} \\right)}{1 - \\left( \\frac{1 + x}{1 - x} \\right)} = \\frac{ \\frac{(1 - x) + (1 + x)}{1 - x} }{ \\frac{(1 - x) - (1 + x)}{1 - x} } = \\frac{ \\frac{2}{1 - x} }{ \\frac{-2x}{1 - x} } = \\frac{2}{-2x} = -\\frac{1}{x}\\]\n\nSo, \\(f(f(x)) = -\\frac{1}{x}\\).\n\nInteresting. Now, what is \\(f(f(f(x)))\\)?\n\n\\[f(f(f(x))) = f\\left( -\\frac{1}{x} \\right) = \\frac{1 + \\left( -\\frac{1}{x} \\right)}{1 - \\left( -\\frac{1}{x} \\right)} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{x}}{1 + \\frac{1}{x}} = \\frac{ \\frac{x - 1}{x} }{ \\frac{x + 1}{x} } = \\frac{x - 1}{x + 1}\\]\n\nAnd \\(f(f(f(f(x)))) = f\\left( \\frac{x - 1}{x + 1} \\right) = \\frac{1 + \\left( \\frac{x - 1}{x + 1} \\right)}{1 - \\left( \\frac{x - 1}{x + 1} \\right)} = \\frac{ \\frac{(x + 1) + (x - 1)}{x + 1} }{ \\frac{(x + 1) - (x - 1)}{x + 1} } = \\frac{ \\frac{2x}{x + 1} }{ \\frac{2}{x + 1} } = \\frac{2x}{2} = x\\]\n\nSo, \\(f(f(f(f(x)))) = x\\). That means that applying \\(f\\) four times brings us back to the original value. So, \\(f\\) has a cycle length of 4.\n\nSimilarly, let's see what happens with \\(g\\).\n\nCompute \\(g(g(x))\\):\n\n\\[g(g(x)) = g\\left( \\frac{ -2 }{ x + 1 } \\right) = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\left( \\frac{ -2 }{ x + 1 } \\right) + 1 } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{ -2 + x + 1 }{ x + 1 } } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{ x - 1 }{ x + 1 } } = \\frac{ -2(x + 1) }{ x - 1 } = -2 \\cdot \\frac{ x + 1 }{ x - 1 }\\]\n\nHmm, not immediately obvious. Let's compute \\(g(g(g(x)))\\):\n\n\\[g(g(g(x))) = g\\left( -2 \\cdot \\frac{ x + 1 }{ x - 1 } \\right) = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\left( -2 \\cdot \\frac{ x + 1 }{ x - 1 } \\right) + 1 } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{ -2(x + 1) + (x - 1) }{ x - 1 } } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{ -2x - 2 + x - 1 }{ x - 1 } } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{ -x - 3 }{ x - 1 } } = \\frac{ -2(x - 1) }{ -x - 3 } = \\frac{ 2(x - 1) }{ x + 3 }\\]\n\nStill not back to \\(x\\). Let's try \\(g(g(g(g(x))))\\):\n\n\\[g(g(g(g(x)))) = g\\left( \\frac{ 2(x - 1) }{ x + 3 } \\right) = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\left( \\frac{ 2(x - 1) }{ x + 3 } \\right) + 1 } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{ 2(x - 1) + (x + 3) }{ x + 3 } } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{ 2x - 2 + x + 3 }{ x + 3 } } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{ 3x + 1 }{ x + 3 } } = \\frac{ -2(x + 3) }{ 3x + 1 } = -\\frac{ 2(x + 3) }{ 3x + 1 }\\]\n\nNot back to \\(x\\) yet. This seems like it's not cycling back soon. Maybe \\(g\\) doesn't have a short cycle length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps combining \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) in sequence creates a cycle. Since \\(f\\) has a cycle length of 4, maybe combining it with \\(g\\) creates a different cycle.\n\nLet's consider the composition \\(f \\circ g\\), which we already computed as \\(f(g(x)) = \\frac{ x - 1 }{ x + 3 }\\).\n\nNow, compute \\(f(g(f(g(x))))\\):\n\nWe have \\(f(g(f(g(x)))) = f\\left( g(f(g(x))) \\right)\\). From earlier, \\(g(f(g(x))) = -1 - \\frac{2}{x + 1}\\), which is equal to \\(-1 + g(x)\\). This seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the repeated application of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\).\n\nLet's try applying \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) alternately starting from \\(x\\):\n\nStart with \\(x\\).\n\n1. Apply \\(f\\): \\(f(x) = \\frac{1 + x}{1 - x}\\)\n\n2. Apply \\(g\\): \\(g(f(x)) = \\frac{ -2 }{ f(x) + 1 } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{1 + x}{1 - x} + 1 } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{1 + x + 1 - x}{1 - x} } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{2}{1 - x} } = -2 \\cdot \\frac{1 - x}{2} = -(1 - x) = x - 1\\)\n\nSo, \\(g(f(x)) = x - 1\\).\n\n3. Apply \\(f\\): \\(f(g(f(x))) = f(x - 1) = \\frac{1 + (x - 1)}{1 - (x - 1)} = \\frac{x}{2 - x}\\)\n\n4. Apply \\(g\\): \\(g(f(g(f(x)))) = g\\left( \\frac{x}{2 - x} \\right) = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{x}{2 - x} + 1 } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{x + 2 - x}{2 - x} } = \\frac{ -2 }{ \\frac{2}{2 - x} } = -2 \\cdot \\frac{2 - x}{2} = -(2 - x) = x - 2\\)\n\nHmm, interesting. It seems that each time we apply \\(f\\) followed by \\(g\\), we subtract 1 from \\(x\\).\n\nLet's check this pattern:\n\n- Starting with \\(x\\), after \\(f\\) and then \\(g\\), we get \\(x - 1\\).\n\n- Then, applying \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) again, we get \\(x - 2\\).\n\n- Continuing this pattern, after 8 cycles of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), we should get \\(x - 8\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that \\(f\\) is applied 8 times and \\(g\\) is applied 8 times, alternating between them. If we apply \\(f\\) and then \\(g\\), that's one cycle, and we do this 8 times, which would be 8 cycles, resulting in \\(x - 8\\).\n\nHowever, the problem might be interpreted differently. It says \"the function \\(f\\) is applied 8 times, and the function \\(g\\) is applied 8 times, alternating between the two.\" This could mean that we apply \\(f\\), then \\(g\\), then \\(f\\) again, and so on, for a total of 16 applications, 8 of each function.\n\nBut according to our earlier observation, each cycle of \\(f\\) followed by \\(g\\) subtracts 1 from \\(x\\). So, after 8 cycles, we would have \\(x - 8\\).\n\nGiven that we start with \\(x = 12\\), after 8 cycles, we would have \\(12 - 8 = 4\\).\n\nBut let's verify this pattern with a smaller number of cycles to confirm.\n\nLet's start with \\(x = 12\\).\n\n1. Apply \\(f\\): \\(f(12) = \\frac{1 + 12}{1 - 12} = \\frac{13}{-11} = -\\frac{13}{11}\\)\n\n2. Apply \\(g\\): \\(g\\left( -\\frac{13}{11} \\right) = \\frac{ -2 }{ -\\frac{13}{11} + 1 } = \\frac{ -2 }{ -\\frac{13}{11} + \\frac{11}{11} } = \\frac{ -2 }{ -\\frac{2}{11} } = \\frac{ -2 \\times -11 }{ 2 } = \\frac{22}{2} = 11\\)\n\nSo, after one cycle of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), we get from 12 to 11, which is \\(x - 1\\), as observed.\n\n3. Apply \\(f\\): \\(f(11) = \\frac{1 + 11}{1 - 11} = \\frac{12}{-10} = -\\frac{6}{5}\\)\n\n4. Apply \\(g\\): \\(g\\left( -\\frac{6}{5} \\right) = \\frac{ -2 }{ -\\frac{6}{5} + 1 } = \\frac{ -2 }{ -\\frac{6}{5} + \\frac{5}{5} } = \\frac{ -2 }{ -\\frac{1}{5} } = 10\\)\n\nSo, after two cycles, we're at 10, which is \\(x - 2\\).\n\nThis confirms the pattern that each cycle of \\(f\\) followed by \\(g\\) subtracts 1 from the starting value.\n\nTherefore,"
