                    "text": "Let's see. I've got this problem here about a piece of land and who owns it after a series of transactions. There are some recording statutes involved, and I need to figure out who has the valid title at the end.\n\nFirst, let's understand the recording statute in this state: \"No conveyance is good against a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration and without notice, unless the same be recorded prior to subsequent purchase.\"\n\nOkay, so this is an \"race-notice\" statute, I think. That means to protect your interest, you have to record your deed, and if someone else comes along and purchases the property without notice of prior deeds and records their deed first, they might have priority.\n\nNow, let's outline the transactions:\n\n1. On May 1, the owner sells the 20-acre tract to the buyer for $40,000 via a quitclaim deed. The owner delivers the deed to the buyer, but the buyer doesn't record it.\n\n2. Later, on August 1, the owner, needing money because he lost his job, sells the same tract to an investor for $75,000 via a warranty deed. The investor acquires title without actual knowledge of the previous deed to the buyer.\n\n3. On August 10, the buyer records his deed.\n\n4. The investor records his deed on August 15.\n\nNow, I need to determine who has title to the tract in an action to quiet title, with all interested parties joined.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. The buyer, because his deed preceded the investor's deed.\n\nB. The buyer, because his deed was recorded prior to the investor's deed.\n\nC. The investor, because he is protected by the recording statute.\n\nD. The investor, because he took title by warranty deed and the buyer took title by quitclaim deed.\n\nHmm.\n\nFirst, the recording statute says: \"No conveyance is good against a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration and without notice, unless the same be recorded prior to subsequent purchase.\"\n\nSo, in this case, the buyer got his deed on May 1 but didn't record it until August 10. The investor purchased on August 1 and recorded on August 15.\n\nNow, under the recording statute, the conveyance (the buyer's deed) isn't good against the subsequent purchaser (the investor) unless it's recorded before the subsequent purchase.\n\nHere, the buyer's deed wasn't recorded until August 10, after the investor purchased on August 1.\n\nSo, according to the statute, the buyer's conveyance isn't good against the investor because it wasn't recorded before the investor's purchase.\n\nTherefore, the investor should have priority, right?\n\nBut wait, the investor purchased on August 1, but the buyer recorded on August 10, which is before the investor recorded on August 15.\n\nSo, there might be a timing issue here.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe statute says: \"unless the same be recorded prior to subsequent purchase.\"\n\nSo, it's the recording before the subsequent purchase that matters.\n\nThe investor purchased on August 1, and at that time, the buyer hadn't recorded his deed yet (he recorded on August 10).\n\nTherefore, the buyer's conveyance isn't good against the investor because it wasn't recorded before the investor's purchase.\n\nSo, the investor should have priority.\n\nBut option C says \"the investor, because he is protected by the recording statute.\"\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nOption D says \"the investor, because he took title by warranty deed and the buyer took title by quitclaim deed.\"\n\nI'm not sure if the type of deed matters in this context. A warranty deed offers more guarantees, but in terms of priority, it might not be relevant here.\n\nOption A says \"the buyer, because his deed preceded the investor's deed.\"\n\nBut under the recording statute, mere precedence doesn't matter if it's not recorded before the subsequent purchase.\n\nOption B says \"the buyer, because his deed was recorded prior to the investor's deed.\"\n\nBut actually, the investor purchased before the buyer recorded, so this might not hold up.\n\nWait, the buyer recorded on August 10, after the investor purchased on August 1, but before the investor recorded on August 15.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a race aspect here.\n\nIn race-notice jurisdictions, the first to record prevails, provided they didn't have notice of prior deeds.\n\nHere, the investor purchased on August 1 without notice, and the buyer recorded on August 10, before the investor recorded on August 15.\n\nSo, maybe the buyer recorded first after the investor purchased, but the investor recorded later.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up how race-notice statutes work.\n\nIn a race-notice statute, to protect your interest, you need to record your deed before any subsequent purchaser records theirs, and the subsequent purchaser must have no notice of prior deeds.\n\nIn this case, the investor purchased on August 1 without notice, and the buyer recorded on August 10, before the investor recorded on August 15.\n\nSo, the buyer recorded first after the investor purchased.\n\nBut the investor had already purchased before the buyer recorded.\n\nSo, perhaps the investor has priority because he purchased without notice and recorded after the buyer.\n\nWait, I need to think differently.\n\nUnder race-notice statutes, if you're a subsequent purchaser for value without notice, and you record first, you get priority.\n\nHere, the investor purchased on August 1, and the buyer recorded on August 10.\n\nSo, the investor purchased before the buyer recorded, and the investor recorded on August 15.\n\nSo, the buyer recorded before the investor recorded, but after the investor purchased.\n\nSo, perhaps the investor has priority because he purchased first without notice, even though the buyer recorded first after the purchase.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the buyer has priority because he recorded first after the investor purchased.\n\nI need to consider the exact language of the statute.\n\nThe statute says: \"No conveyance is good against a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration and without notice, unless the same be recorded prior to subsequent purchase.\"\n\nSo, the key is recording prior to the subsequent purchase.\n\nThe buyer didn't record before the investor purchased, so his conveyance isn't good against the investor.\n\nTherefore, the investor has priority.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. The investor, because he is protected by the recording statute.\n\nOption D suggests the type of deed is relevant, but I don't think that's the deciding factor here. The warranty deed vs. quitclaim deed might affect the remedies or liabilities, but in terms of priority of title, it's the recording and the purchase timing that matter.\n\nTherefore, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
