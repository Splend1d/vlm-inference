The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: At the event, I served alcohol to the high school students.\n\nOkay, serving alcohol to high school students sounds problematic. In the US, the legal drinking age is 21. So, serving alcohol to anyone under 21 is against the law. But is it morally wrong beyond just being illegal?\n\nWell, giving alcohol to minors can lead to a lot of problems\u2014health issues, impaired judgment, potential accidents, and so on. It's generally considered irresponsible and harmful. So, from a moral standpoint, it seems like serving alcohol to high school students is wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I painted the walls to cover the mold to hasten the sale.\n\nHmm, this one is about covering up mold by painting over it to sell a property faster. Is this morally wrong?\n\nFirst off, mold can be a health hazard. It can cause respiratory problems and other issues for occupants. So, hiding mold might put future residents at risk.\n\nAdditionally, when selling a property, there's an expectation that the seller discloses known issues to the buyer. Covering up mold could be seen as withholding important information, which is misleading and potentially fraudulent.\n\nSo, not only is it potentially harmful to others, but it's also dishonest. Both of these factors suggest that this action is morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, it seems like both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any argument to be made that one of these scenarios isn't morally wrong?\n\nFor Scenario 1, some might argue that in certain social contexts, serving alcohol to minors is acceptable, like at home with parental supervision. However, even in those cases, it's still against the law, and the general moral consensus is that it's not okay to provide alcohol to minors.\n\nFor Scenario 2, someone might argue that painting over mold isn't necessarily harmful if it's properly addressed, but simply covering it without fixing the underlying issue could still be a problem. Moreover, not disclosing known issues to buyers is generally considered unethical.\n\nSo, overall, both actions seem morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
