I need to find the sum and see which option matches the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I'll write the numbers one under the other to make it easier to add them:\n\n```\n\n  46,911\n\n+653,092\n\n---------\n\n```\n\nNow, I'll add them starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n1 (from 46,911) + 2 (from 653,092) = 3\n\nSo, the units digit of the sum is 3.\n\nNext, the tens place:\n\n1 (from 46,911) + 9 (from 653,092) = 10\n\nI write down 0 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place:\n\n9 (from 46,911) + 0 (from 653,092) + 1 (carried over) = 10\n\nAgain, I write down 0 and carry over 1 to the thousands place.\n\nMoving to the thousands place:\n\n6 (from 46,911) + 3 (from 653,092) + 1 (carried over) = 10\n\nWrite down 0 and carry over 1 to the ten-thousands place.\n\nNow, the ten-thousands place:\n\n4 (from 46,911) + 5 (from 653,092) + 1 (carried over) = 10\n\nWrite down 0 and carry over 1 to the hundred-thousands place.\n\nFinally, the hundred-thousands place:\n\n0 (since 46,911 has no hundred-thousands) + 6 (from 653,092) + 1 (carried over) = 7\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sum should be 700,003.\n\nLet me check the options:\n\nA. 699,903\n\nB. 700,003\n\nC. 913,203\n\nD. 1,122,202\n\nOption B matches the sum I calculated.\n\nTo double-check, I can add them again quickly.\n\n46,911 plus 653,092.\n\n46,911\n\n+653,092\n\n---------\n\n  700,003\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can estimate the sum to see if it makes sense.\n\n46,911 is almost 47,000, and 653,092 is almost 653,000.\n\nSo, 47,000 + 653,000 = 700,000.\n\nOur exact sum is 700,003, which is very close to the estimated sum, so it makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 700,003.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
