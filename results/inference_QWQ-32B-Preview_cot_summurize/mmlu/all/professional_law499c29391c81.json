A defendant was marooned on a desert island, along with a victim and another sailor after their boat capsized during a violent storm at sea. The three sailors had gone without food for two weeks and were on the verge of dying of starvation. Each of the sailors, however, still had a small amount of water left in their canteens with which to subsist. One night, the defendant took the water from the victim's canteen and poured it into his own canteen while the victim slept. The defendant did this in the hope that the extra water would make it possible for him to live a couple of more days so that he would be able to walk across the island to look for help. The next day, the victim died from starvation and dehydration. Two days later, the defendant and the other sailor were rescued. The defendant never walked across the island because he was too weak from body weight loss.\nB. A defendant and a victim were on a hiking expedition together. They were longtime hiking buddies who had climbed many steep and precipitous mountains in the past. As the defendant and the victim were climbing a dangerously steep incline, their ropes suddenly became entangled. As a result of the entanglement, the victim fell 50 feet before he was able to regain his balance and footing. However, the victim's fall caused the defendant to lose his balance, and he was in jeopardy of falling off the mountain. In order to avoid falling, the defendant cut the safety rope that held the victim. This caused the victim to fall 400 feet to his death.\nC. A defendant, who was intoxicated, was driving his car home along a heavily traveled highway. In his inebriated condition, the defendant was swerving his vehicle across the highway. Suddenly, a school bus loaded with children made a wrong turn and headed directly into the path of the defendant's auto. In order to avoid crashing head-on with the school bus, the defendant turned his vehicle onto the sidewalk and struck a victim, a paraplegic, who was confined to a wheelchair. The defendant's auto crushed the victim to death.\nD. A defendant, a bank teller, was on duty when two robbers held up the bank. She was taken hostage and ordered to drive their getaway car. As they were being pursued by the police, the defendant was commanded to drive excessively fast to avoid being captured. While driving at a speed of nearly 100 M. P. H. , the defendant approached a busy intersection and saw the victim, a blind person, with a guide dog walking across the street. She slowed down to avoid hitting the pedestrian with the dog. As she did so, one of the robbers stuck a gun against her head and threatened to kill her if she didn't speed through the intersection. Afraid she would be murdered, the defendant accelerated into the path of the victim, killing him and his guide dog.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which of these scenarios would most likely allow the defendant to use the defense of necessity to avoid criminal liability. So, first things first, I need to understand what the defense of necessity is.\n\nFrom what I recall, the defense of necessity is used when someone commits a crime but argues that they were facing an immediate threat that required them to act in a certain way to prevent a greater harm. It's like, \"I had to do it because otherwise something even worse would have happened.\" But, there are limits to this defense. For example, the harm you're trying to avoid has to be greater than the harm caused by your criminal act, and there usually has to be no reasonable legal alternative.\n\nOkay, let's look at option A. Here, the defendant is stranded on a desert island with two other people, and they're all starving. The defendant takes water from one of the others while they're sleeping, hoping to increase his own chances of survival. But, the victim dies from starvation and dehydration later on, and the defendant is rescued along with the other sailor.\n\nIn this case, the defendant is arguing that he had to take the water to try to survive longer and look for help. But, I think there are a few issues here. First, taking the water might not necessarily have increased his chances of survival, especially since he never actually walked across the island. Also, by taking the water, he directly contributed to the victim's death, which is a pretty serious harm. So, while the situation was desperate, I'm not sure if this would qualify as a necessary action to prevent a greater harm.\n\nMoving on to option B. Here, the defendant and the victim are hiking buddies climbing a mountain. Their ropes get entangled, and the victim falls, causing the defendant to lose his balance. To prevent himself from falling, the defendant cuts the safety rope holding the victim, causing the victim to fall to his death.\n\nThis seems like a classic example of the \"trolley problem\" in ethics, where you have to choose between two bad outcomes. The defendant chose to save himself by sacrificing the victim. Now, in terms of necessity, the defendant was facing an immediate threat to his own life, and cutting the rope was the only way to save himself. However, intentionally causing someone's death is a severe act, and courts might not look kindly on this defense, especially since the defendant and the victim were experienced hikers who should have known the risks involved in such activities.\n\nOption C involves a defendant who is intoxicated and swerving on a highway. A school bus loaded with children makes a wrong turn directly into his path, and to avoid hitting the bus, he swerves onto the sidewalk and hits a paraplegic victim in a wheelchair, killing them.\n\nThis seems like a case where the defendant was already acting unlawfully by driving under the influence. However, when faced with an imminent danger (the school bus), he made a split-second decision to swerve onto the sidewalk to avoid a potentially catastrophic head-on collision with the bus full of children. In this scenario, the harm he was trying to prevent (hitting the school bus and possibly killing or injuring many children) was significantly greater than hitting one person on the sidewalk.\n\nAdditionally, because he was intoxicated, his ability to make sound decisions might be compromised, but the immediate threat presented by the school bus might justify his actions. Courts might consider that, in the heat of the moment, his choice to avoid the larger harm was reasonable, even if it resulted in the tragic death of the victim on the sidewalk.\n\nLastly, option D involves a bank teller who is taken hostage during a robbery and forced to drive the getaway car. While being pursued by the police, the robbers command her to drive fast, and when she slows down to avoid hitting a blind pedestrian with a guide dog, one of the robbers threatens to kill her if she doesn't speed up. She accelerates and hits the pedestrian, killing them and the dog.\n\nIn this scenario, the defendant is under duress, being threatened with immediate death if she doesn't obey the robbers' commands. She faces a choice between potentially being killed by the robbers or hitting the pedestrian. Given that, her action might be seen as necessary to preserve her own life, especially since the alternative was immediate death.\n\nHowever, the defense of necessity might be complicated here because she was initially involved in a criminal act (the bank robbery) by being forced to drive the getaway car. Courts might view her actions differently because she was participating in a crime, even if unwillingly.\n\nComparing all these options, I think that option C presents the strongest case for the defense of necessity. The defendant was in a position where he had to choose between hitting a school bus full of children or hitting one person on the sidewalk. The potential harm to multiple innocent lives was far greater than the harm caused by hitting one person, even if that person died as a result.\n\nIn addition, the defendant was already acting unlawfully by driving under the influence, but the immediate danger posed by the school bus might be seen as an extraordinary circumstance that justified his actions.\n\nOption D also has strong elements of necessity due to the immediate threat to the defendant's life, but her initial involvement in the criminal activity (albeit under duress) might complicate the defense.\n\nOption A seems less clear because the defendant's action didn't necessarily lead to his own survival, and option B involves a choice between two individuals who were experienced in the activity that led to the dangerous situation.\n\nTherefore, I believe that in scenario C, the defendant's defense of necessity is most likely to exculpate him of criminal liability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
