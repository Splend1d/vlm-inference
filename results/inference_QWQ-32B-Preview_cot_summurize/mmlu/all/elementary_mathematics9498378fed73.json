Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I know that 8 times something equals 56. So, to find y, I should divide 56 by 8. That makes sense because division is the inverse of multiplication.\n\nNow, mentally, I can think about how many times 8 goes into 56. Let me see:\n\n8 times 7 is 56. Yeah, that's right. 8 times 7 equals 56. So, y should be 7.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If y is 7, then 8 times 7 is indeed 56. Perfect, that seems correct.\n\nLet me consider the other options just to be sure. If y were 6, then 8 times 6 is 48, which is less than 56. So, that's too small.\n\nIf y were 8, that's 8 times 8, which is 64, and that's more than 56.\n\nAnd y as 9 would be 8 times 9, which is 72, even larger.\n\nSo, definitely, y equals 7 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of division. If 8y equals 56, then y equals 56 divided by 8, which again is 7.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to subtract 8 repeatedly from 56 until I reach zero. Let's see:\n\n56 minus 8 is 48,\n\n48 minus 8 is 40,\n\n40 minus 8 is 32,\n\n32 minus 8 is 24,\n\n24 minus 8 is 16,\n\n16 minus 8 is 8,\n\nAnd 8 minus 8 is 0.\n\nI subtracted 8 a total of 7 times to reach 0 from 56, which again confirms that y is 7.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
