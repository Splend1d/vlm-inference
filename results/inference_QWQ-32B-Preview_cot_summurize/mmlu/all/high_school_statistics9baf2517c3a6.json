Let's see what I can do with this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the power of a test is. I think power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false. In other words, it's the probability of detecting an effect when there is one.\n\nNow, the problem gives me two probabilities:\n\n1. P(rejecting H0 when H0 is true) = 0.05\n\n2. P(failing to reject H0 when H0 is false) = 0.26\n\nOkay, so the first one is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true. That sounds like a Type I error, right? And the probability of a Type I error is usually denoted by \u03b1. So, \u03b1 = 0.05.\n\nThe second one is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's false. That should be a Type II error, which is usually denoted by \u03b2. So, \u03b2 = 0.26.\n\nNow, power is the probability of correctly rejecting H0 when it's false. That should be 1 - \u03b2, because \u03b2 is the probability of failing to reject H0 when it's false.\n\nSo, power = 1 - \u03b2 = 1 - 0.26 = 0.74.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is 0.74, so that seems to be the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's double-check what each term means.\n\n- \u03b1 (alpha) is the significance level, which is the probability of rejecting H0 when it's true. That's given as 0.05.\n\n- \u03b2 (beta) is the probability of failing to reject H0 when it's false. That's given as 0.26.\n\n- Power is 1 - \u03b2, which is the probability of correctly rejecting H0 when it's false.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the power of the test is 0.74.\n\nI think option D is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
