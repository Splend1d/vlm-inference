                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about apoptosis, which is programmed cell death. It's a important process in living organisms. The question is asking which of the options is NOT correct about apoptosis. So, I need to look at each option and determine which one is incorrect.\n\nOption A says, \"It occurs randomly.\" Hmm, apoptosis is programmed cell death, which means it's a controlled process. If it's programmed, it shouldn't be random, right? Maybe this is the incorrect statement.\n\nOption B says, \"A particular cell dies when it is no longer needed by the organism.\" That sounds right. Apoptosis helps in getting rid of cells that are no longer needed, like in the development process or during tissue remodeling.\n\nOption C says, \"A cell carries out apoptosis when too many mutations have accumulated.\" I think that's also correct. Cells with too much DNA damage can undergo apoptosis to prevent the propagation of those mutations, which could lead to cancer.\n\nOption D says, \"Plant cells carry out apoptosis as a defense measure in cells that have been infected by parasites.\" I'm not entirely sure about this one. I know that plants have a similar process called programmed cell death, which can be used as a defense mechanism against pathogens. So, this might be correct.\n\nSo, looking back, option A says apoptosis occurs randomly. But since apoptosis is programmed and controlled, it shouldn't be random. Therefore, I think option A is the incorrect statement.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any situation where apoptosis occurs randomly? I don't think so. It's a regulated process triggered by specific signals or conditions.\n\nOption B seems correct because cells do die when they're no longer needed, like in the formation of fingers and toes in embryos, where apoptosis removes the webbing.\n\nOption C is also correct because cells with irreparable DNA damage undergo apoptosis to protect the organism.\n\nOption D is a bit more specific, but as far as I know, plants do have a form of programmed cell death to combat infections.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A: It occurs randomly. Apoptosis is not random; it's a controlled process.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
