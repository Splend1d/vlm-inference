                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to find out how many people can sit in the baseball park in total, and there are three sections: red, blue, and green. Each section has a different seating capacity, and we're given some relationships between them.\n\nFirst, the red section seats 200 people. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, the blue section seats 20 fewer people than the red section. So, since the red section has 200 seats, the blue section would have 200 minus 20, which is 180 seats.\n\nThen, the green section seats 2 times as many people as the blue section. So, if the blue section has 180 seats, then the green section would have 2 times 180, which is 360 seats.\n\nNow, to find the total number of seats in the park, we need to add up the seats from all three sections: red, blue, and green.\n\nSo, that's 200 (red) + 180 (blue) + 360 (green).\n\nLet's add those up: 200 plus 180 is 380, and then 380 plus 360 is 740.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 260\n\nB. 380\n\nC. 640\n\nD. 740\n\nOur calculation leads us to option D, which is 740.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, red section: 200 seats. That's given.\n\nBlue section: 20 fewer than red, so 200 - 20 = 180 seats.\n\nGreen section: 2 times blue, so 2 * 180 = 360 seats.\n\nTotal: 200 + 180 + 360.\n\nAdding 200 and 180 gives 380.\n\nAdding 380 and 360 should be 740.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there are any other sections or additional factors, but the problem clearly states there are only three sections: red, blue, and green, and we've accounted for all of them.\n\nSo, the total number of people who can sit in the baseball park is 740.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\n- Red section: 200 people\n- Blue section: \\( 200 - 20 = 180 \\) people\n- Green section: \\( 2 \\times 180 = 360 \\) people\n- Total: \\( 200 + 180 + 360 = 740 \\) people"
