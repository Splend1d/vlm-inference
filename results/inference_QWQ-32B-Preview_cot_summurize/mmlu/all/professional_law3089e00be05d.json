                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out what the court is likely to do in this appeal. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a teenager who borrowed a car from his uncle. The uncle knew that the teenager wasn't capable of driving safely. He knew about the teenager's five license suspensions, several negligence lawsuits, multiple DUIs, and that he's an alcoholic. So, the uncle was aware that the teenager had a history of driving issues and alcohol problems.\n\nThen, the teenager got into an accident while driving the car and was seriously injured. He's now filing a lawsuit against his uncle for something called \"negligent entrustment.\" That's when someone lends a vehicle to another person who they know isn't competent to drive it, and then that person gets into an accident.\n\nThe uncle is trying to get the lawsuit dismissed, saying that there's no such thing as a \"first-party negligent entrustment.\" In other words, the uncle is arguing that you can't sue someone for negligently entrusting a car to you yourself; it only applies if someone else gets hurt.\n\nThe trial court agreed with the uncle and dismissed the complaint. Now, the teenager is appealing that decision, and I need to predict whether the appellate court will affirm the lower court's decision or not.\n\nThe question gives four options:\n\nA. Yes, because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\n\nB. Yes, because the comparative negligence of the entrustee will always defeat liability against the entrustor.\n\nC. No, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee.\n\nD. No, because a first-party negligent entrustment claim is generally allowed when the entrustor knows that he is loaning the vehicle to an incompetent operator.\n\nOkay, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, what is negligent entrustment? It's a legal concept where the owner of a vehicle is held liable for accidents caused by someone they lend their car to, if they knew or should have known that the person was incompetent or unfit to drive.\n\nUsually, negligent entrustment claims are brought by third parties who were injured by the incompetent driver. For example, if the teenager hits another car and injures the other driver, that driver could sue the uncle for negligently entrusting the car to the teenager.\n\nBut in this case, the teenager is trying to sue his own uncle for injuries he suffered himself in the accident. That's why it's called \"first-party\" negligent entrustment.\n\nNow, the uncle is arguing that such a claim doesn't exist, and the trial court agreed. So, on appeal, will the appellate court affirm that decision?\n\nOption A says yes, because public policy forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made. That sounds plausible. Maybe the law doesn't allow the incompetent driver to collect damages from the person who lent them the car.\n\nOption B also says yes, but for a different reason: that the teenager's own negligence would always defeat the uncle's liability. So, even if first-party negligent entrustment exists, the teenager's own fault in the accident would mean he can't recover damages.\n\nOption C says no, because public policy demands that the entrustor is strictly liable to all who are injured, including the incompetent entrustee. This seems to argue that the uncle should be liable to everyone injured by the teenager's driving, including the teenager himself.\n\nOption D says no, because first-party negligent entrustment is generally allowed when the entrustor knows the entrustee is incompetent.\n\nHmm. I need to think about which of these makes the most sense.\n\nFirst, I should consider whether first-party negligent entrustment is recognized in law. A quick search in my legal databases or textbooks would help, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to rely on my knowledge.\n\nI recall that negligent entrustment is typically used in cases where a third party is injured by the incompetent driver. It's a way to hold the vehicle owner liable for failing to ensure that the person they let drive their car is competent.\n\nBut can the incompetent driver himself sue the owner for entrusting the car to him? That seems less common. There might be policies against allowing the very person who was incompetent to drive to then turn around and sue the owner for giving them the car.\n\nOne policy reason could be that it would encourage people to claim they were incompetent in order to shift blame and seek damages. It could create moral hazard problems.\n\nAnother consideration is that the teenager, being incompetent, may have contributed to his own injuries through his own negligence. So, even if first-party negligent entrustment is allowed, his own fault might bar or reduce his recovery.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA suggests that public policy generally forbids such claims. That seems plausible given the potential for abuse.\n\nB says that the teenager's comparative negligence would always defeat the uncle's liability. That might be true in some jurisdictions, but it doesn't directly address whether first-party negligent entrustment is recognized.\n\nC argues that public policy demands strict liability to all injured parties, including the entrustee. But strict liability is usually imposed in contexts where the activity is inherently dangerous, and it's meant to ensure that victims can be compensated regardless of fault.\n\nD says that first-party negligent entrustment is generally allowed when the entrustor knows of the entrustee's incompetence. This seems to directly contradict the uncle's argument and the trial court's decision.\n\nGiven that, I need to decide which option is most likely correct.\n\nI think option A is strong because of the public policy concerns. Allowing the incompetent driver to sue the owner might encourage risky behavior or fraudulent claims.\n\nOption C seems too broad. Strict liability is not typically applied in negligent entrustment cases; it's more common in product liability or ultra-hazardous activities.\n\nOption D suggests that first-party negligent entrustment is generally allowed, but I'm not sure if that's the case. It might vary by jurisdiction.\n\nOption B might be relevant, but it doesn't directly answer whether the claim exists in the first place.\n\nConsidering all this, I lean towards option A: yes, the court will likely affirm the lower court decision because public policy generally forbids the collection of damages by the person to whom the entrustment is made.\n\nAdditionally, the uncle's knowledge of the teenager's incompetence might be relevant in a third-party lawsuit, but not necessarily in a first-party claim.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
