And Statement 2 says that the Penn Treebank has been used for language modeling. I need to figure out if each of these statements is true or false.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Statement 1. I know that the Stanford Sentiment Treebank is a dataset that's been used in sentiment analysis research. I think it's based on movie reviews, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should look it up to be certain.\n\nOkay, after a quick search, I see that the Stanford Sentiment Treebank is indeed a dataset containing movie reviews. It's parsed and labeled for sentiment analysis at different levels, like the sentiment of phrases and entire sentences. So, Statement 1 is correct in saying it contains movie reviews, not book reviews.\n\nNow, Statement 2: \"The Penn Treebank has been used for language modeling.\" I've heard of the Penn Treebank before; it's a large corpus of annotated English sentences, mostly from news sources. I believe it's been used for various natural language processing tasks, including language modeling. Language modeling is about predicting the probability of sequences of words, and having a large corpus like the Penn Treebank is useful for training such models.\n\nSo, it makes sense that the Penn Treebank has been used for language modeling. I can recall that it's a widely used resource in NLP research and applications. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nPutting it all together, both statements are true. So, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. For Statement 1, it specifies \"not book reviews.\" Is that accurate? Well, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank is based on movie reviews, so it doesn't contain book reviews. So, that part is correct.\n\nFor Statement 2, I'm fairly confident that the Penn Treebank has been used for language modeling. It's a standard resource for training language models due to its size and quality.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
