                    "text": "Let's see. This passage is from Jane Addams's book \"Twenty Years at Hull House,\" and it talks about the founding of a boarding club for working girls during a strike. Hull House was a settlement house in Chicago, and Jane Addams was one of the pioneers of the settlement house movement in the United States.\n\nSo, the question is: A settlement house worker was most likely to be motivated by which of the following?\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. The Social Gospel\n\nB. Social Darwinism\n\nC. Communism\n\nD. The support of an urban political machine\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means and how they relate to the settlement house movement.\n\nStarting with A, the Social Gospel: This was a Protestant social movement that was prominent in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It applied Christian ethics to social problems, particularly issues of social justice such as poverty, inequality, and the treatment of workers. Advocates of the Social Gospel believed in improving the conditions of the less fortunate and often supported reform movements.\n\nOption B, Social Darwinism: This is a theory that applies the principles of natural selection and \"survival of the fittest\" to human society. It suggests that certain people or groups are inherently superior and thus more likely to succeed, while others are inferior and will naturally be left behind. Social Darwinism was often used to justify inequality and opposition to social welfare programs.\n\nOption C, Communism: This is a political and economic ideology that advocates for a classless society in which the means of production are owned communally. It's based on the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and was a rising influence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly among labor movements and some intellectuals.\n\nOption D, the support of an urban political machine: This refers to the influence of political organizations, often in cities, that maintained power through patronage and favors to their supporters. These machines could be influential in local politics and sometimes had connections to labor unions and other community groups.\n\nNow, considering the context of settlement houses like Hull House, which were established to help improve the lives of the poor and immigrant populations in urban areas, it's likely that the workers there were motivated by a desire to address social injustices and improve community well-being.\n\nJane Addams herself was known for her progressive views and her work in social reform. The establishment of the boarding club for working girls during a strike suggests a concern for workers' rights and support for collective action, which aligns more with progressive and reformist ideologies.\n\nLet's look back at the options:\n\nA. The Social Gospel: Given that many settlement house workers were socially conscious and often had religious motivations, particularly from Protestant backgrounds, the Social Gospel seems like a plausible motivation.\n\nB. Social Darwinism: This seems less likely because Social Darwinism would probably lead someone to believe that the poor and working classes were inferior and therefore less deserving of assistance. Settlement house workers, on the other hand, were actively trying to help these populations.\n\nC. Communism: While some settlement house workers may have been influenced by socialist ideas, communism was a more radical offshoot, and in the early 20th century, it was not as widespread or acceptable in the United States as it would become later. It's possible but perhaps less likely than other options.\n\nD. The support of an urban political machine: While political machines could have influence in urban areas, settlement house workers were often involved in reform movements that aimed to reduce the power of these machines and promote more transparent and accountable government.\n\nConsidering all this, option A, the Social Gospel, seems the most fitting motivation for a settlement house worker based on the context provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
