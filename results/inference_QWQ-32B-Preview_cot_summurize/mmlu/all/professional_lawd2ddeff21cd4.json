                    "text": "An accountant had an office on the eighth floor of a downtown building. The accountant wanted to have renovations done to the entrance to the office. He hired an interior designer to do the work. The designer told the accountant that he had several options for the type of glass to be used in the door to the office. He could use half-inch thick plate glass, which would look nice and be relatively inexpensive. On the other hand, he could use tempered glass, which would cost twice as much but would be five times stronger than plate glass, more difficult to scratch, and capable of withstanding a blow from a hammer. The designer explained that the great majority of residential and small business establishments use plate glass for such doors. The accountant chose to go with the plate glass. The accountant ordered a plate glass door from a manufacturer and had the designer install the door when it arrived. A few months later, the door shattered when one of the accountant's clients pulled on the handle to open it. The glass cut the client's hand. If the client asserts a claim against the accountant based on negligence and establishes negligent manufacture of the glass door by the manufacturer that was not discoverable through reasonable inspection, the plaintiff will\n\nA. prevail, because the accountant is liable for its supplier's negligence.\nB. prevail, because the accountant instructed the designer to install plate glass rather than the more durable tempered glass.\nC. not prevail, because the accountant could not reasonably have been expected to discover the defect.\nD. not prevail, because the proper defendant is the manufacturer or the designer, not the accountant.\n"

                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's an accountant who had some office renovations done, specifically to the entrance door, which is made of glass. The interior designer gave him options: plate glass or tempered glass. Plate glass is cheaper, tempered glass is stronger and more durable but costs twice as much. Most residential and small businesses use plate glass, and the accountant chose plate glass.\n\nThen, a few months later, the door shattered when a client tried to open it, cutting the client's hand. Now, the client is asserting a claim against the accountant based on negligence, and it's established that there was negligent manufacture of the glass door by the manufacturer, which wasn't discoverable through reasonable inspection.\n\nThe question is asking what will happen in this scenario, and there are four options:\n\nA. The client will prevail because the accountant is liable for its supplier's negligence.\n\nB. The client will prevail because the accountant chose plate glass over tempered glass.\n\nC. The client won't prevail because the accountant couldn't reasonably have discovered the defect.\n\nD. The client won't prevail because the proper defendant should be the manufacturer or the designer, not the accountant.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about negligence in this context. Negligence generally requires that someone had a duty to act with a certain standard of care, they breached that duty, and that breach caused harm to another party.\n\nFirst, was there a duty? The accountant has a duty to ensure that his office premises are safe for visitors, including clients. So, yes, there's a duty to provide a safe environment.\n\nNext, was there a breach of that duty? The door shattered unexpectedly, causing injury. So, perhaps there was a breach.\n\nThen, did this breach cause harm? Yes, the client was cut.\n\nBut, in this case, it's specified that the negligent manufacture was not discoverable through reasonable inspection. That means even if the accountant had inspected the door properly, he wouldn't have found the defect because it was internal or something like that.\n\nOption A says the client will prevail because the accountant is liable for its supplier's negligence. This sounds like vicarious liability, where one party is responsible for the actions of another. However, in negligence cases, generally, you're only liable for your own breaches, not necessarily for the breaches of your suppliers, unless there's a specific relationship or duty that makes you liable for their actions.\n\nOption B says the client will prevail because the accountant chose plate glass over tempered glass. Well, the accountant made a choice based on cost and advice from the designer. But, given that most similar establishments use plate glass, it might be reasonable. So, was there a breach in choosing plate glass?\n\nOption C says the client won't prevail because the accountant couldn't reasonably have discovered the defect. This aligns with the information given that the defect was not discoverable through reasonable inspection.\n\nOption D says the client won't prevail because the proper defendant is the manufacturer or the designer, not the accountant. This suggests that liability should rest with those directly involved in the creation and installation of the door, not with the accountant.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is C. The accountant couldn't reasonably have discovered the defect, so he shouldn't be held liable for something he couldn't have known about or prevented.\n\nOption A might be tempting, but liability for suppliers' negligence isn't typically automatic in negligence cases. Option B doesn't hold up because choosing plate glass, which is standard for similar establishments, might not be a breach of duty. Option D could be valid, but it's possible that multiple parties could be liable, including the manufacturer and possibly the accountant, but given the circumstances, C seems most appropriate.\n\nSo, I would go with C. The client will not prevail because the accountant could not reasonably have been expected to discover the defect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
