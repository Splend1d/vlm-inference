So, the correct answer is A. the patient's opportunities for self-determination.\n\nHere's a brief explanation: Velleman argues that respecting a patient's autonomy involves not just acknowledging their capacity to make decisions but also ensuring that they have meaningful opportunities to exercise that capacity. By maximizing their effective options, we are providing them with the chances to determine their own course of action, which aligns with valuing their opportunities for self-determination."
