                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. First up, Statement 1: \"We learn a classifier f by boosting weak learners h. The functional form of f\u2019s decision boundary is the same as h\u2019s, but with different parameters. (e.g., if h was a linear classifier, then f is also a linear classifier).\"\n\nOkay, so boosting is a method where we combine multiple weak learners to create a stronger classifier. A weak learner is a classifier that performs just slightly better than random guessing. The idea is that by combining many of these weak learners, each focusing on different parts of the data, we can create a more accurate and robust model.\n\nNow, the statement suggests that the decision boundary of the final classifier f has the same functional form as that of the weak learner h, but with different parameters. For example, if h is a linear classifier, then f would also be linear.\n\nHmm, is that accurate? Let's think about it.\n\nIn boosting, like in AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting, we sequentially add weak learners, each trying to correct the mistakes of the previous ones. The final decision is often a weighted sum of the weak learners' decisions.\n\nIf h is a linear classifier, say, a perceptron, then each weak learner might be a linear function. But when you sum these linear functions with different weights, the result is still a linear function. So, in that case, the final classifier f would indeed be linear, just like h.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? Let's consider decision trees as weak learners. If h is a decision tree with a certain depth, say depth 1 (a stump), then each weak learner is a simple step function. When you combine multiple stumps in boosting, the final decision boundary can become more complex, potentially nonlinear, depending on how the stumps are combined.\n\nFor example, in AdaBoost with decision stumps, the final classifier can capture nonlinear boundaries by combining multiple linear decision boundaries in different regions of the feature space.\n\nSo, in this case, even though each h is linear (in the sense of decision stumps), the combination can lead to a nonlinear decision boundary.\n\nTherefore, the statement seems to be false because the functional form of f's decision boundary isn't necessarily the same as h's. It can be more complex, especially when h is a simple model like a decision stump.\n\nAlright, moving on to Statement 2: \"Cross-validation can be used to select the number of iterations in boosting; this procedure may help reduce overfitting.\"\n\nThis statement seems plausible. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model generalizes to an independent dataset. It involves partitioning the data into training and validation sets multiple times and averaging the performance.\n\nIn the context of boosting, the number of iterations is a hyperparameter that can affect model complexity. More iterations can lead to a more complex model that fits the training data better but may overfit and perform poorly on unseen data.\n\nBy using cross-validation to select the number of iterations, we can find a balance between bias and variance. We train the boosting model with different numbers of iterations and choose the one that performs best on the validation sets across the folds.\n\nThis approach can indeed help reduce overfitting by preventing the model from becoming too complex.\n\nSo, Statement 2 seems to be true.\n\nSummarizing:\n\n- Statement 1: False\n\n- Statement 2: True\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
