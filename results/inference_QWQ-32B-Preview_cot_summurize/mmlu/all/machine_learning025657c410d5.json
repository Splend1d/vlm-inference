                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"The log-likelihood of the data will always increase through successive iterations of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.\"\n\nI remember that the EM algorithm is used for finding maximum likelihood estimates in models with latent variables. It alternates between performing an expectation (E) step, which creates a function for the expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters, and a maximization (M) step, which computes parameters maximizing the expected log-likelihood found on the E step. This process is repeated until it converges to a maximum.\n\nNow, the key point here is whether the log-likelihood always increases with each iteration. I think that one of the main properties of the EM algorithm is that it guarantees that the log-likelihood will not decrease from one iteration to the next. In other words, it monotonically increases or stays the same, but it doesn't decrease.\n\nBut the statement says \"will always increase.\" Is there a difference between \"increase\" and \"not decrease\"? Well, if the log-likelihood stays the same at some point, that would mean it's not increasing, but it's also not decreasing. So, strictly speaking, \"always increase\" might not be accurate because it could stay constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in practice, it almost always increases and only stays constant at convergence. I need to recall the exact behavior.\n\nI think it's more precise to say that the log-likelihood is non-decreasing across EM iterations, meaning it either increases or stays the same, but doesn't decrease.\n\nSo, if the statement says \"always increase,\" that might be slightly misleading because it could imply strict increase, which isn't always the case.\n\nBut perhaps in the context of the EM algorithm, the log-likelihood strictly increases until convergence, and at convergence, it stays the same.\n\nWait, no. At convergence, the log-likelihood shouldn't change from one iteration to the next. So, if it's converged, the log-likelihood is the same in subsequent iterations.\n\nTherefore, it's more accurate to say that the log-likelihood is non-decreasing across EM iterations, meaning it increases or stays the same, but doesn't decrease.\n\nSo, the statement is not entirely accurate because it says \"will always increase,\" which might exclude the possibility of staying the same at convergence.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is False.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\"\n\nQ-learning is a reinforcement learning technique where an agent learns a policy telling it how to act in an environment, by performing actions and observing the rewards it receives.\n\nIn Q-learning, the agent learns the value of taking a particular action in a given state, based on the expected future rewards.\n\nNow, the statement suggests that Q-learning requires prior knowledge of how actions affect the environment.\n\nBut, from what I know, Q-learning is a model-free algorithm, which means it doesn't require explicit knowledge of the environment's dynamics. It learns by interacting with the environment, trying different actions and observing the resulting states and rewards.\n\nSo, in other words, it doesn't need to know in advance how its actions will affect the environment; it figures that out through trial and error.\n\nTherefore, the statement seems to be incorrect. Q-learning doesn't require prior knowledge of how actions affect the environment; that's one of its advantages.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is False.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth statements are false. So, the correct choice is B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
