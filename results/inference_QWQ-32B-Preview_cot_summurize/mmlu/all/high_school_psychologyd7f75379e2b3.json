However, the median is about position, not frequency.\n   - Another mistake could be miscalculating the position, especially if one starts counting from zero or miscounts the number of scores.\n\n   In this case, there are 9 scores, so the median is the 5th score in the ordered list.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
