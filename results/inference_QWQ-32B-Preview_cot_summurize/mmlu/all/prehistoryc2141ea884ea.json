                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about rock art. It's asking about a design that's etched into a rock face, and it gives four options: pictograph, petroglyph, pictorial, and petrification. I think I remember something about this from my ancient history class, but I need to make sure.\n\nFirst, I know that pictographs and petroglyphs are both types of ancient drawings or carvings, but I'm not exactly sure what the difference is. I think pictographs are painted onto surfaces, like caves or rocks, while petroglyphs are carved or etched into the surface. So, if the question is about something etched into the rock face, that sounds like a petroglyph.\n\nLet me double-check what a pictorial is. I think \"pictorial\" is more of an adjective referring to something that's like a picture or illustration. It's not a specific term for rock art, so maybe that's not the right answer.\n\nAnd \"petrification\" \u2014 I think that means turning something into stone, like petrified wood. That doesn't sound like a type of rock art at all.\n\nSo, going back to pictographs and petroglyphs, I need to confirm their definitions. A pictograph is a symbol or image that represents a word or concept, and it's often painted onto a surface. Petroglyphs, on the other hand, are images that are carved, incised, or etched into rock surfaces.\n\nGiven that, since the question specifies that the design is etched into the rock face, it should be a petroglyph.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should look up the definitions quickly.\n\nOkay, according to my notes, pictographs are indeed paintings or drawings on surfaces, often rock walls in caves or on cliffs. They use pigments like ochre, charcoal, or other natural materials to create images.\n\nPetroglyphs, conversely, are created by removing some of the surface of the rock to create the image. This can be done by chipping away the outer layer, abrasion, or other methods of altering the rock surface directly.\n\nSo, etching into the rock face aligns with the definition of a petroglyph.\n\nPictorials, as I thought, are more general and relate to anything that resembles a picture, but aren't specific to rock art.\n\nPetrification is a geological process where organic material is turned to stone via mineral replacement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. petroglyph.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
