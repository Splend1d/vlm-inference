Shallots are a type of onion, right? They're grown in fields, not in the ocean. So, I don't think you can catch shallots at sea.\n\nNext, stollen. Stollen is a kind of fruitcake that's traditional in Germany, especially around Christmas. It's baked, not caught. So, that doesn't make sense for catching at sea.\n\nNow, scallop. Hmm, scallops are a type of shellfish, aren't they? I think they live in the ocean, and fishermen catch them and sell them in markets. So, that seems like something you could catch at sea.\n\nLastly, scone. Scones are baked goods, like small quick breads, often served with tea. They're not seafood; they're made in a kitchen. So, you wouldn't catch scones at sea.\n\nBased on this, I think the answer is C, scallop, because it's the only one that comes from the sea and can be caught by fishing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
