So, statement C is true.\n\n**Identity under multiplication modulo 10:**\n\nWe need to check if there exists an element \\( e \\) in \\( S \\) such that for every element \\( a \\) in \\( S \\), \\( a \\times e \\equiv a \\) (mod 10).\n\nLet's check each element in \\( S \\):\n\n- \\( e = 0 \\):\n\n  - \\( 2 \\times 0 = 0 \\not\\equiv 2 \\) (mod 10)\n\n  - So, 0 is not a multiplicative identity.\n\n- \\( e = 2 \\):\n\n  - \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\not\\equiv 2 \\) (mod 10)\n\n  - So, 2 is not a multiplicative identity.\n\n- \\( e = 4 \\):\n\n  - \\( 2 \\times 4 = 8 \\not\\equiv 2 \\) (mod 10)\n\n  - So, 4 is not a multiplicative identity.\n\n- \\( e = 6 \\):\n\n  - \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\equiv 2 \\) (mod 10)\n\n  - \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\equiv 4 \\) (mod 10)\n\n  - \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\equiv 6 \\) (mod 10)\n\n  - \\( 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\equiv 8 \\) (mod 10)\n\n  - It seems like 6 satisfies \\( a \\times 6 \\equiv a \\) for all \\( a \\) in \\( S \\).\n\nWait a minute, but let's verify again:\n\n- \\( 0 \\times 6 = 0 \\equiv 0 \\) (ok)\n\n- \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\equiv 2 \\) (ok)\n\n- \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\equiv 4 \\) (ok)\n\n- \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\equiv 6 \\) (ok)\n\n- \\( 8 \\times 6 = 48 \\equiv 8 \\) (ok)\n\nSo, 6 acts as a multiplicative identity in \\( S \\). This means that statement D is false because there is an identity under multiplication modulo 10 in \\( S \\), which is 6.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
