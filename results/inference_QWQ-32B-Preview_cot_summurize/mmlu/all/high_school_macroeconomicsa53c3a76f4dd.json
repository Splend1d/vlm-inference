                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about inflation and economic policies. So, we're dealing with a scenario where the economy is at full employment, and we need to figure out which policy among the options would most likely cause the greatest inflation in the short run.\n\nFirst off, it's important to understand what full employment means. Full employment doesn't mean that everyone who wants a job has one; rather, it refers to a situation where all the available labor resources are being used efficiently. In other words, the economy is producing at its potential output, and there's little to no unemployment beyond the natural rate, which includes frictional and structural unemployment.\n\nNow, inflation generally occurs when there's an excess demand for goods and services in the economy, meaning that people want to buy more than what's being produced. This excess demand can push prices up. So, in the context of full employment, where the economy is already producing at its potential, any increase in demand without a corresponding increase in supply could lead to inflation.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\n**Option A: An increase in government spending matched by an equal increase in taxes.**\n\nWhen the government increases its spending, it directly increases demand in the economy. However, if this is matched by an equal increase in taxes, it means that the additional income the government is spending is being taken away from the private sector through higher taxes. In theory, this should be neutral because the increase in government spending is offset by a decrease in private spending due to higher taxes. So, overall, there shouldn't be a significant change in total demand, and thus, inflation should not be substantially affected.\n\n**Option B: An increase in government spending with no change in taxes.**\n\nHere, the government is increasing its spending without offsetting it with higher taxes. This means that the government is injecting more money into the economy, increasing demand. Since the economy is already at full employment, this additional demand could lead to inflation if the supply side can't expand to meet this new demand.\n\n**Option C: A decrease in government spending and a matching increase in taxes.**\n\nThis seems counterintuitive at first glance. Decreasing government spending reduces demand, while increasing taxes also reduces private spending. Both of these actions should decrease overall demand in the economy, which could potentially lead to deflationary pressures, not inflation. So, this option is unlikely to cause inflation.\n\n**Option D: A decrease in taxes with no change in government spending.**\n\nDecreasing taxes puts more money in the hands of consumers and businesses, which should increase private spending and, consequently, overall demand in the economy. Again, since the economy is already at full employment, this could lead to inflation if the additional demand isn't met by increased supply.\n\nNow, comparing options B and D, both increase demand in the economy, which could lead to inflation. However, option B involves an increase in government spending, which directly increases demand, whereas option D involves a tax cut, which increases private spending.\n\nIn terms of the immediate impact on demand, government spending might have a more direct and potentially larger effect because the government can target its spending towards areas that have a high multiplier effect. Additionally, government spending might not be subject to the same time lags as tax cuts, which might take longer to stimulate private spending.\n\nHowever, the size of the impact also depends on the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) in the case of tax cuts and the spending multiplier in the case of government spending. If the MPC is high, tax cuts could lead to a significant increase in private spending, potentially matching or even exceeding the impact of government spending.\n\nBut, generally, economists might argue that government spending has a larger multiplier effect because government projects can create more direct demand for goods and services, including hiring more workers, which can have a broader impact on the economy.\n\nTherefore, between options B and D, option B\u2014an increase in government spending with no change in taxes\u2014might create more inflation in the short run because it directly increases demand without reducing private sector resources through taxation.\n\nOption A is neutral, and option C is contractionary, so neither of these would likely cause inflation.\n\nSo, the answer should be **Option B**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
