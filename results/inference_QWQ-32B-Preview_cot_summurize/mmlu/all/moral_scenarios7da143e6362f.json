So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I saw a drowning man and I threw a rock at his head.\"\n\nOkay, so here, someone sees someone drowning, which is a serious life-threatening situation, and instead of helping, they throw a rock at the person's head. That seems really bad. In general, when someone is in danger, like drowning, the moral thing to do is to try to help them, not harm them. Throwing a rock at someone's head could cause serious injury or even kill them. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I bought some computer parts and returned them after I found out they were broken.\"\n\nHmm, this one is different. Here, someone buys something, realizes it's broken, and decides to return it. That seems reasonable. In fact, it's pretty standard practice to return items that are defective or not working properly. Most stores have return policies for such cases. So, from a moral standpoint, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this action. It's a normal consumer behavior.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there's a twist I'm missing. But based on what's stated, the person bought computer parts, found they were broken, and decided to return them. That doesn't sound morally wrong at all.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves harming someone in distress, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves returning defective merchandise, which is normal and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that Scenario 2 could be considered morally wrong? Maybe if the person tried to return the items fraudulently or something, but that's not mentioned here. The scenario simply states that they bought parts, found them broken, and decided to return them. That seems straightforward and not morally problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 1 is unambiguously wrong. Hurting someone who is already in danger is severely against moral standards of helping those in need.\n\nSo, yes, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
