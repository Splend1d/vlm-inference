                    "text": "Let's see. Joe finished the race 4 minutes before Mike, and Mike finished at 4:02 p.m. So, to find out when Joe finished, I need to subtract 4 minutes from Mike's finishing time.\n\nMike finished at 4:02 p.m., so if I subtract 4 minutes from that, what time do I get? Let's think about it.\n\nFirst, 4:02 p.m. minus 4 minutes. Since it's only 4 minutes, I can just subtract directly from the minutes part. 02 minutes minus 4 minutes would be negative 2 minutes, which doesn't make sense. So, I need to borrow from the hour.\n\nLet me think of it differently. If Mike finished at 4:02 p.m., and Joe finished 4 minutes earlier, that means Joe finished at 3:58 p.m.\n\nWait, is that right? Let's check. If Joe finished at 3:58 p.m., and Mike finished 4 minutes after that, that would be 3:58 p.m. plus 4 minutes, which is 4:02 p.m., which matches Mike's finishing time.\n\nSo, Joe finished at 3:58 p.m.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 3:58 p.m.\n\nB. 4:06 p.m.\n\nC. 8:02 p.m.\n\nD. 12:02 p.m.\n\nOption A is 3:58 p.m., which matches what I calculated.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. If Joe finished at 3:58, and Mike finished 4 minutes later, that's 4:02, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms of adding or subtracting time, subtracting 4 minutes from 4:02 p.m. should give me Joe's finishing time.\n\n4:02 minus 4 minutes is indeed 3:58 p.m.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 3:58 p.m.\n\nBut let's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is 4:06 p.m., which is after Mike's finishing time, so that can't be right.\n\nOption C is 8:02 p.m., which is much later in the day, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D is 12:02 p.m., which is in the afternoon, but earlier than both finishing times.\n\nSo, again, A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but the question says \"Joe finished the race 4 minutes before Mike.\" So, Joe finished earlier than Mike.\n\nSo, Joe's finishing time should be earlier than Mike's, which is 4:02 p.m.\n\nOption A is 3:58 p.m., which is earlier than 4:02 p.m. by 4 minutes, which matches.\n\nOption B is 4:06 p.m., which is after Mike's finishing time, so that can't be.\n\nOption C is 8:02 p.m., which is in the evening, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption D is 12:02 p.m., which is at noon, and that's earlier than 4:02 p.m., but not by 4 minutes.\n\nSo, again, A seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's some confusion with the time format, but it's clearly p.m. in all cases.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. 3:58 p.m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
