                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a metal reacting with HCl to produce hydrogen gas, and we're given that 0.0623 grams of this metal produces 28.3 mL of hydrogen at STP. We need to find out how much of this metal reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what STP stands for. STP means Standard Temperature and Pressure, which is typically 0\u00b0C and 1 atm. At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. That's a key fact here.\n\nSo, we have 28.3 mL of hydrogen gas at STP. Let's convert that to liters to make it easier to work with.\n\n28.3 mL = 0.0283 L\n\nNow, since at STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L, I can find out how many moles of hydrogen gas were produced.\n\nmoles of H\u2082 = volume / molar volume at STP\n\nmoles of H\u2082 = 0.0283 L / 22.4 L/mol\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.0283 \u00f7 22.4 \u2248 0.001263 moles of H\u2082\n\nSo, 0.0623 grams of metal produces 0.001263 moles of H\u2082.\n\nNow, I need to relate the moles of metal to the moles of H\u2082 produced. For that, I need to know the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between the metal and HCl.\n\nGenerally, a metal reacts with HCl like this:\n\nM + 2 HCl \u2192 MCl\u2082 + H\u2082\n\nThis is a general equation where M is the metal. From this equation, we can see that 1 mole of metal reacts with 2 moles of HCl to produce 1 mole of H\u2082.\n\nWait, but the question is about how much metal reacts with one mole of HCl. So, according to the equation, 1 mole of metal reacts with 2 moles of HCl. Therefore, to react with 1 mole of HCl, we would need half a mole of the metal.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. Maybe the metal has a different oxidation state, and the reaction is different. For example, if the metal forms a +3 ion, the reaction might be:\n\nM + 3 HCl \u2192 MCl\u2083 + (3/2) H\u2082\n\nThat would change the stoichiometry.\n\nAlternatively, it could be M + HCl \u2192 MCl + (1/2) H\u2082, if the metal forms a +1 ion.\n\nI think I need to determine the actual stoichiometry based on the data provided.\n\nLet's assume the general reaction:\n\nM + n HCl \u2192 MCl\u2099 + (n/2) H\u2082\n\nFrom this, the moles of H\u2082 produced would be (n/2) times the moles of metal.\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to consider the molar ratio directly.\n\nGiven that 0.0623 grams of metal produces 0.001263 moles of H\u2082, and assuming the reaction is M + 2 HCl \u2192 MCl\u2082 + H\u2082, then the moles of metal would be equal to the moles of H\u2082 produced.\n\nSo, moles of metal = moles of H\u2082 = 0.001263 moles\n\nTherefore, the mass of metal per mole is:\n\nmass of metal / moles of metal = 0.0623 g / 0.001263 mol \u2248 49.3 g/mol\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, the molar mass of the metal is approximately 49.3 grams per mole.\n\nBut the question is asking for the mass of the metal that reacts with one mole of hydrochloric acid.\n\nFrom the assumed reaction:\n\nM + 2 HCl \u2192 MCl\u2082 + H\u2082\n\nThis says that 1 mole of metal reacts with 2 moles of HCl.\n\nTherefore, to react with 1 mole of HCl, you would need half a mole of the metal.\n\nSo, mass of metal reacting with 1 mole HCl = 0.5 mol \u00d7 49.3 g/mol = 24.65 g\n\nHmm, that's close to option C, 24.7 g.\n\nBut let's check if the assumed reaction is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal reacts differently.\n\nLet's consider another possible reaction:\n\nM + HCl \u2192 MCl + 1/2 H\u2082\n\nIn this case, 1 mole of metal reacts with 1 mole of HCl to produce 0.5 mole of H\u2082.\n\nGiven that 0.0623 g of metal produces 0.001263 moles of H\u2082, then:\n\nmoles of metal = 0.001263 moles H\u2082 \u00d7 (1 mole M / 0.5 mole H\u2082) = 0.002526 moles M\n\nThen, molar mass of metal = 0.0623 g / 0.002526 mol \u2248 24.65 g/mol\n\nSo, in this case, the molar mass is about 24.65 g/mol.\n\nThen, the mass of metal reacting with 1 mole of HCl would be 1 mole \u00d7 24.65 g/mol = 24.65 g\n\nAgain, that's close to option C, 24.7 g.\n\nBut wait, the first assumption gave us 24.65 g, and the second also gave us 24.65 g.\n\nBut in the first assumption, the molar mass was 49.3 g/mol, and in the second, it was 24.65 g/mol.\n\nThat doesn't make sense. Wait, I think I messed up the first assumption.\n\nLet me revisit the first assumed reaction:\n\nM + 2 HCl \u2192 MCl\u2082 + H\u2082\n\nHere, 1 mole of metal produces 1 mole of H\u2082, reacting with 2 moles of HCl.\n\nGiven that, moles of metal = moles of H\u2082 = 0.001263 moles\n\nThen, molar mass = 0.0623 g / 0.001263 mol \u2248 49.3 g/mol\n\nBut according to the stoichiometry, 1 mole of metal reacts with 2 moles of HCl.\n\nTherefore, to react with 1 mole of HCl, you would need 0.5 moles of metal.\n\nSo, mass of metal reacting with 1 mole HCl = 0.5 mol \u00d7 49.3 g/mol = 24.65 g\n\nIn the second assumed reaction:\n\nM + HCl \u2192 MCl + 1/2 H\u2082\n\nHere, 1 mole of metal reacts with 1 mole of HCl, producing 0.5 mole of H\u2082.\n\nGiven that, moles of metal = 0.001263 moles H\u2082 \u00d7 (1 mole M / 0.5 mole H\u2082) = 0.002526 moles M\n\nThen, molar mass = 0.0623 g / 0.002526 mol \u2248 24.65 g/mol\n\nSo, in this case, molar mass is 24.65 g/mol, and since 1 mole of metal reacts with 1 mole of HCl, the mass reacting with 1 mole HCl is 24.65 g.\n\nWait a minute, in the first scenario, the molar mass is 49.3 g/mol, and in the second, it's 24.65 g/mol.\n\nBut both give the same mass reacting with 1 mole of HCl, which is 24.65 g.\n\nThis suggests that the first assumption is incorrect because the molar mass comes out to be 49.3 g/mol, but in reality, based on the second assumption, it should be 24.65 g/mol.\n\nSo, perhaps the second assumption is correct, and the metal reacts with HCl in a 1:1 molar ratio.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the metal has a different oxidation state.\n\nLet me consider another possible reaction:\n\n2 M + 6 HCl \u2192 2 MCl\u2083 + 3 H\u2082\n\nIn this case, 2 moles of metal react with 6 moles of HCl to produce 3 moles of H\u2082.\n\nSo, moles of metal = (2/3) \u00d7 moles of H\u2082\n\nGiven that, moles of metal = (2/3) \u00d7 0.001263 mol \u2248 0.000842 moles\n\nThen, molar mass = 0.0623 g / 0.000842 mol \u2248 74.0 g/mol\n\nIn this case, to react with 1 mole of HCl, from the equation, 2 moles of metal react with 6 moles of HCl, so 1 mole of HCl reacts with (2/6) = 0.333 moles of metal.\n\nThus, mass of metal reacting with 1 mole HCl = 0.333 mol \u00d7 74.0 g/mol \u2248 24.7 g\n\nAgain, we arrive at approximately 24.7 grams.\n\nThis suggests that regardless of the stoichiometry, the mass of metal reacting with 1 mole of HCl is around 24.7 grams.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 24.7 g.\n\nBut let's check the options again:\n\nA. 98.6 g\nB. 493 g\nC. 24.7 g\nD. 49.3 g\n\nOption C matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if there was a miscalculation, let's double-check the initial data.\n\nGiven:\n\nmass of metal = 0.0623 g\nvolume of H\u2082 at STP = 28.3 mL = 0.0283 L\n\nmoles of H\u2082 = 0.0283 L / 22.4 L/mol \u2248 0.001263 mol\n\nAssuming M + 2 HCl \u2192 MCl\u2082 + H\u2082\n\nThen, moles of metal = moles of H\u2082 = 0.001263 mol\n\nmolar mass = 0.0623 g / 0.001263 mol \u2248 49.3 g/mol\n\nmass reacting with 1 mole HCl = 0.5 mol \u00d7 49.3 g/mol = 24.65 g\n\nAlternatively, assuming M + HCl \u2192 MCl + 0.5 H\u2082\n\nmoles of metal = 0.001263 mol H\u2082 / 0.5 = 0.002526 mol\n\nmolar mass = 0.0623 g / 0.002526 mol \u2248 24.65 g/mol\n\nmass reacting with 1 mole HCl = 1 mol \u00d7 24.65 g/mol = 24.65 g\n\nOr, in the third scenario, with 2 M + 6 HCl \u2192 2 MCl\u2083 + 3 H\u2082\n\nmoles of metal = (2/3) \u00d7 0.001263 mol \u2248 0.000842 mol\n\nmolar mass = 0.0623 g / 0.000842 mol \u2248 74.0 g/mol\n\nmass reacting with 1 mole HCl = (2/6) mol \u00d7 74.0 g/mol \u2248 24.7 g\n\nIn all cases, the mass of metal reacting with 1 mole of HCl is approximately 24.7 grams.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 24.7 g.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
