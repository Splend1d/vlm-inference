Work done in lifting an object is equal to the change in its potential energy, which is given by:\n\n\\[ W = m \\times g \\times h \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the object, \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\( h \\) is the height through which the object is lifted.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( m = 100 \\) kg\n- \\( h = 2 \\) m\n- \\( g \\) is approximately \\( 9.8 \\) m/s\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ W = 100 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\\[ W = 100 \\times 9.8 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ W = 1960 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nNow, the time taken (\\( t \\)) is 4 seconds. So, the power (\\( P \\)) is:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{1960 \\, \\text{J}}{4 \\, \\text{s}} \\]\n\\[ P = 490 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nHowever, none of the options match exactly with 490 W. It seems there might be a mistake in the options provided or in the assumption of the value of \\( g \\). If we take \\( g \\) as 10 m/s\u00b2 for simplicity, then:\n\n\\[ W = 100 \\times 10 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ W = 2000 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{2000 \\, \\text{J}}{4 \\, \\text{s}} \\]\n\\[ P = 500 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nSo, option B (500 W) would be the closest answer if we approximate \\( g \\) to 10 m/s\u00b2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
