                    "text": "So I've got this regression problem here, and I need to find the appropriate critical value for a two-sided test with a 5% significance level for the hypothesis that beta_3 equals 1. The regression is estimated using 27 quarterly observations, and it looks like this:\n\ny_t = beta_1 + beta_2 * x_2 + beta_3 * x_3t + u_t\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. It's a hypothesis test for the coefficient beta_3, specifically testing whether it equals 1 or not. It's a two-sided test, meaning I'm interested in deviations from 1 in both directions, not just one direction.\n\nThe significance level is 5%, which is standard. Now, to find the critical value, I need to know the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. In regression analysis, coefficients are usually estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), and under certain assumptions, the sampling distribution of the OLS estimators is normal.\n\nGiven that, the test statistic for beta_3 would follow a t-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of observations minus the number of parameters estimated in the model.\n\nLet me count the parameters: there's beta_1 (the intercept), beta_2, and beta_3, so that's three parameters in total.\n\nNumber of observations is 27, so degrees of freedom (df) would be 27 - 3 = 24.\n\nAlright, so df = 24.\n\nNow, for a two-sided test with a 5% significance level and df = 24, I need to look up the critical value in a t-distribution table.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the standard normal distribution, but since the sample size isn't extremely large, using the t-distribution is more appropriate.\n\nWait, let's recall that for large degrees of freedom, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution. But with df = 24, it's not extremely large, so using the t-distribution is better.\n\nBut looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 1.64\n\nB. 1.71\n\nC. 2.06\n\nD. 1.96\n\nI recognize that 1.96 is the critical value for a two-sided test with 5% significance level in the standard normal distribution.\n\nSimilarly, 1.64 is the critical value for a one-sided test at 5% significance level in the standard normal distribution.\n\nBut since we're dealing with a t-distribution with df = 24, the critical value might be slightly different.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIn a t-distribution table, for df = 24 and a two-tailed test with alpha = 0.05, the critical value is approximately 2.064.\n\nWait, but option C is 2.06, which is very close.\n\nOption B is 1.71, which seems too low.\n\nOption A is 1.64, which is the one-tailed critical value for the standard normal.\n\nOption D is 1.96, which is the two-tailed critical value for the standard normal.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the most appropriate choice is C. 2.06.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nFirst, confirm the degrees of freedom: 27 observations, 3 parameters, df = 24.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNext, for a two-sided test with alpha = 0.05 and df = 24, the critical value in the t-distribution is indeed around 2.064.\n\nIn practice, 2.06 is a reasonable approximation.\n\nNow, is there any reason to use the standard normal critical value instead?\n\nWell, for larger degrees of freedom, the t-distribution gets closer to the standard normal, and at df = infinity, it becomes the standard normal.\n\nBut with df = 24, the difference is still noticeable.\n\nTherefore, using the t-distribution critical value is more appropriate.\n\nHence, option C. 2.06 is the correct choice.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the question expects us to use the standard normal approximation, given that the sample size isn't small.\n\nBut the problem specifies that there are 27 observations, which isn't extremely large, so sticking with the t-distribution seems more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether we know that for hypothesis tests about coefficients, we use the t-distribution, especially with smaller sample sizes.\n\nGiven that, reinforcing the use of the t-distribution with df = 24 seems appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 2.06.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other aspect I might be missing.\n\nIs there any reason why the critical value would be different in this context?\n\nFor example, is there any mention of heteroskedasticity or other issues that might require a different type of standard error?\n\nThe question doesn't provide any such information, so I'll assume that the standard OLS assumptions hold, and the error terms are homoskedastic.\n\nTherefore, no need to adjust for heteroskedasticity.\n\nAlso, since it's a time series context with quarterly data, there might be serial correlation, but again, the question doesn't mention any such issues, so I'll proceed with the standard approach.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that it's quarterly data doesn't introduce any seasonal effects or other complications in this particular hypothesis test.\n\nSo, sticking with the t-distribution with df = 24 and the two-sided test at 5% significance level, the critical value is approximately 2.06.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 2.06.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
