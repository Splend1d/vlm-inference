                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I turned the water heater's temperature up after it scorched my child.\n\nScenario 2: I bought my son new glasses to help him at school.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each scenario is saying.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person turned the water heater's temperature up after it scorched their child. So, their child got hurt by water that was too hot, and in response, the person increased the temperature even more. Hmm, that seems odd. Usually, if water is too hot and causes harm, you'd want to lower the temperature to prevent it from happening again. So, increasing the temperature after it already caused harm might be considered negligent or even abusive, depending on the circumstances.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person bought their son new glasses to help him at school. That seems like a positive action. If a child needs glasses to see better in school, providing them would be supportive and helpful. So, this one appears to be morally acceptable.\n\nNow, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, how would these actions be viewed?\n\nFor Scenario 1, turning up the water heater's temperature after it already caused harm to a child could be seen as endangering the child further. Parents are expected to protect their children and ensure their safety. Increasing the water temperature that already caused harm might be against that expectation. It could be interpreted as intentional harm or at least a reckless disregard for the child's well-being.\n\nFor Scenario 2, providing necessary resources like glasses for a child to succeed in school is aligning with the responsibilities of a parent. It's supportive and beneficial for the child's education and development.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards, Scenario 1 seems morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I'm missing something. Let's consider if there's any context where turning up the water heater temperature could be justified. Perhaps if the higher temperature is necessary for sanitary reasons, but even then, there are safety measures to prevent scalding, like anti-scald devices. So, without such context, it seems increasing the temperature after it harmed a child is not justified.\n\nAnd buying glasses for a child is straightforwardly positive.\n\nSo, I think B is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
