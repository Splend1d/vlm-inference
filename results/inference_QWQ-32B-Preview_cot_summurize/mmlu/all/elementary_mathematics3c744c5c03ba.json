Okay, first things first, I need to understand what 5 cubed means.\n\nI know that when we say a number raised to a power, it means we multiply the number by itself that many times. So, 5^3 should be 5 multiplied by itself three times. That is, 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5.\n\nLet me just make sure I remember this right. For example, 2^3 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, which is 8. Yeah, that's correct. So, applying the same logic here.\n\nSo, 5 \u00d7 5 is 25. Then, 25 \u00d7 5 is 125. Therefore, 5^3 equals 125.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 125 matches my answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options. A. 15 seems too small. 5 \u00d7 3 is 15, but that's not the same as 5^3. C. 8 is 2^3, which I just thought about earlier. And D. 53 is just 53, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo, definitely, B. 125 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, I can use a calculator. Let's see, entering 5, then the exponent key, which is usually ^ or x^y, then 3, and equals. Yeah, it shows 125. Okay, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, I could do this on paper. Write down 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5. First, 5 \u00d7 5 is 25, then 25 \u00d7 5 is 125. Same result.\n\nOr, mentally, I know that 5 squared is 25, and 25 times 5 is 125. So, all methods lead to the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this one. The answer is B. 125.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
