                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: A zoo has 15 toucans and 60 parrots. I need to find the ratio of the number of toucans to the number of parrots at the zoo. The options are A. 1:04, B. 1:05, C. 4:01, and D. 4:05.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities by division. So, in this case, I'm comparing the number of toucans to the number of parrots.\n\nSo, the number of toucans is 15, and the number of parrots is 60. So, the ratio should be 15 to 60, or 15:60.\n\nBut I think I can simplify that. Simplifying a ratio means reducing it to its lowest terms, just like simplifying a fraction.\n\nOkay, to simplify 15:60, I can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 15 and 60 is 15.\n\nSo, 15 divided by 15 is 1, and 60 divided by 15 is 4. So, the simplified ratio is 1:4.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 1:04, which is the same as 1:4.\n\nWait, but option C is 4:01, which is 4:1, and that's different. Option B is 1:05, which is 1:5, and option D is 4:05, which is 4:5.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, the answer should be A. 1:04.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the ratio.\n\nStarting again: number of toucans is 15, number of parrots is 60.\n\nRatio of toucans to parrots is 15:60.\n\nDivide both by 15: 15/15 = 1, 60/15 = 4, so 1:4.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in fractions. 15/60 simplifies to 1/4, so the ratio is 1:4.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 1:04.\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nMaybe they want the ratio in decimal form or something, but no, the options are in ratio format.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the ratio of parrots to toucans instead.\n\nBut the question clearly says \"the ratio of the number of toucans to the number of parrots,\" so it's toucans to parrots, not parrots to toucans.\n\nSo, it's 15:60, which simplifies to 1:4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 1:04.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
