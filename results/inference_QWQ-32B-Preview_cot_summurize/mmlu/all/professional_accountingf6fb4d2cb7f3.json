                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Darv Co.'s financial ratios. It says that the company has a current ratio of 3-to-1 and a quick ratio of 1-to-1, with current liabilities of $322,000. I need to find out the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses. The options are A. $322,000, B. $644,000, C. $966,000, and D. $1,288,000.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what these ratios represent. The current ratio is a measure of a company's ability to pay its short-term obligations, and it's calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. So, current ratio = current assets / current liabilities. Given that it's 3-to-1, that means current assets are three times the current liabilities.\n\nSimilarly, the quick ratio, also known as the acid-test ratio, is a more stringent measure of liquidity. It's calculated by taking quick assets (which are current assets minus inventory and prepaid expenses) and dividing by current liabilities. So, quick ratio = (current assets - inventory - prepaid expenses) / current liabilities. Here, it's 1-to-1, meaning quick assets are equal to current liabilities.\n\nGiven that, I can set up some equations to solve for the unknowns. Let's denote:\n\n- Current liabilities (CL) = $322,000\n\n- Current assets (CA) = 3 * CL = 3 * $322,000 = $966,000\n\n- Quick assets (QA) = CA - inventory (Inv) - prepaid expenses (Prep) = CL = $322,000\n\nSo, QA = CA - Inv - Prep = $322,000\n\nBut we've already determined that CA = $966,000\n\nPlugging that in:\n\n$966,000 - Inv - Prep = $322,000\n\nNow, I can solve for Inv + Prep:\n\nInv + Prep = $966,000 - $322,000 = $644,000\n\nSo, the total amount for inventory and prepaid expenses is $644,000\n\nLooking back at the options, that's choice B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, current ratio is 3:1, so CA = 3 * CL = 3 * $322,000 = $966,000. That seems correct.\n\nQuick ratio is 1:1, so QA = CL = $322,000\n\nAnd QA = CA - Inv - Prep\n\nSo, $966,000 - Inv - Prep = $322,000\n\nTherefore, Inv + Prep = $966,000 - $322,000 = $644,000\n\nYes, that seems straightforward. I think B. $644,000 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nb. $644,000"
