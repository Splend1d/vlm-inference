The options are:\n\nA. pursue pleasure.\n\nB. pursue happiness.\n\nC. forget about happiness.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nI need to remember what Feinberg said about this. I think he was discussing the concept of happiness and how to achieve it. I recall that he might have argued against directly pursuing happiness because it can be elusive or lead to negative outcomes.\n\nLet me think about this. Option A suggests pursuing pleasure, which sounds similar to hedonism, where the main goal is to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. But I'm not sure if Feinberg endorses that.\n\nOption B is to pursue happiness directly. But I think Feinberg might argue that happiness is not something you can chase directly; it's more of a byproduct of other pursuits.\n\nOption C says to forget about happiness, which might suggest that focusing on other goals or activities leads to happiness indirectly.\n\nOption D is none of the above, which could mean that Feinberg has a different perspective altogether.\n\nI think Feinberg might argue that the best way to pursue happiness is to focus on other meaningful goals and activities, rather than happiness itself. So, maybe option C, forget about happiness, is closest to his view.\n\nAlternatively, he might suggest that happiness comes from leading a virtuous life or engaging in meaningful work, which would be beyond just pursuing pleasure or happiness directly.\n\nWait, perhaps option D is the correct answer because Feinberg has a more nuanced view that isn't captured by the other options.\n\nLet me try to recall specific points from Feinberg's writings. I think he discusses the paradox of happiness, where trying to be happy can make people unhappy.\n\nYes, that rings a bell. So, if someone tries too hard to be happy, it might backfire.\n\nTherefore, maybe the best approach is to pursue other things that contribute to happiness indirectly.\n\nGiven that, option C, forget about happiness, seems plausible because if you focus on other aspects of life, happiness might follow as a consequence.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up Feinberg's views on happiness to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he endorses pursuing pleasure, which is option A.\n\nBut I think that's more aligned with hedonism, and Feinberg might have a different perspective.\n\nWait, perhaps he criticizes the idea that happiness is simply about pursuing pleasure.\n\nI seem to remember that he distinguishes between happiness and pleasure.\n\nSo, maybe he would argue that happiness is about more than just pleasure, which would make option A incorrect.\n\nOption B, pursue happiness, seems circular or unhelpful because happiness is something that often comes indirectly.\n\nSo, perhaps Feinberg would agree with option C, to forget about happiness and focus on other things that contribute to it.\n\nAlternatively, option D might be the case if his view is more complex and not captured by the other options.\n\nI need to make a decision based on my current knowledge.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is C. forget about happiness.\n\nBecause Feinberg likely believes that happiness is best achieved when not directly pursued, but attained through engaging in meaningful activities and pursuing other valuable goals.\n\nSo, forgetting about happiness and focusing on those other aspects might be the key to experiencing happiness.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
