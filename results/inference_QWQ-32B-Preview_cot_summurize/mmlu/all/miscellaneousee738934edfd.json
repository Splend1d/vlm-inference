I don't know much about this, so I need to think carefully.\n\nFirst, I know that rubber is an important material used in many industries, especially for tires. So, maybe the city that has a big history with tire manufacturing or rubber production would be the one called the rubber capital.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Omaha, Nebraska - I don't recall anything specific about Omaha and rubber. Omaha is known for being a financial and insurance center, right? So, maybe not.\n\nB. Rockford, Illinois - I'm not sure about Rockford. I think it's a mid-sized city in Illinois, but I don't know its industry. Maybe it's not the one.\n\nC. Grand Rapids, Michigan - I know Grand Rapids is famous for its furniture manufacturing and is a major city in Michigan. But is it known for rubber? I don't think so.\n\nD. Akron, Ohio - Now, Akron, Ohio, rings a bell. I've heard that Akron is associated with rubber somehow. Maybe because of the rubber industry being based there.\n\nLet me recall some history. The rubber industry really took off in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with companies like Goodyear and Firestone. I think Goodyear was founded in Akron. Yes, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company was founded there by Charles Goodyear's descendants. So, that makes sense.\n\nAlso, Firestone Tire and Rubber Company was founded in Akron as well. So, having two major rubber and tire companies in one city probably earned it the nickname \"rubber capital of the world.\"\n\nMoreover, Akron is often called the \"rubber capital of the world\" because of its significant role in the rubber manufacturing industry. The city has been deeply involved in rubber production and innovation for over a century.\n\nSo, considering all this, I believe the correct answer is D. Akron, Ohio.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check the other options quickly.\n\nOmaha, Nebraska, is known for finance, especially insurance companies like Mutual of Omaha, and it's a major transportation hub, but not for rubber.\n\nRockford, Illinois, has a diverse economy including manufacturing, but I don't think rubber is its main claim to fame.\n\nGrand Rapids, Michigan, is known for furniture, as I mentioned earlier, and is a major furniture manufacturing center in the U.S.\n\nTherefore, none of these cities are primarily known for rubber like Akron is.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. Akron, Ohio.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
