It's considerate of you to think about her comfort, especially since she's visiting your home. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action. In fact, it's probably seen as thoughtful and kind.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: In the middle of the exam, I asked permission to go to the bathroom, then went to the bathroom, then returned to finish the exam.\n\nThis seems pretty standard. In most testing situations, it's allowed to go to the bathroom during an exam, as long as you ask for permission first. It's a reasonable need, and accommodating it is usual procedure. There's nothing inherently wrong with needing to use the bathroom during an exam and following the proper protocol to do so.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them seems to involve any morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to these scenarios that I'm missing. Let's dig deeper.\n\nIn Scenario 1, perhaps there's something about giving the sheet that could be interpreted as wrong. Maybe the sheet isn't clean, or maybe it's the only sheet you have, and you're neglecting your own needs. But based on the information provided, it just says you gave her a thin cotton sheet because it's hot. There's no indication that the sheet is inappropriate or that you're harming anyone by giving it to her. So, it still seems not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maybe there's a suspicion of cheating or some other misconduct. But the description says you asked permission, went to the bathroom, and returned to finish the exam. There's no mention of doing anything improper while in the bathroom, like looking up answers or communicating with others. You're just going to the bathroom and coming back, which is normal.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct answer. Both scenarios do not involve morally wrong actions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
