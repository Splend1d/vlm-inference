                    "text": "So I've got this question here about two passages, one from William Bentinck, who was the Governor-General of India in 1829, talking about the practice of Sati, and another from George Simpson, who was the Head of the Northern Department of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1826, discussing how to rule the Indians who trade with them. The question is asking about the first passage and specifically about British motivations for eradicating the Sati ritual.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The British intended principally to Christianize India's Hindu population.\n\nB. The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\n\nC. They acted out of a progressive concern for women's equality.\n\nD. They were impelled by a racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs.\n\nSo, I need to read the first passage carefully and see which of these options best aligns with the tone and words used by Bentinck.\n\nLet me start by understanding what Sati is. Sati was the practice in some parts of India where a widow would throw herself onto her husband's funeral pyre as a voluntary act of self-immolation. It was considered an honorable act, but it was also controversial and seen as inhumane by many, especially by the British during their rule in India.\n\nNow, looking at Bentinck's words: \"Whether the question be to continue or to discontinue the practice of sati, the decision is equally surrounded by an awful responsibility. To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\"\n\nOkay, so Bentinck is expressing a moral dilemma here. He acknowledges that allowing Sati to continue means condoning a practice that results in the death of hundreds of innocent women each year, which he finds horrifying from a moral standpoint. However, he also recognizes that banning it could threaten the stability and security of the British Empire in India, especially considering the potential reactions from the Indian population and possibly from neighboring powers.\n\nHe mentions that in the past, when there were more powerful neighbors and greater uncertainty about British security in India, it might have been prudent to proceed more cautiously. But now that Britain is supreme in India, he believes it's the right time to prohibit Sati openly and generally.\n\nSo, the tone here is one of moral responsibility coupled with a pragmatic consideration of British power and security.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Christianizing India's Hindu population. The passage doesn't mention anything about Christianity or religious conversion. It's focused on the practice of Sati and its human costs versus the political risks of banning it. So, this seems less likely.\n\nB. Ending an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority. This seems to align closely with what Bentinck is saying. He describes Sati as a \"cruel and untimely end\" for hundreds of women, which his conscience cannot bear, but he's also concerned about the potential risks to British rule if they ban it.\n\nC. Progressive concern for women's equality. While Bentinck does refer to the women as \"innocent victims\" and expresses horror at their deaths, he doesn't explicitly talk about women's equality in a broader sense. His concern seems more focused on the specific practice of Sati and its immediate human costs rather than a general push for women's rights.\n\nD. Racially prejudiced disdain for all Indian customs. This option suggests a more generalized dislike or contempt for Indian customs based on racial prejudice. However, Bentinck's tone is more nuanced. He's critiquing a specific practice that he sees as harmful, but he's also considering the political sensitivities and the potential backlash from the Indian population. There's no explicit expression of racial prejudice in this passage.\n\nBetween options B and C, B seems more accurate because it captures both the moral imperative to end a harmful practice and the pragmatic concern for maintaining British authority in India.\n\nOption C might be partially true in that Bentinck is concerned about the welfare of women, but it doesn't account for his cautious approach and his consideration of the political risks involved.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B: The British sought to end what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
