                    "text": "So I have this problem here about testing a program that calculates shipping charges for Airmail Express. They have different pricing based on the weight of the package, and they only accept packages that weigh more than 0 and up to 20 pounds. The weight has to be an integer.\n\nSo, the charge tiers are:\n\n- If the weight w is between 0 and 2 pounds (exclusive of 0, inclusive of 2), it's $4.00.\n\n- If w is between 2 and 5 pounds (exclusive of 2, inclusive of 5), it's $8.00.\n\n- If w is between 5 and 20 pounds (exclusive of 5, inclusive of 20), it's $15.00.\n\nAnd they don't accept packages over 20 pounds.\n\nNow, I need to choose the best set of data to test this program from the options given:\n\nA. 0, 2, 5, 20\n\nB. 1, 4, 16\n\nC. \u22121, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20\n\nD. \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20, 22\n\nI need to think about what makes a good test case. I should cover all the possible scenarios to make sure the program handles each case correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to test the boundaries of each weight range because that's where errors often occur. So, for each range:\n\n- For 0 < w \u2264 2, the boundaries are just above 0 and up to and including 2.\n\n- For 2 < w \u2264 5, just above 2 and up to and including 5.\n\n- For 5 < w \u2264 20, just above 5 and up to and including 20.\n\nAlso, I need to test weights that are exactly on the boundaries and weights that are within each range.\n\nAdditionally, I should test weights that are not accepted by the service, like weights less than or equal to 0 and weights greater than 20.\n\nLet's look at option A: 0, 2, 5, 20\n\n- 0: This is at the lower limit, but the service doesn't accept packages with weight \u2264 0, so the program should handle this appropriately.\n\n- 2: This is on the boundary between the first and second tier.\n\n- 5: This is on the boundary between the second and third tier.\n\n- 20: This is the upper limit, so it should fall into the third tier.\n\nThis seems good, but it's missing some internal points in each range and doesn't include any weights above 20 or negative weights.\n\nOption B: 1, 4, 16\n\n- 1: Within the first tier.\n\n- 4: Within the second tier.\n\n- 16: Within the third tier.\n\nThis covers one point in each tier but doesn't cover the boundaries or invalid weights.\n\nOption C: \u22121, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20\n\n- \u22121: Invalid weight, should be handled appropriately.\n\n- 1: Inside the first tier.\n\n- 2: Boundary between first and second tier.\n\n- 3: Inside the second tier.\n\n- 5: Boundary between second and third tier.\n\n- 16: Inside the third tier.\n\n- 20: Upper limit, third tier.\n\nThis seems comprehensive as it includes an invalid weight, internal points, and boundaries.\n\nOption D: \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20, 22\n\n- \u22121: Invalid.\n\n- 0: Invalid.\n\n- 1: First tier.\n\n- 2: Boundary.\n\n- 3: Second tier.\n\n- 5: Boundary.\n\n- 16: Third tier.\n\n- 20: Upper limit.\n\n- 22: Invalid.\n\nThis is similar to option C but includes 0 and 22.\n\nComparing C and D, D has more comprehensive coverage as it includes 0 and 22, which are also invalid weights.\n\nBut the question is to choose the best set of data. Option D seems to cover all bases:\n\n- Invalid weights: -1, 0, 22\n\n- Boundary weights: 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20\n\nWait, is 1 a boundary? No, 1 is inside the first tier. Boundaries are at 2 and 5.\n\nBut overall, D includes a good range of weights, including edges and invalid inputs.\n\nOption C is similar but misses 0 and 22.\n\nHowever, the problem might consider only the weights that the service accepts, but since the program should handle invalid inputs as well, including them is important.\n\nBut perhaps the \"best\" set is the minimal set that covers all necessary cases without redundancy.\n\nOption A covers some boundaries but misses internal points and invalid weights.\n\nOption B covers internal points but misses boundaries and invalid weights.\n\nOption C covers some invalid weights and boundaries and internal points.\n\nOption D is more comprehensive.\n\nBut maybe the best is C because it includes invalid weights and covers the necessary points.\n\nWait, but D includes more invalid weights, which might be important to test how the program handles different invalid inputs.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the problem considers only the valid weights, in which case D includes unnecessary invalid weights.\n\nBut I think it's important to test how the program handles invalid inputs.\n\nOption C includes -1, which is invalid, and the rest are valid, including boundaries.\n\nOption D includes -1, 0, and 22 as invalid weights, and the rest are valid boundaries and internal points.\n\nGiven that, option D seems more comprehensive.\n\nBut perhaps the problem considers option C as the best because it includes -1, which is invalid, and valid weights including boundaries.\n\nWait, but D includes more invalid weights, which might be necessary to thoroughly test the program's response to invalid inputs.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the problem considers only the valid weight ranges, in which case option C and D both include valid weights, but D has more invalid weights.\n\nBut since testing invalid inputs is important, D might be better.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem is designed to choose the option that includes all possible cases without including unnecessary weights.\n\nOption D includes 0 and 22, which are invalid, but 0 is a edge case, and 22 is above the limit.\n\nOption C includes -1, which is invalid, and valid weights including boundaries.\n\nGiven that, option D seems more comprehensive.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is C, considering that 0 might be considered a valid weight, but according to the problem, weights have to be greater than 0.\n\nWait, the problem says 0 < w, so w has to be greater than 0.\n\nTherefore, 0 is invalid.\n\nSo, option D is better because it includes 0 as an invalid weight, along with -1 and 22.\n\nBut the problem might consider only the weights that the service accepts, meaning only positive integers up to 20.\n\nIn that case, option C might be considered better because it includes only one invalid weight (-1) and the rest are valid.\n\nBut I think it's important to test how the program handles weights that are exactly 0 and weights above 20.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the best choice.\n\nIt includes:\n\n- Invalid weights: -1, 0, 22\n\n- Valid weights: 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20\n\nThis covers:\n\n- Below the lower limit: -1\n\n- Exactly at the lower limit: 0\n\n- Within the first tier: 1\n\n- At the first boundary: 2\n\n- Within the second tier: 3\n\n- At the second boundary: 5\n\n- Within the third tier: 16\n\n- At the upper limit: 20\n\n- Above the upper limit: 22\n\nThis seems to cover all possible scenarios.\n\nOption C misses the weight 0 and 22, which are important to test how the program handles weights exactly at 0 and above 20.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the best set of data to test the program.\n\nBut let's see if there's any reason to choose another option.\n\nOption A is missing internal points and some invalid weights.\n\nOption B is missing boundaries and invalid weights.\n\nOption C is missing the weight 0 and 22.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most comprehensive.\n\nI think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
