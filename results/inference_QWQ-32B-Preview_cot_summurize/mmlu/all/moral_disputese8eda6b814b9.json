                    "text": "Let's see what this \"greater moral evil rule\" is all about according to Arthur. So, the options are:\n\nA. People can keep their earnings only if there's no way for them to prevent a greater evil by giving them away.\n\nB. Being rich is a great moral evil, and we should all aim for a moderate income.\n\nC. Two moral evils don't make a moral good.\n\nD. Morality itself is a great evil.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. First, I need to understand what Arthur is trying to say with this rule. It seems like it's related to ethics and maybe how we should handle our resources in relation to moral issues.\n\nOption A suggests that people are only entitled to keep their earnings if giving them away couldn't prevent a greater evil. That sounds like it's about the responsibility we have with our wealth. If we can use our money to prevent something really bad from happening, maybe we ought to do that instead of keeping it for ourselves.\n\nOption B says that being rich is a great moral evil and we should all live on a moderate income. That seems like a statement about the morality of wealth itself. It suggests that having too much is wrong and that we should aim for moderation.\n\nOption C is a general moral principle that says you can't justify a good action by combining two evils. It's like saying, \"two wrongs don't make a right.\"\n\nOption D is pretty extreme; it says that morality itself is a great evil. That would mean that following moral rules is bad, which seems contrary to what most ethical theories propose.\n\nGiven these options, I need to think about which one best captures Arthur's \"greater moral evil rule.\" Let me consider the context in which this rule might be applied.\n\nIf it's about how we should use our resources in the face of moral evils, then option A seems relevant. It's about using one's earnings to prevent greater evils, suggesting that keeping your earnings might be morally impermissible if doing so allows a greater evil to occur.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, makes a broader claim about the morality of being rich. It suggests that richness itself is evil, regardless of how it's acquired or used. That seems like a different claim from option A, which is more about the use of earnings in relation to preventing evils.\n\nOption C is a general moral principle that doesn't seem directly related to the handling of earnings or wealth. It's more about the logic of moral justifications.\n\nOption D is quite radical and doesn't align with typical moral reasoning.\n\nConsidering this, I think option A is the most directly related to a \"greater moral evil rule.\" It suggests that our entitlement to keep what we've earned is conditional upon not being able to prevent a greater evil by giving it away. In other words, if giving away our earnings could prevent a significant moral wrong, we have a moral obligation to do so.\n\nThis seems consistent with some ethical theories that emphasize the duty to help others, especially when it's within our power to prevent harm. For example, Peter Singer's drowning child analogy argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable significance, we ought to do so.\n\nSo, in this case, Arthur's \"greater moral evil rule\" likely corresponds to option A: people are entitled to keep their earnings only if there's no way for them to prevent a greater evil by giving them away.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
