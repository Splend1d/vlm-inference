                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about additional terms in contract acceptances between merchants. So, the question is asking which statement is NOT true regarding additional terms proposed in the acceptance. We're dealing with merchants here, so we should consider the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), particularly Article 2, which governs sales between merchants.\n\nOption A says: \"They become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement.\" This sounds familiar. Under the UCC, additional terms in an acceptance by a merchant don't necessarily kill the contract; instead, they can become part of the contract unless certain conditions are met. One of those conditions is if the additional terms materially alter the agreement. So, if the extra terms change the essence of what was offered, they might not be incorporated into the contract. Therefore, this seems like a true statement.\n\nOption B claims: \"Additional terms always become part of the contract.\" Hmm, this seems too absolute. From what I recall, not all additional terms automatically bind the parties. There must be some limitations, like if they materially alter the agreement or if the offeror objects. So, this might not be true.\n\nOption C states: \"They become part of the contract unless the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer.\" This aligns with the UCC provisions. If the offer specifies that acceptance must be exactly as offered, without additions, then extra terms won't become part of the contract. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption D says: \"They become part of the contract unless the offeror objects within a reasonable time to the additional terms.\" Again, this matches the UCC's approach. Even if additional terms are included in the acceptance, they can still be part of the contract unless the offeror timely objects to them.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems to be the one that's not true because it asserts that additional terms always become part of the contract, without considering the possible limitations mentioned in the other options.\n\nTo double-check, let's recall the UCC Section 2-207, which deals with additional terms in acceptances between merchants. It provides that additional terms become part of the contract unless:\n\n1. The offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer.\n\n2. The additional terms materially alter the offer.\n\n3. The offeror objects to the additional terms within a reasonable time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B, as it doesn't account for these exceptions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
