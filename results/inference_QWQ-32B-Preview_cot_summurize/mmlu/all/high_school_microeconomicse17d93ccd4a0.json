                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics question. I need to figure out which option causes the supply curve of paper to shift to the left. Shifting to the left means that at any given price, less paper is supplied. So, I need to identify which of these options would lead to a decrease in the supply of paper.\n\nOption A says: \"Paper producers expect lower paper prices in the months ahead.\" Hmm, if producers expect lower prices in the future, they might try to sell more now while prices are higher. That sounds like it would increase the current supply, which would shift the supply curve to the right, not left. So, A doesn't seem to be the answer.\n\nOption B: \"The price of pencils, a complement to paper, increases.\" Complements are goods that are used together, like paper and pencils. If the price of pencils goes up, people might buy less of both pencils and paper. But this affects demand, not supply. So, this seems like it would shift the demand curve, not the supply curve. Therefore, B isn't the correct choice.\n\nOption C: \"Improvements in the technology used to produce paper.\" Improved technology usually makes production more efficient, which should increase supply. That would shift the supply curve to the right, not left. So, C doesn't fit the question.\n\nOption D: \"Environmental concerns reduce the yearly amount of timber that can be harvested.\" Paper is made from timber, so if less timber is available due to environmental restrictions, that would limit the amount of paper that can be produced. This directly reduces the supply of paper at every price level, causing the supply curve to shift to the left.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be D. Environmental concerns reducing the yearly amount of timber that can be harvested would shift the supply curve of paper to the left because less raw material is available for production.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
