                    "text": "So I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure out the total increase in England's real GDP based on Tiger Woods buying a golf ball for $1, and the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) in England is 0.75. The options are $1, $1.25, $1.75, or $4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what marginal propensity to consume means. MPC is the fraction of additional income that a person or economy spends on consumption. So, if MPC is 0.75, that means for every extra dollar earned, 75 cents are spent on goods and services.\n\nNow, Tiger Woods buys a golf ball for $1. This is an initial expenditure of $1 in England. But because of the MPC, this initial spending can lead to more spending in the economy, creating a multiplier effect.\n\nThe multiplier effect amplifies the initial spending throughout the economy as the money circulates. The formula to calculate the multiplier is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\text{MPC}} \\]\n\nGiven that MPC is 0.75, plugging that in:\n\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.75} = \\frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, the multiplier is 4.\n\nNext, to find the total increase in real GDP, I need to multiply the initial expenditure by the multiplier:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total increase in GDP} = \\text{Initial expenditure} \\times \\text{Multiplier} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Total increase in GDP} = \\$1 \\times 4 = \\$4 \\]\n\nWait, but let's make sure I understand this correctly. The multiplier being 4 means that the initial $1 spent by Tiger Woods will lead to a total increase in GDP of $4. But is there more to consider here?\n\nLet me think about how the multiplier works. When Tiger Woods spends $1 on a golf ball, the seller of the golf ball now has an extra $1. Assuming the MPC is 0.75, the seller will spend 75 cents of that extra dollar on something else, say another good or service in England.\n\nThat 75-cent expenditure becomes income for someone else, who then spends 75% of that, which is 56.25 cents, and so on. This process continues, with each subsequent expenditure being a fraction of the previous one.\n\nSo, the total increase in GDP is the sum of all these expenditures:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total increase} = \\$1 + \\$0.75 + \\$0.5625 + \\$0.421875 + \\dots \\]\n\nThis is an infinite geometric series where the first term is $1 and the common ratio is 0.75.\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} \\]\n\nWhere \\( a \\) is the first term and \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.75} = \\frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, again, the total increase is $4.\n\nBut let's consider if there are any limitations or other factors I should be aware of in this scenario. For example, is all of the expenditure staying within England? If some of the spending leaks out to other countries, that could affect the multiplier.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't mention any leaks or constraints, so I'll assume that all spending stays within England.\n\nAlso, is there any mention of the marginal propensity to save (MPS)? Well, MPS is 1 - MPC, which in this case is 0.25, but since we're focusing on consumption, and the multiplier is based on MPC, I think we're okay.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether this initial expenditure is part of net exports or not, since Tiger Woods is buying something in England, but he might be from another country. However, the problem states that he buys a golf ball in England, so presumably, this is part of England's consumption expenditure.\n\nGiven that, I think the straightforward approach is correct: initial expenditure of $1 multiplied by the multiplier of 4 equals $4.\n\nLooking back at the options, $4 is option D.\n\nBut wait, option C is $1.75, which is 1 + 0.75 + 0.75^2 = 1 + 0.75 + 0.5625 = 2.3125, which is not matching. Option B is $1.25, which might be 1 + 0.25, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption A is $1, which would only account for the initial expenditure without considering the multiplier effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D, $4.\n\nHowever, let me double-check if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose that the MPC is 0.75, but perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, like using the expenditure multiplier in GDP calculations.\n\nThe formula for GDP in the expenditure approach is:\n\n\\[ \\text{GDP} = C + I + G + (X - M) \\]\n\nWhere C is consumption, I is investment, G is government spending, and (X - M) is net exports.\n\nIn this case, Tiger Woods' purchase of a golf ball is part of consumption (C), specifically autonomous consumption since it's an initial expenditure.\n\nGiven that, the multiplier effect would apply to this autonomous expenditure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they're expecting to use the concept of the spending multiplier, which is the same as what I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through the Keynesian spending multiplier:\n\n\\[ \\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\text{MPC}} \\]\n\nWhich again gives 4.\n\nSo, multiplying the initial expenditure by the multiplier gives $4.\n\nAlternatively, if there was information about other components like investment or government spending, but there isn't, so I think sticking with the consumption approach is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, I believe the total increase in England's real GDP resulting from Mr. Woods' purchase is $4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
