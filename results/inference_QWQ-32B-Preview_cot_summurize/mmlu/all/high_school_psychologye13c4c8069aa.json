                    "text": "I'm going to take a shot at this question about Harlow's monkey experiment. So, Harlow was a psychologist who did some famous studies with rhesus monkeys, right? I think he was looking at attachment behaviors in infants. Let me see what each option is saying.\n\nOption A says \"the importance of physical contact to development.\" I recall that in Harlow's experiments, he had these surrogate mothers made of different materials, like wire and cloth, and the baby monkeys preferred the cloth ones because they were softer and more comforting. So, physical contact seemed really important for their emotional development. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption B says \"that language is a uniquely human skill.\" Hmm, I don't think Harlow's monkey experiments were about language. His studies were more focused on attachment and comfort-seeking behaviors. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption C says \"that primates can make and use tools.\" Again, I don't think that was the focus of Harlow's experiments. Tool use in primates was more associated with researchers like Jane Goodall, who observed chimps using sticks to fish for termites. So, this doesn't seem directly related to Harlow's work.\n\nOption D says \"the danger of separating babies from their natural parents.\" While Harlow's experiments did involve separating baby monkeys from their biological mothers to study attachment, I think the main finding was about the type of attachment rather than the general danger of separation. Although separation is a part of it, I think the core finding was about the need for comfort and physical contact.\n\nLet me double-check. Harlow's experiments showed that baby monkeys would prefer a surrogate mother that provided comfort over one that provided food. This suggested that the comfort and tactile stimulation were crucial for their development, more so than just the\u6ee1\u8db3\u57fa\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u5982\u98df\u7269\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u9009\u9879A\u662f\u6700\u7b26\u5408\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u9009\u9879D\u4e5f\u63d0\u5230\u4e86\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u4e3b\u8981\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u8bf4\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8bf4\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u4f9d\u604b\u5bf9\u5a74\u513f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u5728\u4ed6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6709\u98df\u7269\u4f9b\u5e94\u7684\u94c1\u4e1d\u6bcd\u4f53\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u591f\u67d4\u8f6f\u548c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\uff0c\u5c0f\u7334\u5b50\u4eec\u8fd8\u662f\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u90a3\u4e2a\u53ea\u6709\u8212\u9002\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u98df\u7269\u7684\u5e03\u8d28\u6bcd\u4f53\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9A\uff0c\u5373\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u5bf9\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0e\u54c8\u6d1b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u8212\u9002\u63a5\u89e6\u5728\u5a74\u5e7c\u513f\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
