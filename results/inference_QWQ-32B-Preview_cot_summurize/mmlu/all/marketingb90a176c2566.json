Direct marketing. B. Personal selling. C. Sales promotions. D. Advertising.\n\nHmm, let's see. I need to figure out which one of these is about using interpersonal communications to develop positive feelings and stimulate behavior.\n\nFirst, what does \"interpersonal communications\" mean? It's about communication between people, right? Like, one person talking to another or interacting directly.\n\nSo, option A is direct marketing. I think direct marketing is when companies send advertisements directly to potential customers, maybe via mail, email, or phone. It is interpersonal in a way because it's targeted at specific individuals, but is it primarily about developing positive feelings and stimulating behavior through communication?\n\nOption B is personal selling. That sounds like when a salesperson talks directly to a customer, maybe in person or over the phone, to sell a product or service. This seems more about direct interaction between people, which is interpersonal communication. The salesperson would probably try to develop a positive relationship with the customer to encourage them to buy.\n\nOption C is sales promotions. I think this includes things like discounts, coupons, contests, etc., aimed at promoting sales. It's more about incentives rather than interpersonal communication, right? So, maybe not the best fit here.\n\nOption D is advertising. Advertising can be through various media like TV, online, billboards, etc. It's broader and not necessarily interpersonal since it's often one-way communication from the advertiser to the audience.\n\nSo, comparing these, personal selling (option B) seems to align best with the description because it involves direct, interpersonal communication aimed at developing positive feelings and stimulating purchasing behavior.\n\nBut let me double-check. Direct marketing (option A) is also direct, but it might not always involve personal communication. For example, an automated email isn't really interpersonal; it's more like a mass message sent individually. Whereas personal selling typically involves some level of personal interaction and relationship building.\n\nSales promotions (option C) are more about incentives and deals, which can stimulate behavior but aren't primarily about interpersonal communication.\n\nAdvertising (option D) is about broadcasting messages to a wide audience, again not necessarily interpersonal.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. Personal selling.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
