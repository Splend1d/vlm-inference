                    "text": "So I've got this question here about accumulated depreciation, and I need to figure out which explanation would most likely satisfy an auditor who's questioning management about significant debits to these accounts in the current year. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what accumulated depreciation is. Accumulated depreciation is a contra-asset account that records the cumulative depreciation of plant assets over their useful lives. It's essentially the total amount of wear and tear that has been written off against the original cost of the assets.\n\nNow, the auditor is questioning significant debits to this account in the current year. Debits to accumulated depreciation would decrease its balance, which is unusual because accumulated depreciation typically increases over time as depreciation expenses are added to it each period.\n\nSo, why would there be significant debits to accumulated depreciation? Let's look at each option:\n\nOption A: Prior years\u2019 depreciation expenses were erroneously understated.\n\nIf prior years\u2019 depreciation was understated, that means the company didn't record enough depreciation in those years. To correct this, they might need to make an adjustment by debiting accumulated depreciation to reduce its balance. This could be a possible reason for significant debits.\n\nOption B: Current year\u2019s depreciation expense was erroneously understated.\n\nIf the current year\u2019s depreciation was understated, you'd expect the company to record a higher depreciation expense, which would credit accumulated depreciation, increasing its balance, not debit it. So this doesn't seem to fit the scenario of significant debits to accumulated depreciation.\n\nOption C: The estimated remaining useful lives of plant assets were revised upward.\n\nRevising the remaining useful lives upward means the assets are expected to last longer than previously thought. This would decrease the annual depreciation expense because the remaining book value is spread over a longer period. However, this typically doesn't involve debiting accumulated depreciation directly. Instead, it affects future depreciation expenses.\n\nOption D: Plant assets were retired during the current year.\n\nWhen plant assets are retired, the company removes the asset and its accumulated depreciation from the books. This is done by debiting accumulated depreciation and crediting the asset account for their respective balances. So, retiring plant assets would indeed result in debits to accumulated depreciation.\n\nBoth options A and D seem plausible, but I need to determine which one would most likely satisfy the auditor.\n\nLet's think about this. If prior years\u2019 depreciation was understated, correcting that would require adjusting the accumulated depreciation balance, which could involve debiting it to reduce the balance. However, such corrections are usually done through prior period adjustments, which affect retained earnings.\n\nOn the other hand, retiring plant assets is a regular business event that directly results in debits to accumulated depreciation. It's a more straightforward and common transaction.\n\nAdditionally, significant debits to accumulated depreciation due to asset retirements would be expected and easily explainable, whereas debits for correcting prior years\u2019 errors might raise more questions about the accuracy of previous financial statements.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option D, plant assets were retired during the current year, is the explanation that most likely would satisfy the auditor. It provides a clear and normal business reason for the debits to accumulated depreciation.\n\nTo confirm, let's recall the journal entry for retiring plant assets:\n\n- Debit Accumulated Depreciation for the accumulated depreciation balance of the asset.\n\n- Debit Loss on Disposal (if applicable) or credit Gain on Disposal (if applicable).\n\n- Credit the Asset account for its original cost.\n\nThis directly results in a debit to accumulated depreciation, which aligns with the scenario presented.\n\nOption A, while possible, seems less straightforward and more likely to\u5f15\u8d77 further inquiry from the auditor regarding the accuracy of prior period financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. Plant assets were retired during the current year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
