The options are 20, 21, 22, or 25 words per minute.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what typing speed means. Typing speed is usually measured in words per minute (wpm), which tells us how many words someone can type in one minute.\n\nSo, if Marshall needs to type 550 words in 25 minutes, I can calculate the required typing speed by dividing the total number of words by the total time available.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nRequired typing speed = Total words / Total time\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nRequired typing speed = 550 words / 25 minutes\n\nNow, let's do the division:\n\n550 divided by 25 is 22.\n\nSo, 550 / 25 = 22 words per minute.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that.\n\n25 times 22 is 550, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, Marshall needs to type at least 22 words per minute to finish 550 words in 25 minutes.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 20 wpm\n\nB. 21 wpm\n\nC. 22 wpm\n\nD. 25 wpm\n\nOption C is 22 wpm, which is exactly what the calculation shows.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if he types faster than 22 wpm, would that be better? Yes, but the question is asking for the least speed required, meaning the minimum speed he must maintain to finish on time.\n\nSo, the least speed is 22 wpm.\n\nBut let me think about this again. If he types at 22 wpm for 25 minutes, he will type exactly 550 words, which is what he needs.\n\nIf he types at 21 wpm, let's see what happens.\n\n21 wpm times 25 minutes is 525 words.\n\nBut he has 550 words to type, so 525 is less than 550. That means he won't finish on time if he types at 21 wpm.\n\nSimilarly, 20 wpm times 25 minutes is 500 words, which is even less.\n\n25 wpm times 25 minutes is 625 words, which is more than enough, but the question is asking for the least speed required.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 22 wpm, which is option C.\n\nWait, but the question says \"at least how fast must Marshall type,\" which implies that he needs to type no slower than a certain speed, which we've calculated as 22 wpm.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some contexts, \"at least\" means the minimum required, so 22 wpm or faster.\n\nBut among the options, 22 wpm is listed, and that's the exact speed needed.\n\nBut perhaps there's a trick here. Maybe he needs to type a bit faster to account for pauses or mistakes, but the question doesn't specify any of that. It's a straightforward calculation based on the given numbers.\n\nSo, sticking to the math, he needs to type 22 wpm to finish 550 words in 25 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 22 words per minute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
