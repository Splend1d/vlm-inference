                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Moore's philosophy. So, the question is: According to Moore, \u201cpleasure is good\u201d means the same thing as which of the options provided? Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what G.E. Moore, the philosopher, said about pleasure and goodness. Moore is known for his non-naturalist ethical theory, particularly his defense of ethical intuitionism. In his book \"Principia Ethica,\" he discusses the nature of goodness and argues that it is a simple, non-natural property that cannot be defined in terms of natural properties like pleasure, desire, or evolution.\n\nOne of Moore's key points is that goodness is indefinable because it is a simple quality, like yellow or sweetness, which cannot be broken down into more basic components. He criticizes what he calls the \"naturalistic fallacy,\" which is the mistake of defining goodness in terms of natural properties.\n\nNow, regarding pleasure, Moore does consider pleasure to be good, but he is careful to distinguish between pleasure and goodness itself. He argues that pleasure is a good thing, but it is not identical to goodness. So, when he says \"pleasure is good,\" he means that pleasure has intrinsic value, but he doesn't equate it directly with the concept of goodness.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. \u201cpleasure is desired.\u201d\n\nThis seems related to desire, but Moore would likely distinguish between what is desired and what is good. He thought that people often desire things that are not good and vice versa. So, equating \"pleasure is good\" with \"pleasure is desired\" might not align with Moore's views.\n\nB. \u201cpleasure is pleasant.\u201d\n\nThis seems tautological because pleasure is already pleasant by definition. However, Moore might argue that goodness is distinct from the pleasantness of pleasure. So, this option might not capture what he means by \"pleasure is good.\"\n\nC. \u201cwe desire to desire pleasure.\u201d\n\nThis seems to involve second-order desires,\u5373 desires about our desires. Moore might not see a direct connection between desiring to desire pleasure and the goodness of pleasure. His focus is more on the intrinsic value of pleasure rather than on desires about desires.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nGiven that none of the options A, B, or C seem to capture Moore's view accurately, this might be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look back at Moore's actual words to confirm. In \"Principia Ethica,\" Moore discusses the notion of goodness and pleasurable experiences. He argues that pleasure is one of the things that are good in themselves.\n\nMoore introduces the \"open question argument,\" which suggests that no naturalistic definition of goodness can be adequate because it is always an open question whether the proposed definition captures the moral property of goodness. For example, even if something is pleasurable, it is still meaningful to ask whether it is good.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Moore would not equate \"pleasure is good\" with any of the options A, B, or C, because he maintains that goodness is a distinct, non-natural property.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely D. none of the above.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if any of the options might indirectly relate to Moore's view.\n\nOption A: \"pleasure is desired.\" Moore does discuss the relationship between desire and good, but he is careful to point out that desire is not the same as goodness. He argues that good things are not good because they are desired; rather, they are desired because they are good.\n\nOption B: \"pleasure is pleasant.\" This seems almost redundant, as pleasure is pleasant by definition. However, Moore's point is that even if something is pleasant, that doesn't fully capture its goodness.\n\nOption C: \"we desire to desire pleasure.\" This seems to involve meta-desires, or desires about our desires. Moore's focus is more on the intrinsic value of pleasure itself, rather than on desires about desiring pleasure.\n\nTherefore, none of these options accurately capture what Moore means by \"pleasure is good,\" which is that pleasure has intrinsic value as a good thing, distinct from natural properties like being desired or being pleasant.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. none of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
