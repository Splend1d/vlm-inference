So, the question is: \"____________________ is the anticipation of unauthorized access or break into computers or data by means of wireless networks.\" And the options are:\n\nA. Wireless access\n\nB. Wireless security\n\nC. Wired Security\n\nD. Wired device apps\n\nHmm, let's see. So, it's asking for something that anticipates unauthorized access via wireless networks. That sounds a lot like security measures designed to protect against such breaches.\n\nOption A, \"Wireless access,\" that seems more about providing access rather than protecting against unauthorized access. So, probably not that.\n\nOption B, \"Wireless security,\" that directly relates to protecting wireless networks from unauthorized access. That sounds promising.\n\nOption C, \"Wired Security,\" that seems to be about security measures for wired networks, not wireless ones. So, maybe not the best fit.\n\nOption D, \"Wired device apps,\" that sounds like applications for devices that are connected via wired connections, not related to security or wireless access.\n\nSo, between these options, \"Wireless security\" seems to be the most appropriate choice. It makes sense because security in wireless networks is all about preventing unauthorized access and protecting the data transmitted over those networks.\n\nLet me just double-check. Anticipation of unauthorized access means being proactive about security, perhaps implementing measures to detect or prevent such access. Wireless security encompasses techniques and technologies designed to do exactly that.\n\nFor example, using encryption, setting up firewalls, implementing access controls, and monitoring network traffic are all part of wireless security to prevent break-ins and unauthorized access.\n\nOn the other hand, \"wireless access\" is more about providing the ability to connect to the network wirelessly, without necessarily focusing on security.\n\n\"Wired security\" would be more relevant to Ethernet-based networks, not wireless ones.\n\nAnd \"wired device apps\" seem entirely unrelated to security or wireless access.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wireless security.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
