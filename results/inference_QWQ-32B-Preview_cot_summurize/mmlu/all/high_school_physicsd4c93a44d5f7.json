The weight of an object is determined by the gravitational force exerted on it by the planet or moon it's on. The formula for gravitational force is given by:\n\n\\[ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( F \\) is the gravitational force (weight),\n\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n\n- \\( m_1 \\) is the mass of the object,\n\n- \\( m_2 \\) is the mass of the celestial body,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the celestial body.\n\nGiven that the mass of the moon is \\( \\frac{1}{80} \\) that of the Earth, and its radius is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) that of the Earth, we can set up a ratio to find the weight of the box on the moon relative to its weight on Earth.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( m_e \\) as the mass of the Earth,\n\n- \\( r_e \\) as the radius of the Earth,\n\n- \\( m_m = \\frac{1}{80} m_e \\) as the mass of the moon,\n\n- \\( r_m = \\frac{1}{4} r_e \\) as the radius of the moon,\n\n- \\( w_e = 80 \\, \\text{N} \\) as the weight of the box on Earth,\n\n- \\( w_m \\) as the weight of the box on the moon.\n\nFirst, we can express the weight on Earth:\n\n\\[ w_e = G \\frac{m \\cdot m_e}{r_e^2} = 80 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the weight on the moon is:\n\n\\[ w_m = G \\frac{m \\cdot m_m}{r_m^2} = G \\frac{m \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{80} m_e \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{1}{4} r_e \\right)^2} \\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n\\[ w_m = G \\frac{m \\cdot \\frac{1}{80} m_e}{\\frac{1}{16} r_e^2} = G \\frac{m \\cdot \\frac{1}{80} m_e}{\\frac{1}{16} r_e^2} = G \\frac{m \\cdot m_e}{80} \\cdot \\frac{16}{r_e^2} = \\frac{16}{80} G \\frac{m \\cdot m_e}{r_e^2} \\]\n\nNotice that \\( G \\frac{m \\cdot m_e}{r_e^2} = w_e = 80 \\, \\text{N} \\), so:\n\n\\[ w_m = \\frac{16}{80} \\times 80 \\, \\text{N} = 16 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nTherefore, the weight of the box on the moon is 16 N.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{16 \\, \\text{N}} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\nc) 16 N"
