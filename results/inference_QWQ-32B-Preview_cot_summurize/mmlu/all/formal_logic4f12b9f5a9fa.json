B \u2283 W\n\nB. W \u2283 B\n\nC. B \u2261 W\n\nD. Both A and B\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each letter represents. I assume \"B\" stands for \"Beth rides her bike\" and \"W\" stands for \"she gets to work earlier.\" So, the sentence is \"If B, then W.\"\n\nIn propositional logic, \"if P, then Q\" is represented by P \u2283 Q. So, following that, \"If Beth rides her bike, then she gets to work earlier\" should be B \u2283 W, which is option A.\n\nBut let's look at option B: W \u2283 B. That would mean \"If she gets to work earlier, then Beth rides her bike.\" That's not the same as the original sentence. The original sentence is about riding a bike leading to getting to work earlier, not the other way around.\n\nOption C is B \u2261 W, which means \"B if and only if W.\" That would be \"Beth rides her bike if and only if she gets to work earlier.\" That's different from the original sentence, which only talks about one direction.\n\nOption D says both A and B, but as we saw, B is not equivalent to the original sentence.\n\nSo, the best symbolization should be A. B \u2283 W.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Is there any way that W could be affected by B in a different way? For example, are there other factors that could cause W without B? Well, the sentence says \"if B, then W,\" but it doesn't say that B is the only way to W. So, it's possible that there are other ways to get to work earlier, but if Beth rides her bike, that guarantees she gets to work earlier.\n\nIn logic, \"if P, then Q\" doesn't imply that P is the only way to Q; it just says that P guarantees Q.\n\nSo, again, A seems to be the correct choice.\n\nLet me consider if there's any ambiguity in the sentence. The sentence is pretty straightforward: it's a simple conditional statement. There are no exceptions mentioned, and it's not expressing equivalence or biconditional relationship.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization is A. B \u2283 W.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
