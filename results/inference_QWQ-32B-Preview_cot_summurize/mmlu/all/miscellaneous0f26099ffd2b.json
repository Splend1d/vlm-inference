Chordates, C. Invertebrates, D. Echinoderms.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these groups is known for.\n\nStarting with mollusks. I think mollusks are a type of invertebrate. Like snails, clams, and octopuses. I don't think they have backbones. So, maybe A isn't the right answer.\n\nNext, chordates. I remember that chordates are animals that have a notochord at some point in their development. And in more advanced chordates, like vertebrates, this notochord develops into a backbone. So, chordates could have backbones and spinal cords. That seems promising.\n\nThen, invertebrates. The term \"invertebrate\" basically means without a backbone. So, if an animal is an invertebrate, it doesn't have a backbone. Therefore, C might not be the correct answer.\n\nLastly, echinoderms. These are things like sea stars and sea urchins. I don't think they have backbones either. So, D might not be the right choice.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"may have a backbone and a spinal cord.\" So, it's not definite, just possible. That makes me think about chordates again because while not all chordates have backbones (like some marine invertebrates), many do.\n\nAlso, considering that vertebrates are a subgroup of chordates, which have backbones and spinal cords, perhaps B is the best answer.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nMollusks are invertebrates, so no backbone.\n\nChordates can have backbones, especially vertebrates.\n\nInvertebrates, by definition, do not have backbones.\n\nEchinoderms are also invertebrates, so no backbone.\n\nTherefore, the only group among these options that may have animals with backbones and spinal cords is chordates.\n\nI think the answer is B. Chordates.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
