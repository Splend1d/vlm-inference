The genius of Napoleon is astounding. All branches of human knowledge seemed alike familiar to his gigantic mind. His conversations at St. Helena, scattered through the numerous and voluminous memorials of those who gleaned them, are replete with intensest interest. During the long agony of his imprisonment and his death, he conversed with perfect freedom upon the events of his marvelous career, and upon all those subjects or morals, politics, and religion, which most deeply concern the welfare of our race. There is no mind which will not be invigorated by familiarity with these profound thoughts, expressed with so much glow of feeling and energy of diction.\n\u2014John S. C.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage about Napoleon from 1855. The author, John S. C. Abbott, seems really impressed by Napoleon's genius and talents. He talks about how Napoleon's mind was vast and how his conversations were full of interesting and profound thoughts. The author believes that engaging with Napoleon's ideas would be beneficial and invigorating for anyone.\n\nNow, the question is asking which action of Napoleon the author seems to be ignoring the hypocrisy of, given his praise for Napoleon's high-mindedness. So, we need to look at each option and see which one might contradict or show hypocrisy in light of the author's admiration.\n\nOption A is about Napoleon's invasion of Haiti to stop a slave revolt there. If the author is praising Napoleon's genius and his thoughts on morals and politics, ignoring the hypocrisy of invading a place to suppress a slave revolt might be relevant because it involves issues of freedom and equality, which are moral and political topics.\n\nOption B is about the creation of the Napoleonic Code. This code was a set of legal reforms that had a significant impact on many European countries. It's generally seen as a positive step towards codifying laws and promoting legal consistency. So, it might not be the best candidate for showing hypocrisy, unless there's a specific aspect that contradicts Napoleon's stated principles.\n\nOption C is about promoting soldiers and government workers based on merit only. This seems like a positive attribute, aligning with the idea of meritocracy and fairness. Again, it's hard to see hypocrisy here unless there's evidence that Napoleon didn't practice what he preached.\n\nOption D is about Napoleon's conquest of Europe and his use of the Continental System. The Continental System was an attempt to cut off trade between Britain and the rest of Europe, which had significant economic and political implications. This could be seen as hypocritical if Napoleon was espousing ideas of freedom and independence while imposing his will on other nations.\n\nGiven the context, I think options A and D are the most likely to show hypocrisy. Option A because suppressing a slave revolt goes against principles of freedom and equality, which the author mentions Napoleon discussed. Option D because conquering Europe and imposing the Continental System might contradict any statements Napoleon made about respecting the sovereignty of other nations or promoting liberty.\n\nBetween A and D, I think option A is stronger because it directly involves moral issues related to slavery, which is a more profound contradiction to discussions on morals and welfare of the race. However, both could be valid, but perhaps A is more clearly hypocritical.\n\nSo, I would go with option A: The invasion of Haiti to stop a slave revolt there.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
