                    "text": "I've got this question here about securing a jury trial in a patent infringement case. So, the patent holder wants a jury trial because they think a jury would be more sympathetic to their claims against the licensee. They've asked their lawyer to make sure they get a jury trial. Now, I need to figure out what the lawyer should do to secure that right.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. File and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand.\n\nB. File and serve a jury trial demand within 30 days after the close of the pleadings.\n\nC. File and serve a jury trial demand at the close of discovery.\n\nD. Make a jury trial demand at the initial pretrial conference.\n\nFirst, I need to recall when and how a party requests a jury trial in federal court. I remember that in federal court, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern the process.\n\nLooking at Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38, it talks about the right to a jury trial. Rule 38(a) says that \"A party who claims a right to a jury trial must demand it in writing in the party\u2019s initial pleading on the merits that relates to the claim for which the jury is sought.\" So, the initial pleading would typically be the complaint.\n\nBut option A says to file and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand. Well, if the complaint already includes the demand, then that should be sufficient, right? But perhaps the complaint has already been filed without a jury demand, and now they need to make one.\n\nWait, the question says that the patent holder brought a patent infringement action in federal court, so presumably, the complaint has already been filed. So, maybe the complaint already includes a jury demand, or maybe it doesn't.\n\nBut let's assume that the complaint was filed without a jury demand, and now they want to make one. What's the procedure for that?\n\nRule 38(b) says that \"A party may file a demand for a jury trial separately from other filings, but must serve it on all parties and file it with the court within 14 days after service of the last pleading directed to the issue.\" So, it seems like there's a specific time frame for filing a jury demand.\n\nBut option B says to file and serve a jury trial demand within 30 days after the close of the pleadings. That doesn't match with Rule 38(b), which says 14 days after service of the last pleading directed to the issue.\n\nOption C suggests filing and serving the jury trial demand at the close of discovery. Discovery is much later in the litigation process, and according to Rule 38, the demand needs to be made sooner.\n\nOption D says to make a jury trial demand at the initial pretrial conference. Again, that's even later in the process.\n\nSo, based on Rule 38, it seems like the demand should be included in the initial pleading or filed separately within 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue.\n\nBut looking back at option A, it says to file and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand. If the complaint already includes the demand, that should be fine. But if not, then perhaps the lawyer needs to file a separate demand within the specified time.\n\nWait, the question is a bit unclear about whether the complaint already includes the jury demand or not. It just says that the patent holder asked the lawyer to obtain a jury trial.\n\nAssuming that the complaint hasn't yet included a jury demand, what should the lawyer do?\n\nAccording to Rule 38(b), the lawyer should file a separate demand for a jury trial within 14 days after the service of the last pleading directed to the issue.\n\nBut none of the options mention 14 days. Option B says 30 days after the close of pleadings, which seems too late.\n\nOption C says at the close of discovery, which is even later.\n\nOption D says at the initial pretrial conference, which is also later.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is option A: file and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand. But if the complaint has already been filed without a jury demand, then this might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lawyer can file an amended complaint that includes the jury demand.\n\nWait, Rule 38(b) also says that \"A party may file a demand separately from other filings.\" So, the lawyer can file a separate paper titled \"Demand for Jury Trial\" within the specified time.\n\nBut according to Rule 38(b), it's within 14 days after service of the last pleading directed to the issue.\n\nI think the \"close of pleadings\" might refer to the end of the pleading stage, which is typically when the last pleading has been filed.\n\nBut the Federal Rules don't define \"close of pleadings\" specifically in this context.\n\nIn practice, the pleadings usually consist of the complaint, any answers, and any replies.\n\nSo, perhaps the \"last pleading directed to the issue\" would be the answer or reply.\n\nBut again, Rule 38(b) says 14 days after service of the last pleading directed to the issue.\n\nGiven that, option B suggests 30 days after the close of pleadings, which seems too generous compared to the 14-day requirement in Rule 38(b).\n\nOption C suggests at the close of discovery, which is much later.\n\nOption D suggests at the initial pretrial conference, which is also later.\n\nSo, none of these options perfectly match Rule 38(b)'s 14-day requirement.\n\nPerhaps the question is assuming that the complaint has already been filed, and now the lawyer needs to make a jury demand separately.\n\nIn that case, the correct procedure would be to file a separate demand within 14 days after the service of the last pleading directed to the issue.\n\nBut since option B says 30 days after the close of pleadings, which is longer than 14 days, it might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different rule for patent cases.\n\nLooking at the Judiciary Patent and Plant Variety Protection Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(c), it provides that in patent infringement actions, the defendant may, in lieu of answering or moving under this section, file a written demand for a jury trial.\n\nBut that seems to pertain to the defendant's right, not the plaintiff's.\n\nWait, Rule 38(a) applies to any party who claims a right to a jury trial, so both\u539f\u544a\u548c\u88ab\u544a\u3002\n\nBut in patent cases, there might be specific rules.\n\nLooking at Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38(d), it says that \"If a party timely requests a jury on any issue triable of right by a jury, the action shall be tried by a jury unless the party requesting a jury waives the jury in writing and the court so orders.\"\n\nSo, in patent cases, which are typically civil actions, the right to a jury trial applies to issues of fact, unless waived.\n\nBut again, the timing is crucial.\n\nPerhaps the lawyer needs to ensure that the jury demand is made within the time prescribed by the rules.\n\nGiven that, option A seems too early if the complaint has already been filed without a jury demand.\n\nOption B is too late, as it's 30 days after the close of pleadings, which is beyond the 14-day period specified in Rule 38(b).\n\nOption C is at the close of discovery, which is even later.\n\nOption D is at the initial pretrial conference, which is also later.\n\nSo, perhaps none of these options are correct, but among them, option A is the closest, assuming that the complaint includes the jury demand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lawyer needs to file a separate demand within 14 days after the last pleading, but since that's not an option, perhaps the best available choice is option A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lawyer needs to move to amend the complaint to include a jury demand, but that's not among the options.\n\nGiven the options provided, I would choose option A: file and serve a complaint that includes a jury trial demand.\n\nBut honestly, if the complaint has already been filed without a jury demand, this might not be possible, and the lawyer may need to file a separate demand within the time frame specified by the rules.\n\nPerhaps the question expects the answer to be option A, assuming that the complaint includes the jury demand.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
