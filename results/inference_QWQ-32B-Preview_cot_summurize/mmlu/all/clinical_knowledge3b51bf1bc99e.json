                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement is true about Systemic Sclerosis. I know a little bit about it, but I need to recall the facts accurately.\n\nFirst off, systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the connective tissue, leading to hardening and scarring of the skin and internal organs. I remember that it's more common in women than men, so option A says it affects males more than females, which I think is incorrect.\n\nOption B mentions that if telangiectasia are seen, this clinches the diagnosis. Telangiectasia are small dilated blood vessels on the surface of the skin or mucous membranes, often appearing as red or purple spots. While telangiectasia can be seen in systemic sclerosis, I don't think they are definitive for the disease because they can occur in other conditions as well. So, maybe B is not the correct answer.\n\nOption C says arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease. Arachnodactyly refers to long, spider-like fingers and toes, which is more characteristic of Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue disorders, not typically systemic sclerosis. So, I don't think C is correct.\n\nOption D mentions that patients have a beaked-shaped nose and waxy skin. I recall that systemic sclerosis can lead to skin thickening and tightening, which might affect the shape of the nose, but I'm not sure about a \"beaked-shaped\" nose specifically. Also, waxy skin might be a way to describe the thickened, hardened skin in sclerosis, but I need to confirm this.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I should consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Affects males more than females. I believe systemic sclerosis is more common in females, possibly due to hormonal factors. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: Telangiectasia clinches the diagnosis. While telangiectasia can be present in systemic sclerosis, they are also seen in other conditions like rosacea or even as a normal variant in some people. Therefore, they aren't specific enough to confirm the diagnosis on their own.\n\nOption C: Arachnodactyly is a feature. As I mentioned earlier, arachnodactyly is more associated with Marfan syndrome and similar disorders, not systemic sclerosis. So, probably not true.\n\nOption D: Beaked-shaped nose and waxy skin. Systemic sclerosis can cause skin changes, including thickening and tightening, which might lead to a characteristic appearance of the face, including the nose. \"Waxy\" skin might describe the smooth and thickened appearance of the skin in sclerosis. So, this seems more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe none of the above are entirely true, and I need to choose the least incorrect one or consider if there's another aspect I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up some key features of systemic sclerosis to confirm.\n\nSystemic sclerosis, also known as systemic scleroderma, is characterized by fibrosis, vascular alterations, and autoimmune phenomena. It affects more women than men, usually between the ages of 30 and 50.\n\nClinical features include:\n\n- Raynaud's phenomenon (a precursor in many cases)\n\n- Skin changes: swelling, thickening, and tightening\n\n- Gastrointestinal involvement\n\n- Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n- Cardiac and kidney problems\n\nRegarding the skin, it can become thick and hard, giving a waxy appearance. The face may be affected, leading to a mask-like appearance, but I'm not sure about a specifically \"beaked-shaped\" nose. Maybe a more retracted or flattened nasal bridge?\n\nTelangiectasia can be present, but as I thought earlier, they are not specific to systemic sclerosis.\n\nArachnodactyly doesn't seem relevant to this condition.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems closest to being true, but I'm a bit unsure about the \"beaked-shaped\" nose.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps none of the options are entirely accurate, and I need to choose the best available answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\nA: Males more than females. No, females are more affected.\n\nB: Telangiectasia clinches the diagnosis. No, they are not specific enough.\n\nC: Arachnodactyly is a feature. Unlikely, more associated with other conditions.\n\nD: Beaked-shaped nose and waxy skin. Possible, but I question the \"beaked-shaped\" description.\n\nPerhaps the term \"beaked nose\" is not the most accurate description. Maybe it's \"nasal bridge flattening\" or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a typo, and it should be \"boot-shaped\" heart in a different context, but that doesn't make sense here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is that waxy skin is a feature, and the beaked nose is not necessarily a feature, but combined in option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that telangiectasia can be seen, but it doesn't clinch the diagnosis, making option B incorrect.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is D, acknowledging that while the description might not be perfect, it's the closest to being true among the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is that systemic sclerosis affects females more than males, which isn't listed, so none of the above are true.\n\nBut since the question asks \"which of the following is true,\" and option D seems the least incorrect, I might go with D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that telangiectasia can be seen in systemic sclerosis, but it's not definitive for the disease, so option B is partially true, but not entirely.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that telangiectasia can be seen, but it's not specific enough to clinch the diagnosis, so B is not entirely true.\n\nGiven that, and considering the other options, perhaps D is the best answer, despite my reservations about the exact nose description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is that systemic sclerosis affects females more than males, which is option A but stated incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that arachnodactyly is not a feature, making C false.\n\nGiven all that, I think D is the best choice among the options provided, although it's not perfect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
