Synovial hinge joint.\n\nThe elbow is a synovial hinge joint that connects the humerus bone of the upper arm to the radius and ulna bones of the forearm, allowing for flexion and extension movements. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. Ball and socket joint: This type of joint allows for a wide range of motion in multiple planes, such as the shoulder or hip joints.\n\nB. Fused joint: Also known as a synarthrosis, this type of joint allows for little to no movement, such as the joints between the bones in the skull.\n\nD. Plain joint: This term is not standard in anatomy; perhaps you meant \"plane joint\" or \"gliding joint,\" which allows for sliding movements between flat or slightly curved articular surfaces, like the joints between the carpal bones in the wrist.\n\n"
