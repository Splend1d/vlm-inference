                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the weight of an object on the moon compared to its weight on Earth. It says that the weight on the moon, m, is about 1/6 of the object's weight on Earth, e. And I need to find the equation that represents this relationship.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. The problem is asking for an equation that shows how the weight on the moon depends on the weight on Earth. It's giving me four options, and I have to choose the correct one.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. m = 1/6 + e\n\nB. m = e/6\n\nC. m = 6 + e\n\nD. m = 6e\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out which of these equations correctly expresses that the moon weight is one-sixth of the Earth weight.\n\nLet me think about what \"one-sixth of\" means in mathematical terms. If something is one-sixth of another thing, that means I need to divide the other thing by 6, right? So, if m is one-sixth of e, that would be m = e divided by 6.\n\nLooking at option B, that's exactly what it says: m = e/6. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut let's make sure the other options aren't correct. Option A has m = 1/6 + e, which means adding one-sixth to the Earth weight. That doesn't make sense in this context because we're dealing with proportions, not additions.\n\nOption C has m = 6 + e, which is adding 6 to the Earth weight. That doesn't reflect a proportional relationship.\n\nOption D has m = 6e, which means the moon weight is six times the Earth weight. But we know that's not true because the moon's gravity is weaker, so objects weigh less there, not more.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option B seems to be the correct one.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. The problem says \"the weight of an object on the moon, m, is about 1/6 of the object\u2019s weight on Earth, e.\" So, m = (1/6)e, which is the same as m = e/6.\n\nYes, that matches option B.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this? Maybe considering units or something, but weight is proportional, and the proportion is given as 1/6.\n\nI think option B is definitely the right choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
