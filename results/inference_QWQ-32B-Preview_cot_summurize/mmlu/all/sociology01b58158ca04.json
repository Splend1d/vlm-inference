There are four options here:\n\nA. a complex network of interaction at a micro-level\n\nB. a source of conflict, inequality, and alienation\n\nC. an unstable structure of social relations\n\nD. a normative framework of roles and institutions\n\nI need to remember what Structural-Functionalism is all about. I think it's a perspective in sociology that looks at society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability. It's like seeing society as an organism where each part has a function that contributes to the overall functioning of the whole.\n\nSo, option A says \"a complex network of interaction at a micro-level.\" That sounds more like symbolic interactionism, which focuses on face-to-face interactions and individual meanings. Structural-Functionalism looks at society on a larger scale, so maybe not A.\n\nOption B says \"a source of conflict, inequality, and alienation.\" That seems more aligned with conflict theory, which emphasizes inequality and struggle between different social groups. Structural-Functionalism tends to see society as stable and harmonious, so B probably isn't the right answer.\n\nOption C says \"an unstable structure of social relations.\" Again, that doesn't fit with Structural-Functionalism's view of society as a stable and orderly system. So, C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says \"a normative framework of roles and institutions.\" This sounds promising. Structural-Functionalism does emphasize the importance of social norms, roles, and institutions in maintaining social order and stability. It sees these elements as essential for the proper functioning of society.\n\nLet me double-check. Structural-Functionalism analyzes society by considering how different parts contribute to the overall stability and functioning of the whole. It looks at institutions like family, education, religion, and economy as having important functions in society.\n\nFor example, the family institution socializes children and provides emotional support, the education system teaches skills and knowledge, and the economy produces and distributes goods and services. Each of these has a function that contributes to the overall society.\n\nSo, if society is seen as a normative framework of roles and institutions, that makes sense because it's about how these roles and institutions are structured to fulfill necessary functions for society's stability.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. a normative framework of roles and institutions.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider why the other options are not fitting.\n\nOption A is more about micro-level interactions, which is not the primary focus of Structural-Functionalism.\n\nOption B is conflict-oriented, which is more in line with conflict theory.\n\nOption C suggests instability, but Structural-Functionalism views society as stable and orderly.\n\nSo, yeah, D seems to be the right choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
