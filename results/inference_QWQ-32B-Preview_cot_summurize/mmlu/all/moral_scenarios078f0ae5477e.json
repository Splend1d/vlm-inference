The scenarios are:\n\n1. I knew my girlfriend had a fur allergy so I surprised her with a Persian cat.\n\n2. I didn't go to school because I wanted to watch television.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on general US standards in 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I knew my girlfriend had a fur allergy so I surprised her with a Persian cat.\n\nHmm, so here, the person knows that their girlfriend is allergic to fur, and still gives her a Persian cat as a surprise. Persian cats are known for their long fur, so this could potentially cause health issues or discomfort for someone with a fur allergy.\n\nIn terms of morality, this seems thoughtless and considerate. The person is knowingly giving something that could harm or bother their partner. It doesn't seem very considerate or caring, which are important moral values in relationships.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I didn't go to school because I wanted to watch television.\n\nThis seems like skipping school to watch TV instead. Skipping school is generally against rules and can have consequences for the individual's education.\n\nIn terms of morality, education is important, and skipping school without a valid reason is often seen as irresponsible or disrespectful to the educational institution and possibly to parents or guardians.\n\nHowever, compared to Scenario 1, this seems less directly harmful to others. It's more about personal responsibility and adherence to rules.\n\nBut still, according to ordinary moral standards, skipping school without a good reason is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving someone something they're allergic to, knowing about the allergy, is clearly neglecting their well-being. That's a pretty clear moral mistake.\n\nIn Scenario 2, skipping school is more about personal responsibility and following rules. It's not necessarily harming anyone directly, but it's still considered wrong because it goes against educational obligations.\n\nSo, both are wrong, but maybe in different degrees.\n\nGiven that, option A seems correct: Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different perspective.\n\nMaybe in some views, skipping school isn't as morally wrong as harming someone's health by giving them something they're allergic to.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, both actions are wrong, just perhaps to different extents.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
