                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. It's about a 38-year-old person who's afraid to travel on public transportation, and the treatment involves gradually exposing them to traveling by bus, with the exposure increasing over time. The options are flooding, modeling, reinforced practice, and implosion. I need to choose the correct term for this type of treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these terms means.\n\nFlooding, I think, is when someone is exposed to their greatest fear all at once, without any control over it. Like, if they're afraid of buses, maybe they'd be put on a bus for a long time without any way to get off. That sounds pretty intense and maybe a bit scary.\n\nModeling, I believe, is when someone watches someone else do something and learns by imitation. So, maybe the person watches someone else take a bus confidently, and then tries to do the same. That seems more observational.\n\nReinforced practice sounds like practicing a behavior over and over again, with some kind of reward or reinforcement each time they do it correctly. Maybe like getting a treat every time they take a bus ride.\n\nImplosion is a term I'm less familiar with. I think it might involve vividly imagining the feared situation in a controlled way, maybe to desensitize the person to the fear.\n\nBut in this case, the treatment involves \"actual real-life behavioral activities increased across trials.\" So, it's not just imagination; it's real-world exposure that increases over time.\n\nFlooding sounds like it's all at once, which isn't\u6e10\u8fdb\u7684. Modeling is more about observing others, not directly facing the fear oneself. Reinforced practice could involve real-life activities, but the key here is the gradual increase in exposure.\n\nWait, maybe it's graduated exposure, which is increasing the difficulty level gradually. That sounds a lot like what's being described.\n\nBut looking at the options, graduated exposure isn't listed directly. However, reinforced practice might involve graduated steps with reinforcement.\n\nLet me think about reinforced practice. If it's practicing the behavior with reinforcement, maybe each time the person takes a bus ride, they get some kind of positive feedback, like praise or a reward.\n\nBut the key phrase is \"graduated exposure,\" which isn't explicitly mentioned in any of the options. Maybe it's synonymous with one of them.\n\nFlooding is the opposite of graduated exposure; it's immediate and full exposure without gradual buildup.\n\nModeling is more about observing others, not direct exposure.\n\nImplosion seems more related to imaginary exposure, not real-life exposure.\n\nSo, perhaps reinforced practice is the closest, as it involves actual behavioral activities that are increased across trials, possibly with some form of reinforcement to encourage the behavior.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another term for graduated exposure that I'm not recalling right now.\n\nWait, perhaps it's called systematic desensitization. I think that's a method where someone is gradually exposed to their fear, step by step, while learning relaxation techniques to handle the anxiety.\n\nSystematic desensitization involves creating a hierarchy of fears and slowly working up to the most feared situation.\n\nIn this case, the treatment is described as \"graduated exposure to traveling by bus, with actual real-life behavioral activities increased across trials.\" That sounds a lot like systematic desensitization.\n\nBut systematic desensitization isn't one of the options. So, maybe it's not the answer here.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Flooding - doesn't match because it's not gradual.\n\nB. Modeling - more about observing others.\n\nC. Reinforced practice - could involve gradual steps with reinforcement.\n\nD. Implosion - seems more about imaginary exposure.\n\nGiven that, reinforced practice might be the best fit, as it involves actual real-life activities that are increased over time, possibly with some form of reinforcement to encourage the behavior.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is not perfectly matching any of the options, but reinforced practice is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps implosion does involve real-life exposure; maybe I misremembered.\n\nLet me double-check what implosion therapy is. I think implosion therapy is a type of exposure therapy where the person is exposed to their feared stimulus in a controlled, imaginary way, often more intense than what they would experience in reality. So, it's still a form of exposure but through imagination.\n\nBut the question specifies \"actual real-life behavioral activities,\" so implosion might not fit because it's more about imagination.\n\nThat leaves reinforced practice as the most appropriate option among those listed.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. reinforced practice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
