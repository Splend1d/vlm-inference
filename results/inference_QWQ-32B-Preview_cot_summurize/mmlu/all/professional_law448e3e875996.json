No, because a juvenile may be sentenced to life without parole if release would pose a danger to the community.\nB. No, because the Eighth Amendment does not apply outside the context of capital punishment.\nC. Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\nD.

                    "text": "I've got this question here about a 14-year-old who was tried as an adult for armed robbery and sentenced to life without parole. The question is whether this sentence violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Let's see what the options are and think through this step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"No, because a juvenile may be sentenced to life without parole if release would pose a danger to the community.\" Hmm, that seems plausible. If the juvenile has a lengthy history of violent offenses, and armed robbery is considered a crime of violence, maybe the court decided that releasing him would be dangerous. But I need to check if the Eighth Amendment has any specific provisions regarding juveniles and life without parole for non-homicide offenses.\n\nOption B says: \"No, because the Eighth Amendment does not apply outside the context of capital punishment.\" I know that's not correct. The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment in all contexts, not just capital punishment. It's relevant to all sentencing decisions, not just death penalties.\n\nOption C says: \"Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\" This sounds familiar. I think there are Supreme Court cases that have addressed this issue. Let me recall: isn't there a case that says life without parole for juveniles in non-homicide cases is unconstitutional?\n\nOption D says: \"Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for an adult or juvenile defendant convicted of a nonviolent offense.\" Well, first, the armed robbery is considered a crime of violence, so it might not qualify as a nonviolent offense. But more importantly, the question is about juveniles and non-homicide offenses.\n\nLet me dig deeper into the legal principles here. The Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment includes considerations of proportionality in sentencing, especially for juveniles. The Supreme Court has ruled on several cases related to juvenile sentencing.\n\nIn Roper v. Simmons (2005), the Court banned the death penalty for juveniles in all cases. Then in Graham v. Florida (2010), the Court held that life without parole sentences cannot be imposed on juveniles who did not commit homicide offenses. The Court found that such sentences violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment when applied to non-homicide offenses committed by juveniles.\n\nSo, in Graham, the Court recognized that juveniles are different from adults in terms of moral responsibility and amenability to rehabilitation. Therefore, sentencing a juvenile to life without parole for a non-homicide offense was considered disproportionate and unconstitutional.\n\nIn this scenario, the defendant was 14 years old and convicted of armed robbery, which is a serious crime but not a homicide. Even though he has a lengthy juvenile criminal history including violent offenses, the nature of the crime in question is armed robbery, not murder.\n\nTherefore, based on Graham v. Florida, it seems that sentencing this juvenile to life without parole for a non-homicide offense would violate the Eighth Amendment.\n\nOption C aligns with this reasoning: \"Yes, because a life-without-parole sentence is not permissible for a juvenile defendant convicted of a nonhomicide offense.\"\n\nOption D is too broad because it includes adults and nonviolent offenses. The question is specifically about a juvenile convicted of a non-homicide offense, which in this case is an armed robbery considered a crime of violence.\n\nOption A suggests that life without parole is acceptable if release would pose a danger to the community. But according to Graham v. Florida, even if a juvenile poses a danger, life without parole is not an option for non-homicide offenses.\n\nOption B is clearly incorrect because the Eighth Amendment applies to all forms of punishment, not just capital punishment.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. The life-without-parole sentence does violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment in this context.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
