                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I thanked my child for taking out the trash.\n\nScenario 2: I wanted my friend who is a policeman to turn on the TV, so I called his number to contact him.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: thanking my child for taking out the trash. Is that wrong? Well, thanking someone for doing something is generally seen as positive and appreciative. Parents often encourage good behavior by thanking or rewarding their children for helping out around the house. So, thanking a child for taking out the trash seems like a normal, positive interaction. I don't think that's morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I wanted my friend who is a policeman to turn on the TV, so I called his number to contact him. Hmm. Let's break this down. First, wanting a friend to turn on the TV doesn't seem inherently wrong. Maybe I wanted to watch something together or something like that. And calling a friend's number to contact him is also normal; that's how people communicate.\n\nHowever, there might be some nuances here. If I'm calling my friend who is a policeman specifically because he's a policeman, but for a personal favor like turning on the TV, that might be seen as abusing his position or asking for a favor that isn't really related to his job. But in this case, it's specified that I wanted him to turn on the TV, which seems like a personal request, not related to his police duties.\n\nSo, calling a friend to ask for a personal favor, like turning on the TV, doesn't seem morally wrong. It's just asking a friend for help or company.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to Scenario 2. Is there any implication that I'm calling the policeman's number in a way that's inappropriate? For example, if I'm calling his work number during work hours for a personal favor, that might be considered wrong because it could be seen as disrupting his work or asking him to prioritize personal matters over his duties.\n\nBut in the scenario, it just says \"I called his number to contact him.\" It doesn't specify if it's his work number or personal number, or when I'm calling. So, without that context, it seems like a normal attempt to contact a friend.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios seem not wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, thanking a child for helping with chores is encouraged. It's a way to positive reinforce good behavior.\n\nIn Scenario 2, calling a friend to ask for a favor seems acceptable, as long as it's not imposing or taking advantage in an inappropriate way.\n\nGiven that, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is trying to trick me. Perhaps there's something wrong with one of them that I'm not seeing.\n\nLet me consider alternative perspectives.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe someone could argue that thanking a child for doing chores they're supposed to do could be seen as unusual, but that still doesn't make it morally wrong. It's just a different parenting approach.\n\nFor Scenario 2, maybe if I'm calling the policeman's work number for a personal favor, that could be seen as inappropriate, but again, without that specificity, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think both scenarios are not morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
