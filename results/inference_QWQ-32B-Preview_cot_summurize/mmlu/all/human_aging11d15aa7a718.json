They're linked to aging and diseases. Now, the options are:\n\nA. Normal metabolism\n\nB. Excess consumption of Vitamins A and C\n\nC. Lack of sunlight\n\nD. A weakened immune system\n\nFirst, I need to recall what causes free radicals. I remember that they can be generated by various factors, both internal and external. Internal sources include our own metabolism, while external sources can be things like pollution, smoking, and radiation.\n\nOption A says \"Normal metabolism.\" That sounds familiar. In biology class, we learned that during cellular respiration, when cells produce energy, some free radicals can be produced as byproducts. So, even when our body is functioning normally, it generates some free radicals. That makes sense.\n\nOption B is \"Excess consumption of Vitamins A and C.\" Hmm, vitamins A and C are antioxidants, right? Antioxidants are supposed to combat free radicals, not cause them. So, unless you're taking way too much, but even then, I don't recall them producing free radicals. Maybe this is a trick option.\n\nOption C is \"Lack of sunlight.\" Sunlight can actually increase free radical production because of the UV rays, which can damage cells. So, lack of sunlight would probably decrease free radical production, not increase it. Maybe this isn't the answer.\n\nOption D is \"A weakened immune system.\" A weakened immune system might make it harder for the body to fight off damage caused by free radicals, but I don't think the immune system directly produces free radicals. Maybe not the best choice.\n\nComparing all these options, option A seems the most accurate. Normal metabolism does produce free radicals as a natural part of energy production. The other options don't align as well with what I know about free radical sources.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think again. Vitamins A and C are antioxidants, so excess consumption might even have the opposite effect, potentially. Lack of sunlight would reduce exposure to UV rays, which should decrease free radical production. A weakened immune system might lead to more cellular damage, but not necessarily produce more free radicals.\n\nYes, I think A is the correct answer. Normal metabolism is a source of free radicals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
