                    "text": "So I need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 24 and 36. I remember that LCM is the smallest number that both 24 and 36 can divide into without leaving a remainder. Let me think about how to find it.\n\nOne way is to list the multiples of each number and find the smallest one they have in common. Let's try that.\n\nMultiples of 24: 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, ...\n\nMultiples of 36: 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, ...\n\nLooking at these, both 72 and 144 are common multiples. So the smallest one is 72. That would make the LCM 72.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a more efficient way to find the LCM, especially for bigger numbers. I think there's a method using prime factorization.\n\nLet me try that. First, find the prime factors of 24 and 36.\n\n24 can be broken down into primes like this:\n\n24 \u00f7 2 = 12\n\n12 \u00f7 2 = 6\n\n6 \u00f7 2 = 3\n\n3 \u00f7 3 = 1\n\nSo, 24 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 2^3 \u00d7 3^1\n\nNow, for 36:\n\n36 \u00f7 2 = 18\n\n18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\n3 \u00f7 3 = 1\n\nSo, 36 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 = 2^2 \u00d7 3^2\n\nTo find the LCM using prime factorization, I need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n\nSo, for prime number 2, the highest power is 2^3 (from 24).\n\nFor prime number 3, the highest power is 3^2 (from 36).\n\nNow, multiply these highest powers together: 2^3 \u00d7 3^2 = 8 \u00d7 9 = 72\n\nAgain, I get 72 as the LCM.\n\nLet me just double-check with another method. I've heard that LCM can also be found using the formula:\n\nLCM(a, b) = (a \u00d7 b) / GCD(a, b)\n\nWhere GCD is the Greatest Common Divisor.\n\nSo, if I can find the GCD of 24 and 36, I can use this formula.\n\nTo find the GCD, I can use the prime factorizations again.\n\n24 = 2^3 \u00d7 3^1\n\n36 = 2^2 \u00d7 3^2\n\nThe GCD is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors.\n\nSo, for 2, the lowest power is 2^2 = 4\n\nFor 3, the lowest power is 3^1 = 3\n\nTherefore, GCD = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, plug into the formula:\n\nLCM(24, 36) = (24 \u00d7 36) / 12 = 864 / 12 = 72\n\nAgain, 72.\n\nWait a minute, in the first method, I listed the multiples and saw that both 72 and 144 are common multiples, but 72 is smaller, so it should be the LCM. But the answer options include 144, which is also a common multiple, but it's not the least.\n\nSo, why is 144 an option? Maybe to see if I choose the smallest one or not.\n\nLooking back at the question:\n\nFind the LCM of 24 and 36.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 96\n\nB. 144\n\nC. 72\n\nD. 120\n\nSo, according to my calculations, the correct answer should be C. 72.\n\nBut let me verify one more time.\n\nIs there any chance that 72 isn't the LCM?\n\nWait, 24 \u00d7 3 = 72\n\n36 \u00d7 2 = 72\n\nSo, yes, both divide into 72 without a remainder.\n\nIs there any smaller number that both 24 and 36 divide into without a remainder?\n\nLet's see, half of 72 is 36. Does 24 divide into 36? 36 \u00f7 24 = 1.5, which is not an integer, so no.\n\nSo, 72 is indeed the smallest such number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 72.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{72} \\]"
