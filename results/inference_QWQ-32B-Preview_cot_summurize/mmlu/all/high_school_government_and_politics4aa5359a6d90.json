                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"The idea that the Bill of Rights applies to both federal and state governments by means of the Fourteenth Amendment is called...\" and then there are four options: A. mandamus, B. habeas corpus, C. strict constructionism, and D. the doctrine of incorporation.\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what the Bill of Rights is and how it relates to federal and state governments. The Bill of Rights are the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which outline individual liberties and rights. Originally, these rights were intended to limit the power of the federal government, not the state governments.\n\nBut then there's this Fourteenth Amendment mentioned. The Fourteenth Amendment was ratified after the Civil War, in 1868, and it's famous for its Citizenship Clause, which defines citizenship, and its Equal Protection Clause, which requires states to provide equal protection under the law to all people.\n\nNow, the question is about how the Bill of Rights applies to state governments through this amendment. I think this has something to do with the incorporation doctrine.\n\nLet me recall what incorporation is. The incorporation doctrine is a legal principle that makes most provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to state and local governments through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Basically, it incorporates the Bill of Rights against the states.\n\nSo, if someone says that the Bill of Rights applies to both federal and state governments because of the Fourteenth Amendment, they're referring to the doctrine of incorporation.\n\nNow, let's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nA. Mandamus: That's a legal concept where a higher court orders a lower court or a government official to perform a specific duty. It doesn't relate to applying the Bill of Rights to state governments.\n\nB. Habeas corpus: That's a legal procedure to challenge the legality of someone's detention. Again, not directly related to applying the Bill of Rights to state governments.\n\nC. Strict constructionism: That's a judicial philosophy that interprets the Constitution based strictly on the letter of the law and the original meaning of the text. It's not specifically about applying the Bill of Rights to state governments.\n\nD. The doctrine of incorporation: As I just explained, this is the principle that applies the Bill of Rights to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nSo, it seems clear that D is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should think about why incorporation is related to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment has a Due Process Clause, which says that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The incorporation doctrine uses this clause to apply various protections in the Bill of Rights to the states.\n\nFor example, the First Amendment's freedom of speech is applied to the states through incorporation, meaning that states can't abridge freedom of speech either.\n\nSo, yes, the doctrine of incorporation is the key here.\n\nI don't think any of the other options fit the description given in the question.\n\nMandamus is about ordering official action, habeas corpus is about challenging detention, strict constructionism is a judicial philosophy, and only incorporation deals with applying the Bill of Rights to state governments via the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. the doctrine of incorporation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
