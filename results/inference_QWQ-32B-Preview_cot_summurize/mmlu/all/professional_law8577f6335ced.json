                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this city ordinance that says you can't wash your vehicle on city streets because, I guess, the runoff could cause hazards like ice forming in winter. This guy washes his car on the street in front of his home, and overnight, the water turns into ice. The next morning, another driver hits this ice and crashes into a tree. Now, that driver is suing the car-washer for being negligent per se because he broke the city ordinance.\n\nNegligence per se is when someone violates a law meant to protect against a certain kind of harm, and that violation causes that very harm. So, in this case, the ordinance is probably meant to prevent exactly this kind of thing\u2014water on the street turning to ice and causing accidents.\n\nThe question is asking for an additional fact that would help the man being sued the most. So, we need to think about which option weakens the argument that he was negligent per se.\n\nOption A says the man wasn't aware of the ordinance. But ignorance of the law generally isn't an excuse. People are expected to know and follow the laws, even if they don't know about them. So, this might not help him much.\n\nOption B says the city council passed the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a truck. Hmm, that seems like it might provide context for why the ordinance exists, but it doesn't directly relate to the man's situation or his responsibility in this particular incident.\n\nOption C says the driver who crashed lived in the neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before. That might suggest that the driver was aware of the potential hazard but still chose to drive carefully. Maybe it shows that the driver should have anticipated icy conditions. But I'm not sure how much that helps the defendant.\n\nOption D says the driver wasn't a resident of the city. I'm not sure what relevance that has. Maybe it's about whether the ordinance applies to non-residents, but that seems like a stretch.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the best defense is to argue that his action wasn't the cause of the accident, or that there were other factors that contributed more significantly to the crash.\n\nWait, but among the options, none directly address that. Maybe the best help for the man would be if there were some other reason the driver crashed, like poor visibility or the driver was speeding.\n\nBut those aren't among the options. So, perhaps the best option among those given is A, that he wasn't aware of the ordinance. Even if ignorance isn't an excuse, maybe it slightly mitigates his responsibility.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option C could help because if the driver saw him washing the car and still drove the next morning, perhaps the driver shares some responsibility by not being cautious.\n\nBut I think the most helpful fact would be if the man wasn't aware of the ordinance, even though, as I said, that might not be a complete defense.\n\nWait, maybe option B could help by showing that the ordinance was reactive, meaning it was passed after a specific incident, which might suggest that the danger wasn't as obvious as the plaintiff is making it out to be.\n\nBut I'm not sure. This is tricky.\n\nLet me consider the legal principle again. Negligence per se occurs when someone violates a law designed to protect against a particular harm, and that violation causes that harm. So, in this case, the ordinance is presumably in place to prevent hazards like slippery streets from washing cars.\n\nTherefore, the man's violation of the ordinance directly led to the harm. It seems pretty straightforward.\n\nSo, perhaps none of the options would help him much, but among them, maybe A is the least damaging because it shows he didn't know about the law.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option D could be interpreted to suggest that since the driver wasn't a resident, the ordinance wasn't meant to protect him, but that seems like a weak argument.\n\nI think the best answer is A: The man was not aware of the ordinance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
