                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this law problem. It's about a pedestrian who got hurt because a bicycle's brakes failed. The pedestrian is suing the company that made the bicycle, saying they were negligent. So, I need to see if the pedestrian will win based on the options given.\n\nFirst, let's understand what happened. There's a bicycle company that made a bike and sold it to a dealer, who then sold it to a purchaser. The purchaser was riding the bike and saw a traffic light turn from green to amber. He tried to speed up to cross the intersection before the light turned red. But then he realized he couldn't make it, so he tried to brake, but the brakes failed. To avoid hitting traffic, he turned sharply to the right onto the sidewalk and hit a pedestrian. Both the pedestrian and the purchaser were injured.\n\nNow, the pedestrian is claiming that the bicycle company was negligent. At trial, it was found that the brake failure was due to a manufacturing defect in the bicycle, and that the company didn't do a reasonable inspection that could have caught this defect.\n\nSo, the question is, will the pedestrian prevail in his claim against the bicycle company?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the bicycle company placed a defective bicycle into the stream of commerce.\n\nB. Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.\n\nC. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser of the bicycle.\n\nD. No, because the purchaser was negligent in turning onto the sidewalk.\n\nHmm. This seems like a products liability case, where a defective product causes harm, and the manufacturer is being sued.\n\nI remember that in products liability, there are different theories, like negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty. Here, the pedestrian is asserting a claim based on negligence, so we'll focus on that.\n\nIn negligence, to prevail, the plaintiff (the pedestrian) generally needs to prove duty, breach, causation, and damages.\n\nSo, first, was there a duty owed by the bicycle company to the pedestrian?\n\nWell, manufacturers owe a duty of care to consumers and anyone who might be foreseeably harmed by their products. So, even though the pedestrian wasn't the direct purchaser, if the company's negligence in manufacturing or inspecting the bike led to harm, they could still be liable.\n\nNext, was there a breach of that duty?\n\nIt was found that there was a manufacturing defect and that the company failed to conduct a reasonable inspection that would have discovered the defect. That sounds like a breach of their duty to make a safe product.\n\nThen, causation: did the breach cause the harm?\n\nThe brake failure caused the purchaser to lose control, leading him to turn onto the sidewalk and hit the pedestrian. So, yes, the defect directly caused the accident.\n\nAnd damages: both the pedestrian and the purchaser were injured, so there are damages.\n\nBut, there's also the issue of the purchaser's negligence. He saw the light turn amber and tried to speed up to beat the red light, then realized he couldn't make it and applied the brakes, which failed. Then he turned onto the sidewalk to avoid traffic.\n\nSo, was the purchaser acting negligently?\n\nIt seems like he was perhaps speeding or driving unsafely by trying to beat the light. But, even if he was negligent, that doesn't necessarily absolve the bicycle company of liability, especially if their defective product combined with his actions led to the accident.\n\nIn law, sometimes both the plaintiff and the defendant can be at fault, and courts may apportion liability accordingly. This is called comparative or contributory negligence, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nBut in this case, since it's a question about whether the pedestrian will prevail, and given the options, I think the key points are the defect and the company's failure to inspect.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the bicycle company placed a defective bicycle into the stream of commerce.\n\nThis seems relevant. If the company put a defective product into circulation, and that defect caused harm, they could be liable.\n\nB. Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.\n\nThis also seems pertinent. If the company failed to exercise reasonable care in inspecting the bike, and that failure led to the defect going unnoticed and causing harm, then they could be negligent.\n\nC. No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser of the bicycle.\n\nBut, in products liability, it's not always required that the plaintiff be the purchaser. Anyone who is foreseeably harmed by the defective product can potentially sue. So, this might not be a valid reason to say no.\n\nD. No, because the purchaser was negligent in turning onto the sidewalk.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, even if the purchaser was negligent, that doesn't necessarily bar the pedestrian's claim against the manufacturer. The manufacturer's liability is separate from the purchaser's actions, especially since the defect was the precipitating factor.\n\nSo, between A and B, which one to choose.\n\nA focuses on the defective product being in the stream of commerce, which is important, but B emphasizes the company's failure to exercise reasonable care in inspection, which directly relates to negligence.\n\nSince the claim is based on negligence, I think B is a better answer because it highlights the company's duty to exercise reasonable care in inspecting their products.\n\nOption A might be more relevant in a strict liability context, where the focus is on the defective product itself, regardless of the manufacturer's care in producing it.\n\nBut since the claim is specifically based on negligence, I think B is more appropriate.\n\nAlso, in negligence, the focus is on the breach of the standard of care, which in this case was the failure to conduct a reasonable inspection.\n\nTherefore, I would say the answer is B. Yes, because the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the bicycle company.\n\nThis means the pedestrian will prevail in his claim against the bicycle company.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
