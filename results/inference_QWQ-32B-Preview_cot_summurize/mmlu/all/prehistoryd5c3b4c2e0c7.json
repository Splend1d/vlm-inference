                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the Pleistocene ice mass in North America that was centered in the Rocky Mountains. The options are A. Beringia, B. Laurentide, C. Cordilleran, and D. McKenzie Corridor. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Pleistocene epoch is. I think it's the time period from about 2.6 million years ago to around 11,700 years ago, often known for the ice ages. During this time, there were several large ice sheets covering parts of North America.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A is Beringia. I remember that Beringia refers to the land bridge between Siberia and Alaska that existed during the last ice age when sea levels were lower. It's famous for being the route that humans and animals used to migrate from Asia to the Americas. But I don't think it was an ice mass centered in the Rocky Mountains. So, maybe not A.\n\nOption B is Laurentide. I think the Laurentide Ice Sheet was a massive ice sheet that covered most of North America, including Canada and the northern part of the United States, during the last ice age. It was centered roughly over the Laurentian Shield, which is a geological region in Canada. So, it was more centered in the east, not specifically in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nOption C is Cordilleran. The Cordilleran Ice Sheet was another ice sheet that existed during the Pleistocene in North America. I believe it was located in the western part of the continent, covering the Rocky Mountains and parts of the Pacific Coast. That sounds like it could be the one centered in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nOption D is McKenzie Corridor. I'm not sure what this refers to. I think it might be a region between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets where there was a corridor of land that was not covered by ice, allowing for migration of animals and possibly humans during the last ice age. But again, not an ice mass centered in the Rockies.\n\nSo, comparing these options, it seems like the Cordilleran Ice Sheet is the one that was centered in the Rocky Mountains. The Laurentide was more in the east, Beringia was the land bridge in the northwest, and the McKenzie Corridor was a passage between the ice sheets.\n\nTo make sure, I can think about the geography. The Rocky Mountains run along the western part of North America, so an ice mass centered there would be the Cordilleran Ice Sheet.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Cordilleran.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
