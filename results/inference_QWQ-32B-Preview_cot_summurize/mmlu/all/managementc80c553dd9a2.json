It's all about making work more efficient and productive. I remember that Taylor really emphasized breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable parts and then figuring out the best way to do each part.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Experimentation - That does sound familiar. Taylor did advocate for experimenting to find the most efficient methods. But is that the overarching principle?\n\nB. Fluid working relationships - Hmm, that sounds a bit vague. Scientific management was more about standardization and consistency, so I'm not sure about this one.\n\nC. Freedom of association - I don't think that's related to scientific management. Maybe it's more about labor rights or something?\n\nD. One best way to do a job - Oh, this rings a bell. Taylor believed that there was one best way to do each task, and that by finding and implementing that method, you could increase efficiency.\n\nWait a minute, maybe both A and D are important. Experimentation was a method used to find the one best way. But if I had to pick the guiding principle, I think it's D, \"One best way to do a job.\" Because that's the core idea: identifying the most efficient method and then training workers to do it that way.\n\nBut let me double-check. Scientific management is often associated with time and motion studies, where experts analyze tasks to eliminate unnecessary movements and standardize processes. So, the focus is on finding the optimal way to perform each task to maximize efficiency.\n\nExperimentation was a means to an end, not the end itself. The end was to find the one best way. So, I think D is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider option C again. Freedom of association usually refers to the right of workers to form unions and such, which isn't really aligned with scientific management's focus on efficiency and standardization.\n\nAnd option B, fluid working relationships, doesn't seem to fit with the structured, standardized approach of scientific management.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that D, \"One best way to do a job,\" is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
