                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out what causes meteor showers. I have four options here, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me read them carefully.\n\nOption A says that near-Earth asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital path. Then, when Earth passes through the asteroid's orbit, we get bombarded by sand-sized particles, causing a meteor shower.\n\nOption B says that near-Earth asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere, creating hundreds of bright meteors that seem to come from one spot in the sky.\n\nOption C says that the nuclei of comets disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere, making lots of bright meteors that appear to radiate from a central point in the sky.\n\nOption D says that the nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along the comet's orbital path. Then, when Earth passes through the comet's orbit, we get bombarded by sand-sized particles, causing a meteor shower.\n\nHmm, I think I need to recall what I know about meteor showers. I remember that meteor showers happen when Earth passes through the debris left behind by a comet or sometimes an asteroid. So, the key here is that the material causing the meteor shower is debris from these objects.\n\nLet me think about comets and asteroids separately. Comets are made of ice, dust, and rocky material, right? When they approach the Sun, the ice starts to vaporize, releasing dust and rocky particles. This creates the comet's tail and also leaves a trail of debris along the comet's orbit.\n\nAsteroids, on the other hand, are mostly rocky or metallic bodies without the icy component. They can fragment or collide, creating debris, but I'm not sure if their disintegration is the main source of meteor showers.\n\nLooking back at the options, A and B mention asteroids, while C and D mention comets. Based on what I just thought, comets seem more likely to be the source of meteor showers because they leave debris along their orbits.\n\nBut wait, I also remember that some meteor showers can come from asteroids, especially those in Earth-crossing orbits. So maybe asteroids can also be sources of meteor showers.\n\nLet me consider each option more carefully.\n\nOption A says that asteroids gradually disintegrate and spread out along their orbital path. Then, when Earth passes through this path, we get bombarded by sand-sized particles. This seems plausible, but I'm not sure how common it is for asteroids to disintegrate in this way.\n\nOption B says that asteroids disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere, creating many meteors appearing to come from one point in the sky. Wait, this sounds more like a meteor shower caused by an asteroid entering Earth's atmosphere, but typically, meteor showers are caused by many small particles spread along an orbit, not a single asteroid disintegrating in the atmosphere. Also, meteor showers usually have a radiant, which is the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate, but I think this is a common feature regardless of whether the source is a comet or an asteroid.\n\nOption C says that the nuclei of comets disintegrate as they enter Earth's atmosphere, creating many bright meteors appearing to radiate from a central location. This seems similar to option B, but for comets. However, comets don't usually enter Earth's atmosphere; they have their own orbits around the Sun. So, this doesn't make much sense to me. The comet itself doesn't enter Earth's atmosphere; it's the debris from the comet that does.\n\nOption D says that the nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along the comet's orbital path. Then, when Earth passes through this path, we get bombarded by sand-sized particles, causing a meteor shower. This sounds very familiar and consistent with what I know about meteor showers.\n\nSo, comparing options A, B, C, and D, option D seems the most accurate. It correctly identifies that it's the debris from comets, specifically from the disintegration of their nuclei, that spreads out along the comet's orbit, and when Earth passes through this debris field, we see a meteor shower.\n\nOption A is similar but refers to asteroids, which, while possible, are not the primary source of most meteor showers. Option B is incorrect because asteroids don't typically disintegrate in Earth's atmosphere to cause meteor showers. Option C is incorrect because it's not the comet nuclei that enter Earth's atmosphere; it's the debris from them.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. The nuclei of comets gradually disintegrate and spread out along the comet's orbital path. When Earth passes through the orbit of a comet, we are bombarded by sand-sized particles, which cause a meteor shower.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
