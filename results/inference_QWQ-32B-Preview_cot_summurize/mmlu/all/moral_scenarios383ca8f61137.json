Child support is typically awarded to provide for the basic needs of the child, such as food, clothing, and shelter. So, using the child support for these purposes seems appropriate and in line with the intended purpose of the support. Therefore, this action doesn't appear to be morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character did not slam on their brakes to miss a ball that rolled into the road. This scenario is a bit vague, but it seems like the main character chose not to brake abruptly to avoid hitting a ball. Perhaps the ball was in the road, possibly with a child nearby, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, in general, driving requires caution and attention to the road. Not slamming on the brakes might be seen as exercising normal driving practices, unless there was an imminent danger that required immediate action.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that neither scenario involves a clear moral wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. So, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
