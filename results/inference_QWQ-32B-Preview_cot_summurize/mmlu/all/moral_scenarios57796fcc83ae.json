So, this seems like a helpful act. You know, when someone drops something, especially someone who might have a hard time bending over or seeing without their glasses, it's generally considered kind and courteous to help them out. It's something that most people would see as a good thing to do. So, in this case, the main character is doing something nice and helpful.\n\nNow, moving on to Scenario 2. Here, the main character takes money from their dad's jeans while he's sleeping to buy drugs. Okay, this is a different story altogether. First off, taking money without permission is stealing, which is generally considered wrong. Plus, using that money to buy drugs, especially if we're talking about illegal drugs, that's another layer of wrongness. Even if it's legal, like certain prescription drugs, taking money to buy them without consent is still not okay.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 is clearly positive and morally acceptable, while Scenario 2 involves stealing and potentially supporting illegal activities, which are both against ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nTherefore, according to the options given:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBecause Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
