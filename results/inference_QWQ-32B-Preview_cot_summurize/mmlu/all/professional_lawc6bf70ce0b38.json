                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the court's likely ruling would be in this scenario. So, Cooper is suing March for money damages, and Cooper's attorney wants to use parts of March's deposition at trial instead of calling March to the stand. March objects to this. I need to decide which option is most likely correct.\n\nOption A says that Cooper can use the deposition, but if requested, he must read all parts that in fairness ought to be considered with the part introduced. That sounds like it's about context and fairness, making sure that the jury gets the full picture and doesn't get a skewed view by only hearing selective parts of the deposition.\n\nOption B limits the use of the deposition to contradicting or impeaching March's prior inconsistent statements or pleadings. So, this seems more about using the deposition to challenge March's credibility or to show that he's saying something different now than what he said earlier.\n\nOption C says that Cooper cannot use the deposition at trial because March is able to testify and there are no exceptional circumstances. This suggests that depositions are generally not used in place of live testimony unless there's a good reason why the witness can't testify in person.\n\nOption D says that Cooper cannot use the deposition because that would make March his witness and immune to impeachment. I'm not sure about this one. Does using a deposition make the person your witness? And what does it mean to be immune to impeachment in this context?\n\nLet me think about this step by step. First, I need to understand the rules regarding the use of depositions at trial. In many jurisdictions, depositions can be used at trial under certain circumstances, such as when the witness is unavailable or for impeachment purposes.\n\nIn this case, March is able to testify, as indicated in option C. So, if March is available to testify, is there a general rule against using his deposition in place of his live testimony?\n\nI recall that depositions are often used to preserve testimony in case the witness is unavailable at trial, but if the witness is available, it's usually expected that they testify in person.\n\nHowever, there might be situations where using parts of a deposition is allowed even if the witness is available, perhaps for efficiency or if certain parts of the deposition are particularly relevant.\n\nOption A seems to suggest that partial use of the deposition is allowed, but with the condition that all relevant parts must be presented to maintain fairness.\n\nOption B seems more narrow, allowing the deposition only for impeachment purposes, which makes sense if March testifies and says something different from what's in the deposition.\n\nOption C suggests that depositions aren't used at trial if the witness is available unless there are exceptional circumstances. That sounds reasonable, but maybe there are exceptions.\n\nOption D is confusing to me. If Cooper uses March's deposition, does that make March his witness? I think normally, the person who took the deposition is the one who would seek to introduce it. And I'm not sure about the immunity to impeachment part.\n\nLet me consider the purpose behind Cooper's attorney wanting to use the deposition instead of calling March to the stand. It might be because the deposition contains favorable statements, and perhaps they don't want to risk March changing his story or being unreliable on the stand.\n\nBut, if Cooper's attorney introduces March's deposition, and March is present and available to testify, there might be rules about how that affects his status as a witness.\n\nI think the key here is whether March is available to testify. Since the problem states that March is able to testify, and there are no exceptional circumstances mentioned, option C seems plausible.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any exceptions or specific rules that might allow partial use of the deposition under certain conditions.\n\nIn evidence law, there are rules about using statements and declarations in court. For example, Rule 803(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence allows prior statements by witnesses for consistency, but that's under specific conditions.\n\nBut in this case, it's about using a deposition in place of live testimony.\n\nI recall that depositions can be used at trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32, which outlines the circumstances under which a deposition can be used.\n\nLooking at Rule 32(a)(1), it seems that a deposition can be used only if the witness is unavailable or for purposes of contradicting or impeaching the witness\u2019s testimony.\n\nBut in this scenario, March is available to testify, so unless there are exceptional circumstances, it might not be allowed.\n\nOption A seems similar to the concept of using deposition testimony in parts, but ensuring that the context is maintained.\n\nOption B limits the use to impeachment, which might be allowable even if the witness is available.\n\nOption C suggests that depositions aren't used at trial if the witness is available, which aligns with the general rule.\n\nOption D is unclear to me.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is the most likely correct answer: Cooper may not use the deposition at trial because March is able to testify and no exceptional circumstances exist.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf March is available, and there are no exceptional circumstances, using his deposition instead of live testimony might not be permitted.\n\nHowever, perhaps there are exceptions, like if the deposition is more reliable or if it's more efficient.\n\nBut generally, the preference is for live testimony so that the jury can assess the witness's demeanor and responsiveness in real-time.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the most accurate reflection of the likely ruling.\n\nSo, I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
