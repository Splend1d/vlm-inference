                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, we have a quote from Frederick Douglass in 1857 where he's talking about how slavery is deeply entrenched in the political and social structures of the time. He mentions that state governments, churches, and even the federal government are all supporting slavery. It's clear that Douglass is painting a picture of a system that's completely organized in favor of slavery, with no opposition that can match its power.\n\nNow, the question is asking about how Abraham Lincoln's actions in 1860 contradicted Douglass's sentiments. So, we need to think about what Lincoln did in 1860 and see how it goes against what Douglass was saying.\n\nFirst off, let's recall that 1860 was the year of the presidential election where Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States. This was a pivotal moment because Lincoln was from the Republican Party, which had a platform that opposed the expansion of slavery into new territories.\n\nOption A says that Lincoln promoted the freedom of settlers within territories to determine the slave status of their new state. This sounds a lot like the idea of popular sovereignty, which was championed by figures like Stephen A. Douglas. However, Lincoln was actually against popular sovereignty because it allowed for the potential expansion of slavery. So, this doesn't seem to align with Lincoln's stance.\n\nOption B mentions that Lincoln passed the Homestead Act to give free land to all western settlers. While the Homestead Act did eventually pass during Lincoln's presidency, it was in 1862, not 1860. So, this doesn't fit the timeline of the question.\n\nOption C states that Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from any of the new territories. This rings true because the Republican Party platform in 1860 was indeed against the expansion of slavery into new territories. This was one of the key issues that led to the secession of the southern states and the eventual Civil War.\n\nOption D talks about Lincoln enacting the policy of giving newly freed slaves \"forty acres and a mule.\" This policy is more associated with the period after the Civil War, particularly with General William Sherman's Field Order No. 15 in 1865, which allocated land to freed slaves. Lincoln did not enact this policy during his presidency.\n\nSo, considering these options, option C seems to be the most accurate. Lincoln favored the exclusion of slavery from new territories, which contradicts Douglass's sentiment that the federal government was pledged to support and propagate slavery.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Douglass was saying that the entire system\u2014state governments, churches, and the federal government\u2014was geared towards supporting slavery. Lincoln's election in 1860 represented a shift in power, with a president who was against the expansion of slavery. This contradicts the idea that the federal government was entirely pledged to support slavery.\n\nMoreover, Lincoln's victory was based on a platform that opposed the expansion of slavery, which directly goes against the notion that the federal government was committed to propagating human bondage. So, in that sense, Lincoln's actions in 1860\u2014getting elected on a platform that aimed to prevent slavery from spreading into new territories\u2014contradicted Douglass's earlier assertion about the federal government's support for slavery.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Douglass himself was a strong abolitionist and likely supported Lincoln's presidency, despite their differences in approach to slavery. Douglass saw Lincoln's election as a step towards restricting slavery's expansion, which was a contradiction to the idea that the federal government was wholly in favor of slavery.\n\nIn conclusion, option C seems to be the best answer because it highlights Lincoln's stance against expanding slavery into new territories, which contradicts Douglass's earlier claim that the federal government was pledged to support and propagate slavery.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
