                    "text": "I'm looking at this poem by Dennis Brutus from 1973, and there's a line that says, \"what the world whispers / apartheid declares with snarling guns.\" The question is asking what the poet means by \"what the world whispers.\" The options are:\n\nA. The world is too afraid of South Africa to oppose apartheid.\n\nB. The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination.\n\nC. The world condemns South Africa\u2019s discrimination.\n\nD. The world economy promotes South Africa\u2019s discrimination.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the poem. It's about the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, where police in South Africa shot and killed seventy people who were protesting the pass laws\u2014laws that required black South Africans to carry passbooks to prove they had the right to be in certain areas. The poem emphasizes that these protesters were unarmed and defenseless, and that many were shot in the back while retreating.\n\nSo, the poem is clearly criticizing the South African government's policy of apartheid and the violent measures taken to enforce it. Now, the line in question is \"what the world whispers / apartheid declares with snarling guns.\" To interpret this, I need to think about what \"the world\" is doing in contrast to what apartheid is doing.\n\nOption A suggests that the world is afraid of South Africa and therefore doesn't oppose apartheid. Maybe some countries were supporting South Africa because of political or economic interests, but I'm not sure if that's what the poet is getting at here.\n\nOption B says the world engages in subtler forms of discrimination. That could be possible; perhaps the poet is suggesting that while apartheid is overt and violent, other parts of the world have more subtle forms of discrimination that aren't as openly acknowledged.\n\nOption C is that the world condemns South Africa\u2019s discrimination. That seems plausible because many countries did condemn apartheid, but the poet is saying that apartheid \"declares with snarling guns\" something that the world whispers. So, maybe apartheid is openly declaring something that the world is only softly criticizing or acknowledging.\n\nOption D suggests that the world economy promotes South Africa\u2019s discrimination. That could be referring to how some countries continued to trade with South Africa despite apartheid, perhaps propping up the regime.\n\nLet me look back at the poem. The lines before the ones in question are:\n\n\"the blood the rich lust after / South Africa spills dust\"\n\nThis seems to suggest that the rich (perhaps referring to wealthy countries or corporations) have an interest in South Africa's resources, and that this is connected to the violence of apartheid.\n\nThen comes \"Remember Sharpeville / Remember bullet-in-the-back day / And remember the unquenchable will for freedom / Remember the dead / and be glad\"\n\nSo, the poet is calling for people to remember the violence of apartheid and to be inspired by the determination for freedom.\n\nNow, going back to \"what the world whispers / apartheid declares with snarling guns,\" I think the poet is saying that apartheid openly and violently enforces discrimination, while the rest of the world maybe quietly acknowledges it or engages in similar practices but in a less obvious way.\n\nOption B seems to align with that idea: the world engages in subtler forms of discrimination, whereas apartheid is blatant and violent about it.\n\nOption C, that the world condemns South Africa\u2019s discrimination, might not fit as well because if the world is condemning apartheid, that would be the opposite of whispering\u2014it would be speaking out against it.\n\nOption A, that the world is afraid to oppose apartheid, could be a reason why the world whispers, but the poem doesn't provide enough information to confirm that.\n\nOption D, about the world economy promoting discrimination, could be related to the earlier lines about the blood the rich lust after, but it's not directly addressed in the poem.\n\nConsidering the context, I think option B is the most fitting: the world engages in subtler forms of discrimination, whereas apartheid declares it openly and violently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
