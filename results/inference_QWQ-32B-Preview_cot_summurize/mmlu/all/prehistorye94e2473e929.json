I need to figure out which term best fits the description \"the slow agency of existing causes.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"the slow agency of existing causes\" means. It seems to suggest a process that happens gradually over time, driven by current, ongoing factors. So, I'm looking for a concept that involves gradual change due to present causes.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Natural selection: This is a key mechanism in evolution, where organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. It does involve gradual change over generations, but I'm not sure if \"the slow agency of existing causes\" specifically refers to this.\n\nB. Catastrophism: This is the idea that the Earth has been shaped by sudden, catastrophic events, like floods or meteor impacts. This seems more about rapid, abrupt changes rather than slow, gradual processes. So, probably not this one.\n\nC. Uniformitarianism: This is the concept that the same geological processes we see today have been operating in the same way over geological time. It's often summarized by the phrase \"the present is the key to the past.\" This sounds a lot like a slow, gradual process driven by existing causes.\n\nD. Unilineal evolution: This is an anthropological theory that suggests human societies progress through a series of stages, from primitive to advanced, in a linear fashion. It's about cultural development over time, but I'm not sure if it specifically refers to slow, gradual change due to existing causes.\n\nComparing these, uniformitarianism seems to best fit the description \"the slow agency of existing causes\" because it explicitly deals with gradual changes over time caused by current geological processes.\n\nTo make sure, I should consider where this phrase comes from. I think it might be from Charles Lyell, a geologist who influenced Charles Darwin. Lyell talked about uniformitarianism in his work \"Principles of Geology,\" where he argued that the Earth's features are shaped by the same processes still in operation today, acting over long periods.\n\nDarwin was influenced by Lyell's ideas, which helped shape his thinking on natural selection and evolution. So, while natural selection is a process of slow, gradual change, the specific phrase \"the slow agency of existing causes\" seems more directly related to uniformitarianism.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. uniformitarianism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
