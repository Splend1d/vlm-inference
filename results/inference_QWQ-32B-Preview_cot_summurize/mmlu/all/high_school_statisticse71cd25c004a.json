This can be found using a z-table or a calculator with a normal distribution function.\n\nUsing a z-table, look up \\(z = 1.11\\):\n\n- The value for \\(z = 1.10\\) is approximately 0.8643\n- The value for \\(z = 1.11\\) is approximately 0.8665\n\nSo, the percentile rank is approximately 86.65%.\n\n### Step 3: Determine if she qualifies\n\nTo qualify for further evaluation, Estrella needs to be in the top 15%. This means she needs to be at or above the 85th percentile.\n\nHer percentile rank is 86.65%, which is above the 85th percentile.\n\nTherefore, she qualifies for further evaluation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the calculations, the correct choice is:\n\nC. 86.65; she qualified.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
