                    "text": "So I've got this question here about sorting algorithms and their dependence on the initial ordering of the input. The options are Insertion sort, Quicksort, Merge sort, and Selection sort. I need to figure out which one's running time is least affected by how the input is initially ordered.\n\nFirst, I should recall how each of these algorithms works and how their performance can be influenced by the input order.\n\nStarting with Insertion sort: It works by iterating through the list, comparing each element with the ones before it, and inserting it into its correct position. If the list is already sorted, Insertion sort can be quite efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), because it only needs to go through the list once. However, if the list is sorted in reverse order, it's O(n^2), because every element has to be compared with all the ones before it.\n\nQuicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. The performance of Quicksort can vary significantly based on the choice of the pivot. In the best case, it's O(n log n), but if the pivot selection is poor (e.g., the smallest or largest element is always chosen), it can degrade to O(n^2), especially if the input is already sorted or reverse sorted.\n\nMerge sort is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back together. Its time complexity is consistently O(n log n), regardless of the initial order of the input. This is because it always divides the list in half and merges them, without being affected by the ordering.\n\nSelection sort works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moving it to the end of the sorted part. Its time complexity is always O(n^2), because it makes n passes over the list, and each pass involves a linear search for the minimum element. The initial ordering doesn't affect its performance.\n\nSo, considering all this, which one's running time is least dependent on the initial ordering of the input?\n\nInsertion sort's time varies from O(n) to O(n^2), depending on whether the input is already sorted or not.\n\nQuicksort can be O(n log n) or O(n^2), depending on the pivot choice and input order.\n\nMerge sort is always O(n log n), regardless of the input order.\n\nSelection sort is always O(n^2),\u4e0d\u53d7\u8f93\u5165\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n\nTherefore, Merge sort seems to be the one whose running time is least dependent on the initial ordering of the input, because it consistently performs at O(n log n), without any variation based on the input order.\n\nI think the answer is C. Merge sort.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
