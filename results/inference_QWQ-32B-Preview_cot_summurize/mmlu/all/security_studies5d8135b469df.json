Human security as a concept has struggled to gain recognition amongst scholars of security studies, or in the policy-making community. There is a general failure to recognise the political and academic value of human security as a concept.\nB. The concept of human security gained increasing currency in the mid-1990s, serving to highlight critical issues. In particular, the study of human society has focuses on the problem of intra-state violence, which has become the dominant issue for post-Cold War security studies.\nC. The concept of human security does not challenge traditional state-centric arguments in so far as these concern the protection of the state from external military violence. However, it does show that state-centric realism is insufficient because it does not address the security of people within states.\nD. Human security has become the dominant concept in understanding contemporary security studies. After the end of the Cold War, the state-centric security paradigm was made irrelevant and today there is a universal understanding that human beings and individuals within states should be the focal point of security.\n"

Human security doesn't really challenge the idea of protecting the state from outside threats, but it does point out that just focusing on that isn't enough. It's important to also look at the safety and well-being of people inside the state, which traditional state-centric views might overlook.\n\nOption A seems wrong because human security has actually gained a lot of attention in both academia and policy-making circles. It's not like it's been completely ignored.\n\nOption B mentions that human security gained popularity in the mid-1990s and focused on intra-state violence, which is true. But it says that the study of human society has focused on intra-state violence as the dominant issue post-Cold War. While intra-state violence is important, I don't think it's accurate to say it's the dominant issue in security studies. There are still plenty of concerns about inter-state conflicts, terrorism, cyber security, and other issues.\n\nOption D is too strong. It says that human security has become the dominant concept and that the state-centric paradigm is irrelevant. That doesn't seem right because many countries still prioritize state security and there are ongoing debates about the balance between state security and human security.\n\nSo, C seems the most balanced and accurate. It acknowledges that human security complements traditional state-centric views but also highlights their limitations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
