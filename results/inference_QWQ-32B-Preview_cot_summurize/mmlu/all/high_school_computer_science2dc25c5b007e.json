                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: There's a sorted list of 120 integers, and I need to find out if the value 100 is in the list. It says that the most efficient searching algorithm is used, and I need to figure out the maximum number of elements that must be examined. The options are 7, 8, 20, and 100.\n\nFirst off, since the list is sorted, I know that the most efficient searching algorithm for a sorted list is the binary search. Binary search is way faster than just checking each element one by one, especially for large lists.\n\nSo, binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. You start by looking at the middle element of the list. If it's the target value (which is 100 here), then you're done. If it's higher than 100, you look at the first half of the list; if it's lower, you look at the second half. And you keep repeating this process until you either find the value or determine that it's not in the list.\n\nThe key here is that with each comparison, you're eliminating half of the remaining elements from consideration. That's why it's so efficient.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the maximum number of elements that must be examined. In binary search, the number of elements examined is logarithmic with respect to the size of the list. Specifically, in the worst case, the number of comparisons needed is the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of the number of elements in the list.\n\nSo, for a list of 120 elements, the maximum number of comparisons needed would be ceil(log2(120)).\n\nLet me calculate that. Log base 2 of 120 is approximately 6.906, and the ceiling of that is 7. So, the maximum number of comparisons needed is 7.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check that. Let's see, 2^6 is 64, and 2^7 is 128. Since 120 is between 64 and 128, the log base 2 of 120 would indeed be between 6 and 7, closer to 7. So, ceil(log2(120)) is 7.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements that must be examined is 7.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any scenario where more than 7 elements would need to be examined? Let's think about it.\n\nIn binary search, each comparison reduces the search space by half. So, starting with 120 elements:\n\n1st comparison: 120 / 2 = 60 elements remaining.\n\n2nd comparison: 60 / 2 = 30 elements remaining.\n\n3rd comparison: 30 / 2 = 15 elements remaining.\n\n4th comparison: 15 / 2 = 7.5, but since we're dealing with integers, it would be 7 or 8 elements.\n\n5th comparison: 7 / 2 = 3.5, so 3 or 4 elements.\n\n6th comparison: 3 / 2 = 1.5, so 1 or 2 elements.\n\n7th comparison: 1 element.\n\nSo, in 7 comparisons, you can narrow it down to a single element, which you then check to see if it's 100.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements that must be examined is indeed 7.\n\nWait, but the question says \"elements that must be examined.\" In binary search, do we examine the elements being compared or the ones being eliminated?\n\nActually, in each step of binary search, you examine one element: the middle element of the current search interval. You compare it to the target value and decide whether to search the left or right half.\n\nSo, in each comparison, you're examining one element.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements examined is equal to the number of comparisons, which is 7.\n\nBut let me confirm this understanding.\n\nIn the first comparison, you look at the middle element of the entire list, which is the 60th element (since indices start at 0, the middle of 0 to 119 is 59 or 60, depending on how you calculate it, but for simplicity, let's say 60th element).\n\nYou compare the 60th element to 100.\n\nIf it's equal, you're done.\n\nIf it's less than 100, you look at the second half of the list.\n\nIf it's greater than 100, you look at the first half.\n\nIn the next comparison, you look at the middle element of the remaining half, and so on.\n\nSo, in each step, only one element is examined.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements examined is 7.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nMaybe \"examined\" includes all elements that are considered during the search process, not just the ones directly compared.\n\nBut no, in binary search, only the middle element of the current interval is examined in each step.\n\nThe other elements are just part of the intervals that are eliminated based on the comparison.\n\nSo, only the middle elements are actually examined.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements examined is equal to the number of comparisons, which is 7.\n\nMoreover, in binary search, the number of comparisons is log2(n), where n is the number of elements.\n\nIn this case, log2(120) is approximately 6.906, ceiling of which is 7.\n\nSo, the answer should be 7.\n\nBut let's consider that the list has 120 elements, which is not a power of 2.\n\nDoes that affect the number of comparisons?\n\nLet's see, for a list of size n, the maximum number of comparisons in binary search is floor(log2(n)) + 1.\n\nSo, log2(120) is approximately 6.906, floor of that is 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, ceil(log2(n)).\n\nEither way, it's 7.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of elements that must be examined is 7.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 7.\n\nBut let's look at the options again: A. 7, B. 8, C. 20, D. 100.\n\nGiven that, 7 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different perspective.\n\nWait, maybe the question is considering linear search, not binary search.\n\nBut it says \"the most efficient searching algorithm,\" which for a sorted list is binary search.\n\nIf it were linear search, you might have to examine up to all 120 elements in the worst case.\n\nBut that's not efficient.\n\nSo, definitely, binary search is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking about interpolation search, which can be faster than binary search for certain distributions, but that's more advanced, and I think for this context, binary search is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's considering that the list might have duplicates.\n\nBut even if there are duplicates, binary search still applies, and the number of comparisons is still logarithmic.\n\nUnless there are specifics about the distribution of values, but the question doesn't provide that.\n\nTherefore, I think A. 7 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
