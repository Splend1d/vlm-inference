                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about the tropical rain forests near the equator, and how they're being cut down for two main reasons: to get exotic woods to sell to the U.S., and to make space for grazing beef cattle. So, it's talking about deforestation and its consequences.\n\nThe question asks for a negative consequence of clear-cutting these forests. So, I need to pick the option that describes something bad or harmful that happens because of this practice.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Indigenous populations will have access to modern conveniences.\n\nHmm, this seems like it could be seen as a positive thing, right? Getting modern stuff like electricity, roads, maybe schools and hospitals. But the question is asking for a negative consequence. So, maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nWait a minute, but perhaps there's more to it. Clear-cutting might bring in loggers and cattle ranchers, who might bring modern conveniences, but at the cost of displacing or disrupting the indigenous populations' way of life. So, maybe it's not entirely positive for them. But the statement itself says \"access to modern conveniences,\" which sounds positive, so maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B: There will be less precipitation in those clear-cut areas.\n\nThis sounds like a negative consequence. Rain forests are known for their high rainfall and humidity. If you cut down the trees, you might disrupt the water cycle. Trees release water vapor into the air through transpiration, which contributes to cloud formation and rainfall. So, without the trees, there might be less precipitation.\n\nI think this is a valid negative consequence. But let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption C: U.S. markets will have access to less expensive beef.\n\nThis seems like a positive thing for the U.S. markets, right? Cheaper beef. But the question is asking for a negative consequence, so from the perspective of the rain forest and the environment, this might be bad because it's encouraging deforestation to produce cheaper beef. But the statement itself is about the benefit to U.S. markets, not the negative impact.\n\nSo, perhaps this isn't the best choice, unless we consider the environmental cost, but the statement itself doesn't mention that.\n\nOption D: Deforestation will allow more sunlight to penetrate areas that were kept dark by dense vegetation.\n\nAgain, this sounds like a neutral or even positive thing at first, but in reality, allowing more sunlight to penetrate can have negative effects. For example, it can lead to soil erosion because the soil is no longer protected by the forest canopy. Increased sunlight can also alter the local ecosystem, killing certain plants that don't thrive in full sun, and potentially leading to a loss of biodiversity.\n\nSo, this could be considered a negative consequence.\n\nNow, comparing options B and D, both seem like negative consequences, but option B specifically mentions less precipitation, which is a well-known effect of deforestation in rain forests. Disrupting the water cycle can lead to droughts and other climate changes, which are definitely negative.\n\nOption D is also negative, but perhaps less directly harmful than changing the precipitation patterns.\n\nSo, I think option B is the best answer here.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A might not be entirely negative, but it's not directly harmful like the others.\n\nOption C is more of a positive for U.S. markets, but negative for the environment.\n\nOption D is negative for the ecosystem.\n\nBut overall, option B seems to be the most straightforward negative consequence related to the clear-cutting of tropical rain forests.\n\nSo, I'll go with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
