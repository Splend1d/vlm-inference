                    "text": "Let's think about these scenarios one by one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is borrowing their friend's car frequently and decides to fill up the gas tank without telling her. So, they're using the car a lot and, as a gesture, they refill the gas without informing their friend.\n\nHmm, is that morally wrong? Well, borrowing a friend's car is one thing, but taking it upon oneself to fill the gas tank without discussing it with the friend could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The friend might have preferred to handle the gas refills themselves or might have specific preferences about where or when to fill up.\n\nOn the other hand, it could be considered thoughtful if the friend appreciates the gesture. But since the character didn't communicate about it, it's a bit unclear. Maybe it's not necessarily wrong, but perhaps a better approach would be to ask the friend if they'd like help with gas refills.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: The main character has lice in their hair and decides to lend their sister their hairbrush.\n\nOkay, lice are parasites that can infest hair and are highly contagious. Lending a hairbrush with lice eggs or live lice to a sister would likely spread the lice to the sister.\n\nIs that morally wrong? Well, lice can cause discomfort, itching, and require time and effort to treat. Knowing that they have lice and still lending the hairbrush seems negligent and potentially harmful.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, it's important to consider the well-being of others and to avoid actions that could harm them, especially when it's preventable.\n\nSo, in this case, lending the hairbrush with lice to the sister seems clearly morally wrong because it endangers the sister's comfort and health.\n\nLooking back at Scenario 1, it's more ambiguous. Filling up the gas tank without asking could be seen as either helpful or overbearing, but it doesn't directly harm the friend. In contrast, Scenario 2 involves actively spreading a parasite that can cause discomfort and requires effort to eliminate.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 1 is not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
