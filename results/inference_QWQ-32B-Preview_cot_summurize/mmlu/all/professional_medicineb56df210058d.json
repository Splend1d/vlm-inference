                    "text": "Let's think about this problem step by step. We have a healthy 22-year-old man who has just consumed an 800-calorie meal with protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without eating or drinking anything else. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration is still within the normal range. We need to figure out which mechanism is most likely responsible for maintaining his blood glucose level during this time.\n\nFirst, let's recall that glucose is essential for many bodily functions, especially the brain, which relies heavily on glucose for energy. Therefore, the body has several mechanisms to maintain blood glucose levels within a narrow range, even when we're not eating.\n\nOption A suggests that continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal is responsible. However, the man has been sleeping for 12 hours without any additional food or drink. Typically, the digestion and absorption of a meal take several hours, but by the 12-hour mark, most of the nutrients should have already been absorbed. So, it's unlikely that continued gut absorption is still providing significant amounts of glucose at this point.\n\nOption B proposes that glucose is being released from skeletal muscle. But actually, skeletal muscle usually takes up glucose from the blood, especially in the presence of insulin, rather than releasing it. Muscle cells can store glucose as glycogen, but they generally don't release glucose into the bloodstream because they lack the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which is necessary for releasing glucose. Therefore, this option seems unlikely.\n\nOption C mentions glycogenolysis in the liver. The liver is a key organ in glucose regulation. It stores glucose as glycogen and can break it down through glycogenolysis to release glucose into the bloodstream when needed. Since the man hasn't eaten for 12 hours, his blood glucose levels might start to drop, triggering the liver to release glucose through glycogenolysis to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range. This seems like a plausible mechanism.\n\nOption D suggests increased leptin release from adipose tissues. Leptin is a hormone produced by adipocytes (fat cells) that helps regulate energy balance and appetite. It signals to the brain that energy stores are sufficient, which can lead to a reduction in food intake. However, leptin doesn't directly affect blood glucose levels. Therefore, it's unlikely that increased leptin release is directly involved in maintaining serum glucose concentration in this scenario.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely mechanism involved in maintaining the man's serum glucose concentration 12 hours after eating is glycogenolysis in the liver.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
