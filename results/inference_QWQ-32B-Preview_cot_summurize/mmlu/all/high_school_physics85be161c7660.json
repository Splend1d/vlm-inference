                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about elastic collisions, and I need to figure out what minimum information is required to determine the mass of the second object in a collision between two masses, where one is moving and the other is stationary. The first object has a mass m1, and it collides elastically with a stationary object of unknown mass. I need to find out what additional information would allow me to find the mass of the second object.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The final speed of object 1\n\nB. The initial speed of object 1\n\nC. The final speed of object 2\n\nD. Any 2 of the above values\n\nOkay, so first, I need to recall the principles of elastic collisions. In an elastic collision, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. That's important because it gives me two equations to work with.\n\nSo, for two objects colliding elastically, the conservation of momentum says:\n\nm1 * u1 + m2 * u2 = m1 * v1 + m2 * v2\n\nWhere:\n\n- u1 and u2 are the initial velocities of objects 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n- v1 and v2 are the final velocities of objects 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nAnd since object 2 is initially stationary, u2 = 0.\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\nm1 * u1 = m1 * v1 + m2 * v2\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nThe conservation of kinetic energy for an elastic collision is:\n\n(1/2)m1*u1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2*u2\u00b2 = (1/2)m1*v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2*v2\u00b2\n\nAgain, since u2 = 0, this simplifies to:\n\n(1/2)m1*u1\u00b2 = (1/2)m1*v1\u00b2 + (1/2)m2*v2\u00b2\n\nI can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fractions:\n\nm1*u1\u00b2 = m1*v1\u00b2 + m2*v2\u00b2\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. m1*u1 = m1*v1 + m2*v2\n\n2. m1*u1\u00b2 = m1*v1\u00b2 + m2*v2\u00b2\n\nI need to solve these equations for m2, the unknown mass. But to do that, I need to know some of the velocities involved.\n\nLet's see what options are given:\n\nA. The final speed of object 1 (v1)\n\nB. The initial speed of object 1 (u1)\n\nC. The final speed of object 2 (v2)\n\nD. Any 2 of the above values\n\nSo, I need to figure out what's the minimal information required to find m2.\n\nLet me try to see if knowing just one of these is enough.\n\nOption A: knowing v1\n\nIf I know v1, and I already know m1 and u1 (since it's the initial speed of object 1), then looking at the two equations:\n\n1. m1*u1 = m1*v1 + m2*v2\n\n2. m1*u1\u00b2 = m1*v1\u00b2 + m2*v2\u00b2\n\nI still have two unknowns here: m2 and v2. So, I can't solve for m2 without knowing at least one more variable.\n\nOption B: knowing u1\n\nWell, u1 is the initial speed of object 1. But without knowing any final speeds, I don't see how this helps me find m2. I already have m1 and u1 in both equations, but without knowing at least one final velocity, I can't solve for m2.\n\nOption C: knowing v2\n\nIf I know v2, and I know m1 and u1, then looking at the two equations:\n\n1. m1*u1 = m1*v1 + m2*v2\n\n2. m1*u1\u00b2 = m1*v1\u00b2 + m2*v2\u00b2\n\nNow, I know m1, u1, and v2. I still have v1 and m2 as unknowns.\n\nBut perhaps I can solve for v1 from the first equation and plug it into the second equation to solve for m2.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nm1*u1 - m1*v1 = m2*v2\n\nSo, v1 = u1 - (m2*v2)/m1\n\nNow, plug this into equation 2:\n\nm1*u1\u00b2 = m1*(u1 - (m2*v2)/m1)\u00b2 + m2*v2\u00b2\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nm1*u1\u00b2 = m1*(u1\u00b2 - 2*u1*(m2*v2)/m1 + (m2*v2)^2 / m1\u00b2) + m2*v2\u00b2\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in elastic collisions, there's a specific relationship between the velocities.\n\nI recall that for elastic collisions in one dimension, there's a formula that relates the final velocities to the masses and initial velocities.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nv1 = (u1*(m1 - m2) + 2*m2*u2)/(m1 + m2)\n\nv2 = (u2*(m2 - m1) + 2*m1*u1)/(m1 + m2)\n\nBut since object 2 is initially stationary, u2 = 0, so these simplify to:\n\nv1 = (u1*(m1 - m2))/(m1 + m2)\n\nv2 = (2*m1*u1)/(m1 + m2)\n\nThese might be more helpful.\n\nSo, v1 = [u1*(m1 - m2)] / (m1 + m2)\n\nAnd v2 = [2*m1*u1] / (m1 + m2)\n\nNow, if I know v1 and u1, and m1, can I solve for m2?\n\nLet's see:\n\nv1 = [u1*(m1 - m2)] / (m1 + m2)\n\nLet's rearrange this:\n\nv1*(m1 + m2) = u1*(m1 - m2)\n\nv1*m1 + v1*m2 = u1*m1 - u1*m2\n\nNow, group terms with m2:\n\nv1*m2 + u1*m2 = u1*m1 - v1*m1\n\nm2*(v1 + u1) = m1*(u1 - v1)\n\nTherefore, m2 = [m1*(u1 - v1)] / (u1 + v1)\n\nSo, if I know u1 and v1, and m1, I can find m2.\n\nSimilarly, if I know v2 and u1, and m1, can I find m2?\n\nFrom v2 = [2*m1*u1] / (m1 + m2)\n\nLet's solve for m2:\n\nv2*(m1 + m2) = 2*m1*u1\n\nv2*m1 + v2*m2 = 2*m1*u1\n\nv2*m2 = 2*m1*u1 - v2*m1\n\nm2 = [2*m1*u1 - v2*m1] / v2\n\nFactor m1:\n\nm2 = m1*(2*u1 - v2) / v2\n\nSo, yes, if I know v2, u1, and m1, I can find m2.\n\nNow, what if I only know u1? Well, without knowing at least one final velocity, I can't solve for m2.\n\nSo, it seems that knowing either v1 or v2, along with u1 and m1, allows me to find m2.\n\nBut the question is, what is the minimum necessary information?\n\nOption A says \"the final speed of object 1\", which is v1.\n\nOption B says \"the initial speed of object 1\", which is u1.\n\nOption C says \"the final speed of object 2\", which is v2.\n\nOption D says \"any 2 of the above values\".\n\nGiven that, if I know any two of these, can I find m2?\n\nWell, if I know u1 and v1, yes, as shown earlier.\n\nIf I know u1 and v2, yes, as shown earlier.\n\nWhat if I know v1 and v2, but not u1?\n\nIs that sufficient?\n\nLet me see.\n\nFrom the earlier equations:\n\nv1 = [u1*(m1 - m2)] / (m1 + m2)\n\nv2 = [2*m1*u1] / (m1 + m2)\n\nIf I know v1 and v2, but not u1, can I find m2?\n\nWell, from the second equation, u1 = (v2*(m1 + m2))/(2*m1)\n\nThen plug this into the first equation:\n\nv1 = [ (v2*(m1 + m2))/(2*m1) * (m1 - m2) ] / (m1 + m2)\n\nSimplify:\n\nv1 = [ v2*(m1 - m2)/(2*m1) ]\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, from u1 = (v2*(m1 + m2))/(2*m1)\n\nPlugging into v1:\n\nv1 = [ u1*(m1 - m2) ] / (m1 + m2)\n\n= [ (v2*(m1 + m2))/(2*m1) * (m1 - m2) ] / (m1 + m2)\n\n= [ v2*(m1 - m2) ] / (2*m1)\n\nSo, v1 = [ v2*(m1 - m2) ] / (2*m1)\n\nNow, this is an equation with m1 and m2.\n\nI can rearrange it:\n\nv1 = [ v2*(m1 - m2) ] / (2*m1)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2*m1:\n\n2*m1*v1 = v2*(m1 - m2)\n\n2*m1*v1 = v2*m1 - v2*m2\n\nBring terms with m2 to one side:\n\nv2*m2 = v2*m1 - 2*m1*v1\n\nm2 = m1*(v2 - 2*v1)/v2\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right because if v2 = 2*v1, m2 would be zero, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better approach.\n\nLet me consider the ratio of v2 to v1.\n\nFrom the earlier expressions:\n\nv2 = [2*m1*u1]/(m1 + m2)\n\nv1 = [u1*(m1 - m2)]/(m1 + m2)\n\nSo, v2/v1 = [2*m1*u1]/(m1 + m2) divided by [u1*(m1 - m2)]/(m1 + m2)\n\n= [2*m1*u1] / [u1*(m1 - m2)]\n\n= 2*m1 / (m1 - m2)\n\nSo, v2/v1 = 2*m1 / (m1 - m2)\n\nThis is an equation that relates v2, v1, and m2.\n\nBut without knowing u1, can I solve for m2? It seems complicated.\n\nIt might be possible, but it's not straightforward. It's easier when I have u1 known along with either v1 or v2.\n\nTherefore, it seems that knowing any two of the three values (u1, v1, v2) would allow me to find m2.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if knowing only one of them is sufficient.\n\nIf I only know u1, without any final velocities, I can't find m2, as there are too many unknowns.\n\nIf I only know v1, can I find m2?\n\nFrom earlier, v1 = [u1*(m1 - m2)] / (m1 + m2)\n\nThis is one equation with two unknowns (m2 and u1), so no, I can't find m2 without knowing u1.\n\nSimilarly, if I only know v2, from v2 = [2*m1*u1]/(m1 + m2), again, two unknowns: m2 and u1.\n\nSo, knowing only one of them isn't enough.\n\nTherefore, the minimum necessary information is any two of the three values: u1, v1, v2.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Any 2 of the above values.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf I know u1 and v1, I can find m2, as shown earlier.\n\nIf I know u1 and v2, I can find m2.\n\nIf I know v1 and v2, I can find m2, although it's a bit more involved.\n\nTherefore, any two of these values are sufficient to determine m2.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
