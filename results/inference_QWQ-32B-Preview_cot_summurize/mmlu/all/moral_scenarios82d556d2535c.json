                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I ate the cookies my mother bought for my brother.\n\n2. I fed the hungry child some boiling soup.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if it's morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I ate the cookies my mother bought for my brother.\n\nHmm, this seems like a situation where I took something that wasn't meant for me. My mother bought the cookies for my brother, so technically, they aren't mine to eat. Eating them might be seen as being selfish or not considering my brother's feelings.\n\nBut, depending on the context, maybe it's not that bad. Maybe my brother doesn't mind, or maybe there are plenty of cookies, so taking a few wouldn't hurt. However, since it's specifically stated that the cookies were bought for my brother, it seems like I shouldn't have eaten them without asking first.\n\nIn general, taking something that belongs to someone else without their permission is considered wrong. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems like it's wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I fed the hungry child some boiling soup.\n\nThis one sounds more serious. Feeding a child boiling soup sounds dangerous because boiling soup can cause severe burns. If the child is hungry, it's important to feed them, but doing so with something that's too hot could harm them.\n\nIn this case, it seems like there was a failure to consider the child's safety. Providing food that's not suitable or safe for consumption, especially to a child, would be considered morally wrong because it puts the child at risk of harm.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong for different reasons.\n\nIn Scenario 1, it's about taking something that isn't yours without permission, which is a matter of respect for others' property.\n\nIn Scenario 2, it's about endangering someone's well-being by giving them something that could cause them harm, which is a matter of care and responsibility towards others.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions would be considered wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way that Scenario 1 could be considered not wrong?\n\nWell, maybe if the cookies were meant for the whole family, and my mother wouldn't mind if I ate some. But the scenario specifies that the cookies were bought for my brother, so it's more likely that they were intended specifically for him.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if I ate the cookies because I was extremely hungry and there was nothing else to eat, but even then, it's not justified to take something that was intended for someone else.\n\nSo, it still seems wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 2: feeding a hungry child boiling soup.\n\nI can't see any situation where this would be considered okay. It's negligent and could cause serious injury.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
