                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about contingency tables for chi-square tests for independence. So, we have four statements here, and we need to figure out which one isn't true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The categories are not numerical for either variable.\" Hmm, in contingency tables, we're dealing with categorical data, right? So, the variables are categorical, meaning they fall into specific categories, not numerical values. For example, gender (male, female) or type of car (sedan, SUV, etc.). So, this seems correct. Chi-square tests for independence are used to see if there's a relationship between two categorical variables.\n\nOption B: \"Observed frequencies should be whole numbers.\" That makes sense because observed frequencies represent counts of occurrences in each category combination. You can't have a fraction of an observation in a category; it's always a whole number. So, this seems accurate too.\n\nOption C: \"Expected frequencies should be whole numbers.\" Now, this one is interesting. Expected frequencies are calculated based on the assumption that the two variables are independent. The formula for expected frequency in a cell is (row total * column total) / grand total. These calculations can result in decimal numbers, right? So, do expected frequencies have to be whole numbers? I don't think so. They're just expectations based on the independence assumption and can be decimals. So, this might not be true.\n\nOption D: \"Expected frequencies in each cell should be at least 5, and to achieve this, one sometimes combines categories for one or the other or both of the variables.\" This is a rule of thumb in chi-square tests. We aim for expected frequencies to be at least 5 in each cell to meet the test's assumptions. If some expected frequencies are less than 5, we might need to combine categories to increase those frequencies. So, this seems correct.\n\nGiven that, it looks like option C might be the one that's not true. Expected frequencies don't have to be whole numbers; they can be decimals. Observed frequencies are always whole numbers because they represent counts, but expected frequencies are just calculations based on the data.\n\nTo double-check, let's recall that in a chi-square test for independence, the chi-square statistic is calculated by comparing observed frequencies to expected frequencies using the formula: \u03a3[(O - E)^2 / E], where O is observed frequency and E is expected frequency. Here, E can be a decimal, and the formula works with decimal values.\n\nSo, yes, expected frequencies don't need to be whole numbers. It's okay for them to be decimals as long as they meet the assumption of being at least 5 in each cell.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
