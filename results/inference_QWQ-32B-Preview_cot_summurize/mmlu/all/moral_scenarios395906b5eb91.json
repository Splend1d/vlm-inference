The options are:\n\nScenario 1: One day I just left work and picked my kid up from school myself.\n\nScenario 2: At the dinner party, I served perfectly cooked chicken.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I left work early to pick my kid up from school myself.\n\nHmm, leaving work early might be against company policy, but is it morally wrong? In general, parents are expected to take care of their children, and picking them up from school is a responsible act. If I left work early without permission, that might be unethical towards my employer, but is it morally wrong?\n\nIn the US, as of 2020, there's a growing recognition of work-life balance, and many employers are more understanding of personal responsibilities, especially concerning children. However, without knowing the specifics of the job and the company's policies, it's hard to say.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, prioritizing your child's needs is generally seen as positive. So, unless there are extenuating circumstances, leaving work to pick up your kid doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: At the dinner party, I served perfectly cooked chicken.\n\nServing chicken at a dinner party seems perfectly normal and acceptable. In fact, it's a common dish in many cultures. If the chicken is perfectly cooked, that's even better, as it likely pleased the guests.\n\nIs there anything morally wrong with serving chicken at a dinner party? Well, some people might have ethical objections to eating meat, but in general, in the US as of 2020, consuming and serving chicken is considered acceptable by ordinary moral standards.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to be not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way that Scenario 1 could be considered morally wrong? Maybe if leaving work early meant that a colleague had to cover my duties, and that caused problems for them. But again, that seems more like a workplace issue rather than a moral wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 2: serving chicken. Again, some might argue ethical issues regarding animal welfare, but in general, it's accepted.\n\nI think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
