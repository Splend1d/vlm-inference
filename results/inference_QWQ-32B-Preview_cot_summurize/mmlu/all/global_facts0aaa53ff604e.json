So, the closest answer would be:\n\nA. 5%\n\nBut actually, it's closer to 9%, which isn't an option here. The options provided might be a bit outdated or perhaps there's a mistake in the options. As of 2019, it was around 9%, but if we have to choose from the given options, A. 5% is the closest, although not entirely accurate.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nWorld Bank. (2020).

[Link](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/33729)\n\n**Note:**\n\nIt's important to note that the global extreme poverty rate has been decreasing over the decades, but progress has been uneven across regions. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on global poverty levels, potentially reversing some of the gains made in recent years."
