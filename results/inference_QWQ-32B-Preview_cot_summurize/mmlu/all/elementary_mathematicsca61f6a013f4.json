                    "text": "So Michelle did 45 push-ups every day in January, and January has 31 days. She wants to find out the total number of push-ups she did in the whole month. She used the expression 31 times 45 to calculate that. So, I need to figure out what 31 multiplied by 45 is.\n\nFirst, I can try to multiply 30 times 45 and then add one more 45 because 31 is like 30 plus 1.\n\nSo, 30 times 45 would be 30 \u00d7 45. I know that 30 \u00d7 40 is 1200, and 30 \u00d7 5 is 150, so adding those together is 1200 plus 150, which is 1350.\n\nThen, I need to add one more 45 because it's 31 times 45, not just 30. So, 1350 plus 45 is 1395.\n\nLet me check that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down differently. I can think of 45 as 40 plus 5, so 31 times 45 is the same as 31 times 40 plus 31 times 5.\n\nFirst, 31 times 40. Well, 30 times 40 is 1200, and 1 times 40 is 40, so together that's 1240.\n\nThen, 31 times 5. 30 times 5 is 150, and 1 times 5 is 5, so that's 155.\n\nNow, adding those two results together: 1240 plus 155. 1240 plus 100 is 1340, and then plus 55 is 1395.\n\nOkay, so both ways I get 1395. Let me see what the options are.\n\nA. 125 push-ups\n\nThat seems way too low.\n\nB. 279 push-ups\n\nStill too low.\n\nC. 1,395 push-ups\n\nThat matches what I calculated.\n\nD. 1,406 push-ups\n\nThat's higher than 1395.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. 1,395 push-ups.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\n31 times 45.\n\nI can also multiply 45 by 31 directly.\n\n45 times 1 is 45.\n\n45 times 30 is 1350.\n\nAdding them together: 45 plus 1350 is 1395.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use long multiplication.\n\n   45\n\n\u00d7 31\n\n------\n\n   45 \u00d7 1 = 45\n\n   45 \u00d7 30 = 1350\n\n------\n\nTotal: 1395\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 1,395 push-ups.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1395} \\]"
