I need to figure out which statement is true based on this information.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what appreciation and depreciation mean in this context. When a currency appreciates, it means it becomes more valuable compared to another currency. Conversely, when it depreciates, it becomes less valuable.\n\nSo, if the euro was trading at $1.36 yesterday and now it's at $1.40, that means it's worth more in US dollars now than it was yesterday. Therefore, the euro has appreciated against the US dollar.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The U.S. dollar has appreciated.\n\nWait, if the euro has become more valuable in terms of US dollars, that would mean the US dollar has depreciated, not appreciated. Because it now takes more dollars to buy the same euro.\n\nB. The euro has depreciated.\n\nBut according to my earlier reasoning, the euro has appreciated, so this would be incorrect.\n\nC. Interest rates in the United States have decreased.\n\nI don't have any information about interest rates here. The question is only about exchange rates, so I can't infer anything about interest rates from this information alone.\n\nD. The euro has appreciated.\n\nThis seems consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be D. The euro has appreciated.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about it from another angle. If I have 1 euro, yesterday I could get $1.36 for it, and today I can get $1.40. That means my euro can buy more dollars now, so the euro has become more valuable\u2014that is, it has appreciated.\n\nAlternatively, if I look at it from the US dollar perspective, yesterday, to buy 1 euro, I needed $1.36, but today I need $1.40. So, it costs more dollars to buy the same euro, which means the dollar has depreciated.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect, and option D is correct.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the euro has actually appreciated.\n\nOption C is irrelevant here since there's no information about interest rates.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. The euro has appreciated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
