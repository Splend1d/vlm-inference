So, Dr. Vasquez provides secretarial services and office space to Dr. Banquist, and in exchange, he gets 20% of the fees that Dr. Banquist collects from her therapy clients. Then, when Dr. Vasquez can't see all the clients who want therapy, he refers some to Dr. Banquist and charges her 30% of the fees collected from these referred clients. The question is asking, according to the ethics codes of the American and Canadian Psychological Associations, is charging more for referred clients unethical or ethical, and why.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"fee splitting\" is and what the ethics codes say about it. From what I recall, fee splitting is when a psychologist shares fees with another person who isn't qualified to provide psychological services. It's generally considered unethical because it can compromise professional judgment and create conflicts of interest.\n\nIn this scenario, Dr. Vasquez is providing secretarial services and office space to Dr. Banquist, and they have an agreement where he gets 20% of her fees. This seems like a form of fee splitting, but maybe it's acceptable because he's providing valuable services in return.\n\nThen, when Dr. Vasquez refers clients to Dr. Banquist, he charges her 30% of the fees from those clients. This seems similar to fee splitting as well, but perhaps there are different considerations for referrals.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. \"Unethical because it violates the prohibition against 'fee splitting.'\"\n\nThis seems plausible, but I need to consider if there are exceptions or specific conditions under which fee splitting is allowed.\n\nB. Unethical because it creates an unacceptable multiple relationship.\n\nA multiple relationship occurs when a psychologist has more than one kind of relationship with a client, which can potentially harm the client. In this case, Dr. Vasquez is referring clients to Dr. Banquist and charging a percentage of the fees, which might create a conflict of interest or influence his referral decisions.\n\nC. Ethical only if the higher fee for referred clients reflects the actual costs associated with the referrals.\n\nThis suggests that if the 30% charged is commensurate with the actual costs Dr. Vasquez incurs in making the referrals, then it might be ethical. This seems reasonable, but I need to check if the ethics codes allow for such arrangements.\n\nD. \"Ethical because referral fees are prohibited only when they are 'clearly exploitative.'\"\n\nThis option suggests that referral fees are only unethical if they are exploitative, implying that in other cases, they might be acceptable.\n\nTo make a informed decision, I should look up the specific ethics codes from the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA).\n\nStarting with the APA Ethics Code:\n\nStandard 6.04 Fees and Financial Arrangements states that psychologists do not engage in fee splitting with a referral source and do not give or receive payment solely for the purpose of making a referral to another party.\n\nFurthermore, Standard 3.05 Barter Therapy allows for bartering only if it is not clinically contraindicated, is based on the consent of the client, and the arrangement is not exploitative.\n\nIn this scenario, Dr. Vasquez is providing services (secretarial and office space) in exchange for a percentage of Dr. Banquist's fees. This could be seen as a form of barter, but the ethics code is more specific about fee splitting with referral sources.\n\nDr. Vasquez is referring clients to Dr. Banquist and charging a percentage of the fees collected from those clients. According to APA standards, fee splitting with referral sources is prohibited.\n\nSimilarly, the CPA Code of Ethics likely has similar provisions against fee splitting and multiple relationships that could compromise professional judgment.\n\nGiven this information, option A seems to be the correct answer: it's unethical because it violates the prohibition against fee splitting.\n\nHowever, let's consider the other options to be thorough.\n\nOption B suggests that it's unethical because it creates an unacceptable multiple relationship. While it's true that Dr. Vasquez and Dr. Banquist have a professional relationship and a financial arrangement, the specific issue here is the fee splitting related to referrals. So, while multiple relationships can be a concern, the core issue seems to be fee splitting.\n\nOption C proposes that it's ethical if the higher fee reflects actual costs. This might be relevant in some business contexts, but in professional psychology, ethics codes generally prohibit fee splitting, regardless of the costs involved. So, even if the 30% charged corresponds to actual costs, the arrangement may still be considered unethical.\n\nOption D suggests that referral fees are only prohibited when clearly exploitative. However, the APA ethics code doesn't make this distinction; it generally prohibits fee splitting with referral sources, unless it's a standard commission paid by an employer.\n\nTherefore, based on the APA and likely CPA ethics codes, the correct answer is A: it's unethical because it violates the prohibition against fee splitting.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
