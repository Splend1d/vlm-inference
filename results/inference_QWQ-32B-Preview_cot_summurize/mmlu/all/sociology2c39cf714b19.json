                    "text": "So I've got this question here about \u00c9mile Durkheim and his thoughts on what sociology should primarily focus on. The options are social action, social facts, class relations, and cultural dynamics. I need to figure out which one Durkheim believed was the main focus of sociology.\n\nFirst, I remember that Durkheim was one of the founding fathers of sociology, along with Max Weber and Karl Marx, but each had their own take on what sociology should be about. Durkheim seemed to have a different approach compared to Weber, who focused a lot on social action.\n\nSocial action is more about how individuals act based on their meanings and intentions, right? That sounds like Weber's idea. Durkheim, on the other hand, seemed to emphasize something different.\n\nI think Durkheim introduced the concept of \"social facts.\" I recall that social facts are ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that exist outside any one individual and exert influence on the individual. So, according to Durkheim, these social facts are like external forces that shape our behavior and consciousness.\n\nIn his book \"Rules of Sociological Method,\" Durkheim argued that sociology should study social facts, treating them as things, meaning they have an objective reality that can be observed and measured. He believed that by studying social facts, sociologists could understand the structure and functioning of society.\n\nNow, class relations sound more like Karl Marx's focus. Marx was all about the conflicts between different classes in society, like the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Durkheim, while he did consider issues of social inequality, wasn't as focused on class relations as Marx was.\n\nAs for cultural dynamics, that seems broad and could encompass various aspects of culture and how they change over time. While Durkheim did study aspects of culture, like religion and morality, his primary emphasis was on social facts as the building blocks of social life.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the answer is B. Social facts. Durkheim believed that sociology should primarily focus on social facts because they are the fundamental elements that constitute society and influence individual behavior.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check. Social action is more Weber's thing, social facts are Durkheim's, class relations are Marx's, and cultural dynamics doesn't seem to fit directly with Durkheim's work, although he did study cultural phenomena.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty confident with B. Social facts as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
