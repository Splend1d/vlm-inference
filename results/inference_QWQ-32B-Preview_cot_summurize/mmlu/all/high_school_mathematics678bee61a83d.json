                    "text": "So I have this problem here: a number has prime factors 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31. And I need to figure out which of the options A through D must be a factor of that number. The options are 4, 6, 10, and 15.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to have these prime factors. If a number's prime factors are 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31, that means the number can be expressed as a product of these primes, possibly raised to some powers. So, the number n can be written as:\n\nn = 2^a * 5^b * 7^c * 13^d * 31^e\n\nwhere a, b, c, d, and e are positive integers.\n\nNow, I need to determine which of the options A (4), B (6), C (10), or D (15) must be a factor of n.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: 4\n\nI know that 4 is equal to 2 squared (2^2). So, for 4 to be a factor of n, n must have at least two 2's in its prime factorization. That is, a must be at least 2.\n\nBut looking at the prime factorization of n, a is just the exponent of 2, and it's given that 2 is a prime factor, which means a is at least 1. However, it doesn't specify that a is at least 2. So, it's possible that a = 1, in which case 4 would not be a factor of n.\n\nTherefore, 4 does not necessarily have to be a factor of n.\n\nOption B: 6\n\n6 can be factored into primes as 2 * 3. So, for 6 to be a factor of n, n must have at least one 2 and one 3 in its prime factorization.\n\nLooking back at the prime factors of n, they are 2, 5, 7, 13, and 31. There is no 3 listed among the prime factors. Therefore, n does not have 3 as a prime factor, so 6 cannot be a factor of n.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is which of these must be a factor of the number. Since 6 cannot be a factor of n because 3 is not a prime factor of n, then 6 is not a factor. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption C: 10\n\n10 can be factored into primes as 2 * 5. So, for 10 to be a factor of n, n must have at least one 2 and one 5 in its prime factorization.\n\nLooking back at the prime factors of n, both 2 and 5 are present. Therefore, n must have at least one 2 and one 5, which means 10 must be a factor of n.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nOption D: 15\n\n15 can be factored into primes as 3 * 5. So, for 15 to be a factor of n, n must have at least one 3 and one 5 in its prime factorization.\n\nLooking back at the prime factors of n, 5 is present, but 3 is not. Therefore, 15 cannot be a factor of n.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the only option that must be a factor of n is 10.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider if there's any possibility that another option could be a factor.\n\nFor option A (4), as I thought earlier, if a = 1, then 4 is not a factor. So, it's not necessarily a factor.\n\nFor option B (6), since 3 is not a prime factor of n, 6 cannot be a factor.\n\nFor option C (10), since both 2 and 5 are prime factors, 10 must be a factor.\n\nFor option D (15), since 3 is not a prime factor, 15 cannot be a factor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
