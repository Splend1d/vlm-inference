The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I pawned my husband's prized guitar to pay for his heart operation.\n\nScenario 2: I didn't get the office job because I bombed the building.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's look at Scenario 1 first. So, the person pawns their husband's prized guitar to pay for his heart operation. Hmm, this seems like a tough decision. On one hand, pawning something without permission might be considered wrong because it's interfering with his property. But on the other hand, it's to pay for a necessary heart operation, which is to save his life. So, maybe in this context, it's seen as a desperate act out of love and necessity.\n\nIn the US, moral standards might consider that saving a life is a top priority, and perhaps sacrificing property for that is acceptable. Plus, it's their husband's guitar, so there might be an assumption that they have a shared interest in each other's well-being. So, maybe this isn't clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I didn't get the office job because I bombed the building. This seems pretty straightforward. Bombing a building is a serious crime and morally wrong. It causes harm to people and property. There's no justification for that kind of action in ordinary moral standards.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 might not be clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 definitely is.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. In Scenario 1, pawning the guitar without permission could be seen as wrong, but in the context of saving a life, it might be forgiven. Whereas bombing a building is unequivocally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Scenario 1 is wrong because it's taking someone's property without their consent, even for a good cause. But in emergency situations, sometimes necessary actions are taken that might normally be considered wrong.\n\nPerhaps it's a gray area, but compared to bombing a building, which is clearly wrong, Scenario 1 might be considered not wrong, or at least less wrong.\n\nSo, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
