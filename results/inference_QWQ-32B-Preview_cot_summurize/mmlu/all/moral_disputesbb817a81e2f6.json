                    "text": " So I'm reading this objection to care ethics, and it's saying that care ethics seems to suggest we're responsible for our attitudes, even though these attitudes don't seem to be under our voluntary control. And then Collins responds to this objection. The question is, how does Collins respond? The options are:\n\nA. Caring attitudes are not moral attitudes at all.\n\nB. We can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly.\n\nC. When we fail to have attitudes of care, that means no caring attitudes were required of us towards some person.\n\nD. Collins agrees with the objection.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what the objection is really saying. Care ethics emphasizes the moral importance of care, particularly in personal relationships, and it often ties moral responsibility to having certain attitudes or emotions, like care or compassion.\n\nThe objection here is that it seems to hold people responsible for their attitudes, which are not under their voluntary control. In other words, you can't just decide to care about someone; it's not like choosing to pick up a book or decide what to eat for dinner. Attitudes and emotions are more nuanced and not directly controllable.\n\nNow, Collins is responding to this objection. Let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says that caring attitudes are not moral attitudes at all. That seems counterintuitive because care ethics places a lot of emphasis on caring attitudes as moral. If Collins were to say that caring attitudes are not moral, that would undermine the whole point of care ethics. So, I doubt that's the case.\n\nOption B says that we can often bring ourselves to have attitudes of care indirectly. This sounds plausible. Even if we can't directly control our emotions, we might be able to influence them through other means, like changing our behavior or reflecting on certain values. For example, if I make an effort to spend more time with someone and listen to their concerns, I might start to feel more caring towards them, even if I didn't initially.\n\nOption C says that when we fail to have attitudes of care, that means no caring attitudes were required of us towards that person. This seems like a way to avoid the objection by saying that moral responsibility only applies when we do have caring attitudes. But that might weaken care ethics because it could imply that in many cases, no moral responsibility exists if we don't feel caring towards someone.\n\nOption D says that Collins agrees with the objection. That would mean Collins thinks that care ethics does indeed imply that we're responsible for attitudes not under our voluntary control, and perhaps accepts that as a problem. But if that's the case, why is Collins responding to the objection? Maybe Collins is acknowledging the challenge but offering a defense or clarification.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems the most likely. Collins is probably arguing that even if we can't directly control our attitudes, we can influence them through other means, thus we can still be held morally responsible for cultivating caring attitudes.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should think about what care ethics typically says about moral responsibility and attitudes. Care ethics often emphasizes the role of relationships and the development of moral character through practices and habits.
