Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nWe have two sets of words, A and B, where B is a subset of A. The question is asking which of the three statements must always be true:\n\nI. If A is finite, then B is finite.\n\nII. If A is regular, then B is regular.\n\nIII. If A is context-free, then B is context-free.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and II only\n\nAlright, let's tackle these one by one.\n\nStarting with statement I: If A is finite, then B is finite.\n\nWell, if A is finite, that means it has a limited number of words in it. Since B is a subset of A, it can have fewer or the same number of words as A, but definitely not more. So, B has to be finite as well. That makes sense. So, I think statement I is always true.\n\nNow, statement II: If A is regular, then B is regular.\n\nHmm, regular sets are those that can be recognized by finite automata, or described by regular expressions, right? If A is regular, and B is a subset of A, does that necessarily mean B is also regular?\n\nWait a minute, I think not always. For example, take A to be all binary strings, which is regular, and B to be the set of binary strings where the number of 1s is prime, which is not a regular set. So, in this case, B is a subset of A, A is regular, but B is not regular.\n\nSo, statement II doesn't always hold true.\n\nWhat about statement III: If A is context-free, then B is context-free.\n\nContext-free languages are those that can be generated by context-free grammars or recognized by pushdown automata. If A is context-free and B is a subset of A, does that mean B is also context-free?\n\nAgain, I think not necessarily. For example, take A to be all well-formed parentheses, which is a context-free language. Now, let B be the set of well-formed parentheses where the number of pairs is a perfect square. This subset is not context-free, as it requires counting to a non-regular condition.\n\nSo, statement III isn't always true.\n\nGiven that, only statement I is always true. So, the answer should be option A. I only.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any scenario where A is finite and B is infinite? No, because B is a subset of A, and if A is finite, B has to be finite as well.\n\nFor statement II, I have an example where A is regular, but B is not regular. Similarly, for statement III, I have an example where A is context-free, but B is not context-free.\n\nSo, yeah, I think A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
