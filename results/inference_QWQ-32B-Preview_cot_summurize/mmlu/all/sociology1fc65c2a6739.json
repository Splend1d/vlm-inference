In science, experiments are designed to test specific hypotheses by manipulating variables and observing the outcomes. The goal is to determine cause-and-effect relationships, which requires controlling for other factors that might influence the results.\n\nOption A seems more related to methodological development rather than the core of the experimental method in science. While testing new research methods is important, it's not the primary focus of experimental science.\n\nOption C suggests that personal beliefs and values should guide what to study, but in idealized science, research should be objective and based on evidence, not personal biases.\n\nOption D mentions interpreting data subjectively, which contrasts with the objective approach that science aims for. In science, data interpretation should be as objective as possible, guided by established theories and methodologies.\n\nSo, B makes the most sense as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
