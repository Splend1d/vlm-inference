                    "text": "I'm trying to understand when the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose applies in a sales transaction under the UCC. There are four options here, and I need to pick the one that best describes the circumstances under which this warranty arises.\n\nFirst, let's recall what the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is. It's a warranty that assures the buyer that the goods purchased are suitable for a particular purpose, especially when the buyer relies on the seller's expertise to select the right goods.\n\nOption A says: \"The buyer is purchasing the goods for a particular purpose and is relying on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment to select suitable goods.\" This sounds promising. It highlights both the buyer's specific purpose and their reliance on the seller's expertise.\n\nOption B: \"The buyer is purchasing the goods for a particular purpose and the seller is a merchant in such goods.\" This seems similar to option A, but it doesn't mention the buyer's reliance on the seller's skill or judgment. Just because the seller is a merchant in such goods doesn't necessarily mean that the buyer is relying on their expertise.\n\nOption C: \"The seller knows the particular purpose for which the buyer will use the goods and knows that the buyer is relying on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment to select suitable goods.\" This seems more specific than option A. It emphasizes that the seller has knowledge of the buyer's particular purpose and is aware that the buyer is relying on their skill or judgment.\n\nOption D: \"The seller knows the particular purpose for which the buyer will use the goods and the seller is a merchant in such goods.\" Again, this is similar to option C but lacks the element of the seller knowing that the buyer is relying on their skill or judgment.\n\nComparing these options, it seems that option C best captures the essence of when the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose arises. The UCC imposes this warranty when the seller has knowledge of the buyer's particular purpose and knows that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods.\n\nLet me double-check this by referring to the actual UCC provision. According to UCC \u00a7 2-315, the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is created when the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods.\n\nSo, the key elements are:\n\n1. The seller has reason to know the particular purpose for which the goods are required.\n\n2. The buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods.\n\nOption C aligns closely with these elements, as it states that the seller knows the particular purpose and knows that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment.\n\nOption A is close but doesn't specify that the seller knows the buyer is relying on their skill or judgment, only that the buyer is relying. Option B and D both focus on the seller being a merchant in such goods, which, while relevant, isn't the primary condition for the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
