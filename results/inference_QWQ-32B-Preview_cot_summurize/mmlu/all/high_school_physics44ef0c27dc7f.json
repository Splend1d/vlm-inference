                    "text": "So, there's this scenario where a man is standing in an elevator that starts to go up. The question is about the normal force from the floor of the elevator and whether it does any work on the man. And we have to choose from these options: A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what normal force is. Normal force is the support force that a surface exerts on an object in contact with it. In this case, it's the floor of the elevator pushing up on the man's feet. So, the normal force is directed upwards.\n\nNow, work is defined as the product of force and displacement in the direction of the force. So, if there's a force and the object moves in the direction of that force, work is done.\n\nIn this scenario, the elevator is ascending, so the man is moving upwards. The normal force is also upwards. So, the displacement is in the same direction as the normal force.\n\nTherefore, the work done by the normal force should be positive because the force and displacement are in the same direction.\n\nWait, but I remember that when you're standing on the ground, the normal force from the ground prevents you from falling through, but since you're not moving, no work is done because there's no displacement.\n\nBut in the elevator, since it's moving upwards, there is displacement in the direction of the normal force.\n\nSo, does that mean the normal force is doing positive work on the man?\n\nLet me think about it another way. The man has weight, which is the gravitational force acting downwards. The normal force from the floor is upwards, counteracting gravity.\n\nWhen the elevator accelerates upwards, the normal force has to be greater than the man's weight to provide the net force needed for acceleration.\n\nSo, normal force equals mass times acceleration due to gravity plus mass times elevator's acceleration.\n\nN = m(g + a)\n\nWhere g is the acceleration due to gravity, and a is the elevator's acceleration upwards.\n\nSo, the normal force is greater than mg.\n\nNow, work done by normal force would be N times displacement in the direction of N.\n\nSince the elevator is moving upwards, the displacement is upwards, same as the normal force.\n\nTherefore, work done is positive.\n\nWait, but I think there's more to it.\n\nThe man is gaining gravitational potential energy as the elevator goes up.\n\nWork done by gravity would be negative because gravity acts downwards while the displacement is upwards.\n\nSo, work by gravity is negative.\n\nBut the normal force is what's supporting the man and also contributing to his motion upwards.\n\nSo, the positive work done by the normal force is what's countering gravity and also providing the energy for the man to move upwards.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any other forces or if I'm missing something.\n\nIs there any situation where the normal force could do negative work?\n\nWell, if the elevator was descending and accelerating downwards faster than gravity, maybe, but in this case, it's ascending, so I don't think so.\n\nAlso, the question says \"begins to ascend,\" so it's accelerating upwards.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A: Yes, and the work done will be positive.\n\nBut let me check option C: Yes, but the sign can\u2019t be determined.\n\nI don't think that's the case because, in this specific scenario, the force and displacement are both upwards, so the work should be positive.\n\nOption D is \"No,\" which would be incorrect because there is displacement in the direction of the normal force.\n\nSo, I think A is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I recall that in some cases, like when you're holding a book and walking horizontally, the normal force from your hand is upwards, perpendicular to the direction of motion, so no work is done.\n\nBut in this case, the elevator is moving upwards, so the displacement is in the direction of the normal force.\n\nSo, it's different from the walking scenario.\n\nTherefore, work is done by the normal force, and it's positive.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
