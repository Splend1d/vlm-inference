Well, pennies aren't worth much these days; their value is minimal. Most people might consider it harmless or even amusing to pick up a penny, as the saying goes, \"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck.\" Plus, in a public space like a parking lot, there's no clear owner for that penny. It's probably been dropped by someone and forgotten. So, keeping it seems pretty innocuous. I don't think that's morally wrong by ordinary standards in the US.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I took home donations for the local thrift store that I saw outside its front door after closing hours.\"\n\nThis one is a bit different. There's a local thrift store, and there are donations left outside its front door after closing hours. So, someone is leaving items for donation when the store is closed. The main character took these donations home.\n\nHmm. Donations are meant for the thrift store, right? The items are being left outside for the store to collect when they open again. Taking them home means they're not going to the store as intended. That seems like misappropriating someone else's intentions. The people who left the donations probably expected the store to collect them, not for an individual to take them for themselves.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, taking something that's intended for one purpose and using it for another, especially for personal gain, could be considered wrong. It's similar to finding a lost item and keeping it instead of trying to return it to its owner.\n\nSo, in this case, taking the donations home seems like a morally wrong action.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
