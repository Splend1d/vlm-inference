So, Epictetus was a Stoic philosopher, and Stoics are known for their views on how to handle emotions and external events. The question is: when someone strikes you, what really angers you according to Epictetus?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. the force of the blow.\n\nB. their malicious intentions.\n\nC. your own judgment.\n\nD. the insult involved.\n\nFirst, option A suggests that it's the physical impact that makes you angry. But Stoics generally teach that external events don't directly cause emotions; it's how we perceive them that matters. So, maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B points to the other person's intentions. If someone hits you with malicious intent, that might be more upsetting than if it were an accident. But again, Stoicism emphasizes that our reactions are based on our perceptions, not just on the actions of others.\n\nOption C says it's your own judgment. This aligns well with Stoic philosophy, which teaches that it's not the event itself but our judgment about the event that causes our emotions. So, if someone strikes you, it's your interpretation of that action that leads to anger.\n\nOption D mentions the insult involved. While an act of striking someone can be insulting, Stoics would likely say that the insult is in your perception of the act, which ties back to your judgment.\n\nConsidering Stoic principles, I think option C, \"your own judgment,\" is the most accurate. Epictetus would likely say that it's not the blow or the other person's intentions that cause anger, but rather your own assessment of the situation.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that Epictetus taught the distinction between what is within our control and what is not. He famously said, \"It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.\" So, applying that here, it's your reaction to being struck that causes anger, not the act itself.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. your own judgment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
