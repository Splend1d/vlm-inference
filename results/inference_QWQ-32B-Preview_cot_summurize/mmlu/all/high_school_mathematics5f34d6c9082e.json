                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. It says that four packages are delivered to four houses, one to each house, and they're delivered randomly. I need to find the probability that exactly two of them are delivered to the correct houses. The options are fractions like 1/4, 27/128, 1/2, and 1/9.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's going on. There are four packages and four houses. Each package is supposed to go to a specific house, but in this scenario, they're delivered randomly. So, basically, it's like assigning each package to a house at random, and I need to find the probability that exactly two of them end up in the right house.\n\nI know that probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the total number of possible ways to deliver the packages is the number of ways to arrange four distinct packages into four distinct houses. That's just 4 factorial, which is 4! = 24.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these 24 arrangements have exactly two packages delivered correctly.\n\nAt first, I thought, well, maybe I can choose which two packages are delivered correctly and then the other two must be delivered incorrectly. So, the number of ways to choose which two packages are correct is \"4 choose 2,\" which is 6.\n\nThen, for the remaining two packages, they need to be delivered incorrectly. So, if there are two packages and two houses, and both are delivered incorrectly, that means each package goes to the wrong house. For two packages, there's only one way for both to be incorrect: each goes to the other's house. So, for two packages, there's only one derangement.\n\nWait, derangement is the term for a permutation where no element appears in its original position. So, for two items, the number of derangements is 1.\n\nTherefore, for each pair of two correctly delivered packages, there's only one way for the other two to be incorrectly delivered.\n\nSo, total number of favorable outcomes should be \"4 choose 2\" times 1, which is 6.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 6/24, which simplifies to 1/4.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check this because it seems a bit straightforward, and sometimes these problems have tricks in them.\n\nIs there any overlap or overcounting in this approach? Let's think about it.\n\nSuppose I choose two specific packages to be delivered correctly. Then, the other two must be delivered incorrectly, which, as I said, has only one way.\n\nBut is there a scenario where, say, I choose one set of two packages to be correct, and another set of two packages to be correct, and these sets overlap in some way? No, because I'm choosing distinct sets of two packages each time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the general formula for the number of permutations with exactly k fixed points.\n\nA fixed point in permutation terms is an element that remains in its original position. So, here, a correctly delivered package corresponds to a fixed point.\n\nThe number of permutations of n elements with exactly k fixed points is given by the formula:\n\nn! * (1/0! - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^k / k!)'\n\nWait, actually, the number of permutations with exactly k fixed points is given by:\n\nD(n, k) = C(n, k) * !__(n - k)__\n\nWhere C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time, and !__(n - k)__ is the number of derangements of (n - k) items.\n\nA derangement is a permutation with no fixed points.\n\nSo, in this case, n = 4 and k = 2.\n\nSo, number of favorable permutations = C(4, 2) * !(4 - 2) = 6 * !2\n\nNow, !2 is the number of derangements of two items, which is 1, as I previously thought.\n\nSo, 6 * 1 = 6 favorable permutations.\n\nTotal number of permutations is 4! = 24.\n\nTherefore, probability is 6/24 = 1/4.\n\nBut let me verify the general formula to make sure.\n\nThe number of derangements of n items is given by:\n\n!n = n! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n / n!)\n\nSo, for n = 2, !2 = 2! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2!) = 2 * (1 - 1 + 1/2) = 2 * 0.5 = 1\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, for exactly k fixed points, the formula is C(n, k) * !(n - k)\n\nSo, in this case, C(4, 2) * !(2) = 6 * 1 = 6\n\nTherefore, probability is 6/24 = 1/4\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe I can consider the probability that two specific packages are delivered correctly and the other two are delivered incorrectly, and then multiply by the number of ways to choose which two packages are correct.\n\nSo, fix two packages to be delivered correctly. The probability that these two are correct is (1/4)*(1/3), since the first correct package has a 1/4 chance, and the second has a 1/3 chance, given the first was correct.\n\nThen, the other two must be incorrect. The probability that both are incorrect is 1 - probability that at least one is correct.\n\nBut this seems more complicated, and I might be overthinking it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use inclusion-exclusion to calculate the number of permutations with exactly two fixed points.\n\nBut I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nLet me look at the options again. The options are:\n\nA. 1/4\n\nB. 27/128\n\nC. 1/2\n\nD. 1/9\n\nAccording to my calculation, the answer should be 1/4, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me see why option B is 27/128. That seems out of place for this problem, perhaps it's for a different problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that for the remaining two packages, there's only one way for them to be incorrect.\n\nLet me think about it again. If two packages are correctly delivered, and the other two must be incorrect.\n\nSo, for the two incorrect packages, they cannot be in their correct houses.\n\nIf I have two packages and two houses, and both must be incorrect, then indeed, each package must go to the other's house. So, only one way for that to happen.\n\nHence, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the packages are indistinct, but no, the problem states that they are delivered to four houses, one to each house, so I think they are distinct.\n\nWait, but maybe the houses are indistinct? No, houses are distinct.\n\nWait, no, both packages and houses are distinct.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the problem differently.\n\nLet me consider the total number of permutations of four items, which is 24.\n\nNow, number of permutations with exactly two fixed points.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of permutations with at least two fixed points and subtract those with more than two.\n\nBut that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the probability of exactly k fixed points.\n\nI recall that in the limit, as n approaches infinity, the probability of exactly k fixed points in a permutation approaches e^(-1) * 1/k!, which is the probability for a Poisson distribution with mean 1.\n\nBut for finite n, the exact formula is C(n, k) * !(n - k) / n!\n\nWhich, in this case, is C(4, 2) * !(2) / 24 = 6 * 1 / 24 = 1/4\n\nSo, again, 1/4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is different because of some other consideration.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the derangement formula assumes that all permutations are equally likely, which they are in this case, since the deliveries are random.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that multiple packages can be delivered to the same house, but the problem says one to each house, so it's a permutation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is different because of some miscalculation in the derangement.\n\nLet me calculate the number of derangements for n=4.\n\n!4 = 4! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + 1/4!) = 24 * (1 - 1 + 1/2 - 1/6 + 1/24) = 24 * (0 + 0.5 - 0.1667 + 0.0417) = 24 * (0.375) = 9\n\nSo, there are 9 derangements out of 24 permutations.\n\nBut that's for no fixed points. But in this problem, we want exactly two fixed points.\n\nSo, going back, number of permutations with exactly two fixed points is C(4, 2) * !(4 - 2) = 6 * 1 = 6\n\nHence, probability is 6/24 = 1/4\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is different because the problem is considering that the packages are delivered independently, but that doesn't make sense because each package is delivered to one house, and each house gets one package.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the packages are delivered with replacement, but that doesn't make sense because each house gets one package.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that packages can be delivered to the same house, but the problem says one to each house.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that not all houses necessarily get a package, but again, the problem says one to each house.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a misinterpretation in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"four packages are delivered to four houses, one to each house. If these packages are randomly delivered, what is the probability that exactly two of them are delivered to the correct houses?\"\n\nSo, it's clearly a permutation problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a misprint in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the probability is for exactly two packages being correct, and the other two being incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the inclusion-exclusion principle directly.\n\nSo, let's try that.\n\nThe number of permutations with at least two fixed points is:\n\nC(4, 2) * 2! - C(4, 3) * 1! + C(4, 4) * 0! = 6 * 2 - 4 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 12 - 4 + 1 = 9\n\nWait, but that's the number of permutations with at least two fixed points.\n\nBut I need the number with exactly two fixed points.\n\nSo, number with exactly two fixed points is:\n\nC(4, 2) * !(4 - 2) = 6 * 1 = 6\n\nWhich matches what I had before.\n\nTherefore, probability is 6/24 = 1/4\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are miswritten, and option A is meant to be 1/4, which is 0.25, and option B is 27/128 \u2248 0.2109, which is close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the packages are delivered independently, with each package having a 1/4 chance of being delivered correctly, which would make it a binomial probability problem.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the deliveries are not independent; if one package is delivered to a house, others cannot be delivered there.\n\nSo, it's definitely a permutation problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each package is delivered to a house uniformly at random, with possibility of multiple packages per house, but the problem says one to each house.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a misinterpretation in the derangement formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the probability directly.\n\nSo, total number of permutations is 4! = 24\n\nNumber of permutations with exactly two fixed points is 6, as calculated.\n\nTherefore, probability is 6/24 = 1/4\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is different because of some other consideration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 27/128, but that would require a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about binary outcomes or something else, but no, it's about permutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the packages are delivered with some other constraints, but the problem seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a misprint in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is indeed 1/4, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1/2, which would be option C, but that doesn't match my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1/9, which is option D, but again, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is none of the above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is about distinguishable or indistinguishable objects, but in permutations, they are distinguishable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the houses are indistinct, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about combinations rather than permutations, but no, it's about arranging packages to houses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the packages are being delivered with replacement, but no, each house gets one package.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about circular permutations, but no, it's about linear permutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the packages are being delivered in a specific order, but no, it's about assigning packages to houses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about derangements only, but it's not, it's about exactly two correct deliveries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the formula for the probability of exactly k successes in n trials, but that's for binomial distributions, which doesn't apply here because the trials are not independent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the problem as selecting two packages to be correct and then ensuring the other two are incorrect.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think the correct answer is 1/4, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}} \\]"
