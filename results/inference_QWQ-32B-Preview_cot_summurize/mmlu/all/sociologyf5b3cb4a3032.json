                    "text": "Let's see what telework is all about. So, telework is a type of employment where people can work remotely, usually from their homes, instead of going to an office every day. It's become really popular in recent years, especially with the advances in technology.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Running one's own business through telephone helplines or hotlines. Hmm, that sounds more like being a freelancer or entrepreneur, maybe running a call center or something similar. But telework is broader than that; it can include various types of jobs, not just customer service or business operations over the phone.\n\nB. Working at home for an outside employer, using information technology. This seems pretty accurate. Telework often involves using computers, the internet, and other tech tools to communicate with colleagues and complete tasks from a remote location. So, this sounds like a good definition.\n\nC. Babysitting and other jobs within a local network, through the informal economy. Babysitting is usually a local, in-person job, and the informal economy refers to unregulated, often cash-based transactions. While someone could potentially offer babysitting services through an online platform, telework typically implies more professional, white-collar jobs.\n\nD. Combining non-manual work with the leisure activity of watching television. This one seems a bit off. Telework does involve non-manual work, like office jobs that don't require physical labor, but combining it with watching TV isn't typical. People might watch TV while working, but that's not the essence of telework.\n\nSo, based on these thoughts, option B seems to be the most accurate description of telework: working at home for an outside employer, using information technology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
