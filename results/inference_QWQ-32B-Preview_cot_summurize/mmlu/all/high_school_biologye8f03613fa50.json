                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about meiosis. I need to identify which statement is NOT true. Let's review each option step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"Meiosis produces two haploid gametes.\" Hmm, meiosis is a type of cell division that results in four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. So, in humans, for example, meiosis produces four haploid gametes (eggs or sperm). But option A says \"two haploid gametes,\" which is incorrect because it's typically four. Wait, maybe in some organisms it's two, but generally, it's four. So, this might be the incorrect statement.\n\nOption B: \"Homologous chromosomes join during synapsis.\" Synapsis is indeed when homologous chromosomes pair up during prophase I of meiosis. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I.\" Actually, in meiosis I, it's the homologous chromosomes that separate, not the sister chromatids. Sister chromatids separate during meiosis II. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"Crossing-over increases genetic variation in gametes.\" Crossing-over does occur during prophase I, and it does contribute to genetic variation by exchanging genetic material between homologous chromosomes. So, this is correct.\n\nNow, between options A and C, both seem to have issues. Option A because meiosis usually produces four gametes, not two, and option C because sister chromatids separate in meiosis II, not I. But the question is asking for the statement that is NOT true, and I need to choose only one.\n\nMaybe I should double-check about the number of gametes produced. In some organisms, like some plants or fungi, meiosis can produce two gametes, but generally, in animals, it's four. Perhaps the statement is too vague by saying \"two haploid gametes,\" but it's not universally false.\n\nOn the other hand, option C is definitely incorrect because sister chromatids do not separate until meiosis II. So, perhaps that's the better choice.\n\nWait, but option A is also incorrect in many cases. Maybe the question is testing whether I know that meiosis typically produces four haploid gametes, not two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"meiosis\" in general produces four gametes, but in some contexts, like male mammals, meiosis produces four haploid cells, but only one becomes the functional gamete, while in female mammals, typically only one matures into an egg. So, maybe in some cases, it's two or one, but generally, four.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should focus on the statements that are universally true or false.\n\nOption B is definitely true.\n\nOption D is definitely true.\n\nOption C is false because sister chromatids separate in meiosis II, not I.\n\nOption A is generally false because meiosis typically produces four haploid gametes, not two.\n\nBut the question is asking for the statement that is NOT true. So, both A and C are not true, but I need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps the most clearly incorrect statement is C, because sister chromatids separating in meiosis I is fundamentally wrong, whereas option A could be partially correct in certain organisms or contexts.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option C as the statement that is NOT true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
