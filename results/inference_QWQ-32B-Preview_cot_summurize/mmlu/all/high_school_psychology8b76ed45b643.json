Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation?\n\nA. Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English.\nB. The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading.\nC.

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a 7-year-old student who moved to the US a year ago from a non-English-speaking country. She was doing really well in reading back in her home country, getting high scores. Now, after being here for a year, she's pretty fluent in social English. She can chat and stuff, no problem. But when it comes to reading in English, especially with the textbooks they use in class, she's having a tough time. Her teacher noticed this and referred her for evaluation.\n\nSo, they gave her two English proficiency tests. One for speaking and listening, and another for reading and writing. Turns out, in speaking and listening, she's above average compared to her English-speaking peers. But in reading and writing, she's way below average. However, when they tested her reading skills in her native language, she's above average there too.\n\nNow, based on this info, I need to pick the most accurate interpretation from four options.\n\nOption A says that using her native language at home is interfering with her English development. But that doesn't seem right because she's already fluent in social English, and she's performing well in speaking and listening. If anything, her native language skills are strong, which can actually help her learn English.\n\nOption B suggests that her reading difficulty is an early sign of bigger academic problems down the line, especially as coursework requires more reading. That seems possible. If she's struggling with reading in English now, and reading is a foundation for many subjects, then yes, it could lead to more problems later if not addressed.\n\nOption C says that the difference between her social language skills and reading skills in English is normal because social language is learned in a richer context. That makes sense too. Social language is often picked up through interactions, gestures, and the environment, which provides a lot of context. Reading, on the other hand, requires more abstract skills, like decoding and comprehension, which might take longer to develop in a second language.\n\nOption D attributes the discrepancy between her native language reading and English reading to the greater complexity of English. English can indeed be more complex, with its irregular spellings and multiple meanings for words, so that could be a factor.\n\nNow, to decide which one is the most accurate, I need to think about what the main issue is here. The student is fluent in social English but struggles with reading and writing in English, while maintaining strong reading skills in her native language.\n\nOption A seems unlikely because her social English is good, and her native language reading is strong, so it's not that her native language is interfering.\n\nOption B is a possible consequence, but it's more about predicting future problems rather than explaining the current situation.\n\nOption C directly addresses the difference between social language skills and reading skills, acknowledging that social language is often acquired faster due to the rich context provided in interactions.\n\nOption D points to the complexity of English as a reason for the discrepancy, which is valid, but it doesn't explain why her social language is fine.\n\nI think Option C is the most accurate because it directly relates to the different processes involved in acquiring social language versus academic language, like reading and writing. Social language is often acquired more quickly because it's embedded in immediate contexts, whereas reading requires more formal learning and may take longer, especially in a second language.\n\nSo, I would go with Option C: The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
