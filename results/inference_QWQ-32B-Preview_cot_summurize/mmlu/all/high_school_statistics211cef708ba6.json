The options are a census, sample survey, experiment, or observational study. I need to decide which one is most appropriate for gathering the needed data.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these options means:\n\n1. **Census**: This involves collecting data from every member of the population. In this case, that would mean getting the AP Statistics exam results for every male and female student who took the exam at my high school.\n\n2. **Sample survey**: This involves selecting a subset (sample) of the population and collecting data from them. For example, choosing a certain number of male and female students to represent the entire group.\n\n3. **Experiment**: This typically involves manipulating one or more variables to observe the effect on another variable. It usually includes a control group and an experimental group.\n\n4. **Observational study**: This involves observing subjects in their natural state without manipulating any variables. Data is collected based on observations without interference.\n\nNow, considering the goal is to compare AP Statistics exam results between male and female students, let's think about what's needed.\n\nSince AP exam results are already available for all students who took the exam, it seems feasible to access the data for every student, which would be a census. This approach ensures that we have complete data without any sampling error.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether a census is practical. In a high school setting, the number of students taking AP Statistics might be manageable, so collecting data from all of them might not be overly burdensome.\n\nOn the other hand, if the school has privacy restrictions or if accessing individual student data requires permission, a census might not be feasible. In that case, a sample survey could be a viable alternative. By selecting a representative sample of male and female students, we can make inferences about the entire population.\n\nBut since the question is about comparing exam results, which are likely numerical scores, and assuming that the sample would need to be large enough to be representative, a census might still be the better choice if possible.\n\nNow, considering experiments and observational studies:\n\n- An experiment would involve manipulating some variable to see its effect on exam results. For example, assigning different study methods to male and female students and then comparing their exam scores. However, this seems unnecessary for simply comparing existing exam results. Moreover, experimenting with students' study methods might raise ethical concerns.\n\n- An observational study, on the other hand, would involve observing the students' exam results without any intervention. This aligns more closely with the goal of comparing existing data.\n\nGiven that, an observational study seems appropriate. However, since the data is already available, and we're not planning to observe any new data, a census might still be the most direct approach.\n\nLet's consider the context of the question. It's about choosing the most appropriate technique for gathering the needed data. If the data is already available for all students, then a census is the way to go. If not, then a sample survey would be necessary.\n\nAssuming that the exam results are recorded and accessible for all students who took the AP Statistics exam at the high school, a census would be the most appropriate technique. This ensures that the comparison is based on the entire population of interest, providing the most accurate picture without the need for inference from a sample.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Census.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
