In this case, the equipment consists of four major components with different costs and useful lives. Therefore, we need to depreciate each component separately.\n\nFirst, let's determine the cost of each component.\n\nThe total cost of the equipment is $100 million.\n\nTwo components comprise 80% of the total cost:\n\n80% of $100 million = 0.8 * 100,000,000 = $80,000,000\n\nSo, each of these two components costs:\n\n$80,000,000 / 2 = $40,000,000 each\n\nThe remaining two components have costs of $10 million each:\n\nTotal cost of remaining two components: 2 * $10,000,000 = $20,000,000\n\nWhich matches the total cost:\n\n$80,000,000 + $20,000,000 = $100,000,000\n\nNow, let's note the useful lives:\n\n- Two components: 20-year useful life\n\n- One component: 4-year useful life\n\n- One component: 5-year useful life\n\nThe company uses the straight-line method of depreciation.\n\nUnder straight-line depreciation, the annual depreciation expense is calculated as:\n\nAnnual Depreciation = Cost / Useful Life\n\nLet's calculate the annual depreciation for each component.\n\nFirst, the two components with 20-year useful lives:\n\nDepreciation per year per component = $40,000,000 / 20 = $2,000,000\n\nSince there are two such components:\n\nTotal depreciation for these two components = 2 * $2,000,000 = $4,000,000\n\nNext, the component with a 4-year useful life:\n\nCost = $10,000,000\n\nDepreciation per year = $10,000,000 / 4 = $2,500,000\n\nThen, the component with a 5-year useful life:\n\nCost = $10,000,000\n\nDepreciation per year = $10,000,000 / 5 = $2,000,000\n\nNow, let's sum up the depreciation expenses for all components to find the total depreciation expense for the year.\n\nTotal Depreciation = Depreciation of two 20-year components + Depreciation of 4-year component + Depreciation of 5-year component\n\nTotal Depreciation = $4,000,000 + $2,500,000 + $2,000,000 = $8,500,000\n\nTherefore, the depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, year 1, is $8,500,000.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. $8,500,000\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
