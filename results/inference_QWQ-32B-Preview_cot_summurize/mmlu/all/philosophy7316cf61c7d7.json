                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question about Cicero. So, Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman, right? He wrote a lot about ethics and morality. The question is asking what Cicero claims is sometimes permissible among these options: committing acts of injustice, breaking one's promises, stealing, or none of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Cicero said about morality and ethics. I remember that Cicero was influenced by Stoicism and other Greek philosophies. Stoics believe in living in harmony with nature and according to reason. They also emphasize virtue and moral duties.\n\nLet's look at option A: committing acts of injustice. Stoics generally advocate for justice and fairness. Cicero, being influenced by Stoicism, would likely condemn acts of injustice. So, it seems unlikely that he would claim it's sometimes permissible to commit acts of injustice.\n\nOption B: breaking one's promises. Promises are important in Stoic ethics because they relate to integrity and trustworthiness. However, Stoics also believe in flexibility and considering the greater good. Maybe there are circumstances where breaking a promise could be justified if it leads to a better outcome or prevents greater harm. So, perhaps Cicero might allow for breaking promises in certain situations.\n\nOption C: stealing. Stealing is generally considered immoral across many philosophical traditions, including Stoicism. It violates the rights of others and is against the virtue of justice. It's hard to imagine a scenario where Cicero would permit stealing as acceptable.\n\nOption D: none of the above. This would mean that Cicero doesn't permit any of the above actions under any circumstances.\n\nConsidering what I know about Cicero and Stoic ethics, I think option B might be the most plausible. Stoics value keeping promises, but they also consider the overall moral landscape. Perhaps Cicero acknowledges that in extraordinary circumstances, breaking a promise could be the lesser of two evils.\n\nTo confirm, I should think about specific instances where Cicero might have addressed this. For example, in his work \"De Officiis\" (On Duties), Cicero discusses moral duties and exceptions to general rules. He might have provided scenarios where breaking a promise is justified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Cicero strictly adheres to keeping promises without exception, making option D the correct answer.\n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let me consider the context of the question. It's multiple choice, so only one option can be correct. If Cicero claims that it's sometimes permissible to do one of these actions, and given his Stoic leanings, breaking a promise might be the most plausible in certain extreme situations.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe none of the above is the correct answer because Cicero doesn't permit any of these actions under any circumstances.\n\nI think I need to recall more specific teachings from Cicero. In \"De Officiis,\" he does discuss that sometimes duties can conflict, and one must choose the lesser evil. This suggests that in some cases, actions that are generally considered wrong might be permissible if they prevent a greater wrong.\n\nGiven that, perhaps breaking a promise could be permissible if keeping it leads to a greater injustice. For example, if promising to do something harmful, one might be justified in breaking that promise to prevent harm.\n\nSimilarly, regarding stealing, maybe in a situation where someone is starving and has no other means to survive, stealing food could be justified. However, this seems more aligned with utilitarian thinking rather than Stoic ethics.\n\nCicero might not agree with justifying stealing, even in extreme circumstances, because it violates the rights of others and the virtue of justice.\n\nAs for committing acts of injustice, that seems fundamentally against Stoic principles. Stoics aim to live in accordance with nature and reason, which includes acting justly towards others.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most plausible. Cicero might allow for breaking promises in certain situations where it serves a higher moral good.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if Cicero ever explicitly states that any of these actions are permissible under certain conditions.\n\nUpon reflection, I recall that in \"De Officiis,\" Cicero discusses the concept of \"supreme good\" and suggests that in some cases, actions that are normally wrong might be acceptable if they lead to a greater good or prevent a greater evil.\n\nFor example, he might argue that breaking a promise is acceptable if it prevents harm to an innocent person.\n\nSimilarly, in terms of stealing, perhaps if it's to save a life, it could be justified. However, I'm not sure if Cicero specifically addresses stealing in this manner.\n\nGiven the options, and considering Cicero's Stoic influences, I think option B is the most likely correct answer.\n\nSo, my answer is B."
