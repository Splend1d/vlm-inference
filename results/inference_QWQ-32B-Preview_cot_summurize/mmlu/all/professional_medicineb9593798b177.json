                    "text": "So here's this 47-year-old guy who comes into the emergency department with sudden palpitations, left-sided chest pain, light-headedness, and shortness of breath. He has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which means he has episodes of irregular heart rhythm that come and go. He's 5 feet 11 inches tall, weighs 180 pounds, and has a BMI of 25, which is considered normal.\n\nWhen he arrived, his ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a narrow QRS complex, and his pulse was 146 beats per minute, which is pretty fast. On physical examination, they noted a rapid heart rate. They gave him oxygen through a nasal cannula and intravenous metoprolol, 5 mg every 5 minutes, totaling 15 mg. After that, his pulse slowed down to 90 beats per minute, which is a significant improvement.\n\nBut then, two hours after admission, he's still pain-free, but his pulse is back up to 160 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg, which is within the normal range.\n\nNow, the question is, to decrease his pulse, which of the following should be administered intravenously?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Digoxin\n\nB. Enalapril\n\nC. Lidocaine\n\nD. Metoprolol\n\nAlright, let's think this through.\n\nFirst, the patient has atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heart rhythm originating from the atria, leading to an irregular and often rapid heart rate. The goal in managing atrial fibrillation is to control the heart rate and possibly restore normal rhythm, as well as prevent blood clots to avoid strokes.\n\nGiven that he was initially treated with metoprolol, which is a beta-blocker, and his heart rate decreased to 90 bpm, but then it went back up to 160 bpm, it seems like the metoprolol effect might have worn off or isn't sustaining its effect.\n\nSo, considering that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Digoxin: This is a medication that can be used to control heart rate in atrial fibrillation, especially in patients with heart failure. It works by inhibiting the flow of sodium and potassium in the heart muscle, leading to a slower heart rate. However, digoxin is not typically used as a first-line treatment for rate control in atrial fibrillation, especially in acute settings. It has a narrow therapeutic window and can be toxic if levels are too high.\n\nB. Enalapril: This is an ACE inhibitor, used primarily for blood pressure control and heart failure management. It doesn't directly affect heart rate in the same way as beta-blockers or digoxin do. So, it's not the best choice for controlling heart rate in this acute scenario.\n\nC. Lidocaine: This is a local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic drug, mainly used to treat certain types of ventricular arrhythmias, like ventricular tachycardia. It's not typically used for atrial fibrillation or for controlling heart rate in this context.\n\nD. Metoprolol: This is a beta-blocker, which was already administered and had a temporary effect in lowering the heart rate. Beta-blockers are commonly used to control heart rate in atrial fibrillation by blocking the effects of adrenaline on the heart, thereby slowing down the heart rate.\n\nGiven that metoprolol was previously effective but the heart rate has increased again, it might make sense to administer another dose of metoprolol or consider a different approach.\n\nHowever, since the question is asking for what to administer intravenously to decrease the pulse, and considering the options provided, metoprolol is already being used, but perhaps its effect has worn off.\n\nAlternatively, digoxin could be considered, but it's not typically the first choice in acute settings due to its slower onset of action and potential for toxicity.\n\nLidocaine is not indicated for this condition, and enalapril isn't used for heart rate control.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, metoprolol seems to be the most appropriate choice, assuming there are no contraindications to its use, such as severe heart failure, asthma, or bronchospastic diseases.\n\nBut, since the metoprolol was already given and its effect is wearing off, maybe increasing the dose or giving another medication in addition to metoprolol could be considered.\n\nHowever, based on the options provided, metoprolol is the most suitable choice for controlling heart rate in atrial fibrillation.\n\nWait a minute, but the patient is already on metoprolol, and it seems like the effect is wearing off. Maybe the dose needs to be adjusted or perhaps a different medication should be considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps administering digoxin could be a second-line option.\n\nBut in acute settings, often IV metoprolol or other beta-blockers like esmolol are used for rate control in atrial fibrillation.\n\nGiven that esmolol isn't an option here, and considering the rapid onset and short duration of action needed, maybe metoprolol is still the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, digoxin could be administered, but its onset of action is slower, around 2-4 hours, which might not be ideal in this acute scenario.\n\nLidocaine is not indicated for atrial fibrillation, and enalapril isn't used for heart rate control.\n\nTherefore, between these options, metoprolol seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nBut, it's essential to consider whether there are any contraindications to metoprolol in this patient, such as heart failure, severe bronchospasm, or low blood pressure.\n\nGiven that his blood pressure is 122/78, which is normal, and there's no mention of heart failure or respiratory issues, metoprolol should be safe to use.\n\nAdditionally, since metoprolol was previously effective in slowing down the heart rate, it makes sense to reuse it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Metoprolol.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
