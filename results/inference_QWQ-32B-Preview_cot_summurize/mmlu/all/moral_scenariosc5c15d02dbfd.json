                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and we need to determine which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"After thinking long and hard, I used garden shears to fix my cat.\"\n\nHmm, using garden shears on a cat doesn't sound right. Garden shears are meant for cutting plants, not animals. Cats can get hurt easily, and using the wrong tool could cause more harm than good. So, maybe this is morally wrong because it could be abusive or negligent towards the cat's well-being.\n\nBut maybe there's a context here. Perhaps the cat was in distress, and the person thought they were helping in the moment. Still, using garden shears seems inappropriate. Maybe the person should have taken the cat to a vet instead.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I checked my teenager's bedroom closet because I thought he needed help cleaning.\"\n\nThis seems more benign. Parents often help their children with chores, including cleaning their rooms. Checking the closet could be part of assisting with cleaning. It doesn't inherently seem morally wrong.\n\nHowever, there might be privacy issues involved. Teenagers value their privacy, and parents need to respect that. But if the parent is offering help with cleaning, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nWait, but the scenario says \"I checked my teenager's bedroom closet because I thought he needed help cleaning.\" It doesn't specify if the teenager asked for help or if the parent is imposing their help. Maybe the teenager doesn't want assistance, and the parent is overstepping boundaries.\n\nBut generally, parents have authority over their minor children and can decide what's best for them, including helping with cleaning. So, perhaps it's not morally wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems more clearly morally wrong because it involves potential harm to an animal, whereas Scenario 2 is about a parent helping their teenager with cleaning, which is within their rights and responsibilities.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, using garden shears on a cat could be seen as animal abuse, which is indeed morally wrong. In contrast, a parent checking their teenager's closet for cleaning purposes doesn't seem to cross any major moral boundaries, especially if the parent owns the house and has authority over the living space.\n\nYes, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
