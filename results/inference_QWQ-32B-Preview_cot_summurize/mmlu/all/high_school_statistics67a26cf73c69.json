                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. Charlotte has a dataset of 28 students' heights, and she needs to correct the height of the tallest student by adding two inches to it. We need to figure out which measure of spread won't change after this correction.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these measures of spread represents:\n\nA. Mean absolute deviation (MAD): This is the average of the absolute differences between each data point and the mean.\n\nB. Standard deviation: This measures the amount of variation or dispersion from the average. It's the square root of the variance.\n\nC. Variance: This is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n\nD. Interquartile range (IQR): This is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile). It measures statistical dispersion and is a robust measure of spread.\n\nNow, since Charlotte is only changing the height of one student, the tallest one, by adding two inches, we need to see how this affects each of these measures.\n\nLet's consider the mean first because it's involved in MAD, standard deviation, and variance.\n\n1. **Mean**: The mean height will change because we're increasing one of the data points. Specifically, since we're adding two inches to the tallest student, the mean will increase, but by how much depends on the total sum of the heights and the number of students.\n\n2. **MAD**: Since MAD depends on the mean and all data points, changing one data point will likely change the mean, which in turn affects the absolute differences from the mean for all data points. Therefore, MAD is likely to change.\n\n3. **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Both of these are based on the squared differences from the mean. Changing one data point will change the mean, which affects all squared differences. Therefore, both variance and standard deviation are likely to change.\n\n4. **IQR**: The IQR is based on the first and third quartiles, which are the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data. Since the tallest student is likely beyond the third quartile, changing his height might not affect the first and third quartiles, especially if the class size is 28, which is not too small.\n\nLet's think about the position of the tallest student in the ordered list of heights. In a dataset of 28 students, the third quartile would be at the average of the 21st and 22nd values when ordered from smallest to largest. So, the tallest student is the 28th value.\n\nIf we increase the height of the 28th student by two inches, but the 21st and 22nd values remain the same, the third quartile won't change. Similarly, the first quartile, which is the average of the 7th and 8th values, shouldn't be affected by changing the tallest student's height.\n\nTherefore, the IQR, which is the difference between the third and first quartiles, should remain unchanged.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider a small example. Suppose we have the following ordered heights: 60, 60, 61, 62, 63, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84 inches.\n\nHere, the third quartile is the average of the 21st and 22nd values: (77 + 78)/2 = 77.5 inches.\n\nThe first quartile is the average of the 7th and 8th values: (64 + 65)/2 = 64.5 inches.\n\nIQR = 77.5 - 64.5 = 13 inches.\n\nNow, if we increase the tallest height from 84 to 86 inches, the new ordered list is: 60, 60, 61, 62, 63, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 86 inches.\n\nThe third quartile is still the average of the 21st and 22nd values: (77 + 78)/2 = 77.5 inches.\n\nThe first quartile remains the average of the 7th and 8th values: (64 + 65)/2 = 64.5 inches.\n\nSo, IQR is still 13 inches.\n\nTherefore, the interquartile range remains unchanged.\n\nIn contrast, the mean, MAD, variance, and standard deviation would all change because they are sensitive to changes in any data point, especially the mean.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D. Interquartile range.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
