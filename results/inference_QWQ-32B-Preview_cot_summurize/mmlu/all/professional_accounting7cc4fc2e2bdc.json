                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about inventory turnover and I need to figure out how much money is released or invested when the turnover changes. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that inventory turnover (IT) is calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold (COGS) by the average inventory. So, IT = COGS / Average Inventory.\n\nIn this case, initially, the IT is 5 times with a COGS of $800,000. So, I can find the initial average inventory by rearranging the formula: Average Inventory = COGS / IT.\n\nSo, initial average inventory = $800,000 / 5 = $160,000.\n\nNow, if the IT is improved to 8 times, while the COGS remains the same, I can find the new average inventory.\n\nNew average inventory = $800,000 / 8 = $100,000.\n\nSo, compared to the initial average inventory of $160,000, the new average inventory is $100,000. That means the firm is holding less inventory, so they've released some funds.\n\nThe amount released would be the difference between the initial and new average inventory: $160,000 - $100,000 = $60,000.\n\nWait, but the question says \"a substantial amount of funds is released from or additionally invested in inventory.\" And the options are:\n\nA. $160,000 is released.\n\nB. $100,000 is additionally invested.\n\nC. $60,000 is additionally invested.\n\nD. $60,000 is released.\n\nSo, according to my calculation, it should be D. $60,000 is released.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nInitial average inventory: $160,000\n\nNew average inventory: $100,000\n\nDifference: $60,000 released.\n\nYes, that makes sense. By improving the inventory turnover from 5 to 8 times, the firm is able to reduce its average inventory holding by $60,000, which means that amount is released from inventory and can be used for other purposes.\n\nI think the answer is D. $60,000 is released.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
