                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to understand the difference between Responsibility to Protect, or R2P, and humanitarian intervention. The question gives me a few options, and I need to pick the one that best explains how R2P is different from humanitarian intervention.\n\nOption A says that R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention. Well, I think they are related but not exactly the same. Humanitarian intervention is when one country or a group of countries steps in to another country to prevent human suffering, often without the host country's consent. R2P, on the other hand, is a principle that evolved from the idea of humanitarian intervention, aiming to prevent mass atrocity crimes like genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.\n\nSo, maybe they are similar, but R2P has some specific elements that make it different. Let me look at option B: R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress. Hmm, I don't recall that being a necessary condition for R2P. In fact, one of the key aspects of R2P is that even if the state is unable or unwilling to protect its own citizens, the international community has a responsibility to step in. So, I don't think option B is correct.\n\nOption C says that R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some United Nations Security Council input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis. This sounds promising. R2P is guided by the UN and has a framework that includes preventive measures, peaceful diplomatic efforts, and, as a last resort, military intervention. The idea is to have a systematic approach rather than arbitrary interventions. Also, the primary objective is indeed to prevent mass atrocity crimes, which are humanitarian crises. So, this seems like a good answer.\n\nOption D states that R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not. I know that's not accurate because R2P has a spectrum of measures, and military intervention is only considered as a last resort. Most R2P responses are diplomatic, humanitarian, or other non-military measures. Humanitarian intervention, as I understand it, can also involve non-military assistance. So, this option doesn't seem right.\n\nLooking back, option C seems to capture the key differences: R2P is more structured, requires UN Security Council involvement, and its main goal is to prevent mass atrocity crimes. It's designed to be less arbitrary than previous forms of humanitarian intervention, which sometimes lacked clear guidelines and could be motivated by political interests rather than purely humanitarian concerns.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
