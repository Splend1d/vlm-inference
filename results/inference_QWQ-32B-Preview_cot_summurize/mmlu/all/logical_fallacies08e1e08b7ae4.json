It says, \"Asking a question that includes an unproven assumption may lead to which of the following fallacies?\" And then it gives options: A. Appeal to ignorance, B. Extension, C. a priori, D. Complex question.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each of these fallacies is. Let's start with the one that seems most familiar to me, which is D. Complex question. I think I've heard about that before. A complex question is like a trick question that has an unwarranted assumption built into it. For example, \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" That question assumes that you were beating your wife in the first place, which might not be true. So, if someone asks a question that includes an unproven assumption, it sounds a lot like a complex question.\n\nNow, let's look at option A: Appeal to ignorance. I think that's when someone argues that something must be true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. For example, \"Since you can't prove that extraterrestrials don't exist, they must exist.\" That doesn't seem to match the description in the question.\n\nOption B: Extension. I'm not sure what this is. Maybe it's a type of fallacy where someone extends an argument beyond its valid range, but I'm not entirely sure. It doesn't sound directly related to asking a question with an unproven assumption.\n\nOption C: a priori. This term is usually used in epistemology to describe knowledge that is independent of experience. In logic, it refers to arguments where the conclusion is supposed to follow necessarily from the premises without relying on empirical evidence. I don't think this is a fallacy; it's more of a type of reasoning. Maybe I'm misunderstanding it in this context.\n\nGiven that, it seems like D. Complex question is the most appropriate answer here. But let me double-check by making sure I understand what each option is.\n\nAppeal to ignorance: arguing based on lack of evidence.\n\nExtension: not sure, maybe it's a misprint or a less common term.\n\nA priori: a type of knowledge or reasoning, not a fallacy.\n\nComplex question: a question that has an unwarranted assumption.\n\nSo, asking a question that includes an unproven assumption would indeed be a complex question, which is a fallacy because it presumes something that hasn't been established.\n\nI think the answer is D. Complex question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
