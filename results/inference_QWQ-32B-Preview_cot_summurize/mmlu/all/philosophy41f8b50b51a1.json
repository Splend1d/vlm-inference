                    "text": "I'm trying to recall Anselm's argument here. He's talking about the concept of God, right? So, in his ontological argument, Anselm makes a distinction between existing in the mind and existing in reality. Let me think about this.\n\nOption A says \"is worshipped.\" That seems related to how people perceive God, but I don't think that's the direct comparison Anselm is making in his argument.\n\nOption B is \"is embodied.\" I know that some religious traditions have gods with physical forms, but I'm not sure if that's what Anselm is focusing on. He was a medieval philosopher, and his argument is more abstract.\n\nOption C is \"exists only in the understanding.\" That rings a bell. Anselm talks about something that exists in the mind or in the understanding versus something that exists in reality. I think this is the key distinction he's making.\n\nOption D is \"exists without flaws.\" That sounds like it relates to perfection, which is certainly a attribute ascribed to God. But I'm not sure if that's directly comparable to existence in reality.\n\nLet me try to remember the exact phrasing Anselm uses. He posits that God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived. Then he argues that if something exists in reality, it's greater than something that exists only in the understanding. So, according to him, a being that exists in reality is greater than a being that exists only in the understanding.\n\nTherefore, if God is the greatest possible being, he must exist in reality, not just in the understanding. That's the basic outline of his ontological argument.\n\nSo, going back to the options, it seems like C, \"exists only in the understanding,\" is the one that Anselm contrasts with existing in reality.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might not fit.\n\nA. \"is worshipped\" - While worship is certainly associated with God, Anselm's argument isn't primarily about worship; it's about the concept of greatness and existence.\n\nB. \"is embodied\" - Anselm's argument is more about existence in reality versus existence in the mind, not specifically about having a physical form.\n\nD. \"exists without flaws\" - Perfection is certainly part of the concept of God, but in the ontological argument, the focus is on existence and understanding.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C. A being that exists in reality is greater than a being that exists only in the understanding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
