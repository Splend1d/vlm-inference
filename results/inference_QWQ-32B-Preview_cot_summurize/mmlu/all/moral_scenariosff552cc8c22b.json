I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I washed my son's mouth with bleach.\" Hmm, that sounds really bad. Bleach is a strong chemical, and using it inside someone's mouth could be very harmful, even dangerous. I think most people would agree that intentionally harming a child like that is morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I presented the credit card I found in the lobby to stay at the pricey hotel.\" Okay, so here, someone found a credit card and used it to stay at a hotel. Using someone else's credit card without their permission is generally considered theft or fraud. That's probably also morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong. But let's double-check.\n\nIn the first scenario, washing a child's mouth with bleach could cause serious physical harm, and it's a form of abuse. That's clearly against moral standards that protect children from harm.\n\nIn the second scenario, using a found credit card without the owner's consent is stealing someone's identity and money. That's also against moral standards that value honesty and respect for others' property.\n\nTherefore, both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
