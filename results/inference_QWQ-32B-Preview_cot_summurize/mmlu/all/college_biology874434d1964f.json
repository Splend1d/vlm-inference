                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this biology question about sea urchin oocytes. It says that a rise in intracellular free calcium causes the release of proteolytic enzymes that prevent multiple sperm from fertilizing the egg. The question is asking which reaction this describes. The options are A. zona reaction, B. acrosomal reaction, C. cortical reaction, and D. fertilization reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these reactions entails.\n\nStarting with A, the zona reaction. I think this has something to do with the zona pellucida, which is a protective layer around the egg. Maybe it's a reaction that occurs in this layer after fertilization to block other sperm from entering. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption B is the acrosomal reaction. I remember that this is when the sperm head releases enzymes from its acrosome to help it penetrate the egg. So, this seems more related to the sperm's role in fertilization rather than the egg's response.\n\nOption C is the cortical reaction. From what I recall, this involves the release of enzymes from the egg's cortex after it's fertilized, and it's related to preventing polyspermy. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing.\n\nOption D is the fertilization reaction, which is a broad term for the overall process of fertilization. It probably includes all the other reactions, so it might not be specific enough for this question.\n\nLooking back at the question, it mentions a rise in intracellular calcium leading to the release of proteolytic enzymes that prevent multiple sperm from fertilizing the egg. This sounds like the egg is responding to fertilization by making changes to its exterior to block additional sperm.\n\nGiven that, the cortical reaction seems to fit best. In sea urchin eggs, after fertilization, there's an increase in intracellular calcium, which triggers the release of enzymes from the cortical granules. These enzymes modify the egg's surface, preventing other sperm from binding and penetrating, thus avoiding polyspermy.\n\nTo confirm, I should think about the other options again. The zona reaction might involve similar changes in the zona pellucida to block polyspermy, but I think that's more specific to mammals, not sea urchins. Sea urchins don't have a zona pellucida like mammals do; they have a different extracellular matrix.\n\nThe acrosomal reaction is definitely about the sperm, not the egg's response, so that doesn't fit.\n\nThe fertilization reaction is too general, as it encompasses all the events leading to the union of sperm and egg, including both the acrosomal and cortical reactions.\n\nTherefore, the most specific and correct answer should be the cortical reaction, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
