                    "text": "Let's think about this question step by step. We have a very weak base, and we need to determine what its pKb would likely be compared to pOH, or perhaps in relation to pH at 25\u00b0C.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what pKb is. pKb is the negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant, Kb. It's a measure of the strength of a base; the smaller the pKb, the stronger the base.\n\nA very weak base would have a very small Kb, which means its pKb would be large. That's because pKb = -log(Kb), so as Kb gets smaller, pKb gets larger.\n\nNow, pOH is the negative logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH-]. In aqueous solutions at 25\u00b0C, pH + pOH = 14, and pH is related to the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+].\n\nFor a base in solution, it reacts with water to produce OH- ions. The equilibrium for a base B is:\n\nB + H2O \u21cc BH+ + OH-\n\nThe base dissociation constant Kb is [BH+][OH-]/[B].\n\nFor a very weak base, only a tiny amount of B dissociates into BH+ and OH-, so the [OH-] produced is small, which means pOH would be large, since pOH = -log[OH-].\n\nWait, actually, if [OH-] is small, pOH is large. But in reality, for a very weak base, since it doesn't dissociate much, the [OH-] it produces is small, so pOH should be large.\n\nBut let's think about what pKb represents. pKb is a measure of the base's strength, not directly of the pOH of the solution. The pOH of the solution depends on the concentration of the base and its Kb.\n\nFor a very dilute solution of a weak base, the pOH might not be directly comparable to pKb.\n\nMaybe I should consider the relationship between pKb and pOH in more detail.\n\nI recall that for a weak base, the pOH of the solution can be related to pKb and the concentration of the base, but I don't remember the exact relationship off the top of my head.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the pH of the solution and relate it to pKb.\n\nWait, actually, for a base, the pH of the solution will be basic, meaning pH > 7 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nBut the question is about pKb relative to pOH.\n\nLet me consider option D first: Near 7 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nAt 25\u00b0C, pure water has pH = pOH = 7. For a base, especially a weak one, the pH should be greater than 7, meaning pOH would be less than 7.\n\nBut pKb is a measure of the base's strength, not directly its pOH. For a very weak base, pKb should be large, as Kb is small.\n\nSo, pKb would be greater than 7 for a weak base, because Kb is less than 1x10^-7.\n\nWait, no. At 25\u00b0C, for water, Kw = 1x10^-14 = [H+][OH-].\n\nFor a strong base, Kb is large, so pKb is small. For a weak base, Kb is small, so pKb is large.\n\nSo, a very weak base would have a large pKb, likely much greater than 7.\n\nOption D says \"Near 7 at 25\u00b0C\". That might be for a medium strength base, but for a very weak base, pKb should be higher than 7.\n\nOption A says \"Equal to the pOH\". Is pKb ever equal to pOH? I don't think so, at least not in general. It might be equal in some specific conditions, but not necessarily for a very weak base.\n\nOption B says \"Higher than the pOH\". Given that pKb is large for a very weak base, and pOH would be somewhat dependent on the concentration and Kb, but likely smaller than pKb for a very weak base.\n\nOption C says \"Lower than the pOH\". That would suggest pKb is smaller than pOH, which for a very weak base, with large pKb and small [OH-] (large pOH), doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. If pKb is large, and pOH is also large (since [OH-] is small), then pKb could be higher or lower than pOH depending on other factors.\n\nMaybe I need to look up the relationship between pKb and pOH.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for bases.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for a base is:\n\npOH = pKb + log([BH+]/[B])\n\nFor a very weak base, only a small amount dissociates, so [BH+] is much smaller than [B], meaning the log term is negative.\n\nTherefore, pOH = pKb + (negative number), which means pOH < pKb.\n\nSo, pOH is less than pKb for a very weak base.\n\nThat would suggest that pKb is higher than pOH.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIf pOH < pKb, that means pKb > pOH.\n\nSo, pKb is higher than pOH for a very weak base.\n\nThat makes sense because pKb is large, and pOH is also large, but for a very weak base, pKb should be larger than pOH.\n\nAlternatively, if the base is very strong, pKb would be small, and pOH would be small (since it produces a lot of OH-).\n\nBut in this case, we have a very weak base, so pKb is large, and pOH is large but likely smaller than pKb.\n\nTherefore, pKb is higher than pOH.\n\nSo, the answer should be option B: Higher than the pOH.\n\nOption D, near 7 at 25\u00b0C, might be incorrect because for a very weak base, pKb should be much higher than 7.\n\nFor example, if Kb = 1x10^-10, then pKb = 10, which is higher than 7.\n\nSimilarly, if Kb = 1x10^-12, pKb = 12, which is even higher.\n\nSo, in conclusion, for a very weak base, pKb is higher than pOH, and likely higher than 7 at 25\u00b0C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
