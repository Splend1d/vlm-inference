                    "text": "Let's see. So, when an object is set vibrating by a wave that has a matching frequency, what happens? Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. There's an object that starts vibrating because it's being affected by a wave. The key point is that the wave has a matching frequency to the object's natural frequency. So, the object and the wave are in sync in terms of frequency.\n\nNow, let's recall what each of these terms means:\n\nA. Forced vibration: This is when an object vibrates at a frequency different from its natural frequency because it's being forced by an external\u632f\u6e90. So, in this case, the object is being made to vibrate at a frequency that it wouldn't normally vibrate at on its own.\n\nB. Resonance: This is a phenomenon where an object vibrates with increased amplitude when the frequency of an external force matches the object's natural frequency. So, it's about amplifying the vibration when there's a frequency match.\n\nC. Refraction: This is when waves change direction as they pass from one medium to another due to a change in speed. It's more about the bending of waves, not about vibration.\n\nD. Amplitude reduction: This would suggest that the vibration's amplitude decreases over time, maybe due to damping or energy loss.\n\nGiven that, in this scenario, the wave has a matching frequency to the object's natural frequency, which one makes the most sense?\n\nWell, if the frequency matches, and the object starts vibrating, it's likely because the external wave is reinforcing the object's natural tendency to vibrate at that frequency. That sounds a lot like resonance.\n\nForced vibration, on the other hand, typically involves vibrating an object at a frequency that's not its natural frequency. So, that doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nRefraction is about waves bending, which isn't directly related to the vibration of an object due to a matching frequency.\n\nAmplitude reduction suggests a decrease in vibration, but the question says the object is set vibrating, which implies an increase or initiation of vibration.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be B. resonance.\n\nBut let's double-check. Resonance occurs when the frequency of the external force matches the natural frequency of the object, leading to a large amplitude of vibration. That matches the scenario described in the question.\n\nSo, I think B. resonance is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
