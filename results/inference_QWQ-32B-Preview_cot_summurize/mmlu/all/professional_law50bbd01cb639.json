                    "text": "So here's this scenario involving a contractor, an owner, and an electrician, and there's a bunch of bidding going on. Let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's this owner who has a big office building and wants to renovate it. So, she asks several contractors to submit bids for the work. One of these contractors needs to figure out how much it's going to cost him to do the job, so he reaches out to subcontractors, including an electrician, to get their bids for specific parts of the job.\n\nThe electrician submits a bid to the contractor for the electrical work, and the contractor uses that bid to calculate his overall bid to the owner. The contractor tells the electrician that he's using his bid in the bigger picture.\n\nSo, the contractor submits his bid to the owner for $75,000. A week or two goes by, and then the electrician suddenly says, \"Hey, I can't do the electrical work for your project.\" This is a problem for the contractor because he's already submitted his bid to the owner based on the electrician's prices.\n\nTwo days after the electrician backs out, the owner sends the contractor a signed letter accepting his $75,000 bid. So now there's a contract between the contractor and the owner at $75,000.\n\nBut since the original electrician can't do the work, the contractor has to find another electrician. This new electrician charges $5,000 more than the original electrician's bid. So now, the contractor's costs have increased by $5,000.\n\nThe contractor explains this to the owner and says the total cost now needs to be $80,000. But the owner says no, she's sticking to the original $75,000 and won't pay any extra.\n\nSo, the contractor goes ahead and does the work, but the owner hasn't paid anything yet. Now, the contractor is suing the owner for the services rendered, and we need to figure out how much he'll probably recover.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.\n\nB. Only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $80,000, the contractor effectively repudiated his contract with the owner.\n\nC. $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.\n\nD. $80,000, because the contractor reasonably relied to his detriment on the electrician's bid in formulating his job estimate.\n\nOkay, let's understand what these terms mean.\n\nFirst, quantum meruit is a legal doctrine that allows a party to recover the value of the services they provided when there's no contract or when the contract is unenforceable or void. It's like being paid for the work done based on what it's worth, not necessarily what was agreed in a contract.\n\nDoctrine of commercial frustration is a concept where external events beyond the control of the parties make the performance of the contract impossible or impracticable, and thus the contract is discharged.\n\nRepudiation is when one party indicates that they won't perform their obligations under the contract, essentially cancelling it.\n\nSo, let's apply these concepts to the scenario.\n\nOption A suggests that the contractor can only recover in quantum meruit because of commercial frustration. Is there commercial frustration here? The electrician backing out could be seen as an external event that increased the contractor's costs, but is it enough to frustrate the contract? Probably not, because the contractor still performed the work; he just had to pay more for the electrical work. The owner still got the renovation she wanted; she just doesn't want to pay extra for the increased costs.\n\nOption B says the contractor can only recover in quantum meruit because by demanding $80,000, he effectively repudiated the contract. Did the contractor repudiate the contract by asking for more money? Probably not. He's just informing the owner that his costs have increased due to circumstances beyond his control, and he needs to adjust the price accordingly. The owner's response was to stick to the original $75,000, but that doesn't mean the contractor repudiated the contract. He still went ahead and performed the work.\n\nOption C says the contractor can recover only $75,000 because that was the contract price. Well, there is a contract at $75,000, but the contractor's costs increased due to the electrician backing out. So, is he stuck with the higher costs, or can he get more from the owner?\n\nOption D says the contractor can recover $80,000 because he reasonably relied on the electrician's bid when formulating his estimate. This seems plausible because the contractor based his bid on the electrician's prices, and when that fell through, he had to pay more.\n\nBut let's think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between the contractor and the owner for $75,000. The contractor is bound by that price unless there's a valid reason to adjust it.\n\nThe electrician backing out is a risk that the contractor assumed when he based his bid on the electrician's prices. In other words, the contractor was taking on the risk that the electrician might not be able to perform or might increase his prices.\n\nThis is a common scenario in construction: contractors bid based on subcontractor quotes, and if those subcontractors back out or increase their prices, the contractor is still bound by his contract with the owner unless there's a provision in the contract allowing for price adjustments.\n\nIn this case, there's no mention of any such provision. So, it seems like the contractor is responsible for any increases in subcontractor costs.\n\nHowever, the contractor did inform the owner about the increase and proposed a new price, but the owner refused. So, by continuing to perform the work, is the contractor agreeing to do it for the original price?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the contractor is entitled to quantum meruit, which would allow him to be paid based on the value of the services provided, rather than the contract price.\n\nBut in quantum meruit, the recovery is based on the reasonable value of the services, not necessarily the contract price or the increased costs.\n\nIn this case, since there's an existing contract for $75,000, it might be difficult for the contractor to recover in quantum meruit. Quantum meruit is typically used when there's no contract or when the contract is void or unenforceable.\n\nMoreover, the doctrine of commercial frustration might not apply here because the contractor was able to perform the work, just at a higher cost. Frustration of purpose usually applies when the fundamental purpose of the contract is destroyed by an event beyond the control of the parties.\n\nIn this scenario, the contractor's purpose wasn't destroyed; he just had higher costs.\n\nOption B suggests that by asking for $80,000, the contractor repudiated the contract. But repudiation typically means refusing to perform the contract or indicating that you won't perform as agreed. Here, the contractor is just informing the owner of increased costs and proposing a new price. He's still willing to perform the work; he just needs more money to cover his increased expenses.\n\nThe owner's response was to stick to the original price, essentially telling the contractor to live with the higher costs.\n\nSo, in legal terms, the contractor is probably bound by the original contract price of $75,000, meaning option C is correct.\n\nHowever, the contractor might have a claim against the electrician for breach of contract, but that's a separate issue.\n\nWait a minute, but the electrician never had a contract with the owner; he had a bid submitted to the contractor, and the contractor used that bid to formulate his own bid to the owner.\n\nSo, the electrician's bid to the contractor is more like an offer that the contractor accepted by relying on it in his own bid to the owner.\n\nBut since the electrician backed out before any actual contract was formed between him and the contractor, the contractor might not have a straightforward breach of contract claim against the electrician.\n\nNevertheless, that's a separate issue.\n\nBack to the main question: in an action by the contractor against the owner, what can the contractor recover?\n\nGiven that there's an existing contract for $75,000, and the contractor performed the work, he's entitled to the contract price, which is $75,000.\n\nThe fact that his costs increased due to having to hire a more expensive electrician doesn't change that, unless there's a provision in the contract allowing for price adjustments in such scenarios.\n\nSince there's no mention of such a provision, the contractor is likely stuck with the higher costs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is probably C: $75,000 only, because that was the contract price.\n\nOptions A and B suggest recovery in quantum meruit, but given that there's an existing contract, quantum meruit might not be applicable here.\n\nOption D is attractive because it acknowledges the contractor's reliance on the electrician's bid, but again, the contract is with the owner for $75,000, and the contractor assumed the risk of subcontractor price fluctuations.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the contractor will probably be able to recover only the contract price of $75,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
