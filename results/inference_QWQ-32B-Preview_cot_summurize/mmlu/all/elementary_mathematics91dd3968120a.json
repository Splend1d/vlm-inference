                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about making salad dressing. It says that the dressing is made by combining 2 parts vinegar with 5 parts oil. And the question is, how many ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar? The options are A. 2, B. 3.6, C. 22.5, and D. 63.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The ratio of vinegar to oil is 2:5. That means for every 2 parts of vinegar, you need 5 parts of oil. So, if I have 9 ounces of vinegar, I need to find out how many ounces of oil correspond to that amount based on the ratio.\n\nOne way to approach this is to set up a proportion. So, if 2 parts vinegar correspond to 5 parts oil, then 9 parts vinegar should correspond to x parts oil. Mathematically, that would be:\n\n2/5 = 9/x\n\nWait, actually, no. Proportions work by setting up equal ratios. So, the ratio of vinegar to oil is 2:5, which is the same as 2/5. If I have 9 ounces of vinegar and I want to find the corresponding amount of oil, I should set up the proportion as:\n\n2/5 = 9/x\n\nYes, that makes sense. Now, I need to solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying, I get:\n\n2*x = 5*9\n\nSo, 2x = 45\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 45/2\n\nx = 22.5\n\nOkay, so according to this, I need 22.5 ounces of oil for 9 ounces of vinegar. That matches option C.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to think about this. Maybe using the concept of total parts.\n\nThe total parts in the mixture are 2 parts vinegar + 5 parts oil = 7 parts.\n\nSo, if I have 9 ounces of vinegar, which is 2 parts, I can find out what one part is equal to.\n\nSo, 2 parts = 9 ounces\n\nTherefore, 1 part = 9/2 ounces\n\nNow, since oil is 5 parts, oil would be 5 * (9/2) = 45/2 = 22.5 ounces\n\nAgain, that's 22.5 ounces of oil, which is option C.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using decimals.\n\nThe ratio is 2:5, so the multiplier for vinegar to oil is 5/2.\n\nWait, no. Let's see.\n\nIf I have 9 ounces of vinegar and the ratio is 2 parts vinegar to 5 parts oil, then the amount of oil should be (5/2) times the amount of vinegar.\n\nSo, oil = (5/2)*vinegar\n\nOil = (5/2)*9 = (5*9)/2 = 45/2 = 22.5 ounces\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's a chance I'm misinterpreting the ratio.\n\nThe problem says \"2 parts vinegar with 5 parts oil,\" which is a ratio of 2:5.\n\nBut just to be sure, sometimes people might confuse the order.\n\nWait, the ratio is vinegar to oil, 2:5.\n\nSo, for every 2 units of vinegar, there are 5 units of oil.\n\nYes, that's clear.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the proportion of vinegar in the total dressing, it's 2/(2+5) = 2/7.\n\nSimilarly, the proportion of oil is 5/7.\n\nSo, if I have 9 ounces of vinegar, which is 2/7 of the total dressing, I can find the total dressing.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s say the total dressing is t ounces.\n\nThen, vinegar is 2/7 of t, which is equal to 9 ounces.\n\nSo, 2/7 * t = 9\n\nTherefore, t = 9 * (7/2) = 63/2 = 31.5 ounces\n\nNow, the oil is 5/7 of the total dressing.\n\nSo, oil = 5/7 * 31.5 = (5*31.5)/7 = 157.5/7 = 22.5 ounces\n\nAgain, the same answer, 22.5 ounces.\n\nIt seems like no matter which way I approach this, I keep getting 22.5 ounces of oil.\n\nLet me check if perhaps I'm making a calculation error or misreading the options.\n\nThe options are A. 2, B. 3.6, C. 22.5, D. 63.\n\nOption C is 22.5, which matches my calculations.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if perchance the ratio was being misinterpreted.\n\nWait, what if the ratio was oil to vinegar instead of vinegar to oil?\n\nThe problem says \"2 parts vinegar with 5 parts oil,\" so it's vinegar to oil, 2:5.\n\nIf it were oil to vinegar, it would be 5:2, but that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me by putting a similar number like 22.5 and 63.\n\nBut according to my calculations, 22.5 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misprint in the options.\n\nWait, let's read the problem again.\n\n\"A salad dressing is made by combining 2 parts vinegar with 5 parts oil. How many ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar?\n\nA. 2\nB. 3.6\nC. 22.5\nD. 63\"\n\nEverything seems fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the units are confusing me, but it's all in ounces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is meant to be volume ratios, not weight ratios, but in liquid measurements, ounces can be volume.\n\nBut in any case, the ratio should still hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some systems, ounces measure weight differently, but I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nI think the answer is clearly 22.5 ounces of oil.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. 22.5\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
