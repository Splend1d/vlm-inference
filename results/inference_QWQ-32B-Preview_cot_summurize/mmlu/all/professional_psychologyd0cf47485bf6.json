The psychologist is going through a tough time with a divorce, and it's affecting him negatively\u2014he's drinking and feeling depressed. Now, as a professional, especially one who provides mental health services, it's crucial to maintain certain standards for the sake of his clients' well-being and his own.\n\nOption A suggests that he should dive deeper into his work to distract himself from his personal issues. While staying busy can sometimes help, in this case, it might not be the best approach. If he's depressed and drinking, it could impair his judgment and ability to provide proper care to his clients. So, overworking might not solve his problems and could even make things worse.\n\nOption B recommends seeking professional consultation and possibly taking a temporary break from practice. This seems like a more responsible choice. By seeking consultation, he can get support and guidance on how to handle his personal issues without compromising his professional duties. Temporarily suspending his practice ensures that his clients aren't adversely affected by his current state.\n\nOption C suggests explaining the situation to his clients and offering to refer them to other therapists. While transparency is important, it might not be appropriate to burden clients with his personal problems. Moreover, some clients might not feel comfortable continuing therapy under these circumstances, even if he offers referrals.\n\nOption D advises immediately referring his clients to other therapists. This seems abrupt and might not be in the best interest of his clients, especially if they're in the middle of treatment. It's essential to manage this transition carefully to ensure that clients' needs are met without disruption.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think option B is the most appropriate step. Seeking professional help for himself and possibly taking a temporary leave from practice will allow him to address his personal issues without jeopardizing his clients' welfare. It also demonstrates accountability and a commitment to maintaining professional standards.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
