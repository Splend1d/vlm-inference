(A), (B), and (C) are part of the theory\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe kinetic-molecular theory of gases is a model that explains the behavior of gases based on the motion of their constituent particles. According to this theory:\n\nA. The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is directly related to the Kelvin temperature. This means that as the temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the gas particles increases, and vice versa. This relationship is expressed by the equation KE_avg = (3/2)kT, where KE_avg is the average kinetic energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nB. Ideal gas particles do not attract or repel each other. In other words, there are no intermolecular forces between the particles of an ideal gas. This assumption simplifies the calculations and allows for the development of the ideal gas law.\n\nC. The atoms or molecules of an ideal gas have no volume. This means that the particles are considered to be point masses with no physical size. Again, this is an approximation that makes the theory easier to work with, although in reality, gas particles do have a small volume.\n\nTherefore, all of the statements A, B, and C are part of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases, making option D the correct choice.\n\n"
