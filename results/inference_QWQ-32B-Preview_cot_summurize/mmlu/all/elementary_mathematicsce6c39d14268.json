                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the Tranquility Inn's weekly milk order. They order 40 gallons of low-fat milk and 15 gallons of chocolate milk. I need to find the ratio of low-fat gallons to chocolate gallons. The options are A. 3:1, B. 5:1, C. 5:3, and D. 8:3.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what a ratio is. A ratio compares two quantities by division. So, in this case, I'll divide the amount of low-fat milk by the amount of chocolate milk.\n\nSo, the ratio is 40 gallons of low-fat to 15 gallons of chocolate. That is 40:15.\n\nNow, I should simplify this ratio. To simplify, I can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 40 and 15 is 5.\n\nSo, dividing both by 5: 40 \u00f7 5 = 8, and 15 \u00f7 5 = 3.\n\nTherefore, the simplified ratio is 8:3.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 8:3 matches this.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in fraction form: 40/15.\n\nSimplifying 40/15 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5 gives 8/3.\n\nSo, the ratio is indeed 8:3.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if any other option makes sense.\n\nOption A is 3:1, which would mean 3 parts low-fat to 1 part chocolate. That would be 3x for low-fat and x for chocolate. So, 3x = 40 and x = 15. But 3x = 45, which is not 40. So, doesn't match.\n\nOption B is 5:1, which would be 5x = 40 and x = 15. But 5x = 5*15=75, not 40. Doesn't match.\n\nOption C is 5:3, which would be 5x = 40 and 3x = 15. Solving 5x=40 gives x=8, and 3x=24, which is not 15. Doesn't match.\n\nOption D is 8:3, which is what I got earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the total gallons.\n\nTotal gallons are 40 + 15 = 55 gallons.\n\nBut the ratio is only between low-fat and chocolate, so the total isn't directly relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see how many times 15 goes into 40.\n\n40 divided by 15 is 2.666..., which is 8/3, reinforcing the 8:3 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at it is to find how much low-fat milk there is per gallon of chocolate milk.\n\nSo, for every gallon of chocolate milk, there are 40/15 = 8/3 gallons of low-fat milk.\n\nThat's again 8:3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can scale the ratio up or down to see if it matches the orders.\n\nFor example, if I have 8 gallons of low-fat to 3 gallons of chocolate, but the order is for 40 and 15.\n\n40 \u00f7 8 = 5, and 15 \u00f7 3 = 5. So, it scales up by the same factor, confirming 8:3.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the options:\n\nA. 3:1 - 3*15 = 45, not 40.\n\nB. 5:1 - 5*15=75, not 40.\n\nC. 5:3 - 5*3=15 for chocolate, and 5*5=25 for low-fat, but it's 40.\n\nD. 8:3 - 8*1.875=15 for chocolate, and 3*1.875=5.625, but that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the ratio in simplest forms, and I need to see which option matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the options.\n\nWait, option D is 8:3, which matches the simplified ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the difference between low-fat and chocolate milk.\n\nThe difference is 40 - 15 = 25 gallons.\n\nBut ratios aren't about differences; they're about multiples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of fractions.\n\nThe fraction of low-fat to total is 40/55, and chocolate is 15/55.\n\nBut no, the ratio is between low-fat and chocolate, not including both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio as low-fat : chocolate = 40 : 15, which simplifies to 8:3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can cross-multiply to check.\n\nFor option D, 8:3, 8/3 = 40/15, which is true.\n\nFor option C, 5:3, 5/3 = 40/15? 5/3 is 5*15=75, not 40.\n\nWait, no, to check if 5:3 equals 40:15, I can cross-multiply: 5*15=75, and 3*40=120. Since 75 \u2260 120, they are not equal.\n\nFor option D, 8:3, 8*15=120, and 3*40=120. Since 120=120, they are equal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 8:3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me by offering similar ratios.\n\nBut based on the calculations, D is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to express the ratio in lowest terms, which I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the ratio in a different format, but the options are in : format, so it should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that chocolate milk is a type of milk, and low-fat is another category.\n\nBut in terms of gallons ordered, it's straightforward.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the ratio is 8:3, which is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
