                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. A group of friends go out to lunch. There are d people who buy salad and p people who buy soup. Each salad costs $3.99 and each soup costs $2.99. I need to write an expression for the total cost of the soup and salads.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to find out how much the salads cost in total and how much the soups cost in total, and then add those two amounts together to get the total cost.\n\nSo, if d people buy salad and each salad costs $3.99, then the total cost for salads should be d times $3.99, right? That would be 3.99d.\n\nSimilarly, p people buy soup, and each soup costs $2.99, so the total cost for soups should be p times $2.99, which is 2.99p.\n\nNow, to find the total cost of both salads and soups, I just need to add those two amounts together. So, total cost = 3.99d + 2.99p.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 3.99p + 2.99d\n\nB. 2.99p + 3.99d\n\nC. (2.99 + 3.99)(p + d)\n\nD. (3.99p + 2.99)d\n\nHmm, my expression is 3.99d + 2.99p. Looking at option A, it's 3.99p + 2.99d, which has the variables switched. Option B is 2.99p + 3.99d, which is similar to my expression but has the coefficients switched. Option C is (2.99 + 3.99)(p + d), which seems like it's adding the costs and multiplying by the total number of people. Option D is (3.99p + 2.99)d, which looks like it's grouping things differently.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check my initial approach. Let's think about it again.\n\nEach salad costs $3.99, and d people buy salads, so total cost for salads is indeed 3.99d.\n\nEach soup costs $2.99, and p people buy soups, so total cost for soups is 2.99p.\n\nTotal cost should be the sum of these two, which is 3.99d + 2.99p.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, option B is 2.99p + 3.99d, which is the same as 3.99d + 2.99p, just written in a different order. Addition is commutative, so either order is fine. So, option B matches my expression.\n\nOption A has the variables switched, which would mean p people buying salads and d buying soups, which isn't what the problem states.\n\nOption C is (2.99 + 3.99)(p + d). That would be like adding the cost of one salad and one soup and then multiplying by the total number of people. But that doesn't make sense because not everyone is buying both a salad and a soup; some buy only salad, some buy only soup.\n\nOption D is (3.99p + 2.99)d, which seems like it's multiplying the sum of 3.99p and 2.99 by d. That doesn't align with the scenario described.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression should be option B: 2.99p + 3.99d.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had 3.99d + 2.99p, which is the same as option B, just written in a different order. So, yes, option B is correct.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Is there a possibility that some people buy both salad and soup? The problem doesn't mention that, so I'm assuming that each person buys either salad or soup, not both.\n\nGiven that, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to think about the total cost being the sum of the individual costs for each type of item, multiplied by the number of people buying each.\n\nSo, total cost = (cost per salad)(number of salads) + (cost per soup)(number of soups) = 3.99d + 2.99p.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option B: 2.99p + 3.99d.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
