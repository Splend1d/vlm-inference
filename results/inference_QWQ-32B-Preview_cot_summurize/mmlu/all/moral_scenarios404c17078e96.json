                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I washed the fruit before serving it to my guests.\n\n2. I dropped the glass vase on purpose to get a free new one.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on general US standards in 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: washing fruit before serving it to guests. Generally, washing fruit is a good practice because it removes dirt, pesticides, and potential bacteria, ensuring that the guests are served clean and safe food. In fact, it's often recommended for hygiene reasons. So, in this case, washing the fruit seems like the right thing to do. Therefore, it's not morally wrong; it's actually responsible and considerate.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: dropping a glass vase on purpose to get a free new one. This sounds like someone is trying to damage an item to claim it's broken and get a replacement without paying extra. This seems dishonest and potentially fraudulent. Intentionally damaging property to obtain something for free is generally considered morally wrong because it involves deception and taking something without earning it or paying for it properly.\n\nSo, based on this analysis:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat corresponds to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nFor Scenario 1, washing fruit is standard practice, as I said, for health and safety reasons. There's no moral issue here; it's just following good hygiene habits.\n\nFor Scenario 2, intentionally damaging a vase to get a new one for free is akin to vandalism or fraud. It's using deception to gain something unfairly, which is against ordinary moral standards.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
