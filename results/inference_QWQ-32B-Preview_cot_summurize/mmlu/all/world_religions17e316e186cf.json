                    "text": "I've got this question about a group called the Celestial Masters. It says they're an anti-Han rebel group, and I need to figure out which tradition they belong to. The options are Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, or Shamanism. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who the Celestial Masters are. I think they were a group that rebelled against the Han dynasty in China. I remember something about a rebellion during the Han period, maybe around the time of the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Yeah, that sounds familiar.\n\nNow, which tradition were they associated with? Let me think about Buddhism. Buddhism was present in China during the Han dynasty, but I'm not sure if the Celestial Masters were Buddhists. I think Buddhism was more of a religious and philosophical tradition, but maybe they incorporated some Buddhist ideas.\n\nNext, Daoism. I know that Daoism is an indigenous Chinese philosophy and religion that emphasizes living in harmony with the Dao, which is the way or the natural order of things. During the Han dynasty, there were various Daoist movements and sects. Could the Celestial Masters be one of them?\n\nConfucianism is more about social ethics and proper conduct, focusing on relationships and hierarchical structures. It seems less likely that a rebel group would be based on Confucian principles, as Confucianism generally supports the existing social order.\n\nShamanism is a practice that involves spiritual intermediaries who can communicate with the spirit world. It's older than the Han dynasty and was probably present in China, but I don't recall if the Celestial Masters were specifically associated with shamanism.\n\nLet me try to recall some details about the Celestial Masters. I think they were founded by a man named Zhang Daoling, who claimed to have received revelations from the deified version of Laozi, who is considered the founder of Daoism. If that's the case, then they must be associated with Daoism.\n\nAlso, I remember that the Celestial Masters implemented a theocratic form of government, with religious leaders also serving as political leaders. This sounds like a religious movement, and since they were rebelling against the Han dynasty, it makes sense that they would have their own religious basis.\n\nComparing this with Buddhism, which at that time was still relatively new in China and hadn't yet established the same level of influence, I think Daoism is a better fit.\n\nMoreover, the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which was another Daoist-inspired rebellion around the same time, had similar characteristics. Both groups used religious symbolism and millenarian beliefs to mobilize followers against the Han dynasty.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the Celestial Masters belong to the Daoist tradition.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's some connection to Shamanism within Daoism. After all, some Daoist practices do involve rituals and communication with spirits, which might have shamanic elements. But I think Shamanism is too broad a category and not specifically associated with the Celestial Masters.\n\nConfucianism, again, seems unlikely because it's more about social order and less about rebellion.\n\nBuddhism might have had some influence, but I think the core tradition of the Celestial Masters is Daoist.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer should be B. Daoism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
