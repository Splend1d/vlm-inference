So, the question is: \"A transformational leader uses 'framing' in order to:\" and then it gives four options. I need to pick the one that best describes why a transformational leader would use framing.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what transformational leadership is. Transformational leaders are those who inspire and motivate their followers to achieve extraordinary outcomes. They don't just manage; they lead by example, and they challenge the status quo to bring about positive change. Framing, in this context, probably refers to how the leader presents information or ideas to their team.\n\nOption A says: \"make the organization\u2019s goals more meaningful to employees.\" Hmm, that sounds plausible. Transformational leaders are known for connecting the organization's goals to the personal values and motivations of their employees. By framing these goals in a way that resonates with employees' own aspirations and beliefs, leaders can inspire greater commitment and effort.\n\nOption B is: \"clarify the consequences of undesirable performance.\" Well, that seems more like a transactional approach, where leaders focus on rewards and punishments based on performance. While it's important to address performance issues, this doesn't align as closely with the inspirational and motivational aspects of transformational leadership.\n\nOption C says: \"reduce personal biases in decision-making.\" Framing can indeed influence how decisions are perceived and made, but I'm not sure if this is the primary purpose of using framing in transformational leadership. Transformational leaders are more about inspiring change and growth, so this option seems a bit off-track.\n\nOption D is: \"adapt his/her leadership style to the characteristics of subordinates.\" This sounds more like situational leadership, where the leader changes their approach based on the maturity and capabilities of their team members. While transformational leaders do consider their followers' needs, the core of transformational leadership is about inspiring and motivating through a vision, not necessarily adapting their style to individual characteristics.\n\nComparing all these options, Option A seems to be the most aligned with the principles of transformational leadership. It's about making the organization's goals meaningful to employees, which is a key aspect of inspiring and motivating them to achieve beyond their usual limits.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a way that framing could relate to other options as well. For example, clarifying consequences could be part of framing, but it feels more punitive and less inspiring. Reducing personal biases might be a beneficial side effect of framing, but it doesn't seem to be the primary purpose in transformational leadership. Adapting leadership style could involve framing messages differently to different people, but again, that's more about situational leadership.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is Option A: \"make the organization\u2019s goals more meaningful to employees.\" This aligns with the transformational leader's role in inspiring and motivating their team by connecting the organizational objectives to the employees' personal values and aspirations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
