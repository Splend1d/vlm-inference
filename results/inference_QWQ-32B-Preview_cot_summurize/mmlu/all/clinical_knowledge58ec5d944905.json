It is produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary gland. ADH acts on the kidneys to increase water reabsorption, thereby concentrating the urine and reducing urine volume. This helps to maintain the body's fluid balance and blood pressure.\n\nInsulin (option B) is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake of glucose into cells.\n\nAdrenaline (option C), also known as epinephrine, is involved in the body's stress response, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy availability.\n\nTestosterone (option D) is a sex hormone that plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues and secondary sexual characteristics.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Antidiuretic hormone."
