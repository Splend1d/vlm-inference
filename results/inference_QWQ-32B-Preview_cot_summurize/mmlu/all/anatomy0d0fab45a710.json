The other nerves listed have different functions:\n\n- Abducens (VI): Controls the lateral rectus muscle of the eye, which moves the eye laterally.\n\n- Hypoglossal (XII): Supplies motor innervation to all the muscles of the tongue.\n\n- Trochlear (IV): Innervates the superior oblique muscle of the eye, which helps in downward and inward eye movement.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Olfactory."
