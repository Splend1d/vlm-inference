The options are situation analysis, strategy, implementation, and evaluation. I remember that Cutlip talked about these stages in his book from 2006, but I need to recall the specifics.\n\nFirst, let's think about the situation analysis. That's usually the starting point where you assess the current environment, understand the problem or opportunity, and gather information about the target audience and stakeholders. It's more about understanding the context rather than planning the message itself. So, probably not A.\n\nNext, the strategy stage. This is where you decide on the overall approach, goals, and objectives of the communication plan. You would determine the key messages and the rationale behind them\u2014basically, what you want to say and why you want to say it. This sounds like it could be the right answer.\n\nThen there's implementation, which is about putting the plan into action. This includes choosing the right channels, creating the content, and executing the communication activities. While you do decide what to say here, the planning of the message and its purpose should have been done in the strategy stage.\n\nFinally, evaluation involves assessing the effectiveness of the communication plan after it's been implemented. It's about measuring whether the objectives were met and learning from the experience. So, this isn't about planning what to say; it's about checking if what was said worked as intended.\n\nBased on this, it seems like the strategy stage is where you plan what should be said and why. So, the answer should be B. Strategy.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check with the book or a reliable source. Cutlip is a well-known author in public relations, and his books are standard references. Perhaps looking up a summary or an online resource could confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the general process of communication planning. Typically, it follows a logical sequence: understanding the situation, devising a strategy, implementing the strategy, and then evaluating the results. The planning of messages and their purposes falls under devising the strategy.\n\nSo, even without the specific reference to Cutlip's 2006 book, it makes sense that the strategy stage is where you plan what to say and why.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is B. Strategy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
