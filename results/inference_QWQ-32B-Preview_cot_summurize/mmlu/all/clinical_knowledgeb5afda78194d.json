                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to relate the rate of oxygen consumption to the rate of energy expenditure. This relationship is based on the concept of oxygen calorific equivalent, which is the amount of energy released per liter of oxygen consumed.\n\nThe standard value for the oxygen calorific equivalent in humans is approximately 20.1 kJ per liter of oxygen consumed. This value can vary slightly depending on the type of metabolic substrates being used (e.g., carbohydrates, fats), but for general purposes, 20 kJ/L is a commonly used approximation.\n\nGiven that the athlete's mean rate of oxygen consumption is 2 L/min, we can calculate the rate of energy expenditure using the following formula:\n\nRate of energy expenditure (kJ/min) = Rate of oxygen consumption (L/min) \u00d7 Oxygen calorific equivalent (kJ/L)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nRate of energy expenditure = 2 L/min \u00d7 20 kJ/L = 40 kJ/min\n\nTherefore, the approximate rate of energy expenditure is 40 kJ/min, which corresponds to option D.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a simplified calculation and actual energy expenditure can be influenced by various factors, including the efficiency of the athlete, the specific activities being performed, and individual metabolic differences. However, for the purposes of this question, using the standard oxygen calorific equivalent provides a reasonable estimate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
