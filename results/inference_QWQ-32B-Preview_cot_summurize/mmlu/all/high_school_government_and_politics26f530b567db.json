                    "text": "Let's see which statement about the House of Representatives is correct. I need to recall some facts about the U.S. Congress here.\n\nOption A says that all revenue bills must originate in the Senate before moving to the House. Hmm, I think I remember that actually, all revenue bills must originate in the House of Representatives. Isn't that a key power given to the House? So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption B claims that representation in the House is allocated equally among the states, while representation in the Senate is allocated proportional to population. Wait, I know that in the Senate, each state has two senators, so that's equal representation. In the House, representation is based on population, so more populous states have more representatives. So, this statement seems to have it backwards.\n\nOption C says that the Speaker of the House wields less power than the president pro tempore of the Senate. I think the Speaker of the House is actually a very powerful position; they lead the House, appoint committee chairs, and play a major role in setting the legislative agenda. The president pro tempore of the Senate is mostly a ceremonial role, usually filled by the most senior senator of the majority party. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D states that the House has a Committee on Ways and Means, while the Senate does not. I believe the House does have a Committee on Ways and Means, which deals with taxation and revenue. As for the Senate, I think they have a similar committee called the Finance Committee, which handles tax and budget issues. So, perhaps the Senate doesn't have a Committee on Ways and Means specifically, but they do have equivalent functions.\n\nWait a minute, actually, in the House, the committee dealing with taxation is the Ways and Means Committee, and in the Senate, it's the Finance Committee. So, technically, the Senate doesn't have a Ways and Means Committee. Maybe this is the correct statement.\n\nLet me double-check. If all revenue bills must originate in the House, and the House has a specific committee for ways and means related to revenue, while the Senate has a different committee for similar issues, then statement D seems accurate.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm the other options again.\n\nOption A is definitely incorrect because revenue bills originate in the House, not the Senate.\n\nOption B is wrong because House representation is based on population, not equal among states.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Speaker of the House is more powerful than the president pro tempore of the Senate.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is D: The House has a Committee on Ways and Means, while the Senate does not.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
