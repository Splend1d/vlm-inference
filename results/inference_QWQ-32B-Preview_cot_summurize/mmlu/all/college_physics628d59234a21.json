                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a meter stick is moving past an observer at a speed of 0.8 times the speed of light, which is pretty fast! And I need to figure out how long it takes for the entire stick to pass by the observer, from the observer's point of view. The options are in nanoseconds, which tells me that things are happening really quickly here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics of special relativity because speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. One key concept is length contraction. According to special relativity, an object in motion is measured to be shorter in the direction of motion by an observer at rest. The formula for length contraction is:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( L \\) is the length observed by the stationary observer.\n\n- \\( L_0 \\) is the proper length of the object (its length in its rest frame).\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of the object.\n\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nIn this case, the meter stick has a proper length of 1 meter, and it's moving at \\( v = 0.8c \\). So, I can plug these values into the formula to find \\( L \\), the length of the stick as observed by the stationary observer.\n\nLet me calculate the gamma factor, \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\), which is often used in relativity. For \\( v = 0.8c \\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.8)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.64}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.36}} = \\frac{1}{0.6} \\approx 1.6667 \\]\n\nSo, the observed length \\( L \\) is:\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{L_0}{\\gamma} = \\frac{1 \\text{ meter}}{1.6667} \\approx 0.6 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\nWait a minute, actually, the formula I first wrote is correct: \\( L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\), which is equivalent to \\( L = \\frac{L_0}{\\gamma} \\). So, yes, the observed length is shorter than the proper length.\n\nNow, to find out how long it takes for the stick to pass the observer, I need to consider the time it takes for the entire length of the stick to go by. Since the stick is moving at speed \\( v = 0.8c \\), and the observed length is \\( L = 0.6 \\) meters, the time \\( t \\) should be:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{L}{v} = \\frac{0.6 \\text{ meters}}{0.8c} \\]\n\nBut I need to express this in seconds. Knowing that \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\) meters per second, then:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{0.6}{0.8 \\times 3 \\times 10^8} = \\frac{0.6}{2.4 \\times 10^8} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ seconds} = 0.25 \\text{ nanoseconds} \\]\n\nWait, but that's not matching any of the options provided: 1.6 ns, 2.5 ns, 4.2 ns, 6.9 ns. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the length contraction part. Given \\( v = 0.8c \\), the gamma factor is indeed \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.64}} = \\frac{1}{0.6} \\approx 1.6667 \\), so \\( L = \\frac{1}{1.6667} \\approx 0.6 \\) meters. That seems correct.\n\nNow, time calculation: \\( t = \\frac{L}{v} = \\frac{0.6 \\text{ m}}{0.8c} = \\frac{0.6}{0.8 \\times 3 \\times 10^8} \\). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, \\( 0.8 \\times 3 \\times 10^8 = 2.4 \\times 10^8 \\) m/s.\n\nThen, \\( t = \\frac{0.6}{2.4 \\times 10^8} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-8} \\) s = 0.25 ns.\n\nBut 0.25 ns isn't among the options. Maybe I need to consider something else. Perhaps the time should include the time it takes for the entire stick to pass by, considering relativistic effects on time as well.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the time dilation effect. In special relativity, time intervals are measured to be longer in a moving frame of reference, from the perspective of a stationary observer. The formula for time dilation is:\n\n\\[ t = \\gamma t_0 \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time observed by the stationary observer.\n\n- \\( t_0 \\) is the proper time (time in the moving frame).\n\nBut in this case, I'm not sure if time dilation directly applies here. I think the initial approach of using length contraction is sufficient, but maybe I need to reconsider the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic velocity and the relative velocity between the stick and the observer.\n\nLet me think differently. The stick is moving at 0.8c, and its length is contracted to 0.6 meters in the observer's frame. So, the time it takes for the stick to pass the observer should be the time it takes for the stick to travel a distance equal to its own length at that speed.\n\nSo, \\( t = \\frac{L}{v} = \\frac{0.6 \\text{ m}}{0.8c} \\). But earlier, I calculated this as 0.25 ns, which doesn't match any options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the relative velocity correctly. In special relativity, velocities are added differently than in classical mechanics. The relativistic velocity addition formula is:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{v + u'}{1 + \\frac{v u'}{c^2}} \\]\n\nBut in this case, I'm not sure if I need to apply that formula. The stick is moving at 0.8c relative to the observer, so its velocity is simply 0.8c in the observer's frame.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the time it takes for the leading edge and the trailing edge of the stick to pass the observer.\n\nLet's consider that the stick is of length \\( L = 0.6 \\) meters in the observer's frame, moving at 0.8c. The time it takes for the stick to pass the observer would be the time it takes for the stick to travel a distance equal to its own length at that speed.\n\nSo, \\( t = \\frac{L}{v} = \\frac{0.6 \\text{ m}}{0.8 \\times 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}} = \\frac{0.6}{2.4 \\times 10^8} = 0.0025 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s} = 2.5 \\text{ ns} \\).\n\nWait a second, that's 2.5 nanoseconds, which is option B. Earlier, I thought it was 0.25 ns, but that was a miscalculation. Correcting that, \\( \\frac{0.6}{2.4 \\times 10^8} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9} \\) seconds, which is indeed 2.5 nanoseconds.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 2.5 nanoseconds, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.5 \\text{ ns}} \\]"
