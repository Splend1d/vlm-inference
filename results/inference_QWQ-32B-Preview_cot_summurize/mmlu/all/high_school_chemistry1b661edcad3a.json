                    "text": "To determine which of the given molecules is a strong electrolyte when dissolved in water, we need to understand the concept of electrolytes. Electrolytes are substances that, when dissolved in water or melted, conduct electricity due to the presence of ions. Strong electrolytes completely dissociate into their constituent ions in solution, while weak electrolytes only partially dissociate.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. CH3COOH: This is acetic acid. It is a weak acid and only partially dissociates in water, making it a weak electrolyte.\n\nB. HC2H3O2: This is also acetic acid, with a different notation. It is the same as option A and is a weak electrolyte.\n\nC. PCl5: This is phosphorus pentachloride. When dissolved in water, it reacts to form H3PO4 and HCl. HCl is a strong acid and completely dissociates into H+ and Cl- ions, making PCl5 a strong electrolyte in water.\n\nD. HBr: Hydrobromic acid is a strong acid and completely dissociates into H+ and Br- ions in water, making it a strong electrolyte.\n\nBoth options C and D appear to be strong electrolytes. However, the question asks for \"which of the following molecules is a strong electrolyte when dissolved in water,\" implying a single answer. Let's consider the nature of PCl5 and HBr in water more closely.\n\nPCl5 reacts with water to form H3PO4 and HCl:\n\nPCl5 + 4 H2O \u2192 H3PO4 + 5 HCl\n\nHCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely:\n\nHCl \u2192 H+ + Cl-\n\nSimilarly, HBr is a strong acid and dissociates completely:\n\nHBr \u2192 H+ + Br-\n\nBoth HCl and HBr are strong electrolytes. However, PCl5 is an acid anhydride and reacts with water to produce these strong acids. The key point is that in solution, PCl5 ultimately produces ions through its reaction with water, making it a strong electrolyte.\n\nGiven that both C and D seem to be strong electrolytes, but the question likely expects a single answer, we should consider the nature of the substances. PCl5 is not an acid itself but reacts with water to produce acids, while HBr is directly a strong acid.\n\nConsidering standard definitions, HBr is directly a strong electrolyte as it fully dissociates in water, whereas PCl5 is an acid anhydride that reacts with water to produce strong acids, which then dissociate.\n\nGiven this, HBr (option D) is more directly a strong electrolyte when dissolved in water.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. HBr.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
