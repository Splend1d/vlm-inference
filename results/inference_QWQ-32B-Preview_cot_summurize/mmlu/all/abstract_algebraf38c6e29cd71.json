                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is asking. We have a group (G, .), which means G is a set with a binary operation \".\" that satisfies the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverse elements.\n\nThe problem states that for all a, b in G, (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1. We need to determine what kind of group G is based on this property.\n\nFirst, recall that in any group, the inverse of a product is the product of the inverses in reverse order. That is, for any a, b in G, (ab)^-1 = b^-1 a^-1. This is a standard property of groups.\n\nBut here, the problem says (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1 for all a, b in G. So, comparing this to the standard property, we have:\n\na^-1 b^-1 = b^-1 a^-1\n\nThis implies that a^-1 b^-1 = b^-1 a^-1 for all a, b in G.\n\nNow, in group theory, the inverse of an element is unique. So, if a^-1 b^-1 = b^-1 a^-1, can we deduce something about the commutativity of G?\n\nLet's manipulate this equation to see if G is abelian, meaning that ab = ba for all a, b in G.\n\nStarting from a^-1 b^-1 = b^-1 a^-1, let's multiply both sides on the left by a and on the right by b.\n\nSo, a (a^-1 b^-1) b = a (b^-1 a^-1) b\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n(a a^-1) (b^-1 b) = (a b^-1) (a^-1 b)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ne * e = (a b^-1) (a^-1 b)\n\nWhere e is the identity element.\n\nSo, e = (a b^-1) (a^-1 b)\n\nNow, let's compute (a b^-1) (a^-1 b):\n\n= a b^-1 a^-1 b\n\nNow, group the terms differently:\n\n= a (b^-1 a^-1) b\n\nBut from the associative property, we can also write:\n\n= a (b^-1 a^-1) b = (a b^-1) (a^-1 b)\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet's consider the original equation again: a^-1 b^-1 = b^-1 a^-1\n\nNow, take inverses on both sides. Since the inverse of a product is the product of the inverses in reverse order, we get:\n\n(a^-1 b^-1)^-1 = (b^-1 a^-1)^-1\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nb a = a b\n\nBecause (a^-1)^-1 = a and similarly for b.\n\nSo, b a = a b for all a, b in G.\n\nThis means that G is abelian.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this.\n\nIf (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1, and we know that (ab)^-1 = b^-1 a^-1, then setting these equal gives:\n\na^-1 b^-1 = b^-1 a^-1\n\nNow, multiplying both sides on the left by a and on the right by b:\n\na (a^-1 b^-1) b = a (b^-1 a^-1) b\n\nSimplify:\n\n(e) (b^-1 b) = (a b^-1) (a^-1 b)\n\nWhich is:\n\ne = (a b^-1) (a^-1 b)\n\nAs before.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to consider that a^-1 b^-1 = b^-1 a^-1 implies that a and b commute.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in an abelian group, the order of multiplication doesn't matter, so a b = b a, and thus a^-1 b^-1 = b^-1 a^-1.\n\nBut in a non-abelian group, the order matters, so a^-1 b^-1 \u2260 b^-1 a^-1 in general.\n\nTherefore, the condition (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1 forces G to be abelian.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. abelian group.\n\nBut let's see what the options are:\n\nA. commutative semi group\n\nB. abelian group\n\nC. non-abelian group\n\nD. None of these\n\nA commutative semi-group is a set with an associative binary operation and commutativity, but it doesn't necessarily have an identity element or inverses, which are required for a group.\n\nSince G is already given to be a group, options A and C might not be directly applicable.\n\nOption D is \"None of these,\" but we've deduced that G must be abelian.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there are any groups where (ab)^-1 = a^-1 b^-1 holds without being abelian.\n\nFrom our earlier reasoning, it seems that this condition forces commutativity.\n\nTherefore, G must be an abelian group.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. abelian group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
