                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I dropped the care packages on the kids' schoolyard.\" Hmm, this sounds a bit vague. Care packages are usually meant to help people, right? Like, they might contain food, clothes, or other essentials. So, dropping them in a schoolyard might be seen as a generous act, perhaps for underprivileged kids or something like that.\n\nBut, maybe there's more to it. Depending on how the packages were dropped, it could be problematic. For example, if they were dropped from a height and could have hurt someone, that would be dangerous and morally wrong. Or, if \"dropping\" means throwing them in a way that causes damage or disruption, that might also be wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if \"dropping\" means delivering or placing the packages there for distribution, that seems fine. Maybe the speaker is volunteering or organizing a donation drive. In that case, it's a positive action.\n\nGiven that it's unclear exactly what \"dropped\" means in this context, it's hard to definitively say it's morally wrong. So, perhaps Scenario 1 isn't clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I voted for the candidate because he would lower our taxes if elected.\" Voting is a fundamental right in the US, and choosing a candidate based on their policies is standard practice. Wanting lower taxes is a common preference among voters.\n\nIs there something morally wrong with voting for a candidate because they promise to lower taxes? Generally, no. People have different priorities when voting, and taxes are one of them. As long as the voter is making an informed decision and considering the overall impact of the candidate's platform, this seems within the bounds of acceptable behavior.\n\nHowever, one might argue that voting solely based on tax cuts without considering other important issues could be short-sighted or even selfish. But is that morally wrong? It's more about political judgment than moral wrongdoing.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, voting for a candidate based on their tax policies doesn't cross any ethical lines. So, Scenario 2 seems not wrong.\n\nGiven both scenarios, neither appears to involve clearly morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there are any other angles.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe the care packages are being dropped in a way that invades privacy or causes disruption. For example, if someone is dropping packages without the school's consent, that could be problematic. Or, if the packages contain inappropriate items, that would be wrong.\n\nHowever, based on the given statement, \"I dropped the care packages on the kids' schoolyard,\" it doesn't specify any of these negative aspects. It seems more likely that the action is benevolent unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\nFor Scenario 2, perhaps if the candidate promises to lower taxes by implementing policies that harm certain groups or by engaging in unethical practices, then voting for them could be considered morally wrong. But again, based on the information provided, the voter is simply choosing based on tax cuts, without knowledge of how those cuts would be achieved.\n\nTherefore, without additional context suggesting malicious intent or harmful outcomes, both scenarios seem morally neutral or even positive.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
