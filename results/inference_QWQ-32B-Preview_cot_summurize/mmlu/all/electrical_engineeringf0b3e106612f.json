                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about solid angles, and I'm a bit rusty on the concept, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is: \"The solid angle subtended by an area of 2400 cm\u00b2 on the surface of a sphere of diameter 1.2 m is...\" and then there are a few options: A) 3/2, B) 1/3, C) 2/3, D) 2/5.\n\nFirst things first, I need to recall what a solid angle is. I remember that a solid angle is like a two-dimensional angle, but in three dimensions. It's the measure of the 'amount of space' that an object covers when viewed from a point. The unit for solid angles is the steradian (sr). So, the question is asking for the solid angle in steradians subtended by a certain area on the surface of a sphere.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the solid angle \u03a9 subtended by an area A = 2400 cm\u00b2 on a sphere with diameter D = 1.2 m.\n\nFirst, I should make sure all units are consistent. The area is given in cm\u00b2, and the diameter is in meters. Let's convert everything to meters to make it consistent. There are 100 cm in a meter, so:\n\n2400 cm\u00b2 = 2400 / (100)^2 m\u00b2 = 2400 / 10000 m\u00b2 = 0.24 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, A = 0.24 m\u00b2.\n\nDiameter D = 1.2 m, so the radius R is half of that:\n\nR = D / 2 = 1.2 m / 2 = 0.6 m.\n\nNow, I need to recall the formula that relates solid angle, area, and radius for a sphere. I think the formula is:\n\nA = \u03a9 * R\u00b2\n\nWhere A is the area on the sphere, \u03a9 is the solid angle, and R is the radius of the sphere.\n\nSo, rearranging for \u03a9:\n\n\u03a9 = A / R\u00b2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u03a9 = 0.24 m\u00b2 / (0.6 m)^2 = 0.24 / 0.36 = 2/3 sr.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Is that really it?\n\nLet me double-check. The formula A = \u03a9 * R\u00b2 makes sense because it's similar to the formula for the area of a sector in two dimensions, where the area is proportional to the angle subtended. In this case, for a sphere, it's the solid angle.\n\nSo, \u03a9 = A / R\u00b2 = 0.24 / 0.36 = 2/3 sr.\n\nLooking back at the options, C) 2/3 is one of them. So, is that the answer?\n\nHold on a minute. I should make sure that this formula applies specifically to a sphere and that there are no other factors I need to consider.\n\nI recall that for a sphere, the total surface area is 4 * \u03c0 * R\u00b2, and the total solid angle subtended by the sphere is 4\u03c0 sr. So, the formula A = \u03a9 * R\u00b2 seems consistent because if A = 4\u03c0R\u00b2, then \u03a9 = 4\u03c0 sr, which matches the total solid angle.\n\nTherefore, using \u03a9 = A / R\u00b2 should be correct for any area on the surface of the sphere, assuming that the area is small enough that the curvature doesn't cause significant distortion, or that the sphere is large enough that the area is approximately flat.\n\nIn this case, with a radius of 0.6 m and an area of 0.24 m\u00b2, it seems reasonable to use this formula.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the fraction of the total surface area that 0.24 m\u00b2 represents and relate that to the fraction of the total solid angle.\n\nTotal surface area of the sphere: 4\u03c0R\u00b2 = 4\u03c0(0.6)^2 = 4\u03c0*0.36 = 1.44\u03c0 m\u00b2.\n\nFraction of the total surface area: A / (4\u03c0R\u00b2) = 0.24 / (1.44\u03c0) = 0.24 / (1.44 * 3.1416) \u2248 0.24 / 4.5239 \u2248 0.0529.\n\nSince the total solid angle is 4\u03c0 sr, the solid angle subtended by the area A would be:\n\n\u03a9 = (A / (4\u03c0R\u00b2)) * 4\u03c0 = A / R\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's the same formula I used earlier. So, again, \u03a9 = A / R\u00b2 = 0.24 / 0.36 = 2/3 sr.\n\nIt seems consistent. Maybe the answer is indeed 2/3.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to find the subtended angle \u03b8 (in radians) corresponding to the area A, and then relate that to the solid angle.\n\nFor a sphere, the area A corresponding to a cone with apex angle \u03b8 is:\n\nA = 2\u03c0R\u00b2(1 - cos(\u03b8/2))\n\nBut solving for \u03b8 from this equation might be complicated, and I'm not sure if it would lead me to the solid angle easily.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the solid angle \u03a9 subtended by a cone with apex angle \u03b8 is:\n\n\u03a9 = 2\u03c0(1 - cos(\u03b8/2))\n\nBut again, without knowing \u03b8, this might not help directly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the simplest and most direct approach is indeed \u03a9 = A / R\u00b2.\n\nMoreover, considering the options provided, 2/3 is one of them, and the calculation is straightforward.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C) 2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{3}} \\]"
