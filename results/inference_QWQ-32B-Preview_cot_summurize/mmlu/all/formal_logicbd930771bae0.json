If it's invalid, I have to pick a counterexample from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the argument. It has two premises:\n\n- The first premise is ~G \u2283 H, which means \"if not G, then H.\"\n\n- The second premise is ~H, which means \"not H.\"\n\nFrom these, the conclusion is G, which means \"G is true.\"\n\nTo determine if this argument is valid, I need to check if whenever both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. In other words, in all rows where both premises are true, does the conclusion hold true as well?\n\nI'll start by constructing a truth table for the given statements. I need to include columns for G, H, ~G, ~G \u2283 H, ~H, and finally the conclusion G.\n\nLet's list all possible truth values for G and H. Since there are two variables, there will be four rows in the truth table.\n\n| G | H | ~G | ~G \u2283 H | ~H | Conclusion (G) |\n\n|---|---|----|--------|----|----------------|\n\n| T | T | F  | T      | F  | T              |\n\n| T | F | F  | T      | T  | T              |\n\n| F | T | T  | H      | F  | F              |\n\n| F | F | T  | F      | T  | F              |\n\nWait, I need to fill in the truth values correctly.\n\nFirst, for ~G:\n\n- If G is true, ~G is false.\n\n- If G is false, ~G is true.\n\nNext, for ~G \u2283 H:\n\n- A conditional is false only when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.\n\n- So, ~G \u2283 H is false only when ~G is true and H is false.\n\nOtherwise, it's true.\n\nThen, ~H:\n\n- If H is true, ~H is false.\n\n- If H is false, ~H is true.\n\nFinally, the conclusion is G, which is just the value of G in each row.\n\nLet me fill in the table step by step.\n\nRow 1:\n\n- G: T\n\n- H: T\n\n- ~G: F\n\n- ~G \u2283 H: T (because ~G is F, and F \u2283 anything is T)\n\n- ~H: F\n\n- Conclusion (G): T\n\nRow 2:\n\n- G: T\n\n- H: F\n\n- ~G: F\n\n- ~G \u2283 H: T (again, ~G is F, so the conditional is T)\n\n- ~H: T\n\n- Conclusion (G): T\n\nRow 3:\n\n- G: F\n\n- H: T\n\n- ~G: T\n\n- ~G \u2283 H: T (since ~G is T and H is T, T \u2283 T is T)\n\n- ~H: F\n\n- Conclusion (G): F\n\nRow 4:\n\n- G: F\n\n- H: F\n\n- ~G: T\n\n- ~G \u2283 H: F (since ~G is T and H is F, T \u2283 F is F)\n\n- ~H: T\n\n- Conclusion (G): F\n\nNow, to check the argument's validity, I need to look for rows where both premises are true and see if the conclusion is also true in those rows.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n1. ~G \u2283 H\n\n2. ~H\n\nSo, I need to find rows where both ~G \u2283 H is true and ~H is true, and then see if G is true in those rows.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1:\n\n- ~G \u2283 H: T\n\n- ~H: F\n\n- G: T\n\nSince ~H is F, this row doesn't satisfy both premises.\n\nRow 2:\n\n- ~G \u2283 H: T\n\n- ~H: T\n\n- G: T\n\nBoth premises are true, and the conclusion G is T.\n\nRow 3:\n\n- ~G \u2283 H: T\n\n- ~H: F\n\n- G: F\n\n~H is F, so both premises aren't true.\n\nRow 4:\n\n- ~G \u2283 H: F\n\n- ~H: T\n\n- G: F\n\n~G \u2283 H is F, so both premises aren't true.\n\nSo, only in Row 2 are both premises true, and in that row, the conclusion G is also true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid because whenever both premises are true, the conclusion is also true.\n\nBut wait, let's check again. Is there any row where both premises are true, but the conclusion is false? In other words, is there a counterexample?\n\nFrom the truth table, it seems that in the only row where both premises are true (Row 2), the conclusion is also true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid.\n\nBut the question asks to choose an option, and one of the options is \"Valid,\" which is option A.\n\nHowever, it also provides options for invalid with counterexamples.\n\nSince I've concluded the argument is valid, I should choose option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possible counterexample.\n\nA counterexample would be a row where both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.\n\nFrom the truth table, there is no such row.\n\nTherefore, the argument is indeed valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]\n\n"
