                    "text": "Let's see. I have this excerpt from a history book about housing in Britain after World War I. It seems like there was a plan called Addison's Act, named after someone named Addison, and it was about providing housing for working-class people. The idea was that if their needs weren't met, there could be a revolution like the one in Russia. But by 1920, that fear was lessening, and the government started to think that maybe they didn't need to spend so much on housing anymore.\n\nSo, there was this plan for something called the Kingfield Street scheme, and the council had approved it in September 1920. But then, surprisingly, the Government's Housing Board put it on hold. They said it was because of the council's existing commitments and the money available at that time. Then, in May 1921, the government cut back on the housing program, reducing the housing target by half.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the best description of what's happening with these plans being changed. There are four options:\n\nA. Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.\n\nB. Housing was a large part of the British budget.\n\nC. Workers were threatening communist revolution.\n\nD. The government Housing Board wanted to build more houses.\n\nHmm, let's look at each one.\n\nOption A says that welfare programs were questioned after the First World War. Well, Addison's Act seems to be about providing housing, which is a type of welfare program. The excerpt mentions that the act was conceived because of fears of revolution if working-class aspirations weren't met. So, there was an initial push for these welfare programs, but by 1920, that fear was receding, and the government was cutting back on the housing program. So, it does seem like there was some questioning or reevaluation of these welfare programs after the war. This could be a possible answer.\n\nOption B says that housing was a large part of the British budget. The excerpt does mention that the government was cutting back on the housing program, which suggests that it was a significant expenditure. However, it doesn't directly state that housing was a large part of the budget. It just mentions that the government was curtailing the housing programme due to money constraints. So, while this might be true, it's not directly supported by the text.\n\nOption C says that workers were threatening communist revolution. The excerpt does mention that Addison's Act was conceived because of fears of a revolution similar to Russia's, but by 1920, that fear was beginning to recede. So, while there was initial concern about workers potentially revolting, by the time of the events described, that fear was lessening. Therefore, this might not be the best description of the plans being changed.\n\nOption D says that the government Housing Board wanted to build more houses. But according to the excerpt, the Housing Board was deferring the Kingfield Street scheme and the government was cutting back on the housing programme. So, this seems contrary to what's described in the text.\n\nComparing all the options, option A seems to be the best fit. The plans are being changed because there's a reevaluation of the need for these welfare housing programs after the initial fears of revolution subsided. The government is cutting back, suggesting that there's some questioning or reduction in the welfare housing programs.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
