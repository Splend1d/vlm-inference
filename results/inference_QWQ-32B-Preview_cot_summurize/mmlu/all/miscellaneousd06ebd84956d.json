                    "text": "Let's see which of these items can help remove ink stains. I have four options: baking soda, nail polish, hair spray, and butter. Hmm, I need to think about how each of these might interact with ink.\n\nFirst, baking soda. I know that baking soda is a mild abrasive and it's often used in cleaning. It can help scrub away stains by breaking down the particles. Maybe it could work on ink stains by scrubbing them off the surface. I've heard of people using baking soda for cleaning purposes, so this seems plausible.\n\nNext, nail polish. I'm not sure how nail polish would help remove ink stains. Nail polish is something you paint on your nails for decoration, right? It's not typically associated with stain removal. In fact, nail polish is oily and might make the stain worse by spreading it. So, this one seems unlikely.\n\nThen, hair spray. Hair spray is used to hold your hair in place. It's a type of aerosol that contains alcohol and other chemicals. Alcohol can sometimes help dissolve ink, especially if it's a pen ink that contains water or other solvents. So, maybe hair spray could help dissolve the ink stain and make it easier to wash away. That sounds possible.\n\nLastly, butter. Butter is a fatty substance used in cooking. It's oily and might help dissolve oily stains, but ink isn't necessarily oily. In fact, I've heard that applying butter to a fabric stain can set the stain, making it harder to remove. So, I don't think butter would be helpful for removing ink stains.\n\nComparing all these options, baking soda seems like a good choice because it's abrasive and can help scrub away the stain. Hair spray might also work if it contains alcohol that can dissolve the ink. However, nail polish and butter don't seem helpful and might even make the stain worse.\n\nI think the best options are baking soda and hair spray. But if I had to choose one, maybe baking soda because it's more commonly used for cleaning purposes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up what actual stain removal experts recommend for ink stains. That would give me a better idea.\n\nOkay, I did a quick search, and according to some cleaning guides, for ink stains on fabric, it's best to act quickly and try to blot the ink away with a cloth dipped in milk or rubbing alcohol. Some sources also suggest using hydrogen peroxide or bleach, but those might not be among the options here.\n\nIn this case, none of the options are milk, rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or bleach. So, perhaps the closest option to rubbing alcohol would be hair spray, assuming it contains alcohol.\n\nOn the other hand, baking soda is a physical scrubbing agent, which might help remove the stain by friction.\n\nNail polish is probably not going to help, and butter could make the stain worse by setting it.\n\nSo, between baking soda and hair spray, I'm leaning towards hair spray because the alcohol content might help dissolve the ink.\n\nBut, another thought: maybe the ink is oil-based, in which case, a solvent like oil or grease might help emulsify it. But butter is oily, and nail polish is also oily, so perhaps for oil-based inks, those might work.\n\nHowever, most inks are water-based or alcohol-based, especially ink from pens. So, for those types of inks, something like hair spray with alcohol might be more effective.\n\nBaking soda could still work by physically removing the stain through scrubbing, but it might not dissolve the ink as effectively as a solvent.\n\nGiven that, I think hair spray is the most useful item among the options for removing ink stains, assuming it contains alcohol that can dissolve the ink.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
