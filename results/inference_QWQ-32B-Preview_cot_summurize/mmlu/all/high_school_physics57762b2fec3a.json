                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a spinning sphere that needs to be brought to rest using friction. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the sphere is spinning freely with an angular speed of 20 radians per second, and it has a moment of inertia of 0.06 kilogram-meter squared. Then, there's a friction force being applied to the outer surface of the sphere, which is 2.0 newtons, at a distance of 0.30 meters from the center.\n\nI need to find out how much time it will take for the sphere to come to rest due to this friction force.\n\nOkay, so to approach this, I think I need to consider the concept of rotational motion and how torque affects the rotation of the sphere.\n\nFirst, recall that torque (\u03c4) is equal to the force (F) multiplied by the radius (r) at which the force is applied, assuming the force is perpendicular to the radius. So, \u03c4 = F * r.\n\nGiven that the force is 2.0 N and the radius is 0.30 m, the torque would be:\n\n\u03c4 = 2.0 N * 0.30 m = 0.6 Nm.\n\nNow, torque is also related to the moment of inertia (I) and the angular acceleration (\u03b1) by the equation:\n\n\u03c4 = I * \u03b1.\n\nSo, if I know \u03c4 and I, I can find \u03b1:\n\n\u03b1 = \u03c4 / I = 0.6 Nm / 0.06 kg m\u00b2 = 10 rad/s\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity, so \u03b1 = d\u03c9/dt.\n\nIf the sphere is slowing down, the angular acceleration should be negative, meaning \u03b1 = -10 rad/s\u00b2.\n\nOkay, so \u03b1 = -10 rad/s\u00b2.\n\nNow, I know the initial angular velocity (\u03c9\u2080) is 20 rad/s, and I want to find the time (t) it takes for the sphere to come to rest, meaning final angular velocity (\u03c9) is 0 rad/s.\n\nThe equation relating angular velocity, angular acceleration, and time is:\n\n\u03c9 = \u03c9\u2080 + \u03b1 t.\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n0 = 20 + (-10) t.\n\nSolving for t:\n\n0 = 20 - 10t\n\n10t = 20\n\nt = 2 seconds.\n\nSo, according to this, it should take 2 seconds for the sphere to come to rest.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I've missed anything.\n\nIs there any other factor affecting the rotation, like maybe the sphere's mass or something? Wait, the moment of inertia is already given, so I don't need to worry about the mass directly.\n\nAlso, is the friction force constant, and is the torque constant? Yes, since the force is constant and applied at a constant radius.\n\nTherefore, the angular acceleration is constant, and the equation \u03c9 = \u03c9\u2080 + \u03b1 t should hold.\n\nSo, t = 2 seconds seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 4 s\n\nB. 2 s\n\nC. 0.06 s\n\nD. 0.03 s\n\nOption B matches my calculation.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nMaybe using energy considerations. The work done by the friction force should equal the change in rotational kinetic energy.\n\nThe initial rotational kinetic energy is (1/2) I \u03c9\u00b2.\n\nSo, K\u1d62 = (1/2) * 0.06 kg m\u00b2 * (20 rad/s)\u00b2 = (1/2)*0.06*400 = 12 Joules.\n\nThe final kinetic energy is zero since it comes to rest.\n\nThe work done by friction is the torque times the angular displacement (\u03b8), so W = \u03c4 \u03b8.\n\nBut I don't know \u03b8, so this might not be the easiest way.\n\nAlternatively, power is torque times angular velocity, but that might not help directly here.\n\nI think the first approach using angular acceleration is the most straightforward.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with t = 2 seconds, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
