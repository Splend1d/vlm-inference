                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a videographer and a man who hired him to film his daughter's wedding. They have a written contract that says the videographer will be paid $10,000 for filming and editing a 60-minute video of the wedding and reception. The man specified that the video should be filmed using high definition equipment, but the contract doesn't mention any extra payment for using that equipment.\n\nAfter completing the job, the videographer presents an invoice for $15,000, with the additional $5,000 being for the use of the high definition equipment. The man only pays the $10,000 agreed upon in the contract, and now the videographer is suing for the extra $5,000.\n\nWe need to figure out which argument would most persuasively support the videographer's claim that the man agreed to pay an extra $5,000 for using high definition equipment, in addition to the $10,000 fee.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\n**Option A:** According to the customary trade practice of the video industry, a $10,000 fee for filming and editing means $10,000 in addition to a supplemental charge if high definition equipment is used.\n\nThis seems like it could be relevant. If it's standard in the industry to charge extra for high definition equipment, then maybe the man should have understood that the $10,000 was just for the basic services, and extra for high definition. But, on the other hand, the contract specifically says \"$10,000 for the filming and editing of a 60-minute video of the wedding and the reception,\" and it mentions that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment. So, perhaps the high definition is already included in the $10,000.\n\n**Option B:** An oral agreement to that effect, if provable, would only supplement, not contradict, the \"payment clause\" as written.\n\nThis is interesting. If there was an oral agreement separate from the written contract that the man would pay an extra $5,000 for using high definition equipment, and if that oral agreement can be proven, then maybe it can be added to the written contract without contradicting it. But the problem is that the contract might be considered fully integrated, meaning that it's intended to be the complete agreement between the parties, and any oral agreements made prior to the written contract might not be enforceable.\n\n**Option C:** Under the UCC, extrinsic evidence, if available, of additional terms agreed to by the parties is admissible unless such terms \"would certainly vary or contradict those contained in the document.\"\n\nThis seems relevant because it's about admitting evidence outside the written contract to interpret or add to its terms. The UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) allows for the admission of extrinsic evidence unless it would contradict the written terms. In this case, if there's evidence that the parties agreed to pay an extra $5,000 for high definition equipment, and that doesn't contradict the written contract, then it might be admissible.\n\nBut we have to consider whether the additional $5,000 charge would contradict the written payment clause. The contract says \"$10,000 for the filming and editing,\" and includes a stipulation that the video would be filmed using high definition equipment. So, if the extra $5,000 is for using high definition equipment, and the contract already says the video will be filmed with high definition equipment, does that mean the extra charge is for something that's already included in the $10,000?\n\n**Option D:** Assuming arguendo that the written \"payment clause\" was fully integrated and neither patently nor latently ambiguous, equitable considerations require admission of extrinsic evidence, if available, of the parties' intent, since the videographer would stand to lose $5,000 on the contract.\n\nThis option is about equity and fairness. It suggests that even if the contract is fully integrated and there are no ambiguities, the court might still consider extrinsic evidence to prevent unfairness. In this case, if the videographer would lose $5,000 because the man isn't paying for the high definition equipment, which might have been an expectation, perhaps the court should look into the parties' intentions beyond the written contract.\n\nHowever, courts generally respect the principle of freedom of contract and the intention of the parties as expressed in the written agreement. If the contract is fully integrated, meaning it's intended to be the final and complete agreement between the parties, then extrinsic evidence is typically not admissible to add to or vary the terms of the contract.\n\nConsidering all this, I think **Option C** is the most persuasive argument for the videographer. It allows for the admission of extrinsic evidence unless it would contradict the written terms. In this case, if the videographer can provide evidence that the parties agreed to an extra $5,000 for using high definition equipment, and that this doesn't contradict the written contract, then it might be admissible.\n\nBut, there's a catch. The contract already specifies that the video will be filmed using high definition equipment, and the payment is $10,000 for that service. So, one could argue that the high definition equipment is already included in the $10,000 fee, and therefore any additional charge would contradict that.\n\nHowever, perhaps the videographer can argue that the $10,000 is for the services of filming and editing, and the use of high definition equipment is an additional service that wasn't captured in the written contract, or that the man agreed to pay extra for it orally.\n\nIn summary, **Option C** seems to be the strongest argument because it allows for the consideration of oral agreements or additional terms as long as they don't contradict the written contract. The videographer would need to show that the extra $5,000 charge doesn't contradict the written payment clause, perhaps by arguing that the use of high definition equipment was an additional service beyond the basic filming and editing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
