He was able to prevent a fall by holding onto a counter. Wife saw something sticky on a wide part of the floor but became disoriented by seeing her husband slipping and gripping the counter. With other shoppers behind her, she stepped forward and fell on the wet floor, breaking her hip, and requiring extensive complicated surgeries. She sued the store for negligent maintenance. She proved through discovery that the retailer did not clean the mess soon enough and did not put up a warning sign. The store filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, alleging that the wife voluntarily assumed the risk as a matter of law. The trial court agreed, ruling there was no issue of material fact in dispute for the jury to decide. On appeal, is it likely that the appellate court will reverse and remand for a new trial?\n\nA. No, because wife proceeded to encounter a known danger voluntarily, thereby assuming the risk of injury as a matter of law and there were no material issues of fact for a jury to decide.\nB. No, because even taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party under Rule 56, it is nonetheless clear that she knew there was a danger and she accepted the risk.\nC. Yes, because there is evidence that raises a material issue of fact whether the wife was in an emergency where she did not have time to deliberate on whether to move forward.\nD. Yes, because the store was strictly liable to the wife, who was a customer invited on the premises to do business and the store had to protect her.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving an elderly couple shopping, and unfortunately, the wife ends up getting hurt. She sues the store for being negligent in maintaining the store, specifically because they didn't clean up a mess quickly enough and didn't put up a warning sign. The store is trying to get the case thrown out before it goes to trial by filing something called a motion for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. They're arguing that the wife voluntarily assumed the risk, so they shouldn't be liable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what summary judgment is. From my law classes, I remember that summary judgment is a way for one side to say, \"Look, there's no real dispute here about the important facts; it's clear cut, and as a matter of law, we should win.\" So, the store is saying that even if we look at all the facts in the best light for the wife, it still doesn't matter because she knew there was a danger and chose to proceed anyway.\n\nNow, the trial court agreed with the store and granted the summary judgment, but the wife is appealing that decision. The question is whether the appellate court is likely to reverse that decision and send the case back for a trial.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the wife proceeded to encounter a known danger voluntarily, thereby assuming the risk of injury as a matter of law, and there were no material issues of fact for a jury to decide.\n\nB. No, because even taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party under Rule 56, it is nonetheless clear that she knew there was a danger and she accepted the risk.\n\nC. Yes, because there is evidence that raises a material issue of fact whether the wife was in an emergency where she did not have time to deliberate on whether to move forward.\n\nD. Yes, because the store was strictly liable to the wife, who was a customer invited on the premises to do business and the store had to protect her.\n\nOkay, so options A and B are similar; they both say no, meaning the appellate court won't reverse, and they both rely on the idea that the wife knew about the danger and voluntarily took the risk.\n\nOptions C and D say yes, meaning the appellate court should reverse the summary judgment and let the case go to trial.\n\nLet me think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, assuming that the store was negligent\u2014meaning they knew or should have known about the wet floor and didn't clean it up or warn people\u2014then the wife might have a valid claim.\n\nBut the store is arguing that she assumed the risk. Assumption of risk is a defense where the defendant says, \"Yes, we were negligent, but the plaintiff knew about the danger and chose to take the risk anyway, so we shouldn't be liable.\"\n\nNow, in order for assumption of risk to apply, generally, the plaintiff has to have known about the risk and voluntarily chosen to take that risk.\n\nIn this case, the wife saw her husband slip and saw something sticky on the floor. So, she probably knew that the floor was wet or slippery.\n\nBut here's the thing: she was behind her husband, and other shoppers were behind her. When she saw her husband slip, she might have been panicked or concerned for him, and perhaps didn't have time to think carefully about whether to step forward or not.\n\nOption C mentions that there's evidence suggesting she was in an emergency situation where she didn't have time to deliberate about the risk. That could be important because assumption of risk often requires that the plaintiff had the opportunity to appreciate the risk and voluntarily choose to take it.\n\nSo, if she was in a rush or panicked, maybe she didn't have the chance to fully appreciate the risk, which could mean that assumption of risk doesn't apply.\n\nOption D talks about strict liability. Strict liability usually applies in cases where the defendant is engaged in inherently dangerous activities, but I don't think that applies here. The store isn't doing something inherently dangerous; they're just supposed to maintain a safe environment for their customers.\n\nSo, perhaps option D isn't the best choice.\n\nBetween options A and B, they both seem to be saying that the wife knew about the danger and voluntarily assumed the risk, so the store shouldn't be liable.\n\nBut, considering that she might not have had time to deliberate due to the emergency situation, maybe there is a material fact in dispute here\u2014that is, was she in a position to fully appreciate the risk and voluntarily assume it?\n\nIf there's a dispute about that, then summary judgment might not be appropriate, and the case should go to trial for a jury to decide.\n\nTherefore, option C seems more likely to be correct\u2014that there is evidence raising a material issue of fact about whether she was in an emergency situation without time to deliberate.\n\nOption A and B seem too definitive, assuming that she did know and did voluntarily assume the risk, but perhaps there's enough doubt there for the case to go to trial.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Yes, because there is evidence that raises a material issue of fact whether the wife was in an emergency where she did not have time to deliberate on whether to move forward.\n\nThis way, the appellate court would likely reverse the summary judgment and send the case back for a trial to decide that issue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
