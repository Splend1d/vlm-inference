                    "text": "So I have this problem here about functions and their properties. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nWe have two sets, A and B, and two functions between them: f from A to B, and g from B to A. The condition given is that for every a in A, g(f(a)) equals a. So, applying f and then g gets us back to where we started in A.\n\nNow, there are two statements:\n\n1. The function f must necessarily be injective.\n\n2. The function f must necessarily be surjective.\n\nAnd I need to determine which of these statements are true. The options are:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nOkay, let's tackle the first statement: \"The function f must necessarily be injective.\"\n\nInjective means that every element in A maps to a unique element in B, and no two different elements in A map to the same element in B. In other words, if f(a1) = f(a2), then a1 must equal a2.\n\nGiven that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, maybe I can use this to show that f is injective.\n\nSuppose f(a1) = f(a2) for some a1, a2 in A. Then, applying g to both sides, g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)). But according to the given condition, g(f(a)) = a for all a in A. So, g(f(a1)) = a1 and g(f(a2)) = a2. Therefore, a1 = a2.\n\nThis shows that f is injective because if f maps two elements to the same thing, those two elements must be the same.\n\nSo, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\nNow, Statement 2: \"The function f must necessarily be surjective.\"\n\nSurjective means that every element in B is mapped to by some element in A. In other words, for every b in B, there exists an a in A such that f(a) = b.\n\nGiven the condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, does this imply that f is surjective?\n\nWell, let's think about it. The condition only tells us about applying g after f and getting back to a in A. It doesn't say anything about applying f after g or about covering all elements in B.\n\nMaybe I can find a counterexample where f is not surjective but the condition g(f(a)) = a still holds.\n\nSuppose A has two elements, a1 and a2, and B has three elements, b1, b2, b3.\n\nDefine f: A -> B such that f(a1) = b1 and f(a2) = b2.\n\nThen, define g: B -> A such that g(b1) = a1 and g(b2) = a2. What about g(b3)? Since b3 is not in the image of f, we can define g(b3) to be either a1 or a2, say a1.\n\nNow, check the condition: g(f(a1)) = g(b1) = a1, and g(f(a2)) = g(b2) = a2. So, g(f(a)) = a for all a in A.\n\nHowever, f is not surjective because b3 is not mapped to by any element in A.\n\nSo, in this case, f is not surjective, but the condition holds. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"for all a in A, g(f(a)) = a\". In my example, that holds, and f is not surjective. So, Statement 2 is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. True, False.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nStatement 1: f must be injective. I think I've shown that it must be, using the given condition.\n\nStatement 2: f must be surjective. But my counterexample shows that it's not necessarily the case.\n\nSo, yes, C. True, False seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, is there any scenario where f is not injective but the condition holds?\n\nLet me try to think of such a scenario.\n\nSuppose A has two elements, a1 and a2, and B has one element, b1.\n\nDefine f(a1) = b1 and f(a2) = b1.\n\nThen, define g: B -> A as g(b1) = a1.\n\nNow, check g(f(a1)) = g(b1) = a1, but a1 might not equal a2. So, if a1 != a2, then g(f(a2)) = g(b1) = a1 != a2.\n\nThis contradicts the condition that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the condition does not hold if f is not injective.\n\nHence, f must be injective for the condition to hold.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is indeed true.\n\nAnd Statement 2 is false, as shown by the counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
