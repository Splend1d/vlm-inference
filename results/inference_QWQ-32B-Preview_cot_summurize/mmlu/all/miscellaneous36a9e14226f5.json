A female donkey is called a jenny or a jennet, and a male horse is called a stallion. When you breed them together, the offspring is indeed a hinny. So, I believe the correct answer is C. hinny.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's look at the other options. A burro is another name for a donkey, especially in the southwestern United States and Mexico. So, that's not the offspring; that's one of the parents. A dorse, I'm not sure about that. It doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's an alternative term for something else. And a honker, that sounds more like a type of duck or something, not related to horses or donkeys.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that C. hinny is the right answer here. It's always good to know these terms, especially if you're into animals or agriculture.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
