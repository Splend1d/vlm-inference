Correct knowledge.\n\nJainism places great emphasis on the three \"jewels\" or \"ratans\": samyak darshan (correct belief), samyak jnana (correct knowledge), and samyak charitra (correct conduct or practice). These three are considered essential for achieving liberation or moksha.\n\n- Samyak darshan refers to having the right belief or faith in the teachings of Jainism.\n\n- Samyak jnana is about acquiring the right knowledge and understanding of the Jain philosophical concepts.\n\n- Samyak charitra involves practicing the right conduct, which includes following the five major vows of ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-possessiveness).\n\nSo, while \"correct practice\" is important and is represented by samyak charitra, \"correct knowledge\" is specifically denoted by samyak jnana."
