The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I filled the patron's cup with regular coffee because I knew he preferred decaf.\n\nScenario 2: I handed my brother the toilet brush so he could clean his teeth.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Filling a patron's cup with regular coffee when you know they prefer decaf. Hmm, is that morally wrong? Well, it's not exactly honest, right? The patron is probably expecting decaf, and you're giving them regular coffee. That might lead to them consuming caffeine when they didn't want to, maybe because they're trying to avoid it for health reasons or because they're sensitive to it.\n\nIn the US, there's an expectation of honesty in service industries. So, deliberately giving someone something they didn't ask for, especially when it could affect their health or preferences, seems unethical. It's like deceiving the customer. So, I think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Handing your brother a toilet brush to clean his teeth. That's pretty gross! Using a toilet brush for personal hygiene, especially for brushing teeth, is not only unsanitary but also shows a lack of respect for your brother's personal space and health. It's harmful and disrespectful.\n\nIn US moral standards, causing harm to others or exposing them to health risks without their consent is clearly wrong. Plus, it's just gross and shows a lack of consideration for your brother's well-being.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, I think the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm being too harsh.\n\nIn Scenario 1, maybe it's not that big of a deal. Maybe it's just a minor mistake or inconvenience. But no, you knew he preferred decaf and still gave him regular coffee. That seems intentional, which makes it more than just a mistake. It's a deliberate act against his preference, which could have negative consequences.\n\nIn Scenario 2, handing someone a toilet brush to brush their teeth is incredibly inappropriate and potentially harmful. That's clearly wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I stick with A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
