I think I need to use the distributive property here, right? That's where you multiply the number outside the parentheses by each term inside the parentheses and then add those products together.\n\nSo, 5(6x + 3y) should be 5 times 6x plus 5 times 3y.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n5 times 6x is 30x.\n\n5 times 3y is 15y.\n\nSo, altogether, it should be 30x + 15y.\n\nLooking at the options, that matches option D.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I did that correctly.\n\nDistributive property: a(b + c) = ab + ac.\n\nHere, a is 5, b is 6x, and c is 3y.\n\nSo, 5*6x is 30x, and 5*3y is 15y.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's see why the other options are wrong.\n\nOption A: 11x + 3y.\n\nThat seems like someone might have added 5 and 6 to get 11x, and left 3y alone, but that doesn't make sense with the distributive property.\n\nOption B: 11x + 8y.\n\nThis might be someone adding 5 and 6 for x, and then adding 5 and 3 for y, but that's not how distribution works.\n\nOption C: 30x + 3y.\n\nThis is close because they correctly multiplied 5 by 6x to get 30x, but they left 3y alone, without multiplying it by 5.\n\nSo, that's a mistake in applying the distributive property.\n\nOption D: 30x + 15y.\n\nThis matches what I calculated.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
