                    "text": "I think the answer is B. Neandertals used caves in Europe where their remains were preserved. Neandertals lived in Europe and parts of Asia, and they often used caves as shelters. These caves provided a protected environment that helped preserve their remains over time. So, because their living spaces were caves, which are good for preserving bones, we have more information about them compared to other extinct human species.\n\nOption A says that Neandertals spread throughout the world and their remains are found on every continent. But that's not accurate. Neandertals mainly lived in Europe and parts of Asia, not on every continent. For example, they didn't live in Australia or the Americas.\n\nOption C suggests that Neandertal populations were larger and more violent, and they drove other premodern humans to extinction. While Neandertals did interact with other human species, including Homo sapiens, there's no evidence that they were more violent or that they caused the extinction of other species. In fact, Neandertals themselves went extinct around 40,000 years ago, possibly due to a combination of factors including competition with Homo sapiens and environmental changes.\n\nOption D says that Neandertals left crude but intelligible written records. But Neandertals didn't have a written language. They communicated through spoken language, and while they were capable of complex thought and had cultural practices, there's no evidence of written records from them.\n\nSo, based on what I know, option B seems to be the most accurate explanation for why we know more about Neandertals than other extinct species of premodern humans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
