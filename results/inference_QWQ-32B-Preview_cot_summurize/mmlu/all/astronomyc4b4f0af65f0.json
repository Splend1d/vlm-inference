They reveal that the age of the solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years.\n\nMeteorites are remnants from the early solar system, and their study provides valuable insights into its formation and evolution. One of the most significant revelations from meteorites is the age of the solar system, which is estimated to be around 4.6 billion years old. This age is determined by radiometric dating of meteoritic material, particularly from chondrules\u2014small, spherical inclusions found in some meteorites.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the early solar system was indeed composed mostly of hydrogen and helium gas, but meteorites themselves are rocky or metallic fragments and do not directly reveal this composition. Instead, they provide information about the solid materials that formed in the solar nebula.\n\nOption B is misleading because meteorites, comets, and planets all formed around the same time in the early solar system. While some meteorites may be older than certain comets or planets, it is not accurate to generalize that meteorites are much older.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the solar system once contained 10 planets. The traditional model includes eight planets, and the discovery of dwarf planets like Pluto has led to reclassifications but not to the addition of new major planets.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, as meteorites play a crucial role in determining the age of the solar system through radiometric dating techniques applied to their constituent materials."
