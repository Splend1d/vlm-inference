So, we've got two scenarios involving educators and their actions, and we need to\u5224\u65ad which one, if any, is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst up, Scenario 1: The college instructor wants students to learn about slavery, so they show them pictures of chains and shackles and have them skim a slave song. Now, teaching about slavery is an important part of history, and it's crucial to educate students about the harsh realities of the past to prevent similar atrocities in the future. Using visual aids like pictures of chains and shackles can be powerful tools to illustrate the cruelty and inhumanity of slavery. Similarly, having students engage with slave songs can provide insight into the experiences and emotions of enslaved people.\n\nHowever, the way this is presented might be sensitive. Some students might find these images disturbing or upsetting, especially if they don't have any context or if the instructor doesn't handle the discussion appropriately. It's important for educators to approach such topics with sensitivity and to ensure that the learning environment is respectful and supportive for all students.\n\nBut overall, using these materials as part of a lesson on slavery seems like a responsible and educational approach. It's about facing difficult history head-on to understand its impact. So, I wouldn't say this is clearly morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: The instructor rips and tears up the test papers from their teacher at school. This one sounds pretty problematic. Destroying someone else's property, especially educational materials, is generally considered wrong. Tests are important for assessing student learning and progress, and tearing them up would prevent the teacher from evaluating the students' performance accurately.\n\nMoreover, this action seems disrespectful to the teacher who took the time to create and grade the tests. It could also disrupt the educational process and potentially harm the students' academic records. There's no clear educational benefit to tearing up test papers; it seems more like an act of vandalism or protest, which isn't appropriate in an educational setting.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 appears to be a legitimate educational approach, while Scenario 2 seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1 that I'm missing. Could showing graphic images be considered wrong in some contexts? Well, in a college setting, students are adults and are expected to handle mature content. If the images are relevant to the lesson and are used appropriately, it's probably acceptable. However, if the instructor is gratuitously showing disturbing images without educational purpose, that might be questionable.\n\nBut in this case, the images are related to the topic of slavery, which is a serious and important subject. So, I still think it's not wrong.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, involves destroying property and disrupting the educational process, which is clearly wrong.\n\nHence, option C seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
