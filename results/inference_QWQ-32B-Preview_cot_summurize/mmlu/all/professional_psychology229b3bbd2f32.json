                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about a psychologist using a computerized test service for the MMPI-2. The options are a bit confusing, and I need to choose the best answer based on what I know about psychological testing and ethics.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the MMPI-2 is. I think it's a personality assessment tool, right? The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, second edition. It's widely used in clinical settings to assess personality traits and psychopathology.\n\nNow, the psychologist is using a computerized service to score and interpret the MMPI-2. I need to consider what ethical guidelines say about this practice and also think about the reliability and usefulness of computerized interpretations.\n\nOption A says that using computerized interpretations is prohibited by ethical guidelines. I don't recall anything that outright bans computerized interpretations. In fact, I think psychological associations encourage the use of evidence-based tools, and computerized scoring can be efficient and accurate. So, maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B claims that computerized scoring and interpretation services are notoriously unreliable. Well, that seems too broad. Computerized systems can be reliable if they are based on solid research and validated norms. The MMPI-2 has established norms and scoring algorithms, so a well-designed computerized system should be reliable. Maybe this isn't the best choice either.\n\nOption C says that computerized interpretations should always be supplemented with other information obtained by the psychologist. This sounds reasonable. While computerized scoring can be accurate, interpretation requires clinical judgment and consideration of the individual's context. Psychologists are trained to integrate test results with other data, such as clinical interviews, behavioral observations, and historical information. So, relying solely on computerized interpretations might not be sufficient.\n\nOption D suggests that because of their objectivity, computerized interpretations are preferable to subjective interpretations. Hmm, objectivity is important in psychological assessments, but complete objectivity is hard to achieve. Computerized interpretations can provide standardized results, but they might lack the nuance and depth that a human clinician can offer. Also, computers don't have the ability to consider the unique aspects of each individual's situation.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option C is the most appropriate. Computerized interpretations can be a useful tool, but they should be supplemented with other information gathered by the psychologist to ensure a comprehensive and accurate assessment.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any specific ethical guideline regarding the use of computerized interpretations for the MMPI-2? I recall that ethical guidelines emphasize the importance of competence and appropriate use of assessment tools. Psychologists are expected to understand the limitations of the tools they use and to interpret test results in the context of the individual being assessed.\n\nPerhaps option A is partially correct, but I don't think it's entirely accurate to say that computerized interpretations are prohibited. Maybe it's more about how they are used and interpreted.\n\nOption B seems too sweeping. If computerized services are developed based on sound psychometric principles, they can be reliable.\n\nOption D appeals to the idea of objectivity, but as I thought earlier, while objectivity is valuable, it's not the only aspect to consider in psychological assessments.\n\nSo, again, option C seems the most balanced and in line with best practices in psychological assessment.\n\nYes, I think I'll go with C. Computerized interpretations should always be supplemented with other information obtained by the psychologist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
