                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. So, we're given that the sample has a standard deviation of zero, and we need to determine which statement is true based on that information.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a standard deviation of zero means. The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the numbers in a data set are from the mean. If the standard deviation is zero, that means all the values in the sample are identical. They don't vary at all; they're all the same number.\n\nOkay, with that in mind, let's look at each option:\n\nA. The standard deviation of the population is also zero.\n\nWell, the sample has all identical values, but does that necessarily mean the entire population does too? Not necessarily. It's possible that the population has variation, but by chance, the sample we took happened to have all the same values. So, we can't conclude that the population standard deviation is zero based solely on the sample standard deviation being zero.\n\nB. The sample mean and sample median are equal.\n\nIn a sample where all values are identical, the mean and the median would indeed be the same. The mean is the average of the values, and the median is the middle value when ordered. If all values are the same, say all are equal to 'a', then both the mean and the median would be 'a'. So, this statement seems true.\n\nC. The sample may have outliers.\n\nOutliers are extreme values that differ significantly from other observations. In a sample where all values are identical, there can't be any outliers because there's no variation. All points are the same, so none stand out as being unusual or extreme. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nD. The population has a symmetric distribution.\n\nJust because the sample has a standard deviation of zero doesn't tell us anything about the shape of the population distribution. The population could be symmetric, skewed, or anything else. The sample doesn't provide enough information to make inferences about the population distribution's symmetry.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct statement is B: The sample mean and sample median are equal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
