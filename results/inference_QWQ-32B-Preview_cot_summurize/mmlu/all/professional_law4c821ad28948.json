                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this contract where a seller agrees to sell land to a buyer for $300,000. The closing is set for 60 days after the contract is signed, and the seller is supposed to give a \"marketable title\" using a quitclaim deed. The contract doesn't have any other details about the title.\n\nNow, a title search found that there's an unsatisfied $50,000 mortgage on the land and also a right-of-way easement over part of it. The buyer thinks the title is unmarketable and doesn't want to go through with the closing. The question is, is the buyer right?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because nothing under these facts renders the title unmarketable.\n\nB. No, because the buyer agreed to accept a quitclaim deed.\n\nC. Yes, because the right-of-way easement makes the title unmarketable.\n\nD. Yes, because the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"marketable title\" means. Generally, a marketable title is one that is free from significant defects that would deter a reasonable buyer from purchasing it. It should be insurable, and there shouldn't be any encumbrances that significantly impair the value or use of the property.\n\nIn this case, the seller is supposed to convey a marketable title, but the title has two issues: a $50,000 mortgage and a right-of-way easement.\n\nOption A says no, nothing makes the title unmarketable. But there are two encumbrances mentioned, so that seems unlikely.\n\nOption B says no, because the buyer agreed to accept a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the seller has without any warranties. However, the contract specifies that the seller will convey a marketable title, so even though it's a quitclaim deed, the title still needs to be marketable.\n\nOption C says yes, because of the right-of-way easement. An easement can affect the marketability of title, especially if it significantly impacts the use of the property. A right-of-way easement allows others to pass through part of the land, which could be a considerable burden.\n\nOption D says yes, because of the unsatisfied mortgage. An outstanding mortgage is definitely a defect in title because it's a lien on the property, and it needs to be paid off at closing, usually from the sale proceeds.\n\nSo, both the mortgage and the easement could potentially make the title unmarketable.\n\nBut the contract says the seller will convey a marketable title, so it's the seller's responsibility to ensure that the title is marketable at the time of closing.\n\nGiven that, the buyer has a point in refusing to close if the title isn't marketable.\n\nNow, between options C and D, both suggest that the title is unmarketable, but for different reasons.\n\nOption C points to the right-of-way easement, and option D to the unsatisfied mortgage.\n\nI think both could be reasons, but maybe one is more significant than the other.\n\nIn real estate transactions, outstanding mortgages are typically required to be satisfied at closing from the purchase price. So, if the seller hasn't arranged to pay off the $50,000 mortgage, that would indeed make the title unmarketable because the buyer wouldn't be getting clear title.\n\nSimilarly, the right-of-way easement could make the title unmarketable if it's a substantial burden on the property's use and value.\n\nHowever, in many cases, easements are acceptable, depending on their nature and impact. A right-of-way easement might be more acceptable than an outstanding mortgage, but it still depends on the\u5177\u4f53\u60c5\u51b5.\n\nBut in this scenario, since the contract requires a marketable title, and both issues could impair marketability, the buyer might have grounds to refuse closing.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D seems more directly problematic because an unsatisfied mortgage is a lien that needs to be resolved, whereas an easement might be considered a lesser encumbrance.\n\nBut, to be thorough, perhaps both could be issues.\n\nWait, but the question is, is the buyer correct in claiming the title is unmarketable and refusing to close?\n\nGiven that the title has both an outstanding mortgage and an easement, and the contract requires a marketable title, it seems the buyer is correct.\n\nNow, between options C and D, both say \"yes,\" but specify different reasons.\n\nOption D specifies the mortgage, which is likely the more critical issue because it's a financial lien that needs to be satisfied for the buyer to get clear title.\n\nOption C mentions the easement, which could also affect marketability, but perhaps not to the same degree as an outstanding mortgage.\n\nHowever, in legal terms, both could render the title unmarketable.\n\nBut perhaps the mortgage is more directly problematic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is that the title is unmarketable due to both issues.\n\nBut since the question seems to expect a single answer, maybe D is the better choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fact that it's a quitclaim deed affects the analysis.\n\nOption B says no, because the buyer agreed to accept a quitclaim deed.\n\nBut the contract says the seller will convey a marketable title by a quitclaim deed.\n\nSo, even though it's a quitclaim deed, the seller is still obligated to ensure that the title is marketable.\n\nQuitclaim deeds typically don't come with warranties of title, but in this case, the contract separately requires a marketable title.\n\nTherefore, the type of deed doesn't relieve the seller from the obligation to provide a marketable title.\n\nSo, option B doesn't seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the buyer is correct in claiming the title is unmarketable, and option D is probably the right answer, focusing on the unsatisfied mortgage.\n\nBut option C also has merit, as the easement could affect marketability.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, an easement doesn't necessarily make a title unmarketable unless it significantly impairs the property's use or value.\n\nOn the other hand, an outstanding mortgage is a lien that needs to be addressed for the title to be marketable.\n\nTherefore, option D seems more accurate.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Yes, because the unsatisfied mortgage makes the title unmarketable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
