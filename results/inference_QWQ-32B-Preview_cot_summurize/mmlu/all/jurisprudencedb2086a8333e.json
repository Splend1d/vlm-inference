                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Weber and the \"England problem.\" So, first things first, I need to understand what the \"England problem\" is in the context of Weber's work.\n\nI know that Max Weber was a German sociologist who wrote extensively about the development of capitalism and its relationship with various cultural and institutional factors. One of his famous works is \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,\" where he argues that the Protestant work ethic, particularly Calvinism, played a significant role in the development of capitalism in Europe.\n\nNow, the \"England problem\" refers to the fact that England was one of the leading capitalist nations, but its dominant religion was Anglicanism, which isn't strictly Calvinist. Weber's thesis seems to fit better with countries like Scotland and the Netherlands, which had strong Calvinist influences. So, how does Weber explain England's development of capitalism if his thesis emphasizes Calvinism?\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. By denying its existence.\n\nB. By explaining the difference between the common law and civil law.\n\nC. By distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism.\n\nD. By recognizing the importance of legitimate domination.\n\nOption A seems unlikely because denying the existence of England's capitalist development wouldn't make much sense, given its historical significance.\n\nOption B mentions the difference between common law and civil law. I know that England has a common law system, while many continental European countries have civil law systems. Perhaps Weber saw some advantages in the common law system that facilitated capitalism.\n\nOption C is similar to B but more specific to the English legal system. It suggests that there are particular features of England's legal system that helped develop capitalism.\n\nOption D talks about legitimate domination, which is a concept in Weber's sociology referring to authority that is recognized as legitimate by those\u53d7\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u8d44\u672c\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u79e9\u5e8f\u662f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002\n\nBut specifically regarding the \"England problem,\" I think Weber addresses it by highlighting certain aspects of England's legal and political system that allowed for the development of capitalism, even without a strong Calvinist influence.\n\nIn Weber's view, the English legal system, with its emphasis on property rights, contract enforcement, and the independence of the judiciary, provided a stable framework that was conducive to capitalist development. Additionally, the political stability and the gradual evolution of institutions in England might have played a role.\n\nSo, between options B and C, I think C is more precise because it specifies \"certain features of the English legal system.\" Option B is broader, talking about the difference between common law and civil law, which might not fully capture Weber's argument.\n\nOption D, about legitimate domination, is probably relevant to his overall theory of authority and its role in social structures, but it might not directly address the \"England problem\" in the way that options B and C do.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option C: By distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism.\n\nTo further support this, I recall that Weber did discuss the importance of the legal system in fostering capitalist development. He saw the rationalization of law, particularly in the areas of property and contract, as crucial for the growth of capitalist economies. In England, the development of common law, with its emphasis on precedent and the protection of individual rights, may have provided the necessary legal framework for capitalist enterprises to flourish.\n\nMoreover, England's political system, with the gradual emergence of parliamentary governance and the rule of law, contributed to a stable environment where economic activities could expand without excessive interference from arbitrary authority.\n\nIn contrast, in some continental European countries with civil law systems, the law was often more closely tied to the state's bureaucracy and less independent, which might have hindered the development of a truly capitalist economy.\n\nTherefore, by highlighting these features of the English legal and political system, Weber can explain how England developed capitalism even without the same level of Calvinist influence found in other Protestant countries.\n\nSo, in summary, the answer is C: By distinguishing certain features of the English legal system that facilitated the development of capitalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
