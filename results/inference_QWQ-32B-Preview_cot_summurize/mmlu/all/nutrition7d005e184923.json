Estimate the likelihood, or probability, of a toxic effect on exposed humans\n\nB. To support risk management decisions for food substances\n\nC. To derive Allowable Daily Intakes\n\nD. All of the above\n\nHmm, I need to think about what risk assessment actually does in this context.\n\nFirst off, risk assessment in toxicity and exposure is basically about understanding how harmful a substance is to humans and how likely it is to cause harm based on exposure levels. So, option A seems right because estimating the likelihood of a toxic effect is a key part of risk assessment.\n\nNow, option B mentions supporting risk management decisions for food substances. I know that risk assessment is used to inform decisions about regulating foods, setting safety standards, and deciding whether certain substances are safe to use in food. So, that sounds relevant too.\n\nOption C is about deriving Allowable Daily Intakes, which I believe is a specific limit set for how much of a substance a person can be exposed to daily over a lifetime without adverse effects. Risk assessment would be used to determine what that limit should be based on toxicity data and exposure estimates.\n\nSo, all three options seem to be correct applications of risk assessment in this field. Therefore, the answer should be D. All of the above.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where risk assessment wouldn't be used for these purposes? I can't think of one in the context of toxicity and human exposure data. Risk assessment is fundamentally about evaluating the potential for harm and managing that risk, which aligns perfectly with options A, B, and C.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
