                    "text": "Let's see. So, Ramanujan and Hardy are playing a game where they pick complex numbers, and the product of their numbers is given as \\(32 - 8i\\). Hardy picked \\(5 + 3i\\), and we need to find out what number Ramanujan picked. The options are:\n\nA. \\(32 - 8i\\)\n\nB. \\(5 + 3i\\)\n\nC. \\(4 - i\\)\n\nD. \\(4 - 4i\\)\n\nHmm, okay. So, if Hardy picked \\(5 + 3i\\) and the product of their numbers is \\(32 - 8i\\), then Ramanujan's number multiplied by \\(5 + 3i\\) should equal \\(32 - 8i\\). Let's denote Ramanujan's number as \\(z\\). So, we have:\n\n\\[ z \\times (5 + 3i) = 32 - 8i \\]\n\nTo find \\(z\\), I need to divide both sides by \\(5 + 3i\\):\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{32 - 8i}{5 + 3i} \\]\n\nAlright, so I need to perform this division of complex numbers. I remember that to divide complex numbers, you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \\(5 + 3i\\) is \\(5 - 3i\\). So, let's do that:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(32 - 8i)(5 - 3i)}{(5 + 3i)(5 - 3i)} \\]\n\nFirst, I'll compute the denominator:\n\n\\[ (5 + 3i)(5 - 3i) = 5^2 - (3i)^2 = 25 - 9i^2 \\]\n\nSince \\(i^2 = -1\\), this becomes:\n\n\\[ 25 - 9(-1) = 25 + 9 = 34 \\]\n\nNow, the numerator:\n\n\\[ (32 - 8i)(5 - 3i) \\]\n\nI'll use the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\n\\[ 32 \\times 5 = 160 \\]\n\n\\[ 32 \\times (-3i) = -96i \\]\n\n\\[ -8i \\times 5 = -40i \\]\n\n\\[ -8i \\times (-3i) = 24i^2 \\]\n\nAgain, since \\(i^2 = -1\\), this becomes:\n\n\\[ 24(-1) = -24 \\]\n\nSo, combining all these:\n\n\\[ 160 - 96i - 40i - 24 = (160 - 24) + (-96i - 40i) = 136 - 136i \\]\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{136 - 136i}{34} = \\frac{136}{34} - \\frac{136i}{34} = 4 - 4i \\]\n\nSo, Ramanujan picked \\(4 - 4i\\).\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the denominator:\n\n\\[ (5 + 3i)(5 - 3i) = 25 - 15i + 15i - 9i^2 = 25 - 9(-1) = 25 + 9 = 34 \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, the numerator:\n\n\\[ (32 - 8i)(5 - 3i) = 32 \\times 5 + 32 \\times (-3i) + (-8i) \\times 5 + (-8i) \\times (-3i) \\]\n\n\\[ = 160 - 96i - 40i + 24i^2 \\]\n\n\\[ = 160 - 136i + 24(-1) \\]\n\n\\[ = 160 - 136i - 24 \\]\n\n\\[ = 136 - 136i \\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, dividing by 34:\n\n\\[ \\frac{136 - 136i}{34} = 4 - 4i \\]\n\nSo, the answer should be \\(4 - 4i\\), which is option D.\n\nBut let's see if any of the other options could make sense. If Ramanujan picked \\(32 - 8i\\), and Hardy picked \\(5 + 3i\\), their product would be:\n\n\\[ (32 - 8i) \\times (5 + 3i) = 32 \\times 5 + 32 \\times 3i - 8i \\times 5 - 8i \\times 3i \\]\n\n\\[ = 160 + 96i - 40i - 24i^2 \\]\n\n\\[ = 160 + 56i + 24 \\]\n\n\\[ = 184 + 56i \\]\n\nThat's not equal to \\(32 - 8i\\), so option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B is \\(5 + 3i\\), which is Hardy's number. If Ramanujan also picked \\(5 + 3i\\), their product would be:\n\n\\[ (5 + 3i)^2 = 25 + 30i + 9i^2 = 25 + 30i - 9 = 16 + 30i \\]\n\nThat's not \\(32 - 8i\\), so option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C is \\(4 - i\\). Let's check the product:\n\n\\[ (4 - i) \\times (5 + 3i) = 4 \\times 5 + 4 \\times 3i - i \\times 5 - i \\times 3i \\]\n\n\\[ = 20 + 12i - 5i - 3i^2 \\]\n\n\\[ = 20 + 7i + 3 \\]\n\n\\[ = 23 + 7i \\]\n\nNot equal to \\(32 - 8i\\), so option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D is \\(4 - 4i\\), which is what I calculated earlier, and it gave the correct product of \\(32 - 8i\\). Therefore, the answer is D. \\(4 - 4i\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 - 4i} \\]"
