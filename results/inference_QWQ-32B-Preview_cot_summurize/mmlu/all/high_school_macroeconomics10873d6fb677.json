                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these options would likely lead to faster economic growth. Let's look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A is a more restrictive immigration policy. Immigration can affect the economy in various ways. On one hand, immigrants can bring in new skills and labor, which can boost production and innovation. On the other hand, some argue that they might take jobs from native workers or strain public resources. Overall, though, many studies suggest that immigration has a positive effect on economic growth because it increases the workforce and can lead to more diverse ideas and talents. So, a more restrictive policy might limit these benefits, possibly slowing down economic growth.\n\nOption B is negative net investment. Net investment is the amount of investment after accounting for depreciation. Negative net investment means that the capital stock is decreasing because more capital is wearing out or becoming obsolete than is being replaced or added. This would likely hinder economic growth because businesses have fewer resources to produce goods and services, which can lead to lower productivity and output.\n\nOption C is higher taxes on households and firms. Taxes can influence economic behavior. Higher taxes on households might reduce disposable income, leading to less consumption, which is a major component of GDP. Higher taxes on firms can increase their cost of production, potentially leading to lower investment and slower growth. However, it's worth noting that some level of taxation is necessary for public services and infrastructure, which can also support growth. But generally, higher taxes are thought to have a dampening effect on economic activity.\n\nOption D is higher government funding of research on clean energy supplies. Investing in research and development (R&D) can lead to new technologies and innovations, which are key drivers of long-term economic growth. Clean energy research, in particular, could lead to more efficient and sustainable energy sources, reducing costs and environmental impacts, which could stimulate various sectors of the economy. Therefore, increased funding in this area could accelerate economic growth.\n\nConsidering all these points, it seems that option D, higher government funding of research on clean energy supplies, would likely contribute to faster rates of economic growth. The other options either restrict growth (A and B) or have a negative impact on economic activity (C).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
