A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command respect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition to the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard of African Independence by the Great Powers.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader, 1961\nNkrumah's argument in the passage most clearly supports which of the following ideologies?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this quote from Kwame Nkrumah, who was the leader of Ghana, and he's talking about Africa needing to unite politically to make a bigger impact on the world stage. He says that by creating a political union, Africa can project its personality more effectively and gain respect from other powers that only care about size and influence. He also mentions specific examples where Africa's concerns were ignored, like the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the United Nations' handling of the situation in the Congo.\n\nNow, the question is asking which ideology Nkrumah's argument most clearly supports. The options are Pan-Africanism, Communism, African socialism, and Neocolonialism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these ideologies stands for:\n\n1. **Pan-Africanism**: This is the idea that all people of African descent have a common identity and should work together for their collective good. It often emphasizes unity among African nations and people of African heritage worldwide.\n\n2. **Communism**: This is a political and economic ideology that advocates for a classless society where the means of production are owned communally. It's more about economic equality and the abolition of private property.\n\n3. **African socialism**: This is a variant of socialism that was adopted by some African leaders after independence. It combines traditional African values with socialist economic principles, focusing on collective welfare and sometimes on African unity.\n\n4. **Neocolonialism**: This refers to the practice of powerful countries maintaining control over former colonies or less powerful countries through economic, political, or cultural means, even after formal independence.\n\nLooking back at Nkrumah's quote, he's\u5f3a\u8c03\u7684\u662f\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u53d1\u51fa\u975e\u6d32\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u5927\u56fd\u7684\u5c0a\u91cd\u3002\u4ed6\u8fd8\u6279\u8bc4\u4e86\u5927\u56fd\u5bf9\u975e\u6d32\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u6cd5\u56fd\u5728\u6492\u54c8\u62c9\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u6838\u8bd5\u9a8c\u548c\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u5728\u521a\u679c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002\n\n\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u4ed6\u6700\u5f3a\u8c03\u7684\u662f\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u56e2\u7ed3\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u821e\u53f0\u4e0a\u62e5\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8bdd\u8bed\u6743\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0ePan-Africanism\u7684\u7406\u5ff5\u975e\u5e38\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aPan-Africanism\u6b63\u662f\u5021\u5bfc\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u4eba\u6c11\u7684\u56e2\u7ed3\u4e0e\u5408\u4f5c\u3002\n\n\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0cCommunism\u66f4\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5236\u5ea6\u548c\u9636\u7ea7\u6597\u4e89\uff0c\u800cNkrumah\u7684\u8bb2\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u7279\u522b\u63d0\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u975e\u6d32\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u867d\u7136\u4e5f\u5f3a\u8c03\u96c6\u4f53\u798f\u5229\u548c\u975e\u6d32\u7279\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u8fd8\u662f\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u653f\u7b56\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u653f\u6cbb\u7edf\u4e00\u3002Neocolonialism\u5219\u662f\u6279\u8bc4\u5916\u90e8\u52bf\u529b\u5bf9\u975e\u6d32\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u867d\u7136Nkrumah\u63d0\u5230\u5927\u56fd\u5bf9\u975e\u6d32\u7684\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u53ea\u662f\u4ed6\u4e3b\u5f20\u975e\u6d32\u56e2\u7ed3\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4ed6\u652f\u6301Neocolonialism\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u7b26\u5408Nkrumah\u5728\u8fd9\u6bb5\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7acb\u573a\u7684\u5e94\u8be5\u662fPan-Africanism\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A}} \\]"
