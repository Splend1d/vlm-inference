                    "text": "I need to answer a question about a poem called \"The White Man's Burden\" by Rudyard Kipling from 1899. The poem seems to be about the attitude of the British Empire towards the native peoples they ruled or influenced. There are four options to choose from, and I need to pick the one that best describes this attitude based on the poem.\n\nFirst, I should read the poem carefully and understand its tone and message. The title itself, \"The White Man's Burden,\" suggests that there is a responsibility or duty imposed on white people, presumably to civilize or manage non-white peoples. This was a common justification for imperialism during that era.\n\nLooking at the first stanza:\n\n\"Take up the White Man's burden\u2014\n\nSend forth the best ye breed\u2014\n\nGo bind your sons to exile\n\nTo serve your captives' need;\n\nTo wait in heavy harness,\n\nOn fluttered folk and wild\u2014\n\nYour new-caught, sullen peoples,\n\nHalf-devil and half-child.\"\n\nHere, Kipling is encouraging the reader to accept the burden of empire, to send their best sons to govern and serve the needs of the captured peoples. He describes these peoples as \"fluttered folk and wild,\" \"new-caught, sullen peoples,\" and \"half-devil and half-child.\" This language suggests that the native peoples are immature, unruly, and perhaps even dangerous, but in need of guidance and civilization.\n\nMoving to the second stanza:\n\n\"Take up the White Man's burden\u2014\n\nThe savage wars of peace\u2014\n\nFill full the mouth of Famine\n\nAnd bid the sickness cease;\n\nAnd when your goal is nearest\n\nThe end for others sought\u2026\n\nWatch sloth and heathen Folly\n\nBring all your hopes to naught.\"\n\nIn this part, Kipling talks about the \"savage wars of peace,\" which seems like a paradox. It likely refers to the idea that maintaining peace in these colonies requires violent intervention and suppression of uprisings. He also mentions fighting famine and sickness, indicating that part of the white man's burden is to improve the living conditions of these peoples. However, he also warns that laziness and foolishness (\"sloth and heathen folly\") may undo all their efforts.\n\nNow, considering the options:\n\nA. They are \"exiled sons\" of the British race.\n\nThis doesn't seem to fit. The poem is talking about sending the best of the British breed to bind their sons to exile to serve the captives' needs. The \"exiled sons\" are the British sons sent to govern the colonies, not the native peoples.\n\nB. While \"savage,\" they fight wars for the sake of a lasting peace.\n\nThis option mentions that the natives are savage but fight wars for peace. However, in the poem, it's the white man who is taking up the burden and engaging in \"savage wars of peace.\" The natives are not described as fighting for peace; rather, the white man is fighting to impose peace on them.\n\nC. They are ready for conversion to Christianity.\n\nThe poem doesn't explicitly mention Christianity, although imperialism often had a Christian conversion component. The description of the natives as \"heathen\" suggests they are not Christian, but the poem doesn't say they are ready for conversion. Instead, it focuses on their need for civilizing and management.\n\nD. They are the product of a less-civilized and less-developed civilization.\n\nThis option seems to align well with the poem's description. The natives are portrayed as \"sullen,\" \"half-devil and half-child,\" needing guidance and improvement in their living conditions. This suggests that they come from less-civilized and less-developed civilizations, and it's the burden of the white man to uplift them.\n\nConsidering all this, option D seems to be the most accurate description of the attitude towards native peoples in the poem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
