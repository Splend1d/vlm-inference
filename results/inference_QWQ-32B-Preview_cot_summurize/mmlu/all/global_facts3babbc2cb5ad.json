                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about open defecation from 2020. The options are 2%, 4%, 9%, or 18%. I don't remember the exact statistic, but I know it's an important global health issue. Let me think about what I know.\n\nFirst, open defecation is when people don't use a toilet and instead defecate in the open, like in fields or bushes. This is a big problem because it can lead to the spread of diseases, especially in areas with poor sanitation.\n\nI recall that the United Nations and other organizations have been working hard to improve sanitation worldwide, and one of their Sustainable Development Goals is to ensure everyone has access to sanitation by 2030. So, by 2020, there should have been some progress, but I don't know exactly how much.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n\n- 2% seems really low. That would mean only 2 out of every 100 people practice open defecation. I doubt it's that low.\n\n- 4% is a bit higher, but still seems too low to me.\n\n- 9% sounds more plausible. That would mean about 9 out of 100 people still practice open defecation.\n\n- 18% is even higher, which would mean nearly one in five people don't use a toilet.\n\nI think it's somewhere between 9% and 18%. But I need to make an educated guess.\n\nI know that in some developing countries, open defecation is more common, especially in rural areas. For example, in India, which has a large population, there was a big campaign to build toilets and reduce open defecation. But I don't know the exact figures.\n\nMaybe I can think about the global population. As of 2020, the world population was around 7.8 billion people. So, if it's 9%, that would be about 700 million people. If it's 18%, that's about 1.4 billion people. Both numbers are significant, but I need to choose the closest option.\n\nI think 18% is too high. That seems like a lot of people still practicing open defecation. On the other hand, 4% seems too low. So, perhaps 9% is a reasonable estimate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 4%. But if it's 4%, that would still be around 312 million people, which is still a large number.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should recall that in 2015, the UN reported that around 2.4 billion people lacked access to basic sanitation facilities, which includes open defecation. By 2020, there should have been some improvement.\n\nLet me do a quick calculation. If in 2015 it was 2.4 billion out of a world population of around 7.3 billion, that's about 33%. So, in five years, if progress was made, it should be lower than that.\n\nGiven that, 18% seems too high, as it's almost double the 2015 percentage. So, probably it's lower than that.\n\nMaybe 9% is more realistic. That would mean that the number of people practicing open defecation was reduced by about two-thirds in five years, which seems ambitious but possible with global efforts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 4%. But that seems too low compared to the 2015 figures.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about specific regions.\n\nFor instance, sub-Saharan Africa has challenges with sanitation, and some South Asian countries also struggle with this issue.\n\nIf I consider that in some countries, open defecation is still prevalent, but overall, global efforts have reduced the percentage, maybe 9% is a better guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 2%. But that seems too optimistic.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that open defecation is more common in rural areas than in urban areas. So, in rural parts of developing countries, the percentage might be higher, but averaged globally, it might be lower.\n\nI think 9% is a reasonable estimate. So, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
