                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about the purposes of an organizational structure, and it's asking which one is NOT a purpose. So, I need to identify which of these options isn't something that an organizational structure is meant to do.\n\nFirst, let's understand what an organizational structure is. It's basically the framework that defines how tasks are divided, grouped, and coordinated, and it outlines the reporting relationships and lines of authority within an organization. It's like the skeleton that holds the organization together and helps it function efficiently.\n\nOption A says, \"To coordinate people and resources.\" That sounds right. One of the main purposes of an organizational structure is to ensure that people and resources are coordinated effectively so that the organization can achieve its goals. If people and resources aren't coordinated, things can get chaotic, and the organization might not perform well.\n\nOption B is \"To organise lines of communication.\" Again, this seems accurate. An organizational structure establishes how information flows within the organization, who reports to whom, and how decisions are made and communicated. Clear lines of communication are crucial for efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nOption C says, \"To formalise authority.\" Yes, that's another key aspect. An organizational structure formalizes who has authority over whom, establishing a hierarchy that clarifies responsibilities and accountability. This helps in decision-making and ensures that there's a clear chain of command.\n\nNow, option D is \"To limit workers' rights.\" Hmm, this one sounds different. I'm not sure if this is a purpose of an organizational structure. In fact, it seems a bit off. Organizational structures are designed to facilitate work and ensure that tasks are performed efficiently, but I don't recall anything about limiting workers' rights.\n\nWorkers' rights are more related to labor laws, employment regulations, and possibly the organization's policies on human resources. An organizational structure is more about how the work is organized and managed, not necessarily about restricting employees' rights.\n\nI think the key here is to understand that the organizational structure is meant to enhance efficiency and effectiveness, not to impose limitations on employees' rights. In fact, a well-designed organizational structure should support employees in performing their jobs better, not restrict them.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, A, B, and C seem to be valid purposes of an organizational structure, while D seems out of place. Therefore, I believe that \"To limit workers' rights\" is not a purpose of an organizational structure.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there might be any scenario where an organizational structure could limit workers' rights. Maybe in some autocratic organizations, the structure could be used to exert control over employees, potentially limiting their autonomy or rights. However, even in such cases, the primary purpose of the organizational structure isn't to limit rights but to exert control, which is different.\n\nMoreover, in most modern organizations, the focus is on empowering employees and fostering a positive work environment, which aligns more with options A, B, and C, but not with limiting workers' rights.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D. To limit workers' rights is not a purpose of an organizational structure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
