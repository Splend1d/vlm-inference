                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the velocity of a stone that is thrown vertically upward with an initial speed of 5 m/s after 3 seconds. We will use the equations of motion under constant acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFirst, let's recall the relevant equation for velocity under constant acceleration:\n\n\\[ v = u + at \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v \\) is the final velocity,\n- \\( u \\) is the initial velocity,\n- \\( a \\) is the acceleration (in this case, due to gravity),\n- \\( t \\) is the time.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial velocity, \\( u = 5 \\) m/s (upward),\n- Time, \\( t = 3 \\) s,\n- Acceleration due to gravity, \\( a = -g \\), where \\( g \\approx 9.8 \\) m/s\u00b2. The negative sign is used because the acceleration is downward, opposite to the initial direction of motion.\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\n\\[ v = 5 + (-9.8)(3) \\]\n\\[ v = 5 - 29.4 \\]\n\\[ v = -24.4 \\] m/s\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the velocity is downward.\n\nHowever, none of the options match exactly with -24.4 m/s. It seems there might be a discrepancy in the options provided or a need to approximate the value of \\( g \\). Let's try using \\( g = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2 for simplicity.\n\n\\[ v = 5 + (-10)(3) \\]\n\\[ v = 5 - 30 \\]\n\\[ v = -25 \\] m/s\n\nThis matches option B: 25 m/s, downward.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 25 m/s, downward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
