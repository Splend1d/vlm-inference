                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a football player who got seriously injured because his helmet shattered during a game. He's suing the manufacturer of the helmet for damages. Now, at trial, his attorney wants to call a former employee of the manufacturer to testify that three weeks after the player\u2019s injury, the manufacturer came up with a new design for their football helmets.\n\nThe question is asking whether this testimony is admissible, and if so, under what basis. The options are:\n\nA. admissible as an admission.\n\nB. admissible as circumstantial evidence that the player's injury was traceable to the defective design of the football helmet.\n\nC. inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.\n\nD. inadmissible, because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the testimony is about. The former employee is saying that after the player got injured, the manufacturer changed the design of their helmets. So, the implication might be that they realized there was a problem with the original design.\n\nOption A says it's admissible as an admission. Admissions are statements made by a party to the case that they own up to something. But here, the statement is about a new design created after the fact. It's not really an admission of anything directly related to the original design being defective or causing the injury. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption B says it's admissible as circumstantial evidence that the injury was due to a defective design. Circumstantial evidence is evidence that suggests a fact by implying it, rather than proving it directly. So, if the manufacturer changed the design after the injury, it might suggest that they thought there was something wrong with the original design. That could imply that the original design was defective, which might be related to the player's injury. This seems plausible.\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible because of public policy behind taking safety precautions. I'm not sure what this means exactly. Maybe it's referring to the idea that if a company takes steps to improve safety after an incident, that shouldn't be used against them in court, to encourage them to make improvements without fear of litigation. But I'm not positive about this.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer. Well, the testimony is about what the manufacturer did, not about any current official statements. Plus, the person is a former employee, so they might have knowledge about what happened inside the company, even if they can't speak officially anymore. So, this seems less likely.\n\nLet me think again. The key here is whether the fact that the manufacturer changed their design after the injury is relevant to proving that the original design was defective, which caused the player's injury.\n\nIn legal terms, evidence of subsequent remedial measures is generally not admissible to prove negligence or defect. There's a rule in evidence law, Federal Rule of Evidence 407, which states that when measures are taken after an event, proof of those measures is not admissible to show that the measures should have been taken earlier or that the party was negligent.\n\nSo, according to this rule, the fact that the manufacturer changed the design after the injury wouldn't be admissible to prove that the original design was defective.\n\nBut wait, there's an exception to this rule. Rule 407 does allow for such evidence to be admitted for other purposes, such as proving ownership or control, or for planning to prevent similar events in the future.\n\nIn this case, maybe the testimony could be used to show that the manufacturer had control over the design, or that they recognized there was a problem after the injury.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option B suggests it's admissible as circumstantial evidence that the injury was traceable to a defective design. However, based on Rule 407, this seems contrary to the general inadmissibility of subsequent remedial measures to prove defect.\n\nOption C mentions public policy behind taking safety precautions. This might be referring to the policy rationale behind Rule 407\u2014to encourage parties to make improvements without fearing it will be used against them in court.\n\nOption D seems less relevant because the admissibility doesn't hinge on whether the witness is currently authorized to speak for the manufacturer; it's more about whether the testimony is relevant and not prejudicial.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most accurate answer is C: inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions. This aligns with the principle that subsequent remedial measures shouldn't be admissible to prove defect, to encourage such improvements.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because option B seems tempting\u2014it does seem like changing the design after an injury could imply that the original design was defective. However, according to the evidence rules, this kind of evidence is typically excluded for the reasons of policy.\n\nMaybe I should look up Rule 407 more closely.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 407 states:\n\n\"Subsequent Remedial Measures. When, after an injury or harm allegedly caused by an event, measures are taken that, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove:\n\n(a) negligence;\n\n(b) culpable conduct;\n\n(c) a defect in a product or its design; or\n\n(d) a need for a warning or instruction.\n\nBut the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures, if those matters are disputed.\"\n\nSo, according to this, evidence of subsequent remedial measures isn't admissible to prove defect in a product or its design, which directly relates to option B.\n\nHowever, the rule also allows for such evidence to be admitted for other purposes, like proving ownership or control.\n\nIn this case, perhaps the plaintiff's attorney is trying to use the new design to show that the manufacturer had control over the design, which might be relevant in establishing liability.\n\nBut even so, the primary purpose of the testimony seems to be suggesting that the new design was implemented because the old one was defective, which is precisely what Rule 407 seeks to prevent.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the testimony would be inadmissible under Rule 407, based on the public policy of encouraging parties to take steps to make their products safer without fear that those steps will be used against them in litigation.\n\nSo, option C seems correct: inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider option A: admissible as an admission.\n\nAn admission is an acknowledgment of the truth of a fact by a party to the case. Here, the manufacturer didn't directly admit that their original design was defective; they just changed the design after the injury. So, this doesn't seem like a direct admission of defect. Therefore, option A is probably not correct.\n\nOption D: inadmissible because the former employee is no longer authorized to speak on behalf of the manufacturer. While the witness is a former employee, their testimony is about what the manufacturer did, not about any current official statements. So, their lack of current authorization shouldn't necessarily make the testimony inadmissible, especially if they have firsthand knowledge of the events.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the best answer is C: inadmissible, because of the public policy behind taking safety precautions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
