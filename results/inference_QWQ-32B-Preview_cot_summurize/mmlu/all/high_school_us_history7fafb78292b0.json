But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nPresident Jackson's policy was later altered by the\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here that's asking about a policy of President Jackson being altered later by one of these options: the Homestead Act of 1862, the Immigration Act of 1921, the Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, or the Dawes Act of 1887. First, I need to recall what President Jackson's policy was regarding Native Americans.\n\nI remember that President Jackson was known for his Indian Removal Policy, which led to the forced relocation of Native American tribes from their ancestral lands in the Southeast to territories west of the Mississippi River. This is infamously known as the Trail of Tears. So, his policy was essentially to remove Native Americans from their homes and move them to reserved lands in the west.\n\nNow, I need to see which of these options altered that policy later on.\n\nLet's look at option A, the Homestead Act of 1862. I know that the Homestead Act allowed people to claim government land for farming, which led to more settlement in the west. But I don't think this directly altered Jackson's policy on Native Americans; it was more about opening up land for white settlers.\n\nOption B is the Immigration Act of 1921. This act was about restricting immigration into the United States, particularly from certain countries. It doesn't seem directly related to Native American policy or Jackson's removal policy.\n\nOption C is the Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896. This case established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which was about racial segregation, mainly affecting African Americans. While it did have implications for racial separation, it wasn't directly about altering Jackson's policy towards Native Americans.\n\nOption D is the Dawes Act of 1887. I think this is the one that might be relevant here. The Dawes Act was about dividing tribal lands into individual allotments and promoting assimilation of Native Americans into American society. This seems like it would alter the earlier policy of removal by trying to integrate Native Americans into the existing social structure, rather than just moving them elsewhere.\n\nSo, comparing these options, the Dawes Act of 1887 seems to be the most directly related to altering President Jackson's Indian Removal Policy by shifting from removal to assimilation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Dawes Act of 1887.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
