PKU (phenylketonuria), C. Huntington's disease, D. Down syndrome. I need to figure out which one of these can have its symptoms or traits prevented by a special diet.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these conditions is and how they're caused.\n\nStarting with A, Tay-Sachs syndrome. I know that's a genetic disorder that affects the brain and nervous system. It's caused by a deficiency of an enzyme called hexosaminidase A. Without this enzyme, certain fats called gangliosides build up in the brain cells, leading to damage. I don't think there's a diet that can prevent or treat Tay-Sachs. It's more about managing symptoms and providing supportive care.\n\nOption B is PKU, or phenylketonuria. This is another genetic disorder where the body can't break down the amino acid phenylalanine properly because of a missing enzyme. If phenylalanine levels get too high, it can cause brain damage and other problems. But I recall that PKU can be managed with a special diet that limits phenylalanine intake. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nOption C, Huntington's disease, is a progressive brain disorder that causes uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. It's caused by a mutation in the Huntingtin gene. As far as I know, there's no diet that can prevent or treat Huntington's disease. Medications can help manage some symptoms, but it's a progressive condition.\n\nOption D, Down syndrome, is a chromosomal condition where a person has an extra copy of chromosome 21. This leads to developmental delays and distinct physical features. Again, there's no diet that can prevent the expression of Down syndrome traits. Early intervention and supportive therapies can help individuals with Down syndrome reach their full potential, but the condition itself can't be prevented by diet.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems like PKU is the one where a special diet can prevent the expression of the trait. By limiting phenylalanine in the diet, people with PKU can avoid the buildup that causes problems. In fact, newborn screening tests often check for PKU so that treatment can start early.\n\nI think the answer is B. PKU (phenylketonuria).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
