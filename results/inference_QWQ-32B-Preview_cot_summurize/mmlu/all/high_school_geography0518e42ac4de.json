Indo-European\n\nThe Indo-European language family is the most widely spoken in both North America and Europe, and it includes subfamilies such as Baltic, Celtic, Germanic, and Greek, among others. The other options listed\u2014Dravidian, Uralic-Altaic, and Sino-Tibetan\u2014are also important language families but are not as broadly represented in these regions.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Indo-European Languages:** This is the largest language family in terms of speakers, with languages spread across Europe, the Americas, and parts of Asia and Africa due to historical migrations and colonial expansions. In Europe, almost all languages belong to this family, with exceptions like Basque and Finnish. In North America, English, Spanish, French, and others are Indo-European languages.\n\n- **Dravidian Languages:** Primarily spoken in southern India and parts of northeastern Sri Lanka, these languages include Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam. They are not prominent in North America or Europe.\n\n- **Uralic-Altaic Languages:** This is a somewhat controversial grouping that includes Uralic languages (like Finnish and Hungarian in Europe) and Altaic languages (such as Turkish and Mongolian). While some languages in this group are spoken in Europe and Asia, they do not dominate these regions like Indo-European languages do.\n\n- **Sino-Tibetan Languages:** This family includes Chinese, Tibetan, and Burmese, among others, and is primarily spoken in East and Southeast Asia. While there are speakers of these languages in North America and Europe due to immigration, they are not as widespread as Indo-European languages in these regions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Indo-European."
