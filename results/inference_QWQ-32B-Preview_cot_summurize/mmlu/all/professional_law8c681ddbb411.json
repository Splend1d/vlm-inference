                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, we've got a scenario where a debtor owes a creditor $2,000, but collecting on that debt is barred by the statute of limitations. That means the legal time period for the creditor to enforce that debt has passed, so the creditor can't sue the debtor for it anymore. Got it.\n\nNow, the debtor sells his car to a buyer, and they have a written agreement where the buyer promises to pay the $2,000 purchase price to the creditor \"in satisfaction of [the debtor's] debt to [the creditor].\" Interesting. So, the buyer is agreeing to pay the creditor directly as part of this car sale.\n\nThe question is, can the creditor recover the $2,000 from the buyer?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because payment of the $2,000 to the creditor would undermine the statutory public policy against enforcement of stale claims.\n\nB. No, because the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary are subject to any defenses available to the contracting parties between themselves.\n\nC. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor is enforceable by the creditor regardless of whether the debtor was legally obligated to pay the creditor anything.\n\nD. Yes, because the buyer's promise to pay $2,000 to the creditor revived the uncollectible debt.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the statute of limitations has expired on the debt, so the creditor can't enforce the debt against the debtor anymore. But here, there's a new promise from the buyer to pay the creditor directly.\n\nOption A suggests that allowing the creditor to collect from the buyer would undermine the public policy against enforcing stale claims. That seems plausible because the whole point of the statute of limitations is to prevent old debts from being collected, to give debtors peace after a certain period.\n\nOption B talks about the creditor's rights as an intended beneficiary being subject to defenses available to the contracting parties. Hmm, in contract law, when a contract is made for the benefit of a third party, that third party can enforce the contract, but their rights might be subject to defenses that the contracting parties could have raised against each other.\n\nIn this case, the buyer and the debtor are the contracting parties, and the creditor is the intended beneficiary. So, if there are any defenses the buyer has against the debtor, perhaps those could be raised against the creditor.\n\nOption C says yes, the buyer's promise is enforceable by the creditor regardless of the debtor's legal obligation. This seems straightforward, but we have to consider the statute of limitations issue.\n\nOption D suggests that the buyer's promise revives the uncollectible debt. That's an interesting point. Does the buyer's promise to pay revive the original debt?\n\nLet me consider the law on this. In general, a new promise to pay an old debt can revive the debt and restart the statute of limitations. This is called an \"express promise\" or a \"new acknowledgment.\" But in this case, it's not the debtor making the new promise; it's a third party, the buyer.\n\nMore importantly, the buyer is promising to pay the creditor directly, not undertaking the debtor's obligation. So, it might be considered a novation, where the original debt is extinguished and a new debt is created between the buyer and the creditor.\n\nBut in this scenario, the buyer is promising to pay the creditor in satisfaction of the debtor's debt. So, it seems like the buyer is stepping into the shoes of the debtor, at least as far as paying the creditor is concerned.\n\nNow, regarding the statute of limitations, generally, if a debt is barred by the statute of limitations, a new promise to pay can revive it if certain conditions are met, like the debtor intending to revive the debt and the creditor accepting that revival.\n\nBut again, here, it's not the debtor making the new promise; it's the buyer. So, perhaps the rules are different.\n\nLet's think about option A again. If the creditor is allowed to collect from the buyer, it would effectively enforce the stale debt, which goes against the public policy embodied in the statute of limitations.\n\nOn the other hand, the buyer voluntarily agreed to pay the creditor as part of the car purchase. The buyer knew about the debt and agreed to satisfy it. So, perhaps the buyer should be bound by that promise.\n\nBut, as option B suggests, the creditor's rights might be subject to defenses the buyer has against the debtor. Maybe the buyer has defenses related to the car purchase that could be raised against the creditor.\n\nWait a minute, I need to think about the relationship between the parties.\n\nThe debtor and the buyer have a contract for the sale of the car, where the buyer promises to pay the creditor directly.\n\nThe creditor is an intended beneficiary of that contract.\n\nNow, if the buyer fails to make the payment, can the creditor sue the buyer?\n\nIn contract law, intended beneficiaries do have the right to enforce contracts made for their benefit, but their rights can be limited by defenses that the promisor (the buyer) has against the promisee (the debtor).\n\nIn this case, if the debtor had defenses against the buyer related to the car sale, perhaps those could be raised against the creditor.\n\nBut in this specific scenario, the main issue is the statute of limitations on the debtor's debt.\n\nI think the key here is whether the statute of limitations bars the creditor from enforcing the debt, and whether the buyer's promise somehow revives the debt or creates a new obligation.\n\nOption D suggests that the buyer's promise revives the uncollectible debt. If that's the case, then the creditor could collect from the buyer.\n\nBut, generally, only the debtor can revive the debt by making a new promise to pay. A third party's promise might not have that effect.\n\nMoreover, allowing the creditor to collect from the buyer would circumvent the statute of limitations, which is not desirable because it undermines the purpose of the limitations period.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is correct: the creditor cannot recover from the buyer because it would undermine the public policy against enforcing stale claims.\n\nBut option C argues that the buyer's promise is enforceable regardless of the debtor's legal obligation.\n\nWell, the buyer did promise to pay the creditor $2,000, and as an intended beneficiary, the creditor could enforce that promise.\n\nHowever, if the debtor's debt is barred by the statute of limitations, perhaps that should also bar the creditor from enforcing the buyer's promise.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me consider the practical aspect. Suppose the buyer pays the creditor $2,000 as promised. Then, the debtor could potentially turn around and say, \"Wait, I owe you nothing because the statute of limitations has expired, so you should refund that $2,000 to me.\" But that seems unlikely because the buyer paid it voluntarily.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the buyer could claim that since the debtor's debt is barred, the buyer shouldn't have to pay.\n\nBut in the contract, the buyer agreed to pay the creditor in satisfaction of the debtor's debt. So, the buyer voluntarily took on this obligation.\n\nIn contract law, parties can enter into agreements to satisfy debts, even if those debts are barred by the statute of limitations, as long as all parties agree.\n\nPerhaps the buyer is getting a car in exchange for promising to pay the creditor, and that's their deal.\n\nFrom the creditor's perspective, they have a promise from the buyer to pay $2,000, and they can enforce that promise.\n\nBut, considering the statute of limitations, there might be public policy reasons to say that the creditor can't enforce the buyer's promise because it would allow collection on a barred debt.\n\nThis seems to be a tricky area, and I suspect that the answer is option A: no, the creditor cannot recover from the buyer because it would undermine the public policy against enforcing stale claims.\n\nHowever, I should consider option B as well. If the creditor's rights are subject to defenses available to the contracting parties, perhaps the buyer could raise the statute of limitations as a defense against the creditor.\n\nBut, strictly speaking, the buyer's promise is independent of the debtor's debt, and the buyer voluntarily agreed to pay the creditor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the buyer could argue that since the debtor's debt is barred, there's no valid debt to satisfy, so the buyer shouldn't have to pay.\n\nThis is getting a bit muddled.\n\nLet me look at it differently. Suppose the buyer pays the creditor $2,000. The creditor accepts the payment, and the debtor's debt is satisfied.\n\nBut, since the debt was barred by the statute of limitations, perhaps the debtor could later claim that the creditor should refund the $2,000 because they had no legal right to collect it.\n\nWait, but the debtor isn't party to the agreement between the buyer and the creditor. The buyer and the debtor have their own agreement.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. I think the best answer is A: no, the creditor cannot recover from the buyer because it would undermine the public policy against enforcing stale claims.\n\nThe statute of limitations exists to prevent the enforcement of old, stale debts, and allowing a third party to pay them would circumvent that policy.\n\nTherefore, the creditor should not be able to enforce the buyer's promise.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
