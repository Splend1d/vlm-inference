                    "text": "I'm trying to recall the findings from that study by Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz from 1995 about differences in experiences after first intercourse between men and women. I remember it had to do with emotional responses, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nLet me think about this. The question is asking what women were more likely than men to have experienced after their first act of intercourse. The options are feeling glad, feeling fear, experiencing guilt, or experiencing regret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what kinds of emotions are typically associated with first-time intercourse. For many people, it's a significant and sometimes sensitive event, so emotions like happiness, fear, guilt, or regret could all be possible reactions.\n\nNow, considering the gender differences, perhaps societal expectations or cultural norms play a role here. Historically, there have been different expectations for men and women regarding sexuality, which might influence how they feel about their first intercourse.\n\nLet me eliminate some options. Feeling glad seems like a positive emotion, perhaps indicating satisfaction or happiness with the experience. I'm not sure if women were more likely than men to feel glad, but it's possible.\n\nFeeling fear could be another emotion, perhaps related to the unknown or potential consequences. Again, it's possible that women experienced more fear, but I need to think about why that might be the case.\n\nExperiencing guilt and regret are both negative emotions that could be associated with feelings of wrongdoing or disappointment with the experience. Given historical attitudes toward female sexuality, it's possible that women might have felt more guilt or regret compared to men.\n\nWait a minute, maybe guilt and regret are closely related in this context. If someone feels they did something wrong, they might feel guilty, and if they feel disappointed with the outcome, they might feel regret.\n\nPerhaps the study found that women were more likely to experience guilt or regret after their first intercourse compared to men. But I need to recall the specific finding.\n\nLet me try to remember the study's focus. Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz (1995) conducted research on sexual experiences, and I believe they looked at both male and female responses to their first intercourse.\n\nI think in their study, they found that women were more likely to experience certain negative emotions compared to men. Maybe it was guilt or regret.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it was fear that women experienced more than men. But I seem to recall that guilt and regret were more prominent in women's responses.\n\nWait, maybe it was both guilt and regret. Or perhaps one of them more strongly than the other.\n\nLet me consider the cultural context of 1995. At that time, there might have been more stigma attached to female sexuality, which could lead to feelings of guilt or regret in women who had their first intercourse.\n\nOn the other hand, men might have faced different pressures or expectations, perhaps being encouraged to be sexually active, which might result in different emotional responses.\n\nGiven that, it's possible that women were more likely to experience guilt or regret, while men might have been more likely to feel glad or satisfied.\n\nBut I need to be careful here because this is based on general assumptions, and I should rely on the actual findings of the study.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have immediate access to the study, so I need to rely on my memory of it.\n\nLet me think about the options again:\n\nA. Felt glad - this seems like a positive emotion, which might be experienced by both genders, but I don't recall if women were more likely than men to feel glad.\n\nB. Felt fear - fear could be a possible response, but again, I'm not sure if women experienced more fear than men.\n\nC. Experienced guilt - this seems plausible, given cultural expectations.\n\nD. Experienced regret - similar to guilt, regret might be more common in women due to societal pressures.\n\nPerhaps the study found that women were more likely to experience both guilt and regret. But since the question allows for only one answer, I need to choose the most appropriate one.\n\nMaybe guilt is more closely related to feelings of wrongdoing, while regret might be more about disappointment with the decision or outcome.\n\nIn any case, both guilt and regret are negative emotions, and it's possible that women experienced more of these after their first intercourse compared to men.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the study found that women were more likely to experience fear, but I doubt that.\n\nWait, maybe it's guilt. I seem to recall that guilt was a prominent emotion reported by women in the study.\n\nLet me consider the alternatives again. If women were more likely to feel glad, that would suggest a positive experience, which might not align with the general assumptions about first intercourse in the past.\n\nFeeling fear could be a possibility, but I don't recall the study emphasizing fear specifically.\n\nTherefore, between guilt and regret, I need to decide which one was more likely experienced by women.\n\nPerhaps guilt was more strongly associated with their experience, given possible societal judgments about female sexuality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe regret was more common if women felt that the timing or circumstances of their first intercourse were not what they desired.\n\nIn any case, I think the study highlighted that women were more likely to experience negative emotions such as guilt or regret compared to men.\n\nGiven that, and looking back at the options, both C and D are possible.\n\nBut since I have to choose one, perhaps guilt is a more fundamental emotion in this context, given potential societal expectations.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with C. Experienced guilt.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if regret might be a better answer.\n\nIf the study found that women were more likely to experience regret, that could also make sense, especially if they felt that their first intercourse didn't meet their expectations or if they felt pressured into it.\n\nIn fact, regret might encompass both the emotional discomfort of guilt and the disappointment of the experience not living up to their hopes.\n\nGiven that, perhaps regret is a more comprehensive response, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the study specifically identified guilt as the predominant emotion.\n\nTo make a decision, I'll consider that guilt is more about feeling bad for doing something wrong, while regret is about wishing one had made a different choice.\n\nGiven that, perhaps both are relevant, but if I have to choose one, guilt might be the more commonly reported emotion in the context of societal judgments.\n\nTherefore, I'll select C. Experienced guilt as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
