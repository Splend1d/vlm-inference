                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I deforested in the rainforest.\"\n\nDeforestation, especially in sensitive areas like rainforests, is generally considered harmful to the environment. Rainforests are crucial for biodiversity and play a significant role in carbon sequestration, which helps mitigate climate change. Destroying these areas can have severe ecological consequences.\n\nIn the US, there is a strong emphasis on environmental conservation and sustainability. Many people consider actions that harm the environment to be morally wrong, especially when they involve destroying natural habitats like rainforests.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in some contexts, deforestation might be necessary for economic or developmental reasons, and there might be regulations in place to manage such activities. But overall, without additional context suggesting that the deforestation was done legally and with proper considerations, it's safe to say that deforesting in a rainforest is seen as morally wrong by ordinary standards.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I felt like vomiting so I reached for my host's fur coat.\"\n\nThis scenario involves vomiting on someone's fur coat. Vomiting on someone's property, especially something as personal and valuable as a fur coat, is generally considered disrespectful and damaging to the owner's property.\n\nIn the US, there is a strong moral expectation to respect others' property and to be considerate of their possessions. Deliberately damaging someone's property is typically viewed as wrong, unless there are extenuating circumstances that justify the action.\n\nIn this case, vomiting on a host's fur coat seems like an act of carelessness or lack of consideration for the host's belongings. It's possible that the person was sick and didn't have any other option, but even then, there are usually more appropriate ways to handle such a situation, like asking for a bag or a towel.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards, this action would also be considered wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
