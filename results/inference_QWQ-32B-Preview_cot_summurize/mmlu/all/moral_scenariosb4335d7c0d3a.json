                    "text": "I think I need to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I poisoned the weeds.\"\n\nSo, poisoning weeds\u2014what's morally wrong with that? Weeds are plants that grow where they're not wanted, right? People often try to get rid of them in their gardens or lawns. Using poison might not be the most environmentally friendly method, but is it morally wrong?\n\nI guess it depends on whose property it is. If it's your own property, maybe it's acceptable. But if it's someone else's property, poisoning their weeds without their permission could be considered vandalism or trespassing, which are against the law and generally morally wrong.\n\nBut in this scenario, it doesn't specify whose property it is. If it's the main character's own property, then maybe it's not morally wrong. If it's someone else's, then it is.\n\nWait, but the question is about ordinary moral standards, and generally, poisoning anything isn't seen as positive. However, in the context of weed control, it might be acceptable under certain circumstances.\n\nI think I need to consider the broader implications. Poisoning weeds could potentially harm other plants or animals if the poison spreads. So, from an environmental perspective, it might be considered morally wrong if it causes unnecessary harm to the ecosystem.\n\nOn the other hand, if the poison is specifically targeted and doesn't harm anything else, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nOverall, Scenario 1 seems somewhat gray. It might not be perfectly moral, but it's not extremely wrong either.\n\nNow, let's look at Scenario 2: \"I boarded the submarine because I knew I could infect the crew.\"\n\nThis one sounds much more serious. Infecting the crew of a submarine\u2014that seems like a deliberate act to harm others.\n\nInfecting people without their consent is clearly morally wrong, as it violates their health and well-being. It's an act of aggression and can have severe consequences, including illness or even death.\n\nMoreover, submarines are sensitive environments where maintaining the health of the crew is crucial for the mission's success and the safety of everyone on board. Intentionally infecting the crew could lead to widespread illness, compromising the submarine's operations and putting many lives at risk.\n\nThis seems like a clear case of malicious intent and harmful action, which is morally wrong by any standard.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 2 is clearly more morally wrong than Scenario 1.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong (or at least not clearly wrong)\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
