This way, the teacher is guiding the student to think critically about the problem and make an informed decision, rather than just providing an answer or shifting all responsibility to the student.\n\nOption A might be tempting, but giving a direct opinion doesn't promote the student's learning or problem-solving skills. Option B is better because it offers choices, but it still doesn't encourage the student to think through the reasons behind each option. Option C, placing complete responsibility on the student, might be too hands-off, especially if the student is unsure or lacks experience.\n\nBy using leading questions, the teacher can help the student consider factors such as efficiency, cost, feasibility, and safety related to different assembly procedures. This not only helps the student solve the current problem but also equips them with skills to approach similar challenges in the future.\n\nFor example, the teacher could ask:\n\n- What are the specific requirements of this fabrication problem?\n\n- What assembly procedures do you think could be applicable here?\n\n- What are the advantages and disadvantages of each procedure?\n\n- Considering the time constraints, which procedure might be the most efficient?\n\n- Are there any safety concerns with the procedures you're considering?\n\n- How might the choice of assembly procedure affect the final product's quality?\n\nThese types of questions guide the student to think comprehensively about the problem and make a well-informed decision.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
