                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about cumulative preferred stock. So, the question is: \"To which of the following rights is a holder of a public corporation's cumulative preferred stock always entitled?\" And then there are four options:\n\nA. Conversion of the preferred stock into common stock.\n\nB. Voting rights.\n\nC. Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid.\n\nD. Guaranteed dividends.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what cumulative preferred stock is. I know that preferred stock is a type of stock that usually pays a fixed dividend and has priority over common stock in terms of dividend payments and liquidation preferences. Now, the term \"cumulative\" adds a specific feature to this type of preferred stock.\n\nLet me think about option A: conversion into common stock. I recall that some preferred stocks have a conversion feature, which allows the holder to convert their preferred shares into a specified number of common shares. However, I don't think this is a universal right for all cumulative preferred stockholders. It might be an optional feature. So, maybe A isn't the correct answer.\n\nOption B is voting rights. Typically, preferred stockholders have limited voting rights compared to common stockholders. In many cases, preferred stockholders don't have voting rights unless certain conditions are met, like missed dividend payments. So, it doesn't seem like they are always entitled to voting rights.\n\nOption C mentions dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid. Now, this sounds interesting. The term \"cumulative\" in cumulative preferred stock refers to the accumulation of unpaid dividends. So, if the corporation doesn't pay the dividend in a given year, those missed dividends accumulate and must be paid out before any dividends can be paid to common stockholders in future years. This seems like a right that cumulative preferred stockholders are always entitled to.\n\nOption D is guaranteed dividends. Well, preferred stock typically has a fixed dividend rate, but dividends are not always guaranteed. Companies are not required to pay dividends, especially if they don't have sufficient earnings. However, preferred stockholders have a higher claim on dividends than common stockholders. But \"guaranteed\" might be too strong a word because, in reality, dividends can be omitted if the board of directors decides not to declare them, unless there are specific legal requirements.\n\nComparing options C and D, C seems more accurate because it specifically relates to the cumulative feature, which ensures that missed dividends are carried over to future years. Option D, while preferred stockholders have a prior claim on dividends, it's not an absolute guarantee.\n\nLet me double-check. Cumulative preferred stock means that if dividends are not paid in one year, they accumulate and must be paid in future years before any dividends are paid to common stockholders. So, the holder is entitled to those accumulated dividends, which is essentially what option C is saying.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
