                    "text": "Let's dive into this contract law scenario. So, we have a purchasing agent who agreed to buy some khaki garments from a dressmaking company for $75,000. But a week later, the vice president of the dressmaking company calls and says there was a mistake in calculating the contract price, and they now want an additional $15,000 or else they won't deliver the garments.\n\nThe key point here is that the purchasing agent should have known that the original price of $75,000 was in error, but she agreed to the contract anyway. We need to figure out which statement is the most accurate in this situation.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake resulted from an error in computation, not in judgment.\"\n\nHmm, mistake in computation versus judgment. In contract law, mistakes can affect the formation or enforceability of a contract. Generally, if both parties are mistaken about a fundamental fact, there might be no contract at all, or it could be voidable. But here, it's a unilateral mistake\u2014only the dressmaking company made an error in calculation.\n\nOption B says: \"There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.\"\n\nUnilateral mistakes are when only one party is mistaken about something. In many cases, unilateral mistakes don't affect the enforceability of a contract, especially if the other party didn't know about the mistake or didn't rely on it.\n\nOption C says: \"There was no valid contract formed, because there was no mutuality of assent.\"\n\nMutuality of assent means both parties agreed to the same terms. If there's a mistake that affects the terms, it could impact mutuality of assent. But in this case, the purchasing agent should have known about the error but still agreed to the contract.\n\nOption D says: \"There was a voidable contract, because the purchasing agent should have known of the error.\"\n\nA voidable contract is one where one party can choose to void the contract due to certain circumstances like misrepresentation, mistake, or undue influence.\n\nGiven that the purchasing agent should have known about the error but still agreed to the contract, it seems like she can't really claim ignorance. So, perhaps the contract is enforceable as is.\n\nLet's think about it differently. If the purchasing agent knew or should have known that the price was incorrect, but still agreed to it, does that mean she's bound by the agreement? Or does the mistake allow for adjustment?\n\nIn contract law, if both parties are mistaken about a material fact, the contract might be voidable. But here, it's a unilateral mistake by the dressmaking company. The purchasing agent should have known about the error, which suggests that she might have been aware or ought to have been aware that the price was not correct.\n\nIn such cases, the purchasing agent can't really rely on the mistake to get out of the contract because she should have clarified the price or negotiated accordingly.\n\nSo, perhaps the most accurate statement is that there's an enforceable contract at the original price term.\n\nWait, but option A specifies that it's because the mistake was in computation, not judgment. Is that distinction important?\n\nIn contract law, mistakes in computation might be treated differently from mistakes in judgment. A computational error could be a simple miscalculation, like adding numbers wrong, whereas a mistake in judgment is more about assessing value or quality.\n\nIn this case, the vice president says there was an error in calculating the contract price, which sounds like a computational error.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that distinction affects the enforceability.\n\nOption B seems similar to A but doesn't specify the type of mistake.\n\nOption C claims there was no valid contract due to lack of mutuality of assent. But if the purchasing agent agreed to the terms, even knowing there was an error, perhaps there is mutuality of assent.\n\nOption D says it's a voidable contract because the purchasing agent should have known of the error. But if she should have known, does that make the contract voidable in her favor?\n\nWait, perhaps if she was negligent in not discovering the error, she can't void the contract.\n\nLet me try to find some case law or legal principles that might apply here.\n\nIn general, unilateral mistakes do not invalidate a contract unless the other party knew or should have known about the mistake and took advantage of it.\n\nIn this scenario, the purchasing agent should have known about the error but still agreed to the contract. So, it seems like she can't now claim that there was a mistake to get out of the contract.\n\nTherefore, the contract is enforceable at the original price term.\n\nLooking back at the options, both A and B suggest that there's an enforceable contract at the original price term, but for different reasons.\n\nOption A emphasizes that it's because the mistake was in computation, not judgment.\n\nOption B simply states that it's because the mistake was unilateral.\n\nWhich one is more accurate?\n\nI think option B is more accurate because it's the general rule in contract law that unilateral mistakes do not affect the enforceability of a contract, especially when the other party didn't know about the mistake.\n\nOption A introduces the distinction between computational and judgment mistakes, which might not be directly relevant to the enforceability in this context.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option B: There was an enforceable contract at the original price term, because the mistake was unilateral.\n\nBut let me consider option D again. If the purchasing agent should have known about the error, does that make the contract voidable?\n\nI don't think so. If she should have known, it suggests that she was negligent, and therefore, she can't void the contract based on the mistake.\n\nSo, option D seems incorrect.\n\nOption C suggests no valid contract due to lack of mutuality of assent. But if she agreed to the terms knowing there was an error, there still is mutuality of assent.\n\nTherefore, option B appears to be the most accurate statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
