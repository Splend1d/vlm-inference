                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have information about the speeds and prices of computers from five years ago compared to current computers. We need to find out what percent the current computer's speed-to-price ratio is of the older computer's speed-to-price ratio.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( s_c \\) be the speed of the current computer.\n\n- Let \\( p_c \\) be the price of the current computer.\n\n- Let \\( s_o \\) be the speed of the older computer from five years ago.\n\n- Let \\( p_o \\) be the price of the older computer.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n1. \"Five years ago, a computer that worked half as fast as a current computer...\" So, the speed of the older computer was half that of the current one:\n\n   \\[ s_o = \\frac{1}{2} s_c \\]\n\n2. \"...cost twice as much money.\" So, the price of the older computer was twice that of the current one:\n\n   \\[ p_o = 2 p_c \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the speed-to-price ratio for both computers.\n\nThe speed-to-price ratio for the current computer is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ratio}_c = \\frac{s_c}{p_c} \\]\n\nThe speed-to-price ratio for the older computer is:\n\n\\[ \\text{ratio}_o = \\frac{s_o}{p_o} \\]\n\nWe need to find what percent the current computer's ratio is of the older computer's ratio. In other words:\n\n\\[ \\text{percent} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{ratio}_c}{\\text{ratio}_o} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nLet's substitute the expressions for \\(\\text{ratio}_c\\) and \\(\\text{ratio}_o\\):\n\n\\[ \\text{percent} = \\left( \\frac{\\frac{s_c}{p_c}}{\\frac{s_o}{p_o}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n\\[ \\text{percent} = \\left( \\frac{s_c}{p_c} \\times \\frac{p_o}{s_o} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nNow, substitute the relationships between \\( s_o \\) and \\( s_c \\), and \\( p_o \\) and \\( p_c \\):\n\n\\[ \\text{percent} = \\left( \\frac{s_c}{p_c} \\times \\frac{2 p_c}{\\frac{1}{2} s_c} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nSimplify the expression step by step:\n\nFirst, the \\( s_c \\) terms:\n\n\\[ \\frac{s_c}{1} \\times \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} s_c} = \\frac{s_c}{1} \\times \\frac{2}{s_c} = 2 \\]\n\nNext, the \\( p_c \\) terms:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{p_c} \\times \\frac{2 p_c}{1} = \\frac{1}{p_c} \\times 2 p_c = 2 \\]\n\nSo, overall:\n\n\\[ \\text{percent} = (2 \\times 2) \\times 100\\% = 4 \\times 100\\% = 400\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the current computer's speed-to-price ratio is 400% of the older computer's speed-to-price ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 20\n\nB. 400\n\nC. 32\n\nD. \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\)\n\nThe correct answer is B. 400.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{400} \\]"
