                    "text": "Let's see. This is a passage from Thomas Paine's \"The Age of Reason,\" and it's from 1794-1795. I know that Thomas Paine was an influential figure during the Enlightenment, so this probably relates to Enlightenment ideas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Enlightenment philosophes were demanding. The Enlightenment was a period when rationality and reason were highly valued, and many thinkers critiqued traditional institutions, including religion and monarchy. So, they were advocating for things like freedom of thought, separation of church and state, and human rights based on reason.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Deism should be adopted by all as the only logical religion.\n\nWell, deism is the belief in a supreme being without any religious doctrine or revelation, relying solely on reason. Paine seems to be expressing deistic views here, but does he demand that everyone adopts it? Let's see what he says.\n\nHe says, \"I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life. I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.\" This sounds like a deistic viewpoint, emphasizing reason and morality without dogma.\n\nBut then he says, \"I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.\" So, he's not demanding that everyone adopts deism; he's just stating his own beliefs and extending tolerance to others.\n\nSo, option A doesn't seem right because he's not demanding universal adoption of deism.\n\nOption B: Religious toleration leads to the destruction of social unity.\n\nHmm, that doesn't align with Paine's views here. He's advocating for religious toleration, not against it. In fact, he's arguing for tolerance of all beliefs, as long as they don't infringe on others' rights.\n\nOption C: Skepticism is not a reliable way of examining information.\n\nAgain, this doesn't fit with Paine's stance. He values reason and skepticism toward established religions. He's questioning traditional beliefs and institutions, which is a skeptical approach.\n\nOption D: Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.\n\nThis seems to align with what Paine is saying. He asserts that everyone has the right to their own opinion and belief, and he doesn't condemn those who believe differently. He even says, \"I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine.\"\n\nMoreover, he mentions that the abolition of compulsory religion in France has made this work necessary \"lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.\" So, he's concerned about maintaining moral and humanitarian values in the face of religious upheaval, and he seems to support the idea that people should be free to believe as they choose.\n\nTherefore, the demand that this document supports is that religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
