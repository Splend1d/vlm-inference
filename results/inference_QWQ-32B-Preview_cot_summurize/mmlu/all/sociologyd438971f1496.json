I remember that Ebenezer Howard was a key figure in urban planning, especially known for his concept of garden cities. So, I need to recall what exactly he proposed.\n\nOption A says: six small towns surrounded by green belts and linked to a larger central city. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Howard did propose a kind of decentralized urban structure where smaller towns were connected to a central city, all surrounded by green spaces. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B: planning cities to have plenty of trees, flowers, and public gardens. Well, that does sound like a garden city. Howard emphasized the importance of nature and green spaces within urban areas to improve the quality of life for residents. So, this also aligns with his ideas.\n\nOption C: each privately owned house to have its own front and back garden. Again, this ties into the concept of integrating nature into daily life. Having individual gardens for each house would promote a connection to nature and provide private outdoor space for residents.\n\nOption D: tower blocks to displace the population vertically and leave most of the land available as green open spaces. This sounds more like a modern approach to urban planning, where high-rise buildings are used to concentrate population density and preserve green areas. While this might share some similarities with Howard's ideas, I think it's not exactly what he proposed.\n\nNow, considering all options, I need to choose the one that best represents Howard's idea of the garden city.\n\nHoward's original concept, as I recall, was to create self-contained communities surrounded by \"greenbelts,\" with a balance between housing, industry, and agriculture. He envisioned a series of small, interconnected towns that would grow organically, minimizing the need for long commutes and preserving rural areas.\n\nSo, option A seems to capture this idea of multiple small towns linked to a central city, all surrounded by green belts. This aligns well with Howard's vision of decentralizing population and providing a combination of urban and rural amenities.\n\nOption B is also attractive because it emphasizes the importance of green spaces, trees, and public gardens. However, this seems more like a description of the physical characteristics of a garden city rather than the overall structure.\n\nOption C focuses on individual houses having their own gardens, which is certainly a part of the garden city ideal but perhaps not the central planning concept.\n\nOption D mentions tower blocks, which weren't really part of Howard's original plan. His vision was more about low-density, decentralized communities rather than high-rise buildings.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is option A: six small towns surrounded by green belts and linked to a larger central city. This captures the essence of Howard's garden city concept, which aimed to combine the benefits of urban and rural life through thoughtful planning and the preservation of green spaces.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
