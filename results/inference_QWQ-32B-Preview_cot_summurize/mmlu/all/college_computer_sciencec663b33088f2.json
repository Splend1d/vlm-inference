                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of the following decimal numbers has an exact representation in binary notation? A) 0.1, B) 0.2, C) 0.3, D) 0.5.\" I need to figure out which one of these decimal fractions can be represented exactly in binary. I remember that not all decimal fractions can be expressed precisely in binary, just like how 1/3 can't be expressed exactly in decimal; it's 0.333... repeating. So, I need to determine which of these options doesn't have that repeating issue in binary.\n\nFirst, let's recall how binary fractions work. In binary, fractions are represented similarly to decimal fractions, but instead of tenths, hundredths, etc., we have halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths, and so on. So, each place after the binary point represents a negative power of two.\n\nLet's consider option D) 0.5 first because it seems straightforward. 0.5 in decimal is exactly half, which in binary is 0.1. That's because the first place after the binary point represents 2^-1, which is 0.5. So, 0.1 in binary is exactly 0.5 in decimal. No issues here; it's exact.\n\nNow, option A) 0.1. I think this is where things might get tricky. I recall that 0.1 in decimal is a repeating fraction in binary. Let me try to convert it to binary to confirm.\n\nTo convert 0.1 to binary, I can multiply it by 2 repeatedly and record the integer part:\n\n0.1 * 2 = 0.2 \u2192 0\n\n0.2 * 2 = 0.4 \u2192 0\n\n0.4 * 2 = 0.8 \u2192 0\n\n0.8 * 2 = 1.6 \u2192 1\n\n0.6 * 2 = 1.2 \u2192 1\n\n0.2 * 2 = 0.4 \u2192 0\n\n0.4 * 2 = 0.8 \u2192 0\n\n0.8 * 2 = 1.6 \u2192 1\n\nAnd this pattern seems to repeat: 0.0001100110011... in binary. So, yes, 0.1 in decimal is a repeating fraction in binary, which means it doesn't have an exact representation.\n\nMoving on to option B) 0.2. Let's try converting 0.2 to binary using the same method:\n\n0.2 * 2 = 0.4 \u2192 0\n\n0.4 * 2 = 0.8 \u2192 0\n\n0.8 * 2 = 1.6 \u2192 1\n\n0.6 * 2 = 1.2 \u2192 1\n\n0.2 * 2 = 0.4 \u2192 0\n\n0.4 * 2 = 0.8 \u2192 0\n\n0.8 * 2 = 1.6 \u2192 1\n\nAgain, this seems to repeat: 0.001100110011... in binary. So, 0.2 in decimal also doesn't have an exact binary representation.\n\nNow, option C) 0.3. Let's convert 0.3 to binary:\n\n0.3 * 2 = 0.6 \u2192 0\n\n0.6 * 2 = 1.2 \u2192 1\n\n0.2 * 2 = 0.4 \u2192 0\n\n0.4 * 2 = 0.8 \u2192 0\n\n0.8 * 2 = 1.6 \u2192 1\n\n0.6 * 2 = 1.2 \u2192 1\n\n0.2 * 2 = 0.4 \u2192 0\n\n0.4 * 2 = 0.8 \u2192 0\n\n0.8 * 2 = 1.6 \u2192 1\n\nAgain, it's repeating: 0.010011001100... in binary. So, 0.3 doesn't have an exact binary representation either.\n\nFinally, option D) 0.5, which I already determined is exactly 0.1 in binary. No repetition, exact representation.\n\nSo, among the options given, only 0.5 has an exact representation in binary notation.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check. Is there a general rule or a better way to understand which decimal fractions can be represented exactly in binary?\n\nI recall that a fraction can be represented exactly in binary if the denominator is a power of 2. In other words, if the fraction can be expressed as a sum of fractions where each denominator is a power of 2, then it has an exact binary representation.\n\nFor example, 0.5 is 1/2, which is already a power of 2, so it's exact.\n\n0.25 is 1/4, which is 2^-2, exact.\n\n0.75 is 3/4, which is 2^-1 + 2^-2, exact.\n\nOn the other hand, 0.1 is 1/10, and 10 is not a power of 2; it's 2 * 5. Since it has a prime factor other than 2, it cannot be represented exactly in binary.\n\nSimilarly, 0.2 is 1/5, which again has a prime factor other than 2, so it's not exact.\n\n0.3 is 3/10, same issue as 0.1.\n\nSo, this seems consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe by considering the binary representation of fractions with denominators that are powers of 2.\n\nLet me consider some examples:\n\n1/2 = 0.1 in binary (exact)\n\n1/4 = 0.01 in binary (exact)\n\n1/8 = 0.001 in binary (exact)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFractions like 1/3, 1/5, 1/10, etc., which have denominators with prime factors other than 2, will not have exact binary representations.\n\nTherefore, in the given options, only 0.5 has a denominator that is a power of 2 (specifically, 2^1), so it has an exact binary representation.\n\nThe other options have denominators that are not powers of 2:\n\n0.1 is 1/10, 10 = 2 * 5\n\n0.2 is 1/5\n\n0.3 is 3/10\n\nHence, they don't have exact binary representations.\n\nSo, the answer should be D) 0.5.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if there's any exception or special case that I might be missing.\n\nIs there any decimal fraction that appears not to be exact but actually is?\n\nFor example, 0.4 in decimal is 2/5, which still has a denominator with a prime factor other than 2, so it shouldn't be exact.\n\nSimilarly, 0.6 is 3/5, same issue.\n\nSo, no, I don't think there are any exceptions here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) 0.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
