                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. So, there's a driver who was driving along Main Street at 10:00 p.m. on November 14. He's approaching the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue. Another motorist comes through a red light, so the driver tries to avoid him by veering onto the sidewalk. There's a deep hole in the sidewalk dug by a construction company that was repairing a water main break earlier in the day. This construction company was hired by the local municipal water department.\n\nNow, the construction company put up a warning sign for pedestrians about the hole, but there was no fence or barrier around it. So, the car lands in this hole, which ruptures the water main, filling the car with water. The driver drowns because he couldn't escape.\n\nNow, there's a wrongful death action by the driver's estate against the municipal water department. We need to figure out which of the options is most probably correct.\n\nOption A says the estate will prevail because sovereign immunity wouldn't attach to non-delegable duties, which are proprietary in nature.\n\nOption B says the estate will prevail because the city government would be strictly liable for failing to ensure the water main repair work was done properly.\n\nOption C says the estate will not prevail because the municipal water department wouldn't be liable for the negligence of its independent contractor.\n\nOption D says the estate will not prevail because sovereign immunity attaches to functions that are governmental in nature.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what sovereign immunity is. Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that protects the government from being sued without its consent. However, in many jurisdictions, there are exceptions to this immunity, especially when the government is performing proprietary functions as opposed to governmental functions.\n\nSo, in this case, the municipal water department is involved in repairing a water main, which is part of the infrastructure. I think this is a proprietary function because it's related to providing a service to the public, similar to how a private entity might operate.\n\nNow, option A suggests that sovereign immunity doesn't apply to non-delegable duties that are proprietary in nature. So, if the water department has a non-delegable duty in this regard, and since it's a proprietary function, maybe the estate can prevail.\n\nOption B says the city government would be strictly liable for failing to ensure the water main repair work was done properly. Strict liability means they're responsible regardless of fault. But I'm not sure if strict liability applies here. It seems more like a negligence case.\n\nOption C says the water department isn't liable for the negligence of its independent contractor. Well, that might be true, but in some jurisdictions, there are exceptions, especially if the work being done is inherently dangerous or if it's a non-delegable duty.\n\nOption D says sovereign immunity applies to governmental functions, and since this is a governmental function, the estate won't prevail. But earlier, I thought that repairing water mains might be a proprietary function, in which case sovereign immunity might not apply.\n\nI need to think about whether repairing water mains is a governmental or proprietary function. Governmental functions are typically those that are uniquely the province of the government, like police protection, whereas proprietary functions are more like business activities that could be performed by private entities, like providing water.\n\nSo, providing water seems proprietary to me. Therefore, sovereign immunity might not apply, and the water department could be liable.\n\nNow, regarding the independent contractor. If the construction company was an independent contractor hired by the water department, generally, the water department isn't liable for the contractor's negligence. However, if the water department had a non-delegable duty to ensure the safety of the public during the repair work, then they might still be liable.\n\nIn this case, the construction company put up a warning sign but no fence or barrier around the hole. Maybe the water department had a duty to ensure that adequate safety measures were taken.\n\nAlso, the fact that the car fell into the hole and ruptured the water main, causing the car to fill with water and the driver to drown, suggests that there were inadequate safeguards in place.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option A might be the correct answer. The estate will prevail because sovereign immunity doesn't attach to non-delegable duties that are proprietary in nature.\n\nOption B seems less likely because strict liability is not typically applied in these situations. It's more about negligence.\n\nOption C might not hold because of the non-delegable duty.\n\nOption D is perhaps incorrect because the function is proprietary, not governmental.\n\nSo, my best guess is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
