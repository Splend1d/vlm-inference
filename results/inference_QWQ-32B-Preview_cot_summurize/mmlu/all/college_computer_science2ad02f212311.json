It divides memory into units of equal size.\n\nII. It permits implementation of virtual memory.\n\nIII. It suffers from internal fragmentation.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and III\n\nOkay, first I need to recall what a purely segmented memory system is. In a segmented memory system, the memory is divided into variables-length segments, each of which can be allocated to hold a logical unit of a program, like a function or a data structure.\n\nSo, statement I says: \"It divides memory into units of equal size.\" But in a segmented system, segments can be of different sizes, right? So, this doesn't sound correct.\n\nStatement II: \"It permits implementation of virtual memory.\" Virtual memory is a way to manage memory by swapping data between RAM and disk storage. Segmentation can be used to implement virtual memory because each segment can be paged or stored on disk and brought into memory as needed. So, this seems correct.\n\nStatement III: \"It suffers from internal fragmentation.\" Internal fragmentation occurs when there are unused holes within an allocated block. In a segmented system, each segment is allocated a specific size, and if the data doesn't fully use the allocated space, there might be internal fragmentation. However, I think internal fragmentation is more associated with paging systems, where memory is divided into fixed-size pages, and the last page of a process might not be fully used. In segmentation, the segments are sized according to the needs of the data or code, so internal fragmentation should be minimal. Wait, maybe I'm confusing this.\n\nLet me think again. In segmentation, each segment is allocated based on its size, so there shouldn't be much internal fragmentation because the segments fit the data closely. But I remember that in pure segmentation, there can be external fragmentation, where there's enough total memory available, but not a contiguous block large enough to satisfy a request. So, maybe statement III isn't accurate for segmentation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is internal fragmentation in segmentation due to the way segments are allocated. Maybe I need to recall how segments are managed. In segmentation, each segment has a segment table entry that specifies the base address and limit of the segment. The CPU uses the segment identifier and an offset to access memory. If the segments are allocated in a way that there are gaps between them, that would be external fragmentation, not internal.\n\nInternal fragmentation would occur if, for example, each segment had to be allocated in a block that is a multiple of a certain size, leading to unused space within the block. But in classic segmentation, segments are allocated contiguously based on their exact size, so internal fragmentation shouldn't be a issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider that in some implementations of segmentation, there might be overhead per segment, like the segment table entries, which could lead to some waste, but that's more of administrative overhead rather than internal fragmentation.\n\nGiven that, statement III might not be accurate for segmentation.\n\nSo, statement I is incorrect because segments are of variable size, not equal size.\n\nStatement II is correct because segmentation can be used to implement virtual memory.\n\nStatement III is likely incorrect because segmentation doesn't suffer from internal fragmentation in the same way paging does.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. II only.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something specific about purely segmented memory systems that I'm missing regarding internal fragmentation.\n\nIn a purely segmented system, without paging, the memory is divided into segments of varying sizes based on the needs of the program's segments. Each segment is allocated contiguously in memory, and the segment table maps logical segments to physical memory addresses.\n\nInternal fragmentation typically occurs when memory is divided into fixed-size units, and data doesn't fully utilize the unit, leaving unused space. Since segments are sized according to their content, there shouldn't be internal fragmentation.\n\nExternal fragmentation can occur in segmentation because over time, as segments are allocated and deallocated, holes can form in memory that are too small to be used for new segments, even though the total free memory is sufficient.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\n- Internal fragmentation: unused space within an allocated block.\n\n- External fragmentation: unused space between allocated blocks.\n\nIn segmentation, internal fragmentation shouldn't be a problem because blocks are sized to fit the data. External fragmentation can be a problem.\n\nTherefore, statement III is incorrect because it's external fragmentation that's more relevant to segmentation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. II only.\n\nBut let's see if there's any scenario where segmentation could lead to internal fragmentation.\n\nPerhaps if the operating system allocates segments in multiples of a certain unit, say, in multiples of 512 bytes, and the segment size isn't a multiple of that unit, then there could be some internal fragmentation. But in general, segmentation allows for segments of any size, so this shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a fixed-size segment table entry that reserves a certain amount of memory per segment, and if the segment isn't fully using that, there's internal fragmentation. But again, that's more of administrative overhead.\n\nGiven that, I think statement III is not accurate for segmentation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
