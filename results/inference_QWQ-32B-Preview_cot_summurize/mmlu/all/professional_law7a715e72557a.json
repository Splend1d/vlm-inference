On May 1, he telephoned a number of contractors whom he had dealt with in the past and asked them to submit bids to build the homes. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. He notified each subcontractor that he intended to use their bids in submitting a general bid to the developer. A plumber submitted a bid to the contractor in the amount of $50,000, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the developer. On June 1, the contractor submitted a bid to the developer in which he offered to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. On June 4, the plumber notified the contractor that he had overbooked his crews and could not possibly do the work on the developer's job. On June 5, the developer sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein he stated, \"I hereby accept your offer to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. ', Thereafter, the contractor hired another plumber to complete the plumbing work at a cost of $60,000. The contractor then explained the situation to the developer and requested that the overall cost of the job be increased to $510,000. The developer refused on the grounds that he had a contract for $500,000 and that this was the contractor's problem. The contractor then built the 10 tract homes, and the developer sent him a check for $500,000. Which of the following best supports a claim for $10,000 by the contractor against the plumber who refused to do the work?\n\nA. The plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.\nB. The plumber's bid was a \"firm offer\" that was not revocable, since both the plumber and the contractor were merchants.\nC. The contractor made an offer to the plumber that the plumber accepted when he submitted his bid.\nD. An option contract was created, because the contractor, with the plumber's knowledge, used the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a developer who wants to build 10 tract homes on a large vacant lot. He calls several contractors he's worked with before and asks them to submit bids for the project. One of these contractors then reaches out to subcontractors, including a plumber, to get bids for specific parts of the job. The plumber submits a bid of $50,000 for the plumbing work, which the contractor uses to calculate his overall bid to the developer.\n\nSo, the contractor submits a bid of $500,000 to the developer on June 1. Then, on June 4, the plumber backs out, saying he can't do the work because his crew is overbooked. On June 5, the developer accepts the contractor's bid by sending a signed confirmation letter.\n\nAfter the plumber pulls out, the contractor has to find another plumber to do the job, which costs $60,000 instead of the original $50,000 bid. So, the contractor incurs an extra $10,000 in costs. The contractor then approaches the developer to increase the overall contract price to $510,000 to cover this extra cost, but the developer refuses, sticking to the original accepted bid of $500,000.\n\nThe contractor proceeds to build the homes and receives a check for $500,000 from the developer. Now, the contractor is seeking to claim $10,000 from the plumber who refused to do the work. We need to determine which option best supports this claim.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.\n\nThis seems plausible. The plumber submitted a bid, which can be considered an offer to provide plumbing services for $50,000. By using this bid in his own bid to the developer, the contractor accepted this offer. However, we need to consider if this acceptance is valid under contract law.\n\nB. The plumber's bid was a \"firm offer\" that was not revocable, since both the plumber and the contractor were merchants.\n\nA firm offer is a commitment by a merchant to keep an offer open for a certain period, and it's irrevocable during that time. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a firm offer requires a signed writing and a promise to keep the offer open. Here, the plumber's bid was likely in writing, but it's not specified whether it was a firm offer or if it included a promise to keep the offer open. So, this might not be the strongest argument.\n\nC. The contractor made an offer to the plumber that the plumber accepted when he submitted his bid.\n\nThis seems backward. Typically, in a bidding scenario, the subcontractor (plumber) makes an offer (bid), and the contractor accepts it. So, this option doesn't align with standard practices.\n\nD. An option contract was created, because the contractor, with the plumber's knowledge, used the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.\n\nAn option contract gives one party the right to enter into a contract with another party within a specified period, in exchange for consideration. Here, the plumber's bid might be considered an option if the contractor provided some consideration (like paying for the bid preparation) and there was an agreement to keep the offer open. However, it's not clear from the scenario that such an agreement existed.\n\nConsidering these points, option A seems to be the most straightforward. The plumber made an offer (bid), and the contractor accepted it by incorporating it into his own bid to the developer. Once accepted, the plumber was bound by his bid, and backing out would constitute a breach of contract, for which the contractor could seek damages, in this case, the extra $10,000 incurred by hiring another plumber.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in practice, subcontractor bids are often considered non-firm and revocable unless specified otherwise. But based on the information provided and the options given, A seems to be the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
