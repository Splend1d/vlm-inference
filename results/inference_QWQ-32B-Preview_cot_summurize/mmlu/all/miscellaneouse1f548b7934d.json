So, it's important that the information is reliable and not biased.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Annual reports - These are documents that companies publish every year to share their performance and financial status with shareholders. They usually include financial statements, management discussions, and sometimes information about the company's goals and culture. But, since the company prepares these, they might present things in a positive light to attract investors or potential employees. So, while they can be informative, they might not be entirely objective.\n\nB. Press releases - These are statements issued by the company to announce news or updates. They're meant to shape public perception and can be quite promotional. So, I don't think press releases are a great source for objective information.\n\nC. Newspaper articles - Articles in newspapers can provide insights from an external perspective. Journalists often interview sources and do their own research, which can lead to more objective reporting. However, the quality of the information depends on the journalist and the newspaper's standards. Some articles might be balanced, while others could have biases or errors.\n\nD. 10-K filings with the SEC - This is a comprehensive report that publicly traded companies in the U.S. are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) annually. It includes detailed financial information, management's discussion and analysis, legal proceedings, and other important data. Since these filings are regulated and must comply with SEC rules, they are designed to provide accurate and objective information to investors.\n\nComparing all these options, I think the 10-K filings with the SEC would be the best source for objective information about a prospective employer that is publicly traded. They are legally required to be accurate and comprehensive, reducing the chance of bias or misinformation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's any other source I'm missing. What about shareholder presentations or investor relations materials? Those might also be useful, but similar to annual reports, they could be biased towards presenting the company in a positive light.\n\nAlso, consider industry reports or analyst reports. These could provide objective analysis, but they might focus more on the company's financial performance and less on the workplace culture, which is important for a prospective employee.\n\nAnother option could be job review websites like Glassdoor, where current and former employees share their experiences. These can be very informative about the work environment, but they might not be entirely objective, as reviews can be biased based on individual experiences.\n\nGiven all this, I still think the 10-K filings are the most objective and reliable source for financial and operational information about the company. For information about workplace culture, maybe combining the 10-K filings with job reviews could give a more complete picture.\n\nSo, my final answer is D. 10-K filings with the SEC.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
