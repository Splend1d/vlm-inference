Peace studies developed after the Second World War as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. Initially, the field was conditioned by the nuclear arms race and East-West divide that characterised the Cold War, but was quick to embrace environmental concerns and the issues surrounding the North-South wealth/poverty divide.\nB. Peace studies developed as a discipline following the Cold War when the security studies paradigm shifted to include areas of concern such as environmental, societal and economic security. As a field of research peace studies adopts a Euro-centric approach to security and has thus been defined by developments within the West and wealthier nations.\nC. Peace studies emerged as a response to the developing nuclear capability of states during the Cold War. The aim of peace studies is to secure the state as a referent object and does this through the study of weapons accumulation. The approach is particularly focused on the nuclear arms race between East and West.\nD. Developed as a response to World War I, peace studies focuses on disparities in wealth and resource allocation that exist within the global system, with the aim of promoting peace through the equal distribution of these resources.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about peace studies and see which statement best captures its emergence as a field of research. I need to think carefully about the historical context and the key factors that led to the development of peace studies.\n\nOption A says that peace studies developed after the Second World War as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. It mentions that the field was initially shaped by the nuclear arms race and the East-West divide of the Cold War, but also evolved to include environmental concerns and issues related to the North-South wealth/poverty divide.\n\nOption B suggests that peace studies became a discipline after the Cold War, when the security studies paradigm expanded to include areas like environmental, societal, and economic security. It also notes that peace studies adopt a Euro-centric approach, being defined by developments in the West and wealthier nations.\n\nOption C states that peace studies emerged in response to the developing nuclear capabilities during the Cold War, with a focus on securing the state through the study of weapons accumulation, particularly the nuclear arms race between East and West.\n\nOption D claims that peace studies was developed in response to World War I, focusing on wealth and resource disparities globally, aiming to promote peace through equal distribution.\n\nHmm, let's consider the timelines first. World War I ended in 1918, and World War II in 1945. The Cold War lasted from roughly 1947 to 1991. So, timing is important here.\n\nOption A mentions that peace studies developed after WWII, in response to the failures of International Relations to prevent global conflicts following WWI. That makes sense because after WWII, there was a significant push to understand and prevent such large-scale conflicts. The nuclear arms race and the East-West divide were indeed major concerns during the Cold War, which aligns with the initial conditioning of peace studies. Additionally, it notes that the field quickly embraced environmental concerns and the North-South divide, suggesting an evolution in its focus.\n\nOption B says peace studies developed as a discipline following the Cold War, which seems a bit late. Many peace studies programs and research began during the Cold War, not after it ended. Also, it labels peace studies as Euro-centric and defined by developments in the West and wealthier nations. While it's true that many early peace studies institutions were in the West, the field has become more globalized and inclusive over time.\n\nOption C focuses narrowly on the nuclear arms race during the Cold War, stating that peace studies aim to secure the state through studying weapons accumulation. This seems quite limited. Peace studies is broader and includes not just arms reduction but also conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and addressing root causes of conflict.\n\nOption D attributes the development of peace studies to World War I, which is earlier than most accounts. While the League of Nations and other international organizations emerged post-WWI with aims to prevent future wars, the formal field of peace studies is generally considered to have gained momentum after WWII and during the Cold War.\n\nConsidering these points, Option A seems the most comprehensive and accurate. It acknowledges the post-WWII origins of peace studies, its initial focus on nuclear arms and the Cold War, and its expansion to include environmental and North-South issues.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
