The jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts are also common to international tribunals\n\nB. The jurisdiction of all international tribunals is regulated by the UN Security Council\n\nC. International tribunals share some, but not all, of the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts\n\nD. The jurisdiction of international tribunals is dictated solely by their founding treaties\n\nFirst, I need to understand what jurisdiction means in this context. Jurisdiction generally refers to the authority of a court to hear and decide a case. So, for international tribunals, it's about what cases they have the power to adjudicate.\n\nNational courts have jurisdiction based on various principles, such as territoriality, nationality of the parties, subject matter, etc. I need to see how these principles apply to international tribunals.\n\nOption A says that the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts are also common to international tribunals. That sounds plausible because international tribunals, like national courts, need guidelines on what cases they can hear.\n\nOption B states that the jurisdiction of all international tribunals is regulated by the UN Security Council. I know that some international tribunals are established by the UN, like the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia or Rwanda, and their jurisdiction might be defined by the UN Security Council. But not all international tribunals are UN tribunals. For example, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is part of the UN, but there are other tribunals like the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) or the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which might have different governing bodies.\n\nOption C suggests that international tribunals share some, but not all, of the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts. This seems reasonable because while there might be some overlap, international tribunals deal with different subjects and have different constitutive frameworks.\n\nOption D says that the jurisdiction of international tribunals is dictated solely by their founding treaties. This also makes sense because international tribunals are generally created by treaties, and their jurisdiction is defined therein.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, international tribunals are established by agreements among states, usually through treaties. These treaties outline the tribunal's functions, including its jurisdiction. So, in that sense, their jurisdiction is dictated by their founding treaties, which aligns with option D.\n\nHowever, national courts also have jurisdiction based on laws and constitutions. So, there might be some similar principles in how jurisdiction is defined, but the contexts are different.\n\nOption A seems too broad. While there might be some common principles, international tribunals operate in a different legal realm\u2014public international law\u2014compared to national courts, which operate under domestic law.\n\nOption B is too narrow because not all international tribunals are regulated by the UN Security Council. For instance, the European Court of Human Rights is governed by the Council of Europe, not the UN.\n\nOption C acknowledges that there are some shared principles but also recognizes that there are differences, which seems like a balanced view.\n\nOption D emphasizes that the jurisdiction is solely dictated by the founding treaties, which is generally true, but it might not account for developments in customary international law or other sources of international law that could influence a tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is C because it acknowledges both the similarities and differences between the jurisdictional principles of national courts and international tribunals.\n\nLet me consider some examples.\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has jurisdiction based on the consent of states, either through optional clause declarations or special agreements. This is similar to how national courts might have jurisdiction based on the parties' consent or territorial links. So, there are overlapping principles.\n\nHowever, the ICJ also has jurisdiction based on the UN Charter and the treaties that the states have ratified, which is different from national courts.\n\nSimilarly, international arbitral tribunals, like those constituted under the Permanent Court of Arbitration or the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), have jurisdiction based on the parties' submission to arbitration, often through a treaty or a contract clause. This is akin to contractual jurisdiction in national courts but operates within the framework of international law.\n\nOn the other hand, national courts' jurisdiction is often mandatory for certain types of cases within their territory, whereas international tribunals generally require state consent to exercise jurisdiction.\n\nSo, while there are some common principles, like jurisdiction based on consent or territorial links, there are also significant differences due to the nature of international law and the sovereignty of states.\n\nTherefore, option C seems the most accurate: international tribunals share some, but not all, of the jurisdictional principles applicable to national courts.\n\nI think that's the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
