                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about reviewing financial statements, especially focusing on leases that should be capitalized but aren't. So, the scenario is that an accountant is looking at a nonissuer's financial statements and finds several leases that according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), should be capitalized, but they're not. The accountant thinks this is material, meaning it's significant enough to affect the users' understanding of the financial statements. And management isn't willing to capitalize these leases.\n\nNow, the accountant has to decide how to modify the standard review report because of this issue. There are four options provided, and we need to figure out which one is the most appropriate.\n\nOption A suggests issuing an adverse opinion because of the departure from GAAP. But wait, in a review engagement, accountants typically don't issue opinions. Reviews are less extensive than audits, and in reviews, accountants express limited assurance, not an opinion. So, issuing an adverse opinion might not be the right approach here.\n\nOption B says to express no assurance of any kind on the entity's financial statements. That seems pretty severe. If the accountant doesn't express any assurance, it might mislead users into thinking that the financial statements haven't been reviewed at all, which isn't the case. The accountant has performed a review engagement, so completely withdrawing assurance doesn't seem appropriate.\n\nOption C suggests emphasizing that the financial statements are for limited use only. Now, in some cases, accountants might include a paragraph highlighting the limited distribution or use of the financial statements, but this doesn't directly address the specific issue of the uncapitalized leases.\n\nOption D proposes disclosing the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report. This seems like a reasonable approach. By disclosing the issue in the report, the accountant is bringing attention to the fact that there's a material departure from GAAP, which is important for the users of the financial statements to know.\n\nBut let's think a bit more deeply. In a review engagement, when an accountant becomes aware of a material departure from GAAP and management refuses to adjust the financial statements, the accountant needs to modify the review report to communicate this issue.\n\nAccording to the AICPA's Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS), when an accountant becomes aware of a material modification that should have been made to the financial statements but was not, and management refuses to make the adjustment, the accountant should consider the implications for the review report.\n\nIn such cases, the accountant may need to include an Other-Matter paragraph to describe the departure from GAAP. This paragraph would explain the nature of the departure and its potential effect on the financial statements.\n\nSo, option D seems aligned with this requirement. By disclosing the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph, the accountant is fulfilling the responsibility to communicate the issue to the users of the financial statements.\n\nOption A, issuing an adverse opinion, is more akin to an audit scenario, not a review engagement. In reviews, accountants don't express an opinion; they express limited assurance that no material modifications should be made to the financial statements for them to be in conformity with GAAP.\n\nOption B, expressing no assurance, would essentially nullify the review engagement, which isn't the appropriate response to a specific material misstatement.\n\nOption C, emphasizing limited use, doesn't directly address the GAAP departure related to leases.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable course of action is to disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nd disclosure of the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report"
