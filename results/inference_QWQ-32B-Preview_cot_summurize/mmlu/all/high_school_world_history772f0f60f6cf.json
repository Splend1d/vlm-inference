                    "text": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following later developments would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. It's about a passage from Mao Zedong in 1955, talking about agricultural cooperation in China. Mao is expressing concerns about the growing capitalist tendencies in the countryside, with some peasants becoming rich while others remain poor. He sees this polarization as a threat to the worker-peasant alliance and proposes socialist transformation of agriculture to address it.\n\nThe question is asking which later development would most undermine the hopes expressed in the second-to-last line of the passage. That line says, \"carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.\" So, Mao hopes that through cooperation and eliminating individual and rich-peasant economies, all rural people will prosper together.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China.\n\nThis seems positive, but the question is about undermining Mao's hopes. Special Economic Zones were introduced later, under Deng Xiaoping, focusing on market-oriented reforms and opening up to foreign trade. While this brought economic growth, it moved away from Mao's socialist vision towards a more capitalist approach. However, it's not directly related to agriculture or the countryside, so its impact on Mao's hopes might be indirect.\n\nB. Political friction with the Soviet Union pushed China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War.\n\nThis is about foreign policy and alliances during the Cold War. While it's an important development, it doesn't directly relate to the agricultural policies or the well-being of rural people in China. So, it might not directly undermine Mao's hopes about rural prosperity.\n\nC. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry.\n\nThis option directly relates to the agricultural policies Mao was advocating. It mentions cooperatives and emphasis on countryside steel production, which likely refers to the Great Leap Forward, a campaign launched by Mao in the late 1950s. The Great Leap Forward aimed to rapidly transform China from an agrarian economy into a socialist society through the establishment of people's communes and rural steel furnaces. However, it's widely recognized that this campaign led to the Great Chinese Famine, causing millions of deaths due to starvation.\n\nSo, if cooperatives and emphasizing countryside steel production brought famine and poverty, this directly contradicts Mao's hope that cooperation would make all rural people increasingly well off together. Instead, it resulted in suffering and deprivation.\n\nD. Opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaopeng were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThis refers to political purges during the Cultural Revolution, where Mao and his allies targeted perceived opponents within the party. While this had significant political consequences, it doesn't directly address the economic well-being of rural people. So, while it's an important development, it might not directly undermine Mao's hopes about rural prosperity.\n\nComparing these options, C seems to be the one that most directly undermines Mao's hopes. It suggests that the very policies he advocated\u2014cooperation and emphasis on rural industrialization\u2014led to famine and poverty, which is the opposite of his goal of making all rural people increasingly well off together.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
