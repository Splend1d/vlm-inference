Proximal means closer to the body, and distal means farther away.\n\nStarting from the hand, the first bone that connects to the metacarpal is the proximal phalanx. Then, connected to that is the middle phalanx, and finally, the last bone is the distal phalanx, which is at the tip of the finger.\n\nSo, the order should be proximal, middle, distal.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Proximal phalynx, middle phalynx, distal phalynx.\n\nB. Distal phalynx, middle phalynx, proximal phalynx.\n\nC. Middle phalynx, distal phalynx, proximal phalynx.\n\nD. Distal phalynx, proximal phalynx, middle phalynx.\n\nOption A matches the order I thought: proximal, middle, distal.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. In some fingers, like the thumb, there's only two phalanges, but the middle finger has three. So, proximal is first, connected to the metacarpal, then middle, then distal.\n\nYes, I think A is correct.\n\nSpelling note: It's actually \"phalanx\" for singular and \"phalanges\" for plural, but maybe there's a typo in the options.\n\nBut among the given choices, A seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
