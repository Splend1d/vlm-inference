                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to figure out which of these options the Hopewell culture didn't lack. So, they had a complex rank society but weren't a state. That means they probably had some social hierarchy but didn't have all the trappings of a state-level society.\n\nOption A is \"formal government.\" If they weren't a state, they probably didn't have a formal government like states do, with centralized authority and bureaucracy. So, they likely lacked a formal government.\n\nOption B is \"monumental earthworks.\" I think the Hopewell are known for their earthworks, like mounds and geometric earthworks. So, they probably had monumental earthworks. Maybe this is the one they didn't lack.\n\nOption C is \"urban centers.\" States usually have urban centers, but if the Hopewell weren't a state, maybe they didn't have true urban centers. Perhaps they had large settlements, but not full-fledged cities.\n\nOption D is \"a permanent military.\" States often have standing armies, but if the Hopewell weren't a state, they probably didn't have a permanent military.\n\nSo, considering that, the Hopewell likely had monumental earthworks, but lacked a formal government, urban centers, and a permanent military. Therefore, the answer should be B, monumental earthworks.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The question says they lacked all of the following elements EXCEPT one. So, except for one thing, they lacked the others. In other words, they had one of these elements.\n\nGiven that, and my earlier thoughts, monumental earthworks seem to be the one they had. The Hopewell are famous for their earthworks, so it makes sense that this is the exception.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about each option again.\n\nFormal government: Probably lacked it, as they weren't a state.\n\nMonumental earthworks: Had them.\n\nUrban centers: Maybe didn't have true urban centers.\n\nPermanent military: Likely didn't have a permanent military.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, monumental earthworks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
