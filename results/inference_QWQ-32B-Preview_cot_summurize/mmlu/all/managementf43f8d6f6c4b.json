                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's asking about a concept that makes sure one person doesn't have to do all the work by themselves. The options are work specialization, work design, work schedule, and work shift. I need to figure out which one of these terms refers to distributing the workload so that no single individual is overloaded.\n\nFirst, let's look at work specialization. I think work specialization is when tasks are divided into specific jobs, and each person is assigned a particular part of the task. So, for example, in a assembly line, each worker has a specific job to do. This might help in not overburdening one person because the work is divided among many people. But I'm not sure if that's exactly what the question is asking.\n\nNext, work design. This seems broad. Work design is about how tasks are arranged and structured within an organization. It could include things like job roles, responsibilities, and how tasks are combined. Maybe work design encompasses work specialization, but I'm not sure if it specifically refers to preventing one person from carrying the whole burden.\n\nThen there's work schedule. This is about when people work, like their hours, shifts, etc. While a good schedule can help distribute workload over time, it might not directly address the issue of one person carrying the entire task.\n\nLastly, work shift. This is related to the timing of work, like day shift, night shift, etc. Again, shifts are about dividing work over time, but not necessarily about dividing the task among different people.\n\nHmm, maybe work specialization is the answer because it divides tasks among different people, so no one has to do everything. But I feel like work design might also be relevant because it's about how tasks are structured and assigned.\n\nLet me think differently. The question is about ensuring that one individual does not carry the burden of a whole work task. So, it's about distributing the workload among multiple people.\n\nWork specialization seems to fit because it's about dividing tasks into smaller, specific jobs that different people can do. This way, no one person has to do the entire task.\n\nWork design, on the other hand, is a broader concept that includes work specialization, but it might also involve other aspects like job enrichment or job rotation.\n\nWork schedule and work shift are more about when people work rather than how tasks are divided among people.\n\nSo, perhaps work specialization is the most appropriate answer here.\n\nBut wait, I recall that work design can also involve distributing tasks to avoid overburdening any single individual. For example, job sharing or cross-functional teams can be part of work design.\n\nMaybe work design is a better answer because it's more comprehensive and includes strategies specifically aimed at preventing workload imbalance.\n\nLet me check some definitions to be sure.\n\nWork specialization: This is the division of labor, where tasks are divided into smaller tasks, and each person is assigned a specific task.\n\nWork design: This involves deciding how to combine different tasks into jobs, considering factors like skill requirements, task variety, and workload balance.\n\nWork schedule: This is about arranging work hours and shifts for employees.\n\nWork shift: This refers to a specific period of time during which a group of employees works.\n\nBased on these definitions, work design seems to be the most appropriate answer because it includes strategies for balancing workload among employees, whereas work specialization is just one aspect of work design.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Work design.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
