I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: I took my three-year-old to the theater to see Sleeping Beauty. Is there anything morally wrong with taking a young child to see a movie like Sleeping Beauty? Well, Sleeping Beauty is a classic children's tale, often considered appropriate for young children. So, taking a three-year-old to see it seems pretty normal and not morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: I walked past a pond and saw a drowning child, at which time I jumped into the pond and my expensive shoes got tarnished. So, here, someone sees a child drowning and jumps in to save them, but their shoes get damaged in the process. Is there anything morally wrong with that? It seems like the person is doing something good by trying to save the child, even if it means damaging their shoes. In fact, jumping in to save a drowning child is probably the morally right thing to do, especially since not doing so could lead to the child's harm or death.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, nothing seems clearly morally wrong. Taking a child to see Sleeping Beauty is fine, and jumping into a pond to save a drowning child is praiseworthy, even if it damages your shoes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let me think again. In the first scenario, is there any possible way that taking a three-year-old to see Sleeping Beauty could be morally wrong? Well, it depends on the version of Sleeping Beauty and its content. Some adaptations might have scary parts or themes that could be upsetting for a three-year-old, but generally, the classic tale is considered appropriate for young children.\n\nIn the second scenario, jumping in to save the child is clearly the right thing to do. The damage to the shoes is just a consequence of a good action.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
