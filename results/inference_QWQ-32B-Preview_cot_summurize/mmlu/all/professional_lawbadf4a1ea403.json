                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about discharge for impracticability in sales contracts. So, the scenario is that a seller is claiming that something has happened making it impractical to perform the sales contract, and we need to figure out which statement among the options isn't correct regarding this discharge.\n\nFirst off, it's important to understand what impracticability means in the context of contracts. Impracticability is a doctrine that allows for the discharge of contractual duties when performance becomes excessively difficult or costly due to unforeseen circumstances, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nOption A says: \"The problem must not have been caused by the fault of the party seeking to invoke the defense.\" This sounds right because if the party themselves caused the problem, they shouldn't be allowed to escape their contractual obligations. It's about external, unforeseeable events.\n\nOption B: \"A price increase is sufficient for discharge.\" Hmm, this seems\u53ef\u7591. Generally, mere increases in cost aren't enough to make performance impractical. Contracts are meant to allocate risks, and price fluctuations are often anticipated. So, this might not be correct.\n\nOption C: \"The failure to excuse performance would result in grave injustice.\" This aligns with the principles of impracticability. The doctrine is meant to prevent hardship and injustice when circumstances change dramatically beyond what was anticipated.\n\nOption D: \"The impracticality must go to a basic assumption on which the contract was made.\" This is also consistent with the doctrine. Impracticability often relates to fundamental assumptions that were made at the time of contracting, and if those are undermined, it might justify discharge.\n\nSo, considering these points, option B seems to be the one that's not correct. Price increases alone aren't typically sufficient to discharge a party from their contractual obligations due to impracticability.\n\nTo double-check, let's think about it this way: If a seller agrees to sell goods at a certain price, and then the market price goes up, does that mean they can refuse to sell? Usually, no, because that's a risk they took on by entering into the contract. Impracticability is more about situations like unforeseen events that make performance impossible or excessively burdensome, not just more expensive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: A price increase is sufficient for discharge.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
