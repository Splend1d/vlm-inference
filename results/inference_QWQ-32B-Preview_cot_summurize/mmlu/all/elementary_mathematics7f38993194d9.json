                    "text": "So I need to find the product of 0.07 and 5.8. That means I have to multiply these two numbers together. I'm a bit rusty on multiplying decimals, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, I'll ignore the decimals and just multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. So, 7 times 58. Let's see, 7 times 50 is 350, and 7 times 8 is 56. Adding those together, 350 plus 56 is 406. So, 7 times 58 is 406.\n\nNow, I need to account for the decimals. In 0.07, there are two decimal places, and in 5.8, there is one decimal place. So, in total, there are three decimal places that I need to account for in my answer.\n\nStarting from the right, I'll count three places to the left in 406. So, starting from the units place: 6 is units, 0 is tens, 4 is hundreds. So, placing the decimal point three places to the left would make it 0.406.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider the multiplication again. Sometimes I get confused with the decimal places.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the numbers in terms of fractions. 0.07 is the same as 7 hundredths, or 7/100, and 5.8 is the same as 58 tenths, or 58/10.\n\nSo, multiplying them together: (7/100) * (58/10) = (7 * 58) / (100 * 10) = 406 / 1000 = 0.406.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, the product is 0.406.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.406\n\nB. 0.0406\n\nC. 4.06\n\nD. 40.6\n\nIt seems like A is the correct answer. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nMaybe I'll try another method, like using the decimal points directly.\n\nFirst, multiply 0.07 by 5.8.\n\nI can write it as:\n\n     0.07\n\n   x 5.8\n\n   -------\n\nLet's multiply 7 hundredths by 5.8.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 0.07 as 7 x 10^-2, and 5.8 as 58 x 10^-1.\n\nSo, (7 x 10^-2) * (58 x 10^-1) = 7*58 * 10^(-2 + -1) = 406 * 10^-3 = 0.406.\n\nAgain, I get 0.406.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the places step by step:\n\nMultiply 0.07 by 5.8.\n\nFirst, ignore the decimals and multiply 7 by 58, which is 406.\n\nNow, since 0.07 has two decimal places and 5.8 has one decimal place, the total number of decimal places in the product should be 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSo, 406 with three decimal places is 0.406.\n\nYes, that seems consistent across different methods.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 0.406.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
