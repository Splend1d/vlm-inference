                    "text": "So I've got this question about Johnson's salary and some fringe benefits he received from ABC Co. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Johnson earned a salary of $100,000. That's straightforward; it's part of his gross income. But he also received group term life insurance that covers twice his salary. So, the insurance coverage is for $200,000 ($100,000 x 2).\n\nNow, the question is about how much Johnson must include in his gross income regarding this insurance benefit. I know that some fringe benefits are taxable, and it seems like this might be one of them.\n\nThe problem mentions the annual IRS established uniform cost of insurance, which is $2.76 per $1,000 of coverage. So, to find out the cost of the insurance benefit, I need to calculate how much $2.76 per $1,000 is for $200,000 of coverage.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many thousands are in $200,000:\n\n$200,000 / $1,000 = 200\n\nSo, there are 200 thousands in $200,000.\n\nNow, multiply that by the cost per thousand:\n\n200 x $2.76 = $552\n\nSo, the cost of the insurance benefit is $552.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how much of this Johnson must include in his gross income. I recall that for group term life insurance, up to a certain amount of coverage is excluded from income, and anything above that must be included.\n\nI think the exclusion limit is $50,000 of coverage, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check that.\n\nAssuming the exclusion limit is $50,000, then any coverage above that would be subject to inclusion in income based on the uniform cost.\n\nSo, in this case, the coverage is $200,000, so the excess over $50,000 is $150,000.\n\nNow, calculate the cost for the $150,000 excess coverage.\n\nFirst, find out how many thousands are in $150,000:\n\n$150,000 / $1,000 = 150\n\nThen, multiply by the uniform cost per thousand:\n\n150 x $2.76 = $414\n\nSo, Johnson must include $414 in his gross income for the insurance benefit.\n\nAdding that to his salary:\n\n$100,000 + $414 = $100,414\n\nLooking back at the options, C. $100,414 seems to match.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the exclusion limit. I thought it was $50,000, but maybe it's different.\n\nUpon checking, I recall that for group term life insurance, up to $50,000 of coverage is excluded from income. Any coverage above $50,000 is included in income based on the uniform cost.\n\nSo, yes, my calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. $100,414.\n\nAlternatively, if there is no exclusion limit, then the entire cost of $552 would be included in income, making the gross income $100,552, which is option D.\n\nBut based on my knowledge, there is an exclusion for the first $50,000 of coverage.\n\nLet me see if the question provides any information about the exclusion limit. It doesn't specify, so perhaps I need to rely on general tax rules.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exclusion limit has changed, or perhaps it's different for this scenario.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nIf the entire cost of the insurance benefit is $552, and there is an exclusion for the first $50,000, which would be:\n\n$50,000 / $1,000 = 50\n\n50 x $2.76 = $138\n\nThen, the excluded amount is $138, and the included amount is $552 - $138 = $414.\n\nAdding that to the salary: $100,000 + $414 = $100,414.\n\nThat reinforces my previous calculation.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because I thought only the excess over the exclusion limit is included in income, not sure if I should be subtracting the excluded amount from the total cost.\n\nWait, no. The excluded amount is the cost of the first $50,000 of coverage, which is not included in income. The excess coverage's cost is included in income.\n\nSo, in this case, the cost for the first $50,000 is $138, which is excluded. The cost for the excess $150,000 is $414, which is included in income.\n\nTherefore, Johnson must include $414 in his gross income, making the total $100,414.\n\nThus, the correct answer is C. $100,414.\n\nAlternatively, if there is no exclusion, the entire $552 would be included, leading to $100,552, which is option D.\n\nBut based on tax rules, there is an exclusion for the first $50,000 of group term life insurance coverage.\n\nHence, option C seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
