                    "text": "So I have this problem: compute the product (20)(-8) in Z_26. The options are A. 0, B. 1, C. 11, and D. 22. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what Z_26 is. Z_26 is the set of integers modulo 26. That means all operations are done and then the result is taken modulo 26.\n\nSo, I have to multiply 20 by -8 and then find the result modulo 26. Let's start by multiplying 20 and -8.\n\n20 * -8 = -160\n\nNow, I need to find -160 modulo 26. Modulo operation finds the remainder when one number is divided by another. But since -160 is negative, I need to handle it carefully.\n\nOne way to think about negative modulo is to add the modulus (26 in this case) enough times to get a positive remainder.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the property that a \u2261 b mod m if m divides (a - b).\n\nSo, let's find a positive equivalent of -160 modulo 26.\n\nFirst, I can find how many times 26 fits into -160.\n\n-160 \u00f7 26 = -6.1538...\n\nSo, the integer division would be -7 because we round down for negative numbers.\n\nWait, no. In programming, negative division is tricky because of how the floor works. But in mathematics, when dividing negative numbers, we have to be careful about the direction of the inequality.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nI know that a mod m = a - m * floor(a/m)\n\nSo, for a = -160 and m = 26,\n\nfloor(-160 / 26) = floor(-6.1538...) = -7 (since floor rounds down to the nearest integer)\n\nSo, -160 mod 26 = -160 - 26*(-7) = -160 + 182 = 22\n\nTherefore, -160 \u2261 22 mod 26\n\nSo, the product (20)(-8) in Z_26 is 22.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 22 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, 20 * -8 = -160\n\nThen, -160 mod 26\n\nI used the formula a mod m = a - m*floor(a/m)\n\n-160 - 26*floor(-160/26)\n\n-160/26 = -6.1538...\n\nfloor(-6.1538...) = -7\n\nSo, -160 - 26*(-7) = -160 + 182 = 22\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can add 26 repeatedly to -160 until I get a positive number less than 26.\n\n-160 + 26*7 = -160 + 182 = 22\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, some people might prefer to compute the positive equivalent first.\n\n20 mod 26 = 20\n\n-8 mod 26 = 18 (since -8 + 26 = 18)\n\nThen, (20 * 18) mod 26\n\n20 * 18 = 360\n\n360 mod 26\n\n360 \u00f7 26 = 13.8461...\n\n26 * 13 = 338\n\n360 - 338 = 22\n\nAgain, 22.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I get 22.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
