                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 47-year-old man who came in 12 hours after having a severe occipital headache and a stiff neck. Let's break this down step by step to figure out what's most likely going on.\n\nFirst, the symptoms: severe occipital headache and stiff neck. Occipital means it's at the back of the head, and a stiff neck along with that is notable. He didn't have any other symptoms, which is important to note because sometimes other symptoms can point us in different directions.\n\nHe has a history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He's on hydrochlorothiazide for his blood pressure and ranitidine for his GERD. His vitals are: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse 100/min, and blood pressure 160/90 mm Hg. So his blood pressure is a bit high, which isn't surprising given his history of hypertension.\n\nOn examination, he's oriented to person, place, and time, which is good. His neck has decreased range of motion due to pain, which makes sense with a stiff neck. Neurological exam doesn't show any focal findings, meaning there aren't any specific areas of the brain or nervous system that seem to be affected.\n\nNow, the options given are:\n\nA. Cluster headache\n\nB. Meningitis\n\nC. Migraine\n\nD. Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\nLet's consider each one.\n\nStarting with A, cluster headache. Cluster headaches are known for being severe, often around one eye, and can cause tearing, nasal congestion on the same side. They usually occur in clusters, hence the name, over a period of time. However, they typically don't cause neck stiffness, which is a key symptom here. So, probably not the most likely diagnosis.\n\nOption B is meningitis. Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, which are the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It's often caused by infection, like bacterial or viral. Symptoms typically include fever, headache, and neck stiffness, along with possibly altered mental status, sensitivity to light, etc. In this case, the patient has a normal temperature and is oriented, which is good, but the headache and neck stiffness are concerning. However, meningitis often presents with fever, which isn't present here, so it's possible but maybe less likely.\n\nOption C is migraine. Migraines can cause severe headaches, often with pulsating pain, and can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. However, neck stiffness isn't a typical feature of migraines. So, while migraines can be severe, the neck stiffness makes this less likely.\n\nOption D is subarachnoid hemorrhage. This is bleeding in the subarachnoid space, which is the area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. It's a medical emergency and can present with a sudden, severe headache, often described as \"the worst headache of my life,\" and can be accompanied by neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes altered mental status. Given that the patient had a sudden onset of a severe headache and neck stiffness, this is a serious consideration.\n\nNow, considering his age, 47, and his history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for subarachnoid hemorrhage, this becomes even more concerning. The fact that his blood pressure is elevated now also aligns with that possibility.\n\nComparing all the options, subarachnoid hemorrhage seems to fit the symptoms best, especially given the sudden onset of a severe headache and neck stiffness, in a patient with hypertension.\n\nMeningitis is also a possibility, but the absence of fever makes it less likely, although it's still possible, especially in some cases of meningitis where fever may not be prominent.\n\nCluster headaches don't typically cause neck stiffness, and migraines usually don't present with neck stiffness as a primary symptom.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to confirm this with appropriate tests, such as a CT scan of the head, possibly with contrast, and lumbar puncture if necessary, to look for blood in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
