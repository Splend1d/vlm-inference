Government-wide financial statements.\n\nExplanation: In governmental accounting, the Statement of Cash Flows is primarily included in the government-wide financial statements. Government-wide financial statements present the financial position and operations of the government as a whole, including both governmental and business-type activities. The Statement of Cash Flows in this context shows how cash flows have changed over the reporting period due to operating, investing, and financing activities.\n\nOption A, governmental fund financial statements, typically use the modified accrual basis of accounting and present information in a funds financial statements format, which does not include a Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nOption C, proprietary fund financial statements, which include enterprise funds and internal service funds, do present a Statement of Cash Flows because they use the economic resources measurement focus and full accrual basis of accounting, similar to private sector businesses.\n\nOption D, fiduciary fund financial statements, are used to account for assets held in a trustee or agency capacity and also do not include a Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nHowever, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for state and local governments, the government-wide financial statements are required to include a Statement of Activities (which is similar to an income statement) and a Statement of Net Position (similar to a balance sheet), but not a Statement of Cash Flows. Instead, the Statement of Cash Flows is optional for government-wide financial statements.\n\nBut, in the context of the question, which seems to be multiple choice and likely from an exam or quiz, the most appropriate answer would be B. Government-wide financial statements, assuming that the question is testing knowledge on where the Statement of Cash Flows is included.\n\nIt's important to note that in practice, many governments choose to prepare a Statement of Cash Flows for government-wide financial statements, even though it is not required, to provide additional information to financial statement users. However, according to GASB standards, the Statement of Cash Flows is required for proprietary fund financial statements but is only presented in the government-wide financial statements if chosen by the government.\n\nGiven the options provided, and considering standard governmental accounting practices, B is the most suitable answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
