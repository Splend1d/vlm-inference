                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about the differences in vocalizations between deaf and normal children. So, I need to think about how their sounds develop over time.\n\nOption A says that during the second half of the first year, normal children increase the variety of sounds, whereas deaf children do not. Hmm, that seems plausible because normal hearing children are exposed to a lot of speech sounds and they start to imitate them. Deaf children might not hear those sounds, so their vocalizations might not change in the same way.\n\nOption B claims that deaf children vocalize more than normal children in the first 6 months, then less thereafter. I'm not sure about that. Maybe deaf children vocalize differently, but I don't know if they vocalize more in the beginning and less later on.\n\nOption C states that normal children babble extensively, whereas deaf infants do not. Babbling is a stage in language development where infants make repetitive sounds. I think normal hearing children do babble a lot, but what about deaf children? Do they babble less or differently?\n\nOption D says that during the first 6 months, normal children increase their range of sound output more than deaf children do. Again, normal hearing children are exposed to a variety of sounds, so they might develop a wider range of sounds earlier.\n\nLet me think about this. I know that hearing is crucial for speech development because children learn by imitating the sounds they hear. So, deaf children might have different patterns of vocalization.\n\nFrom what I recall, normal hearing children start babbling around 6-7 months, with a lot of repetitive sounds like \"ba ba ba\" or \"ma ma ma.\" Deaf children, on the other hand, might not babble as much or their babbling might be different because they don't hear the typical speech sounds.\n\nAlso, during the second half of the first year, normal hearing children continue to expand their repertoire of sounds, moving towards more speech-like sounds. Deaf children might not show the same progression because they don't have auditory feedback.\n\nOption A seems consistent with that. It says that normal children increase the variety of sounds in the second half of the first year, while deaf children do not. That makes sense.\n\nOption B says deaf children vocalize more in the first 6 months and then less thereafter. I'm not sure about that. Maybe deaf children vocalize differently, but I don't know if they vocalize more in the beginning and less later on. I think it's possible, but I'm not certain.\n\nOption C says normal children babble extensively, whereas deaf infants do not. That aligns with what I know. Deaf children might babble, but it's often less frequent or different in quality compared to hearing children.\n\nOption D says that in the first 6 months, normal children increase their sound output range more than deaf children. Again, that makes sense because hearing children are exposed to and imitating a wider range of sounds.\n\nBut the question is asking for the difference in vocalizations. Maybe multiple options are correct, but I have to choose one.\n\nIf I had to pick one, I would go with option C: normal children babble extensively, whereas deaf infants do not. This seems like a clear difference in their vocalization patterns.\n\nHowever, option A also seems valid. Maybe both are correct, but I need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is C because it directly addresses a key difference in the vocalization behavior between deaf and normal children.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
