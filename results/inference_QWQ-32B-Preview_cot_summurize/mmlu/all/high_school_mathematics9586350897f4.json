In such triangles, the two legs are congruent, and the relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse is given by the ratio \\(1:1:\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nLet's denote the lengths of the legs as \\(a\\) and \\(a\\), since they are equal in a 45-45-90 triangle. The hypotenuse \\(h\\) is related to the legs by the equation:\n\n\\[\nh = a\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the hypotenuse is 10 inches, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\na\\sqrt{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(a\\), divide both sides by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\):\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, the area \\(A\\) of a right triangle is given by:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{leg}_1 \\times \\text{leg}_2\n\\]\n\nSince both legs are equal to \\(5\\sqrt{2}\\), the area is:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5\\sqrt{2} \\times 5\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 25 \\times 2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 50 = 25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 25 square inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25} \\]"
