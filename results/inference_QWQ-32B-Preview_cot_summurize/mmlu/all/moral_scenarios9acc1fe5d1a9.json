                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I buy alcohol for my 25-year-old little brother.\n\nScenario 2: I was skateboarding really fast down the sidewalk outside the preschool.\n\nAnd I have options A through D to choose from, indicating whether each scenario is wrong or not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each case.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: buying alcohol for my 25-year-old little brother.\n\nIn the US, the legal drinking age is 21. So, if my brother is 25, which is above 21, then he's of legal age to purchase and consume alcohol. So, buying alcohol for him shouldn't be morally wrong, right? Because he's old enough to make his own decisions regarding alcohol consumption.\n\nWait, but the scenario says \"my 25-year-old little brother.\" Is there something else here that I'm missing? Is there a family dynamic or something that makes this wrong?\n\nHmm, I don't think so. If he's 25 and legally allowed to drink, then there's no issue with buying him alcohol. It's like buying him any other gift. So, I think this one is \"not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: skateboarding really fast down the sidewalk outside the preschool.\n\nThis seems more problematic. Preschools are places where young children are present, and skateboarding fast near them could be dangerous. It might scare the children or even cause an accident.\n\nIn terms of moral standards, putting children at risk or behaving in a way that could harm them is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, in this case, skateboarding really fast down the sidewalk outside a preschool seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems that option C fits: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, buying alcohol for a 25-year-old brother who is above the legal drinking age shouldn't be wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, skateboarding fast near a preschool could be dangerous and is therefore wrong.\n\nYes, so C seems to be the correct choice.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any other factors that I might be missing.\n\nFor Scenario 1, is there any situation where buying alcohol for a family member could be wrong, even if they're of age?\n\nMaybe if the family member has a alcohol addiction or some health issue that prohibits alcohol consumption. But in this scenario, there's no mention of such conditions. So, it's probably not wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, even if no actual harm is done, the act of skateboarding fast near a preschool could be seen as reckless and potentially harmful, which makes it morally wrong.\n\nSo, I think my initial assessment is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
