                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a landlord who owns a two-story house and leases it fully furnished to a tenant for 10 years. Towards the end of the seventh year, a storm blows off some roof shingles, causing a leak. The tenant notices the leak but doesn't do anything about it. A month later, another storm causes more water to leak through the roof, damaging the parquet floors in two rooms below. Now, the landlord is suing the tenant to recover for the damage to the floors, and we need to figure out who is most likely liable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the responsibilities of both the landlord and the tenant in this scenario. In general, in a\u79df\u8d41\u5173\u7cfb, there are certain obligations for both parties regarding the maintenance and repair of the property.\n\nOption A says the landlord is liable because he was under an implied obligation to keep the premises in a habitable condition. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think there's a principle in landlord-tenant law that requires landlords to maintain the property in a habitable condition, which includes making necessary repairs to keep it safe and habitable. But in this case, the storm damaged the roof, and the tenant didn't report it or make any repairs. So, is the landlord still responsible for not maintaining the habitability?\n\nWell, typically, the landlord is responsible for maintaining the property, but there might be exceptions based on the tenant's actions or inactions. If the tenant fails to notify the landlord of necessary repairs, that could affect liability. Also, depending on the terms of the lease, the responsibilities might be allocated differently.\n\nOption B says the landlord is liable because he was under an affirmative obligation to deliver the premises in a reasonable state of repair. That seems similar to option A. Delivering the premises in a reasonable state of repair is usually part of the landlord's obligations at the beginning of the lease term. But in this case, the damage occurred during the lease term due to a storm, which is an external event. So, maybe this isn't directly applicable.\n\nOption C says the landlord is liable because of a contractual obligation under the lease to make all necessary repairs during the term of the lease. This could be possible if the lease specifically states that the landlord is responsible for all repairs. However, in many standard leases, there are provisions that outline who is responsible for different types of repairs. It's possible that the landlord is responsible for structural repairs, while the tenant is responsible for minor repairs or maintenance.\n\nOption D says the tenant is liable because a tenant for years is obligated to make such ordinary repairs on the leased property. This seems interesting. In some jurisdictions, tenants do have certain obligations to maintain the property and perform ordinary repairs, especially in longer-term leases. If the tenant fails to do so and damage results, they could be held liable.\n\nLet me think about this again. The storm blew off some shingles, causing a leak. The tenant noticed the leak but didn't make any repairs. A month later, another storm caused more damage to the floors. So, the question is, whose responsibility was it to fix the roof after the first storm?\n\nIf the lease doesn't specify, I need to look at general principles of landlord-tenant law. In many places, landlords are responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the property, including the roof. Tenants are usually responsible for maintaining the property in its original condition and reporting any necessary repairs to the landlord.\n\nIn this case, the tenant noticed the leak but didn't report it or attempt to fix it. If the tenant had reported the leak promptly, the landlord could have repaired the roof in time to prevent the further damage caused by the second storm.\n\nSo, was the tenant obligated to report the leak or even to make temporary repairs to prevent further damage?\n\nI recall that tenants generally have a duty to mitigate damages, meaning they should take reasonable steps to prevent further damage once they know about a problem. In this case, perhaps the tenant should have covered the leak temporarily or at least notified the landlord immediately.\n\nIf the tenant fails to do so, they might be liable for any additional damage that results from their inaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the landlord might argue that the initial damage was due to a natural event (the storm), and they should have been the ones to repair it promptly.\n\nBut considering that the tenant had possession of the property and noticed the damage, there might be an expectation for them to take some action.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA and B both point to the landlord's obligations, while C specifies a contractual obligation for the landlord to make all repairs, and D assigns responsibility to the tenant for making ordinary repairs.\n\nGiven that the damage was caused by a storm, which is generally considered a natural event, and that the tenant didn't report or attempt to fix the leak, it seems that the tenant might be liable for not taking steps to mitigate the damage.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that roofs are typically considered part of the structural elements of the property, and landlords are often responsible for maintaining them.\n\nPerhaps the answer lies in the specific terms of the lease. If the lease states that the landlord is responsible for all repairs, then the landlord would be liable for not fixing the roof in time. But if the lease puts the responsibility on the tenant for certain repairs, then the tenant could be liable.\n\nSince the question doesn't provide the specific terms of the lease, I need to rely on general principles.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, tenants are expected to notify landlords of necessary repairs and to not cause damage to the property through neglect.\n\nIn this scenario, the tenant knew about the leak but didn't report it or fix it, leading to further damage. Therefore, it's possible that the tenant could be held liable for the additional damage.\n\nOption D seems to align with this, stating that a tenant for years is obligated to make such ordinary repairs on the leased property.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both parties share some responsibility, but the question asks for the party upon whom liability would most likely be imposed.\n\nConsidering that the tenant had notice of the leak and didn't take action, and that the additional damage occurred as a result of their inaction, it seems that the tenant could be held liable.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is D: the tenant, because a tenant for years is obligated to make such ordinary repairs on the leased property.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
