                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Pine Co. purchasing land and building a factory. Let's see what all the costs are and figure out how much they should capitalize for the completed factory building.\n\nFirst, they bought the land for $450,000. Then, there was an existing building on the site that they had to razed before construction could begin. The cost of razing that old building was $60,000. Also, there were some title insurance and legal fees to purchase the land, totaling $30,000. The architect's fees came to $95,000, and finally, the new building construction cost was $1,850,000.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the amount Pine should capitalize as the cost of the completed factory building. Capitalizing costs in this context means determining the total cost that should be recorded as the asset's value on the balance sheet.\n\nI remember that in accounting, when you acquire land and build a structure on it, certain costs are capitalized as part of the building's cost, while others are capitalized as part of the land's cost.\n\nLet's list out all the costs again:\n\n1. Land purchase: $450,000\n\n2. Cost of razing old building: $60,000\n\n3. Title insurance and legal fees: $30,000\n\n4. Architect's fees: $95,000\n\n5. New building construction cost: $1,850,000\n\nI need to figure out which of these costs should be included in the building's capitalization.\n\nFirst, the land purchase cost is for the land itself. The cost of razing the old building might be considered a cost to get the land ready for its intended use, which could be either capitalized as part of the land's cost or the building's cost. I think it's more related to the land preparation.\n\nTitle insurance and legal fees are typically capitalized as part of the land's cost.\n\nArchitect's fees are usually capitalized as part of the building's cost because they are directly related to the design of the building.\n\nThe new building construction cost is obviously part of the building's cost.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Land cost: $450,000 + $60,000 (razing) + $30,000 (title and legal) = $540,000\n\n- Building cost: $95,000 (architect's fees) + $1,850,000 (construction) = $1,945,000\n\nTherefore, the amount to capitalize for the completed factory building should be $1,945,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $2,005,000\n\nB. $1,975,000\n\nC. $1,945,000\n\nD. $1,910,000\n\nIt seems that C is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nIs the cost of razing the old building part of the land's cost or the building's cost? Some might argue that it's a necessary expense to prepare the land for the new building, so it should be part of the land's cost. On the other hand, perhaps it's considered a demolition cost associated with the new building.\n\nI think the general principle is that costs to prepare the land for its intended use, such as clearing the land, are capitalized as part of the land's cost. So, the $60,000 for razing the old building should be included in the land's cost.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation stands: building cost is $95,000 + $1,850,000 = $1,945,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the razing cost should be allocated between the land and the building based on some criteria, but I don't think that's necessary here. The problem seems straightforward.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is C. $1,945,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nc. $1,945,000"
