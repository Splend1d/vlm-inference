                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: find the area bounded by the parabola y = x\u00b2 and the lines y = 1 and y = 9. The options are A. 8, B. 84/3, C. 64\u221a2/3, and D. 104/3. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize what's going on. I have a parabola y = x\u00b2, which opens upwards with its vertex at the origin. Then there are two horizontal lines at y = 1 and y = 9. So, the area bounded by these should be between these two lines along the y-axis.\n\nI think the best way to find this area is to integrate with respect to y, since the boundaries are given in terms of y. So, I'll express x in terms of y.\n\nFrom y = x\u00b2, solving for x gives x = \u00b1\u221ay. So, for each y, the horizontal width at that height is from x = -\u221ay to x = \u221ay, which means the total width is 2\u221ay.\n\nNow, the area element would be a thin horizontal strip of width 2\u221ay and height dy. So, the area dA = 2\u221ay dy.\n\nTo find the total area between y = 1 and y = 9, I'll integrate this from y = 1 to y = 9.\n\nSo, A = \u222b from 1 to 9 of 2\u221ay dy.\n\nLet's compute that integral.\n\nFirst, 2\u221ay is the same as 2 y^(1/2).\n\nThe integral of y^(1/2) is (2/3) y^(3/2).\n\nSo, integral of 2 y^(1/2) is 2 * (2/3) y^(3/2) = (4/3) y^(3/2).\n\nNow, evaluate this from y = 1 to y = 9.\n\nAt y = 9: (4/3)(9)^(3/2) = (4/3)(27) = 36.\n\nAt y = 1: (4/3)(1)^(3/2) = 4/3.\n\nSo, the area A = 36 - 4/3 = 108/3 - 4/3 = 104/3.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 104/3 matches this.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nStarting again:\n\nIntegral of 2\u221ay dy from y = 1 to y = 9.\n\n2\u221ay = 2 y^(1/2)\n\nIntegral of y^(1/2) is (2/3) y^(3/2)\n\nSo, 2 * (2/3) y^(3/2) = (4/3) y^(3/2)\n\nEvaluated from 1 to 9:\n\nAt y = 9: (4/3)(27) = 36\n\nAt y = 1: (4/3)(1) = 4/3\n\nDifference: 36 - 4/3 = 108/3 - 4/3 = 104/3\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider integrating with respect to x, but that might be more complicated since the boundaries are given in terms of y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find the area by finding the x-values where y = 1 and y = 9.\n\nFor y = 1, x = \u00b11\n\nFor y = 9, x = \u00b13\n\nSo, the area would be the integral from x = -3 to x = 3 of (9 - 1) dx, but that doesn't make sense because the area is not a rectangle.\n\nWait, that's not correct. The area is bounded by y = x\u00b2, y = 1, and y = 9.\n\nSo, for each x, the height is from y = 1 to y = 9, but only where y = x\u00b2 is between y = 1 and y = 9.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The area is between the parabola and the lines y = 1 and y = 9.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of it as the area where y ranges from 1 to 9, and for each y, x ranges from -\u221ay to \u221ay.\n\nSo, again, integrating with respect to y seems preferable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the area by subtracting the area under y = 1 from the area under y = 9 between the appropriate x-limits.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe area under y = 9 from x = -3 to x = 3 is 6*9 = 54.\n\nThe area under y = 1 from x = -1 to x = 1 is 2*1 = 2.\n\nBut then, the area between y = 1 and y = 9 would be 54 - 2 = 52, but that doesn't match 104/3, so maybe this approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to integrate the difference between y = 9 and y = x\u00b2 from x = -3 to x = 3, and then subtract the area between y = 1 and y = x\u00b2 from x = -1 to x = 1.\n\nSo, area = [integral from -3 to 3 of (9 - x\u00b2) dx] - [integral from -1 to 1 of (1 - x\u00b2) dx]\n\nLet's compute that.\n\nFirst, integral from -3 to 3 of (9 - x\u00b2) dx.\n\nAntiderivative is 9x - (1/3)x\u00b3.\n\nEvaluated from -3 to 3:\n\nAt x = 3: 27 - 9 = 18\n\nAt x = -3: -27 + 9 = -18\n\nDifference: 18 - (-18) = 36\n\nNow, integral from -1 to 1 of (1 - x\u00b2) dx.\n\nAntiderivative is x - (1/3)x\u00b3.\n\nEvaluated from -1 to 1:\n\nAt x = 1: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\n\nAt x = -1: -1 + 1/3 = -4/3\n\nDifference: 2/3 - (-4/3) = 2/3 + 4/3 = 2\n\nSo, total area = 36 - 2 = 34\n\nBut this doesn't match the earlier result of 104/3, which is approximately 34.666, but it's not exactly 34.\n\nWait, 104/3 is approximately 34.666, but 34 is 102/3, so there's a discrepancy of 2/3.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in this approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the area is symmetric about the y-axis, so I can calculate the area for x >= 0 and then double it.\n\nSo, for x >= 0, y ranges from 1 to 9, and x = \u221ay.\n\nSo, area for x >= 0 is integral from y = 1 to y = 9 of \u221ay dy.\n\nCompute that integral.\n\nIntegral of \u221ay dy is (2/3) y^(3/2)\n\nEvaluated from 1 to 9:\n\nAt y = 9: (2/3)(27) = 18\n\nAt y = 1: (2/3)(1) = 2/3\n\nDifference: 18 - 2/3 = 54/3 - 2/3 = 52/3\n\nThen, total area is twice that, so 104/3, which matches the first method.\n\nSo, the second method gives 34, but the first and third methods give 104/3.\n\nI'm getting conflicting results, which means I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nLet me check the second approach again.\n\nArea = [integral from -3 to 3 of (9 - x\u00b2) dx] - [integral from -1 to 1 of (1 - x\u00b2) dx]\n\nFirst integral: integral from -3 to 3 of (9 - x\u00b2) dx\n\nAntiderivative: 9x - (1/3)x\u00b3\n\nAt x = 3: 27 - 9 = 18\n\nAt x = -3: -27 + 9 = -18\n\nDifference: 18 - (-18) = 36\n\nSecond integral: integral from -1 to 1 of (1 - x\u00b2) dx\n\nAntiderivative: x - (1/3)x\u00b3\n\nAt x = 1: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3\n\nAt x = -1: -1 + 1/3 = -4/3\n\nDifference: 2/3 - (-4/3) = 2/3 + 4/3 = 2\n\nSo, area = 36 - 2 = 34\n\nBut earlier, using the first method, I got 104/3, which is approximately 34.666, and using the third method, also 104/3.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the second approach is incorrect because when y goes from 1 to 9, x goes from -3 to 3, but within that, y = x\u00b2 is below y = 9, but above y = 1 only from x = -3 to x = -1 and from x = 1 to 3.\n\nBetween x = -1 and x = 1, y = x\u00b2 is below y = 1, so the area there is between y = 1 and y = 9, not between y = x\u00b2 and y = 9.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to split the area into two parts: from x = -3 to x = -1, and from x = 1 to 3, the area is between y = 9 and y = x\u00b2, and from x = -1 to x = 1, the area is between y = 9 and y = 1.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nThe area bounded by y = x\u00b2, y = 1, and y = 9 is the region where y goes from max(y = x\u00b2, y = 1) up to y = 9.\n\nBut y = x\u00b2 is below y = 1 for |x| < 1, and above y = 1 for |x| > 1.\n\nSo, the area can be split into two parts:\n\n1. From x = -1 to x = 1, y goes from y = 1 to y = 9.\n\n2. From x = -3 to x = -1 and from x = 1 to x = 3, y goes from y = x\u00b2 to y = 9.\n\nSo, total area = area from x = -1 to x = 1 of (9 - 1) dx + area from x = -3 to x = -1 of (9 - x\u00b2) dx + area from x = 1 to 3 of (9 - x\u00b2) dx.\n\nLet's compute these.\n\nFirst, area from x = -1 to x = 1 of 8 dx:\n\nThis is 8 * (1 - (-1)) = 8 * 2 = 16.\n\nSecond, area from x = -3 to x = -1 of (9 - x\u00b2) dx:\n\nThis is the same as from x = 1 to 3 due to symmetry.\n\nSo, compute integral from x = 1 to 3 of (9 - x\u00b2) dx.\n\nAntiderivative: 9x - (1/3)x\u00b3\n\nAt x = 3: 27 - 9 = 18\n\nAt x = 1: 9 - 1/3 = 26/3\n\nDifference: 18 - 26/3 = 54/3 - 26/3 = 28/3\n\nSince the area from x = -3 to x = -1 is the same, total for both is 2 * (28/3) = 56/3.\n\nSo, total area = 16 + 56/3 = 48/3 + 56/3 = 104/3.\n\nAh, now this matches the previous result.\n\nSo, the mistake in the earlier second approach was not properly accounting for the different regions where y = x\u00b2 is above or below y = 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct area is indeed 104/3, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{104}{3}} \\]"
