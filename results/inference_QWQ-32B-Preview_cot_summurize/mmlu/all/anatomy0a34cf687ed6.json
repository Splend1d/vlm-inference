I remember that when we chew bread for a long time, it starts to taste sweet. I think that's because saliva breaks down starch into simpler sugars. So, maybe the enzyme in saliva acts on starches.\n\nLet me double-check. I think the enzyme is called amylase. Yes, salivary amylase breaks down starch into maltose, which is a simpler sugar. That makes sense because starch is a complex carbohydrate, and breaking it down makes it easier to digest.\n\nNow, proteins are broken down by enzymes called proteases, but I think those are more active in the stomach with gastric juice. Fats are digested by lipases, which are present in both pancreatic and intestinal juices. Minerals are inorganic substances and are usually already in a form that can be absorbed without needing enzymatic action.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be A. Starches.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Is there any enzyme in saliva that acts on proteins? I've heard that there's a protein in saliva called lysozyme that has antibacterial properties, but I don't think it's an enzyme that breaks down nutrients.\n\nPerhaps, just to be thorough, I should consider if saliva has any role in breaking down proteins. From what I recall, the main enzymatic action in saliva is carbohydrate digestion, specifically starch.\n\nAlso, considering that infants produce more saliva when they start teething, which is before they start eating solid foods, but even then, the primary enzyme is still amylase for starch digestion.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident with A. Starches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
