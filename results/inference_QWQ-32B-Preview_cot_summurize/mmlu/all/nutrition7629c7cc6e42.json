                    "text": "I've got this question about what elite athletes should consume during really long and intense workouts, like more than 2.5 hours. The options are:\n\nA. 60 grams of glucose per hour\n\nB. 60 grams of glucose plus fructose per hour\n\nC. 90 grams of glucose per hour\n\nD. 90 grams of glucose plus fructose per hour\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand why hydration and nutrition are important during prolonged exercises. I know that during intense workouts, athletes sweat a lot and burn a lot of calories, so they need to replace fluids and carbohydrates to maintain performance.\n\nI remember that carbohydrates are stored in the body as glycogen, mainly in the liver and muscles. During exercise, these stores get used up, and if the exercise is long enough, like over 90 minutes, the stores can be depleted, leading to fatigue and decreased performance. That's why athletes need to replenish their carbs during exercise.\n\nNow, about the types of carbs. Glucose is a simple sugar that's quickly absorbed by the body. Fructose is another simple sugar, but it's absorbed differently. I think combining glucose and fructose can increase the total carb absorption because they use different transport mechanisms in the gut.\n\nI've read somewhere that the body can absorb up to about 60 grams of carbs per hour, but I'm not sure if that's just for glucose or for a mixture of carbs.\n\nLet me think about option A: 60 grams of glucose per hour. That seems like a standard amount. Many sports drinks recommend around that amount.\n\nOption B is 60 grams of glucose plus fructose per hour. So that's a total of 120 grams of carbs per hour. Is that too much?\n\nOption C is 90 grams of glucose per hour, which is higher than option A.\n\nOption D is 90 grams of glucose plus fructose per hour, totaling 180 grams of carbs per hour. That seems like a lot.\n\nI need to recall what sports nutrition experts recommend. I think that recent studies suggest that consuming a mixture of carbs, like glucose and fructose, can allow for higher absorption rates compared to just one type of carb.\n\nI think the body can handle up to around 90 grams of carbs per hour if it's a mixture of glucose and fructose. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider that during prolonged high-intensity exercise, athletes need not only carbs but also fluids to stay hydrated. So whatever they consume should also help with fluid absorption.\n\nI think that fructose might help with fluid absorption because it can pull water into the intestines through osmosis, which might aid in hydration.\n\nBut I also need to consider that consuming too much sugar during exercise can cause gastrointestinal issues like stomach cramps or diarrhea. So there's a limit to how much an athlete can tolerate.\n\nI recall that some sports drinks have a combination of carbs to optimize absorption without causing GI distress.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D seems the highest in carb intake, which might not be feasible for all athletes.\n\nOption B is a mix of glucose and fructose, totaling 120 grams per hour, which might be more than what some athletes can handle.\n\nOption A is just glucose, 60 grams per hour, which is a common recommendation, but maybe not optimal for the highest performers.\n\nOption C is 90 grams of glucose per hour, which might be pushing the limit of absorption for glucose alone.\n\nI think that the best answer would be option B: 60 grams of glucose plus fructose per hour. This combines two types of carbs, which can be absorbed via different pathways, potentially allowing for higher overall carb intake without overwhelming the digestive system.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the exact amounts. Maybe I should look up some research on this.\n\nI remember that a study by Jeukendrup in 2014 suggested that consuming multiple transportable carbs can increase oxidation rates beyond the traditional 60 grams per hour.\n\nAnother study I recall recommended up to 90 grams per hour of a mixture of carbs for elite endurance athletes.\n\nGiven that, option D seems attractive, but it's the highest in carb intake, and I'm not sure if that's practical or advisable for all athletes.\n\nPerhaps the answer depends on the individual athlete and their tolerance. Some athletes can handle higher intakes without issues, while others might struggle.\n\nBut since the question is about what elite athletes should ideally consume, perhaps it's assuming that they have optimized their nutrition and can tolerate higher intakes.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the ideal is still 60 grams per hour, and higher intakes don't provide additional benefits.\n\nI need to think about the physiology behind carb absorption.\n\nCarbs are absorbed in the small intestine via specific transporters. Glucose uses the SGLT1 transporter, while fructose uses the GLUT5 transporter. By consuming both, you can potentially double the absorption rate.\n\nBut I also need to consider that even with multiple transporters, there's a limit to how fast the intestines can absorb carbs during exercise.\n\nI think that 90 grams per hour is pushing it, and maybe 60 grams is more realistic.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the context of the exercise. The question specifies prolonged high-intensity exercise over 2.5 hours. In such cases, athletes are expending a lot of energy and may need higher carb intakes to maintain performance.\n\nMoreover, during high-intensity exercise, the body may be able to handle higher carb intakes because blood flow to the intestines is maintained, allowing for better absorption.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nMaybe I should think about what professional sports organizations recommend.\n\nFor instance, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has guidelines on nutrition for exercise.\n\nI think they recommend consuming 30-60 grams of carbs per hour during endurance events, but that might be for moderate-intensity exercise.\n\nFor high-intensity exercise, the needs might be higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recommendation has changed, and they now suggest higher intakes.\n\nI should also consider that consuming carbs during exercise not only replaces energy stores but also helps maintain blood sugar levels, which is crucial for brain function and exercise performance.\n\nAdditionally, carbs can have a central nervous system effect, reducing perceived exertion and allowing athletes to perform better.\n\nGiven all that, I think that option D, 90 grams of glucose plus fructose per hour, might be the answer, assuming that the mixture allows for higher absorption and utilization.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not sure if that's practically achievable or advisable.\n\nMaybe I should consider that combining different types of carbs allows for higher oxidation rates, and therefore, higher intakes can be beneficial.\n\nIf that's the case, then option D would be the best choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option B is sufficient, and going beyond that doesn't offer additional benefits.\n\nI need to make a decision based on the knowledge I have.\n\nGiven that elite athletes likely have optimized their nutrition and can tolerate higher carb intakes, and that consuming a mixture of carbs can increase absorption, I think that option D, 90 grams of glucose plus fructose per hour, would be the ideal consumption during prolonged high-intensity exercise.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because that seems like a lot, and I haven't come across specific recommendations that high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option B is more appropriate.\n\nI think I need to trust my understanding of sports nutrition and choose option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
