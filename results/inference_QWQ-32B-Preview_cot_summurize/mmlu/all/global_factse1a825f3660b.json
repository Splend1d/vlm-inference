                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about school desegregation and approval ratings in the South compared to the rest of the U.S. at its peak. The options are A. 80%, B. 40%, C. -40%, and D. -80%. I need to figure out what the approximate difference in approval was between the South and the rest of the country.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"approval of school desegregation\" means. School desegregation is the process of integrating schools that were previously segregated, usually by race. In the United States, this was a major issue in the mid-20th century, particularly after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which declared that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the difference in approval ratings between the South and the rest of the U.S. at its peak. The South has a complex history with desegregation, often resisting it more than other regions. So, I can infer that approval in the South might have been lower compared to the rest of the country.\n\nBut I need to find the approximate difference. The options include positive and negative percentages, which might indicate whether the South had higher or lower approval ratings than the rest of the U.S. Positive percentages would mean higher approval in the South, and negative percentages would mean lower approval in the South compared to the rest of the country.\n\nGiven the historical context, it's likely that approval in the South was lower than in the rest of the U.S., so the difference would be negative. Therefore, options C and D (-40% and -80%) might be more plausible.\n\nHowever, I don't have specific data on approval ratings at the time. I need to think about what I know about public opinion during that period.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, there was significant resistance to desegregation in the South, with events like the integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, requiring federal intervention. There were also movements like Massive Resistance in Virginia and other Southern states to oppose desegregation.\n\nOn the other hand, in the rest of the U.S., there was likely more support for desegregation, although there was still opposition in some areas.\n\nSo, if approval in the South was lower, the difference would be negative. For example, if approval in the rest of the U.S. was 70% and in the South was 30%, the difference would be -40%.\n\nBut I need to consider if the difference was as high as 80%. That would mean, for example, 90% approval in the rest of the U.S. and 10% in the South.\n\nGiven the historical context, a difference of 40% seems more plausible. But I need to think carefully.\n\nLet me consider some possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1:\n\n- Rest of U.S.: 60% approval\n\n- South: 20% approval\n\nDifference: -40%\n\nScenario 2:\n\n- Rest of U.S.: 80% approval\n\n- South: 0% approval\n\nDifference: -80%\n\nScenario 3:\n\n- Rest of U.S.: 70% approval\n\n- South: 30% approval\n\nDifference: -40%\n\nScenario 4:\n\n- Rest of U.S.: 50% approval\n\n- South: 10% approval\n\nDifference: -40%\n\nLooking at these scenarios, a difference of -40% appears more reasonable, but I have to consider if there were times when approval in the South was extremely low compared to the rest of the country.\n\nI recall that in the immediate aftermath of the Brown v. Board decision, there was widespread resistance in the South, with some polls showing very low support for desegregation.\n\nFor example, in 1956, a Gallup poll showed that only about 4% of white Southerners favored immediate desegregation, while about 57% favored waiting until public opinion was ready, and 36% favored keeping segregation forever.\n\nIn contrast, in the rest of the country, there was more support for desegregation. For instance, in the same poll, 50% of non-Southern whites favored immediate desegregation, 38% favored waiting, and 10% favored keeping segregation.\n\nSo, in this poll, the approval for immediate desegregation was 4% in the South and 50% in the rest of the U.S., which would make a difference of -46%.\n\nAnother poll in 1963 showed that in the South, only 21% of whites favored school desegregation, while in the rest of the country, 61% favored it. That would make a difference of -40%.\n\nOver time, approval in the South increased, but it still lagged behind the rest of the country.\n\nGiven these data points, a difference of around -40% seems plausible.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there was a time when the difference was as high as -80%.\n\nIf, for example, approval in the rest of the U.S. was 80% and in the South was 0%, that would be a difference of -80%.\n\nWhile it's possible that in some years or specific polls such a difference existed, the examples I've considered suggest a difference more around -40%.\n\nMoreover, it's important to note that these are hypothetical scenarios, and I don't have the exact data for the \"peak\" difference.\n\nThe question asks for the approximate difference at its peak, so I need to think about when the difference might have been the greatest.\n\nProbably, immediately after the Brown v. Board decision, in the mid-1950s, the difference was quite stark, with very low approval in the South and higher approval elsewhere.\n\nOver time, approval in the South may have increased, reducing the difference.\n\nTherefore, the peak difference likely occurred in the mid-to-late 1950s.\n\nGiven that, and considering the poll data I recall, a difference of around -40% seems more accurate than -80%.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option C. -40%.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other factors that might have influenced approval ratings.\n\nFor example, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 may have shifted opinions, but I believe that by the mid-1960s, approval in the South was still lower than in the rest of the country, albeit perhaps with some increase from the earlier years.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to consider that these polls measured public opinion among whites, as black opinions would have been overwhelmingly in favor of desegregation.\n\nHowever, given that the majority of the population in the South was white at the time, their opinions would have had a greater impact on policy and public discourse.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the historical context and the poll data I've considered, the approximate difference in approval of school desegregation between the South and the rest of the U.S. was around -40%, so I would select option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
