                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about school safety strategies recommended by the National Association of School Psychologists, or NASP. The options are:\n\nA. Expelling a student right after a minor disciplinary issue.\n\nB. Putting in place a strict code of conduct with zero tolerance for certain behaviors.\n\nC. Telling parents that the school is safe.\n\nD. Setting up a school safety and response team.\n\nI need to figure out which one NASP actually recommends as a best practice for improving school safety.\n\nFirst, I should probably think about what NASP is. I know it's a professional organization for school psychologists. Their goal is to promote the health and education of children and youth. So, they would have guidelines and recommendations on how to create safe and supportive school environments.\n\nOption A is about expelling students immediately after a minor disciplinary infraction. That seems pretty harsh. Expulsion is usually a last resort for more serious offenses, not minor ones. I doubt NASP would recommend that as a best practice for improving school safety. It might even backfire, making students feel unwelcome and possibly pushing them towards more negative behaviors.\n\nOption B is about implementing a strict student code of conduct, like a zero-tolerance policy. Zero tolerance means that certain behaviors automatically result in severe punishment, regardless of the circumstances. These policies have been around for a while, but there's a lot of debate about their effectiveness. Some research suggests that zero-tolerance policies don't necessarily make schools safer and can lead to higher rates of suspension and expulsion, particularly affecting students of color and those with disabilities. So, I'm not sure if NASP would endorse this as a best practice.\n\nOption C is about communicating to parents that the school environment is safe. While it's important for schools to keep parents informed and build trust, simply stating that the school is safe might not be enough. Schools should also be transparent about their safety measures, policies, and any incidents that occur. So, while communication is key, just assuring parents that the school is safe without backing it up with actions might not be sufficient.\n\nOption D is about creating a school safety and response team. This sounds like a more comprehensive approach. A safety and response team would likely include various stakeholders such as administrators, teachers, school psychologists, law enforcement, and possibly even students and parents. Such a team can develop and implement strategies for preventing violence, promoting a positive school climate, providing support to students, and preparing for emergencies. This seems aligned with NASP's focus on creating safe and supportive learning environments.\n\nLet me see if I can find more specific information about NASP's recommendations. I recall that NASP has resources on their website about school safety. Maybe I can look that up.\n\nUpon checking NASP's website, I find that they do have a lot of resources on school safety. One of their key positions is that a multi-tiered system of supports, which includes prevention, intervention, and crisis response, is essential for creating safe schools. They emphasize the importance of a comprehensive approach that addresses the social, emotional, and behavioral needs of students.\n\nNASP also critiques zero-tolerance policies, stating that they can disrupt the learning process and do not necessarily lead to improved safety. Instead, they recommend strategies that promote positive behavior, such as social-emotional learning, restorative practices, and mental health supports.\n\nRegarding expulsions, NASP likely views them as a last resort for severe behaviors, not for minor infractions. Expelling students for minor issues could potentially exacerbate problems and fail to address the root causes of the behavior.\n\nCommunicating with parents is important, but NASP would probably stress the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration rather than just assuring them that the school is safe.\n\nGiven all this, option D, creating a school safety and response team, aligns best with NASP's recommendations. Such a team can implement a multi-tiered system of supports, address various aspects of school safety, and ensure a comprehensive approach to creating a safe and supportive school environment.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
