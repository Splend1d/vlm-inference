Hmm, is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, using eggs from a nest might be problematic. In the US, there are laws and ethical considerations about taking things from nature, especially eggs from nests. Many birds are protected by law, and taking their eggs could be illegal.\n\nAlso, ethically, interfering with wildlife in this way might be considered wrong because it disrupts the natural environment and could harm the birds.\n\nSo, from both a legal and ethical standpoint, taking eggs from a nest and using them for dinner might be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I voted for the man who was a criminal.\"\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. Voting for someone who has a criminal past\u2014assuming they have served their time and are allowed to run for office\u2014is a personal choice.\n\nIn a democracy, voters have the right to choose who they think is best suited for office, regardless of their past. Some people might consider it wrong to vote for a criminal, but others might believe in second chances or think that the person's policies outweigh their past mistakes.\n\nMoreover, in the US, once someone has served their time for a crime, they are allowed to participate in elections, including running for office.\n\nSo, is voting for a criminal morally wrong? It's subjective and depends on personal ethics. Some might see it as wrong, but others wouldn't.\n\nGiven that, I would say that according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, voting for a criminal isn't necessarily clearly morally wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems more clearly morally wrong because of the potential legal and ethical issues involved in taking eggs from a nest, whereas Scenario 2 is more of a personal choice without clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
