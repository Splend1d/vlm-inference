                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Which of the following algorithms has running time \u0398(n\u00b2) in the worst case but \u0398(n log n) on average?\" and the options are A. Bubblesort, B. Mergesort, C. Heapsort, D. Quicksort.\n\nOkay, first I need to recall the time complexities of these sorting algorithms.\n\nStarting with A. Bubblesort:\n\n- I know that Bubblesort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order, repeating this process until the list is sorted.\n\n- In the worst case, which is when the array is sorted in reverse order, Bubblesort has to make n passes through the array, each time making n-1 comparisons, so that's O(n\u00b2).\n\n- On average, it's also O(n\u00b2), because even if the array is partially sorted, it still has to go through all the elements multiple times.\n\nSo, Bubblesort has \u0398(n\u00b2) in both worst case and average case. That doesn't match the question's requirement of \u0398(n log n) on average.\n\nNext, B. Mergesort:\n\n- Mergesort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them.\n\n- I think Mergesort has a time complexity of \u0398(n log n) in all cases: best, average, and worst.\n\n- It doesn't have a worse case of \u0398(n\u00b2); it's consistently \u0398(n log n).\n\nSo, Mergesort doesn't fit the description either.\n\nOption C. Heapsort:\n\n- Heapsort uses a binary heap data structure to sort the elements.\n\n- It builds a max heap and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element to build the sorted array.\n\n- Heapsort also has a time complexity of \u0398(n log n) in all cases: best, average, and worst.\n\n- Similar to Mergesort, it doesn't have a worst-case of \u0398(n\u00b2); it's always \u0398(n log n).\n\nSo, Heapsort doesn't match the required characteristics.\n\nNow, option D. Quicksort:\n\n- Quicksort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.\n\n- The time complexity of Quicksort depends on how well the pivot is chosen.\n\n- In the worst case, if the pivot is always the smallest or largest element, Quicksort degenerates to O(n\u00b2). For example, if the array is already sorted and we always pick the first or last element as the pivot.\n\n- On average, Quicksort has a time complexity of \u0398(n log n). This is because the pivot roughly divides the array into two equal parts, leading to a recurrence relation that solves to \u0398(n log n).\n\n- So, Quicksort has \u0398(n\u00b2) in the worst case and \u0398(n log n) on average.\n\nThat matches exactly what the question is asking for.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nBubblesort: \u0398(n\u00b2) worst and average.\n\nMergesort: \u0398(n log n) in all cases.\n\nHeapsort: \u0398(n log n) in all cases.\n\nQuicksort: \u0398(n\u00b2) worst case, \u0398(n log n) average case.\n\nYes, Quicksort is the only one that fits the description.\n\nI think the answer is D. Quicksort.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
