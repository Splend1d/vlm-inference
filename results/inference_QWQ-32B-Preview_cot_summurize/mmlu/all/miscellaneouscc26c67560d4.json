Moe Howard and Shemp Howard were biological brothers, while Larry Fine was Moe's cousin and Shemp's second cousin. Curly Howard, who was Moe and Shemp's younger brother, was also Larry's second cousin. So, in this group, they were all connected through family ties.\n\nHowever, if we consider the dynamics and the time they spent in the group, perhaps Shemp could be seen as slightly less integrated compared to the others, especially since he replaced Curly in some films after Curly's health issues. But in terms of blood relations, they were all interconnected.\n\nSo, to answer the question directly: None of them was completely unrelated to the others, as they were all connected through family ties, either as brothers or cousins.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None of the above}} \\]"
