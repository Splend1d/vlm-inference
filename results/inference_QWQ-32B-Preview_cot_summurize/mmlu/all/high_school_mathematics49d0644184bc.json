                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a theater group with eight members, out of which four are females. That means there must be four males, right? The play has one female lead, one male lead, and three different roles that can be played by either gender. We need to find out how many ways there are to assign these roles.\n\nFirst, let's identify the number of choices for the female lead. Since there are four females, there are 4 possible choices for the female lead.\n\nNext, for the male lead, there are four males, so there are 4 possible choices for the male lead.\n\nNow, after assigning the female and male leads, we have six members left (since two have already been assigned to leads). These six members can play the three remaining roles, and the roles are different, so the order in which we assign them matters.\n\nThe number of ways to assign three different roles to six members is the number of permutations of six members taken three at a time. That's calculated as 6P3, which is 6! / (6-3)! = 6! / 3! = (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!) / 3!) = 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 = 120.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to assign all the roles should be the product of the number of choices for each step:\n\nTotal ways = (choices for female lead) \u00d7 (choices for male lead) \u00d7 (permutations for the three remaining roles)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal ways = 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 120 = 16 \u00d7 120 = 1920.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, we could think of it as first choosing the female lead (4 choices), then choosing the male lead (4 choices), and then assigning the three remaining roles to any of the remaining six members, considering that the roles are distinct.\n\nYes, that matches what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of it as selecting one female for the female lead, one male for the male lead, and then selecting three others from the remaining six for the other roles, considering the permutations since the roles are different.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\nChoose 1 female out of 4: C(4,1) = 4\n\nChoose 1 male out of 4: C(4,1) = 4\n\nChoose 3 members out of the remaining 6: C(6,3) = 20\n\nAnd since the three roles are different, we need to arrange these three members in those roles, which is 3! = 6 ways.\n\nSo, total ways would be: 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 6 = 16 \u00d7 120 = 1920.\n\nWait, that's the same answer as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut let's see why the other options are there. Option A is 640, which is 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 40, but I don't see where 40 would come from. Maybe if someone miscalculated the permutations.\n\nOption B is 720, which is 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 45, or something like that. Doesn't seem to match any obvious mistake I can think of.\n\nOption C is 8, which is way off.\n\nOption D is 1920, which is what I got.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps someone might think that after choosing the leads, there are five members left for three roles, but that wouldn't make sense because if you have eight total, and you've assigned two to leads, that leaves six for the remaining roles.\n\nWait, maybe someone would do 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 = 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 120 = 1920, which is the same as what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the three remaining roles could be any of the eight members, but that can't be right because two have already been assigned to leads.\n\nWait, but that's incorrect because once leads are assigned, those people can't be assigned to other roles.\n\nSo, yes, it's definitely 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 120 = 1920.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 1920.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1920} \\]"
