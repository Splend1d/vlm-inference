The deed recited that the title was conveyed to the three siblings \"as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" One of the sisters, during the lifetime of all three, conveyed an \"undivided one-third interest\" to a third party. The third party died, leaving a will that bequeathed her one-third interest to her son. Is the son's ownership interest enforceable in the face of the claim by the two non-selling sisters that they own 100% of the property pursuant to the law regarding joint tenancies?\n\nA. No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\nB. Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\nC. Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\nD. No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure this out. So, there's a father who gave a piece of land to his three daughters using something called a warranty deed. The deed says they own it as \"joint tenants with the right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common.\" Okay, so they own it together, and if one dies, the others get her share.\n\nNow, one of the sisters sold an \"undivided one-third interest\" to someone else while all three were still alive. Then, this third party died and left her one-third to her son in her will. The question is, can the son enforce his ownership against the other two sisters who say they own 100% because of the joint tenancy.\n\nLet me think about joint tenancies. I know that in a joint tenancy, the owners have four main rights: unity of time, title, interest, and possession. That means they all own equal shares, acquired at the same time, with the same document, and have the same rights to possess the whole property.\n\nOne key feature is the right of survivorship. So, if one joint tenant dies, her share automatically goes to the surviving joint tenants, without going through probate.\n\nBut here, one of the sisters sold her share to a third party. Does that break the joint tenancy? I think it might. I've heard of something called \"severance\" of the joint tenancy, which can happen when one joint tenant sells her interest.\n\nIf the joint tenancy is severed, then the co-owners become tenants in common, each owning a separate share that can be sold or inherited independently.\n\nSo, if the selling sister conveyed an undivided one-third interest, that might suggest that the joint tenancy was severed, and now they're tenants in common.\n\nAs tenants in common, each owner can leave their share to whoever they want in their will.\n\nSo, if the third party died and left her one-third to her son, that should be valid.\n\nTherefore, the son has a valid ownership interest in one-third of the property, and the two non-selling sisters own their original one-third each, making it 100%.\n\nBut wait, the question says the two non-selling sisters claim they own 100% pursuant to the law regarding joint tenancies. They probably argue that the sale by one sister didn't sever the joint tenancy, so the right of survivorship still applies, and when the third party died, her interest should go to the surviving joint tenants, which are the three sisters.\n\nBut if the sale severed the joint tenancy, then the third party became a tenant in common, and her will should be respected.\n\nI need to figure out whether the sale severed the joint tenancy or not.\n\nI remember that in some jurisdictions, to sever a joint tenancy, you need to take certain steps, like getting a court order or having all joint tenants agree.\n\nBut I think in many places, simply conveying your interest to someone else severs the joint tenancy.\n\nLet me check option A: \"No, because each joint tenant owns an equal and undivided interest in the whole of the property, making invalid the sister's attempted conveyance of a one-third interest.\"\n\nWait, does that mean that in a joint tenancy, you can't sell your interest? That doesn't sound right. I thought you could, but selling it would sever the joint tenancy.\n\nOption B says: \"Yes, only a will can create a joint tenancy; the deed was invalid for that purpose and resulted in a tenancy in common by operation of law.\"\n\nThat seems wrong. Deeds can certainly create joint tenancies; in fact, that's common. So, I don't think this is correct.\n\nOption C: \"Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\"\n\nThis aligns with what I was thinking earlier. The sale severs the joint tenancy, turning them into tenants in common, and then the third party can leave her share to her son.\n\nOption D: \"No, because the selling sister did not take steps to get a court order to sever the joint tenancy prior to conveying a deed to a third party.\"\n\nThis suggests that severing a joint tenancy requires a court order, which might not be the case. I think conveying your interest to someone else can automatically sever the joint tenancy.\n\nSo, based on this, I think option C is the correct answer: Yes, because the conveyance severed the joint tenancy, and the third party took a one-third interest that she could pass by will to her son.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the joint tenancy was severed by the sale, then the third party became a tenant in common with the sisters, owning one-third each. Then, when the third party died, her one-third went to her son as per her will, and the two remaining sisters keep their one-thirds.\n\nSo, the son's ownership interest is enforceable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
