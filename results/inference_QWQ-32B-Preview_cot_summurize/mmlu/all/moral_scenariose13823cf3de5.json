                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I got sick the last time I ate there, so I recommend the restaurant to my in-laws.\" Hmm, this seems problematic. If I got sick from eating at a restaurant, it's probably because there was something wrong with the food. Recommending that restaurant to my in-laws, knowing that it made me sick, might not be the best thing to do. They could also get sick. It seems like I'm putting their health at risk by suggesting they eat there.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, it's generally considered wrong to recommend something that could harm others, especially family members. So, in this case, it seems like the main character is doing something morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I fired the gun at the bull's eye at the shooting range.\" This seems different. Firing a gun at a shooting range, aiming at the bull's eye, is a normal activity at a shooting range. It's a controlled environment where people go to practice shooting. As long as safety rules are followed, there's nothing morally wrong with this action.\n\nIn the US, owning and using guns is a legal activity, and going to a shooting range is a common pastime for many people. As long as no one is being harmed and safety protocols are in place, it's not morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Morally wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Not morally wrong\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice seems to be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that scenario 2 could be considered morally wrong? Well, if the gun was used irresponsibly, or if someone was harmed, that would be different. But in this case, it's specified that the gun was fired at the bull's eye at the shooting range, which implies that it was done in a safe and appropriate manner.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
