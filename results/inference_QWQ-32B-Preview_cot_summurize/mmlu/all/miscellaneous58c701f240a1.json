                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this economics question about price floors. So, the government sets a price floor in a market for a good to do one of these things: eliminate a surplus, eliminate a shortage, help buyers, or help sellers. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a price floor is. A price floor is a minimum price that can be charged for a good. It's set by the government above the equilibrium price. So, if the equilibrium price is $10, and the government sets a price floor at $12, sellers can't sell below $12.\n\nNow, I need to think about what happens when a price floor is set above the equilibrium price. I recall that at a higher price, the quantity supplied increases because sellers are willing to supply more at a higher price. At the same time, the quantity demanded decreases because buyers are less willing to buy at a higher price. So, there's a surplus because supply exceeds demand at that price.\n\nSo, if a price floor creates a surplus, then option A, which says \"eliminate a surplus in the market,\" doesn't make sense. The price floor actually creates a surplus, doesn't eliminate it.\n\nOption B is \"eliminate a shortage in the market.\" A shortage occurs when the price is below the equilibrium price, and there's more demand than supply. But a price floor is set above the equilibrium price, which should create a surplus, not eliminate a shortage. In fact, to eliminate a shortage, you'd want to lower the price to increase supply and decrease demand, moving towards equilibrium.\n\nOption C is \"help buyers of the good.\" But if the price floor is set above the equilibrium price, buyers have to pay more for the good. That doesn't seem like it's helping buyers; it's making them pay higher prices and possibly buying less of the good because of the higher price.\n\nOption D is \"help sellers of the good.\" This makes sense because at a higher price floor, sellers can sell their goods at a higher price, which increases their revenue and profits. So, it seems like price floors are set to help sellers get a better price for their goods.\n\nBut wait, I think I should consider why the government would set a price floor. Maybe it's to protect sellers from selling below a certain price, perhaps to ensure they cover their costs or to support their income.\n\nFor example, minimum wage is a type of price floor in the labor market, set to ensure workers earn a certain amount per hour. Similarly, in agricultural markets, governments might set price floors to ensure farmers receive a minimum price for their crops, protecting them from low market prices.\n\nSo, in those cases, the price floor is set to help sellers\u2014workers or farmers\u2014get a better price for their labor or their products.\n\nBut I should also consider that while price floors can help sellers in the short term by giving them higher prices, they can also lead to surpluses, which might not be sustainable in the long run. For example, if there's a surplus of a crop because the price floor is set too high, the government might have to buy the excess supply, which can be costly.\n\nNevertheless, the primary intent of a price floor seems to be helping sellers get better prices for their goods or labor.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the correct answer is D: help sellers of the good.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
