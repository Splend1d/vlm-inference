I think the best way to approach this is to plug in each value and see which one makes the equation true.\n\nLet's start with option A, x = -1.\n\nPlugging in x = -1:\n\n5*(-1) - 5 = -5 - 5 = -10.\n\nHey, that equals -10, which is exactly what the equation says. So, x = -1 seems to be a solution.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another value that also works. I should check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption B, x = -6:\n\n5*(-6) - 5 = -30 - 5 = -35.\n\nThat's not equal to -10. So, x = -6 is not a solution.\n\nOption C, x = -4:\n\n5*(-4) - 5 = -20 - 5 = -25.\n\nAgain, not equal to -10. So, x = -4 is not a solution.\n\nOption D, x = -3:\n\n5*(-3) - 5 = -15 - 5 = -20.\n\nStill not -10. So, x = -3 isn't a solution either.\n\nLooks like only x = -1 satisfies the equation. But just to double-check, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me solve the equation properly to confirm.\n\nStarting with 5x - 5 = -10.\n\nFirst, add 5 to both sides:\n\n5x - 5 + 5 = -10 + 5,\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n5x = -5.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\n5x / 5 = -5 / 5,\n\nSo, x = -1.\n\nYes, that matches what I found earlier by plugging in the values. So, the correct answer is x = -1, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
