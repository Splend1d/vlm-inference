However, among the options provided, the closest one is A. 6000 K.\n\nBut to be precise, the Sun's surface temperature is approximately 5,778 K, which is often rounded to 5,500 degrees Celsius or 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature is determined by measuring the Sun's brightness and color, which indicate its thermal emission.\n\nOption A, 6000 K, is the closest to the actual value, but it's still slightly higher than the precise measurement. Option B, 7000 K, is even higher, and options C and D are significantly higher.\n\nIt's worth noting that different parts of the Sun have different temperatures. The core is much hotter, around 15 million degrees Celsius, while the outer atmosphere, or corona, can reach temperatures of over a million degrees. But when we talk about the surface temperature, we're referring to the photosphere, which is the visible surface of the Sun.\n\nSo, while 6000 K is a reasonable approximation, the most accurate answer is around 5778 K.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
