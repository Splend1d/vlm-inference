I remember that hemoglobin is made up of different protein chains, and there are different types of hemoglobin at different stages of life. For adults, it should be hemoglobin A, right?\n\nOption A says two alpha and two beta chains. That sounds familiar. I think in adult hemoglobin, the main type is Hb A, which has alpha and beta chains. But let me double-check.\n\nOption B mentions two alpha and two gamma chains. I think gamma chains are present in fetal hemoglobin, Hb F. So, that might not be the correct choice for adult hemoglobin.\n\nOption C has two alpha and two delta chains. Delta chains, I think, are part of hemoglobin A2, which is another type of hemoglobin in adults, but not the main one. Hb A is primarily Hb A1, which is the major form in adults.\n\nOption D says four gamma chains. That sounds like Hb Bart\u2019s, which is a type of fetal hemoglobin associated with certain genetic conditions, but not normal adult hemoglobin.\n\nSo, based on what I recall, option A seems correct. But I should make sure that Hb A indeed consists of two alpha and two beta chains.\n\nLet me think about the structure of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a tetramer, meaning it has four protein chains. In adults, the predominant form is Hb A, which is made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains. The alpha chains are encoded by genes on chromosome 16, and the beta chains are encoded by genes on chromosome 11.\n\nFetal hemoglobin, Hb F, has two alpha chains and two gamma chains, which allows it to bind oxygen more tightly, suitable for the lower oxygen levels in the fetus. But in adults, Hb F is present in very small amounts, usually less than 2%.\n\nThere's also Hb A2, which consists of two alpha chains and two delta chains, but again, this is only a small fraction of total hemoglobin in adults.\n\nSo, considering that Hb A is the major form in adults and it consists of two alpha and two beta chains, I believe the correct answer is option A.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other types of hemoglobin in adults that might fit another description. For example, there's Hb S, which is associated with sickle cell anemia, but that's a variant, not the normal form.\n\nAlso, Hb C and Hb E are other variants, but again, they are not the normal adult hemoglobin.\n\nSo, yeah, I think option A is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
