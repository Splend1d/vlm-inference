                    "text": "Let's see. So, the university sent out a survey to 120 recent graduates, and 32 didn't respond. Now, they have 88 responses, and they need to decide how to proceed with the analysis. There are four options presented, and I need to figure out which one is the best approach.\n\nOption A suggests using the 88 responses and considering that as the sample size. So, basically, ignoring the non-respondents and proceeding with the data they have. But, I think there might be a problem with that because the non-respondents might have different opinions from those who did respond. If those who didn't respond feel differently about their education, then using only the respondents could bias the results.\n\nOption B is similar to A, but it suggests using 88 as the number of responses but still considering the sample size as 120. I'm not sure about that. It seems like they're still only analyzing the 88 responses, but somehow keeping the original sample size in mind. Maybe for calculating response rates, but for the analysis itself, it's still based on 88 people.\n\nOption C is to attempt to contact the non-respondents again to get their information. That seems like a good idea because increasing the response rate would give a more representative picture of the entire sample. However, it might not be feasible or practical, especially if those 32 people are hard to reach or\u4e0d\u613f\u610f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8c03\u67e5\u3002\n\nOption D is to select 32 more graduates at random to replace the non-respondents. This could be a way to get a full sample size of 120, but it might introduce new biases because the new participants might have different experiences or opinions compared to the original non-respondents.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. The main issue here is non-response bias. If the people who didn't respond have different opinions from those who did, then the results might not accurately represent the entire group of recent graduates.\n\nOption A and B both involve using only the 88 respondents, which could lead to bias. Option C tries to reduce non-response bias by encouraging more people to respond, which is ideal, but it might not be possible to get all 32 to respond.\n\nOption D suggests replacing non-respondents with new participants, but this could introduce new biases, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best way to proceed is Option C: attempt to contact the 32 who did not respond and get the information from them. This would help increase the response rate and make the sample more representative of the entire group of recent graduates.\n\nHowever, if that's not possible, then perhaps using the 88 responses but acknowledging the potential bias in the analysis would be necessary. But among the given options, Option C seems to be the most appropriate approach.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
