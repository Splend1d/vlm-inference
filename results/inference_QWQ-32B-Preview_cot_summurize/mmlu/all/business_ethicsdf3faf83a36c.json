It's asking about the obligations of workers towards their employer, and it's based on individual contracts and wider employment laws. So, I need to think about what workers are required to do according to their contracts and the law.\n\nFirst, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Employee rights\n\nB. Employee rights\n\nC. Employer duties\n\nD. Employee duties\n\nWait, option B is repeated as \"Employee rights.\" Maybe it's a typo, and it should be \"Employer duties\" or something else. Anyway, I'll proceed with the unique options.\n\nSo, employee rights would be the benefits and protections that workers are entitled to by law or by their contract. Things like minimum wage, safe working conditions, overtime pay, and so on. But the question is about obligations, which are things that workers must do, not things they are entitled to.\n\nEmployer duties would be the responsibilities that the employer has towards the employee, such as providing a safe workplace, paying wages on time, and complying with labor laws.\n\nEmployee duties, on the other hand, are the responsibilities that the worker has towards the employer. This could include things like showing up to work on time, performing job duties to the best of their ability, following company policies, and maintaining confidentiality when necessary.\n\nGiven that, it seems like \"employee duties\" is the correct answer because it refers to the obligations of workers towards their employer.\n\nBut let's double-check. The question specifies that these obligations are based on individual contracts and wider employment laws. So, in the contract of employment, there are usually clauses that outline what the employee must do, such as duties and responsibilities related to the job. Additionally, employment laws may impose certain obligations on employees, such as the duty to act in good faith, not to disclose confidential information, and to not breach their contract.\n\nEmployee rights would be more about what the employee is entitled to, not what they must do. For example, the right to a minimum wage, the right to rest breaks, the right to a safe workplace, etc.\n\nEmployer duties are what the employer must do for the employee, such as providing a safe workplace, paying wages, providing certain benefits, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Employee duties, as they represent the obligations of workers towards their employer based on contracts and employment laws.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any overlap or if another option could be correct. But no, employee duties are clearly the responsibilities of the employee towards the employer, which aligns perfectly with the question.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
