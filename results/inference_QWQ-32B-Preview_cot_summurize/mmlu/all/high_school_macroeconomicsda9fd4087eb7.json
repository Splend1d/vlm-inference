                    "text": "Let's see what \"ceteris paribus\" means. I think it's a term used in economics and other social sciences to make analysis simpler by holding other factors constant. So, I need to choose the correct definition from these options.\n\nOption A says it's Greek for \"never changing.\" Hmm, I know that \"ceteris paribus\" is actually a Latin phrase, not Greek. So, that might not be right.\n\nOption B says it means anything can change at any time. That seems opposite to what I think ceteris paribus means. I thought it was about assuming other things stay the same.\n\nOption C says it's Latin for \"everything else remains constant.\" That sounds familiar. In economics, when we say \"ceteris paribus,\" we're usually saying \"all else being equal\" or \"holding other variables constant.\"\n\nOption D says it means \"when in equilibrium.\" Equilibrium is a state in economics where supply and demand balance, but I don't think that's what ceteris paribus means.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C seems correct. Ceteris paribus means \"everything else remains constant.\"\n\nBut let me double-check. I recall that \"ceteris paribus\" is Latin for \"other things being equal.\" It's a way to isolate the relationship between variables by assuming that other variables do not change.\n\nFor example, if we say \"ceteris paribus, an increase in price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded,\" we mean that if price increases and all other factors stay the same, then quantity demanded decreases.\n\nSo, yes, option C is the correct definition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
