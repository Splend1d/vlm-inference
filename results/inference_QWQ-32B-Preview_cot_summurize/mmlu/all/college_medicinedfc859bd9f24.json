Each nucleotide has three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar called deoxyribose, and a nitrogenous base.\n\nThe nitrogenous bases in DNA are of two types: purines and pyrimidines. Purines include adenine (A) and guanine (G), while pyrimidines include cytosine (C) and thymine (T). So, purines and pyrimidines are both part of DNA as they are the bases that pair up in the double helix.\n\nDeoxyribose is the sugar component of DNA, so that's definitely part of it.\n\nNow, amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. DNA codes for proteins, but amino acids themselves are not part of the DNA molecule.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. Purine - part of DNA\n\nB. Pyrimidine - part of DNA\n\nC. Deoxyribose - part of DNA\n\nD. Amino acid - not part of DNA\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Amino acid.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Purines and pyrimidines are the bases in DNA, deoxyribose is the sugar, and amino acids are for proteins. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
