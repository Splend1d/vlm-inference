                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about estimators and their properties. So, we have an estimator that's said to have minimum variance, and we need to figure out which statement isn't necessarily implied by that. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The probability that the estimate is a long way away from its true value is minimized.\" Hmm, minimum variance means that the estimator has the smallest spread or variability among all unbiased estimators. So, if an estimator has low variance, it means that its estimates are tightly clustered around the true value. Therefore, the probability of it being far away from the true value should be lower compared to estimators with higher variance. So, this seems like it is implied by having minimum variance.\n\nOption B: \"The estimator is efficient.\" Efficiency in estimators is often defined as achieving the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound, which is the theoretical minimum variance for an unbiased estimator. So, if an estimator has minimum variance, it's efficient. This seems directly related, so this statement is implied.\n\nOption C: \"Such an estimator would be termed 'best'.\" In statistics, especially in the context of unbiased estimators, the \"best\" estimator often refers to the one with the smallest variance. This is in line with the concept of minimum variance unbiased estimators (MVUE). So, this seems like it's also implied.\n\nOption D: \"Such an estimator will always be unbiased.\" Now, this is interesting. Minimum variance refers to having the smallest variance among similar estimators, but it doesn't necessarily specify whether the estimator is biased or unbiased. However, in the context of MVUE, the estimator is both unbiased and has the minimum variance among all unbiased estimators. But the question here says \"minimum variance\" without specifying \"unbiased.\" So, perhaps there's a catch here.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to recall the definition more carefully. The Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound provides a lower limit on the variance of unbiased estimators. So, when we talk about an estimator with minimum variance, it's usually in the context of being unbiased. But the question doesn't specify that it's unbiased.\n\nIn fact, there can be biased estimators with lower variance than unbiased estimators. For example, in some cases, introducing a small bias can lead to a significant reduction in variance, making the mean squared error (MSE) lower than that of the unbiased estimator. So, an estimator with minimum variance doesn't necessarily have to be unbiased.\n\nTherefore, statement D is not necessarily implied by having minimum variance.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about it differently. If an estimator is biased, it means that its expected value isn't equal to the true parameter value. But it can still have a very small variance. So, while bias and variance are both important aspects of an estimator's performance, they are separate properties.\n\nHence, having minimum variance doesn't guarantee that the estimator is unbiased.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
