After excavation started, an employee of the cement company delivered a load of concrete to the construction site. To facilitate delivery, the contractor and the subcontractor had built an access ramp extending from the street to the lot. As the employee was driving over the ramp, it suddenly collapsed and caused the truck to overturn, seriously injuring the employee.

                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this situation where a buyer got a beachfront lot and hired a contractor to build a house. Then the contractor hired a subcontractor for maintenance, and also got concrete from a cement company. While delivering concrete, the truck driver got hurt because the ramp they built for access collapsed. It turns out the contractor and subcontractor used bad materials, and the driver was drunk. Now, the driver is suing the contractor and subcontractor for his injuries, and there was a trial that figured out how much each party was at fault.\n\nAccording to the information:\n\n- Plaintiff (driver): 40% negligence\n\n- Defendant (contractor): 35% negligence\n\n- Defendant (subcontractor): 25% negligence\n\nTotal negligence adds up to 100%, which makes sense.\n\nNow, the jurisdiction has a modified comparative negligence statute, which says that the plaintiff can recover damages as long as their negligence isn't greater than the defendant's, but their damages will be reduced by their own percentage of fault.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff is 40% at fault, which is less than the combined 60% fault of the defendants (35% + 25%). So, he can recover damages, but they'll be reduced by his 40% fault.\n\nThe total damages are $100,000.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nTotal damages - (damages * plaintiff's percentage of fault) = recoverable amount\n\nThat is:\n\n$100,000 - ($100,000 * 0.40) = $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000\n\nBut wait, that's not one of the options. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that there are two defendants, the contractor and the subcontractor, and they're being sued individually.\n\nThe question is: The employee brings a personal injury action against the contractor individually. He will most likely...\n\nSo, it's only against the contractor now.\n\nIn this jurisdiction, they follow joint and several liability for joint tortfeasors. That means each defendant can be liable for the full amount, but since it's a modified comparative negligence jurisdiction, the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by his own fault.\n\nBut in this case, he's only suing the contractor individually.\n\nSo, first, we need to see how much the contractor is liable for.\n\nThe contractor is 35% negligent, the subcontractor is 25%, and the plaintiff is 40%.\n\nBut since it's only against the contractor, I think the plaintiff can recover from the contractor his proportionate share.\n\nWait, but in joint and several liability, the plaintiff can recover the full amount from any defendant, but since it's modified comparative negligence, his recovery is reduced by his own fault.\n\nBut here, it's only against the contractor.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the percentage of negligence of the contractor alone.\n\nThe contractor is 35% negligent.\n\nThe plaintiff is 40% negligent.\n\nBut according to the statute, \"contributory negligence shall not bar recovery if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person against whom recovery is sought.\"\n\nHere, the plaintiff's negligence (40%) is greater than the contractor's negligence (35%), so according to this statute, recovery should be barred.\n\nWait, but let's look at the statute again:\n\n\"Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in any action by any person or his legal representative to recover damages for negligence resulting in death or injury to person or property, if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person against whom recovery is sought...\"\n\nSo, if the plaintiff's negligence is not greater than the defendant's negligence, then recovery is allowed, reduced by the plaintiff's percentage of negligence.\n\nBut in this case, the plaintiff's negligence is greater (40%) than the contractor's (35%), so recovery should be barred.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff cannot recover anything from the contractor individually.\n\nBut let's think about it again.\n\nWait, the statute says \"if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person against whom recovery is sought...\"\n\nSo, if the plaintiff's negligence is equal to or less than the defendant's negligence, then recovery is allowed, reduced by the plaintiff's percentage.\n\nBut here, the plaintiff's negligence is greater (40%) than the contractor's (35%), so recovery is barred.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the contractor.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier calculation, when considering both defendants together, the plaintiff's negligence was less than the combined negligence of the defendants (60%), but since he's only suing one defendant, and his negligence is greater than that defendant's negligence, recovery is barred.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the contractor.\n\nBut let me check the options again:\n\nA. recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the contractor.\n\nB. recover $100,000.\n\nC. recover $55,000.\n\nD. recover $35,000.\n\nGiven the analysis, A seems correct.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's another way to look at it.\n\nMaybe the plaintiff can recover from the contractor the contractor's proportionate share of the damages, reduced by the plaintiff's fault.\n\nSo, the contractor is 35% negligent.\n\nTotal damages are $100,000.\n\nFirst, reduce damages by plaintiff's fault: $100,000 - ($100,000 * 0.40) = $60,000.\n\nThen, the contractor is responsible for 35% of that $60,000.\n\nSo, $60,000 * 0.35 = $21,000.\n\nBut that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the plaintiff can recover from the contractor the contractor's proportionate share of the total damages, without reducing by the plaintiff's fault, but I don't think that's correct given the statute.\n\nWait, but the statute clearly states that \"any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person for whose injury, damage, or death recovery is made.\"\n\nSo, the damages are reduced by the plaintiff's negligence.\n\nThen, each defendant is liable for their proportionate share.\n\nSo, total recoverable damages are $60,000 (after reducing by plaintiff's 40% fault).\n\nThen, the contractor is 35% negligent, so $60,000 * 0.35 = $21,000.\n\nBut that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something about joint and several liability.\n\nIn joint and several liability, the plaintiff can recover the full amount from any defendant, but in this case, since it's modified comparative negligence, the recoverable amount is reduced by the plaintiff's fault.\n\nBut here, the plaintiff is only suing the contractor individually.\n\nSo, perhaps he can recover from the contractor his proportionate share, which is 35% of the total damages reduced by the plaintiff's fault.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he can recover the full reduced damages from the contractor, up to the contractor's share.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me look up the rules for modified comparative negligence and joint and several liability.\n\nUpon research, in modified comparative negligence jurisdictions with a 50% or less bar, the plaintiff can recover from any defendant whose negligence is greater than the plaintiff's negligence, and the recovery is reduced by the plaintiff's percentage of fault.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff's negligence is 40%, and the contractor's negligence is 35%, which is less than the plaintiff's.\n\nTherefore, since the plaintiff's negligence is greater than the contractor's, recovery is barred.\n\nHence, the answer is A. recover nothing, because he was more at fault than the contractor.\n\nAlternatively, if considering that the plaintiff's negligence is only compared to the defendant he's suing individually, and since the plaintiff's negligence is greater than the contractor's, recovery is barred.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
