                    "text": "The critical pH below which demineralisation of tooth enamel occurs is usually around 5.5.\n\nTo understand this, it's important to know that tooth enamel is the hardest substance in the human body, primarily composed of hydroxyapatite, a mineral with the chemical formula Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. The pH level in the mouth can significantly affect the enamel's integrity.\n\nWhen the pH in the mouth drops below 5.5, enamel starts to demineralize, meaning that minerals begin to dissolve out of the enamel. This process can lead to the formation of cavities if not counteracted by remineralization, which occurs when the pH rises above 5.5 and minerals are deposited back into the enamel.\n\nThis critical pH of 5.5 is a key concept in preventive dentistry, as it highlights the importance of maintaining a neutral oral environment to prevent tooth decay. Factors that can lower the oral pH include consumption of acidic foods and drinks, as well as the production of acid by bacteria in plaque during the breakdown of sugars.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 5.5."
