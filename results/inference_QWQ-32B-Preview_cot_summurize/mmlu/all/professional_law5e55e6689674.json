This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which option is correct here. So, there's a state that has a tax on extracting pitchblende, which is a mineral containing uranium and plutonium, important for atomic energy. Congress passed a law forbidding any state from taxing the extraction of pitchblende, and since only this one state has such a tax, the law basically only affects this state.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether this state's tax is valid or invalid based on the options given.\n\nOption A says it's invalid because of the supremacy clause, which means that federal law takes precedence over state law when there's a conflict. Since Congress has forbidden states from imposing such taxes, and the state is doing it anyway, that would conflict with federal law. So, according to the supremacy clause, the state law should be invalid.\n\nOption B says it's invalid because Congress can use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that's harmful to the nation as a whole. I think the general welfare clause allows Congress to make laws that promote the general welfare, but I'm not sure if that directly applies here. Maybe it's more about Congress's power to regulate commerce or something else.\n\nOption C says the tax is valid because Congress can't interfere with a state's taxing policies. But that seems contradictory because Congress is precisely interfering by passing this law that forbids states from taxing pitchblende extraction.\n\nOption D says it's valid because Congress can't pass a law that treats one state differently from others. But in this case, since only one state has this tax, the law effectively only affects that one state. So, is it unconstitutional for Congress to pass a law that only applies to one state?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the commerce clause. Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, and that power is pretty broad. If the extraction of pitchblende affects interstate commerce, maybe Congress can regulate it.\n\nAlso, nuclear materials are heavily regulated by the federal government because of safety and national security concerns. So, maybe Congress has the authority to prohibit states from taxing these materials to ensure uniform regulation across the country.\n\nLooking back at option A, the supremacy clause does suggest that federal law overrides state law in case of a conflict. Since Congress has forbidden states from imposing such taxes, the state's tax should be invalid.\n\nOption B mentions the general welfare power. I think Congress's power to tax and spend for the general welfare might allow it to pass laws that affect state taxation, but I'm not entirely sure how that applies here.\n\nOption C seems incorrect because Congress has indeed interfered with the state's taxing policy by passing this law.\n\nOption D talks about Congress not being able to pass laws that single out one state. But in this case, even if the law only affects one state in practice, it's still a general prohibition applying to all states. Congress can pass laws that have disparate impacts on different states as long as the law itself is uniformly applied.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is the most correct. The state's tax is invalid because federal law supersedes it through the supremacy clause.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there are any exceptions or specific powers that the state has regarding taxation. For example, states have broad taxing powers unless expressly preempted by federal law.\n\nIn this case, Congress has expressly forbidden states from imposing taxes on the extraction of pitchblende, so that should preempt the state's tax.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an issue with Congress targeting only one state, but as I thought earlier, if the law applies uniformly to all states but only affects one because only that state has such a tax, that might be acceptable.\n\nAnother angle could be the dormant commerce clause, which prohibits states from passing laws that unduly burden interstate commerce. But in this case, it's Congress acting to prohibit state taxation that might affect interstate commerce.\n\nWait, perhaps Congress is exercising its power to regulate interstate commerce by prohibiting state taxes that might interfere with that commerce.\n\nSo, under the commerce clause, Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, and that can include preempting state taxation that affects such commerce.\n\nGiven that, option A seems correct: the state's tax is invalid because federal law, exercising its commerce clause power, supersedes the state's tax.\n\nOption B might be reaching; I'm not sure about the general welfare power in this context.\n\nOption C is contradicted by the federal law.\n\nOption D might not apply because the law is generally applicable, even if it only affects one state.\n\nTherefore, the answer is most likely A: invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
