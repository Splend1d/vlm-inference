                    "text": "Let's think about this question step by step. We're trying to figure out why the solar nebula heated up as it collapsed. There are four options provided, and we need to determine which one is the most accurate explanation.\n\nOption A says that collisions among planetesimals generated friction and heat. Now, planetesimals are small bodies that form early in the process of planet formation. But the solar nebula collapsing happened before planetesimals had fully formed. So, while collisions might have contributed some heat later on, it's probably not the main reason for the initial heating during the collapse.\n\nOption B suggests that radiation from other nearby stars heated the nebula. While it's true that stars emit radiation, the solar nebula was likely to be quite distant from other stars, and the heating effect from their radiation might not have been significant enough to cause the collapse and heating we're considering here.\n\nOption C proposes that a shock wave from a nearby supernova heated the gas. Supernovae can indeed cause shock waves that compress and heat surrounding gas. This is a plausible trigger for the collapse of a molecular cloud, leading to the formation of a protostar and eventually a solar system. So, this could be a possible reason for the heating.\n\nOption D states that as the cloud shrank, its gravitational potential energy was converted to kinetic energy and then into thermal energy. This makes a lot of sense based on the principles of physics. When a cloud collapses under gravity, the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy of the infalling material. As this material collides and interacts, the kinetic energy is then converted into thermal energy, causing the temperature to rise.\n\nConsidering these points, option D seems to be the most fundamental and direct explanation for why the solar nebula heated up as it collapsed. It's based on the basic physics of gravitational collapse, which is a well-established process in astrophysics.\n\nHowever, option C also has some merit because a supernova shock wave could have triggered the collapse in the first place. But the heating during the collapse is more directly related to the conversion of gravitational potential energy into thermal energy, as described in option D.\n\nSo, while external factors like a supernova might have initiated the collapse, the heating during the collapse is primarily due to the conversion of gravitational potential energy into thermal energy.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
