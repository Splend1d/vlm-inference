                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the challenges faced by countries that gained independence after World War II. The question mentions that the legacy of colonialism hindered their economic development, and lists several hindrances. I need to decide which one or ones are correct.\n\nOption A talks about artificial political boundaries that grouped diverse ethnic groups with little in common. I recall that during colonial times, European powers drew boundaries without considering the existing ethnic or cultural divisions. This often led to countries with a mix of different groups who may not have gotten along well, which could lead to internal conflicts and instability. Instability isn't good for economic development because it can scare away investment and disrupt trade.\n\nOption B mentions inadequate access to higher education and training for nationals under colonial administration. Colonizers often set up educational systems that favored the colonizer's own people or a small elite in the colony. The general population might have had limited access to quality education, especially higher education. Without a skilled workforce, it's harder for a country to develop economically because they lack the human capital needed for advanced industries and technologies.\n\nOption C refers to control of domestic commerce by foreign minority groups brought in by the colonial power. I think this relates to how colonizers would often bring in their own people or other minority groups to handle trade and commerce, giving them advantages over the local population. After independence, these minority groups might still control key economic sectors, which could marginalize the majority population and make it harder for them to participate fully in the economy.\n\nOption D says \"all of the above,\" meaning that all these factors were hindrances to economic development.\n\nLooking back, it seems like each of these options points to different ways in which colonialism left a problematic legacy for newly independent countries. Artificial boundaries could lead to political instability, lack of education could hinder human resource development, and control of commerce by foreign groups could limit economic opportunities for the local population.\n\nGiven that, it seems likely that all of these factors\u2014A, B, and C\u2014were indeed hindrances to economic development in post-colonial countries. Therefore, the best answer would be D, \"all of the above.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there could be any reasons to exclude one of these options.\n\nFor example, maybe some countries managed to overcome the issues with artificial boundaries through federal systems or other forms of political accommodation. However, even if some did, the general point seems valid that such boundaries were a challenge.\n\nSimilarly, some countries might have invested heavily in education after independence, mitigating the lack of access under colonial rule. But again, the overall trend was likely that colonial education systems were inadequate for the needs of independent nations.\n\nAs for control of domestic commerce by foreign minority groups, this was a common scenario in many former colonies, and it could indeed be a barrier to local economic development.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think \"all of the above\" is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
