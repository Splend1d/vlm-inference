The yield to maturity (YTM) is used as the discount rate.\n\nGiven:\n- Face value (FV) = $100\n- Coupon rate = 5%\n- Yield to maturity (YTM) = 6%\n- Time to maturity = 3 years\n\nFirst, we need to determine the annual coupon payment:\nCoupon payment = Coupon rate * Face value = 5% * $100 = $5\n\nNext, we calculate the present value of the coupon payments. Since the coupons are paid annually, we can use the formula for the present value of an annuity:\nPV of coupons = C * [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r\nWhere:\nC = annual coupon payment = $5\nr = YTM = 6% = 0.06\nn = number of years = 3\n\nPlugging in the values:\nPV of coupons = 5 * [1 - (1 + 0.06)^-3] / 0.06\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.06)^-3:\n(1.06)^-3 \u2248 0.8396\nThen, 1 - 0.8396 = 0.1604\nNow, 5 * 0.1604 / 0.06 = 5 * 2.6736 \u2248 13.368\n\nSo, the present value of the coupons is approximately $13.37.\n\nNext, we calculate the present value of the face value at maturity:\nPV of FV = FV / (1 + r)^n = 100 / (1.06)^3\n(1.06)^3 \u2248 1.1910\nSo, PV of FV = 100 / 1.1910 \u2248 83.96\n\nNow, the bond price is the sum of the present values of the coupons and the face value:\nBond price = PV of coupons + PV of FV = 13.37 + 83.96 \u2248 97.33\n\nTherefore, the price of the bond is approximately $97.33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
