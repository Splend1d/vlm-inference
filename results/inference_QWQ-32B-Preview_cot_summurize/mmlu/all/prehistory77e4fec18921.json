Forensic anthropologist: This sounds promising. I know that \"forensic\" relates to the application of scientific methods in legal contexts, like solving crimes. So, a forensic anthropologist probably uses skeletal analysis to help with criminal investigations.\n\nB. Historical archaeologist: Archaeologists study human history through physical remains, but \"historical\" might suggest they focus on more recent history, maybe not specifically on skeletons for crime solving.\n\nC. Paleoanthropologist: This term has \"paleo,\" which usually refers to ancient or prehistoric. So, they probably study ancient human skeletons to understand evolution and prehistory, not necessarily for solving modern crimes.\n\nD. Linguistic anthropologist: These anthropologists study how language influences social life. It doesn't seem directly related to studying skeletons for crime solving.\n\nBased on this, I think the best answer is A, forensic anthropologist. They specialize in using skeletal analysis to aid in legal matters, including solving crimes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
