                    "text": "So I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure out what percentage of the population are carriers of a certain autosomal recessive trait but don't express it. The trait is expressed in 1% of the population, and we're assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The options are 10%, 18%, 27%, and 50%. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is. It's a principle that helps us understand the genetic variation in a population. There are five main principles or assumptions: no mutation, no gene flow, no sexual selection, large population size, and random mating. If these conditions are met, the allele frequencies and genotype frequencies remain constant from generation to generation.\n\nIn this case, we're dealing with a autosomal recessive trait, which means that the trait is expressed only when an individual has two copies of the recessive allele. Let's denote the dominant allele as \"A\" and the recessive allele as \"a\". So, individuals with AA or Aa genotypes will not express the trait, while those with aa will express it.\n\nGiven that 1% of the population expresses the trait, that means 1% of the population has the aa genotype. So, frequency of aa is 0.01.\n\nIn Hardy-Weinberg terms, the frequency of the aa genotype is equal to q\u00b2, where q is the frequency of the recessive allele \"a\". So, q\u00b2 = 0.01.\n\nTo find q, I take the square root of 0.01, which is 0.1. So, q = 0.1.\n\nSince there are only two alleles for this gene, A and a, the frequency of A (which is p) is 1 - q. So, p = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.\n\nNow, carriers are individuals who have one dominant and one recessive allele,\u5373 Aa genotype. In Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of Aa is 2pq.\n\nSo, plugging in the values, 2 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.18.\n\nTo express this as a percentage, I multiply by 100, so 0.18 * 100 = 18%.\n\nLooking back at the options, 18% is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n- Trait is autosomal recessive, so expressed only in aa individuals.\n\n- Frequency of aa is 1%, so q\u00b2 = 0.01.\n\n- q = square root of 0.01 = 0.1.\n\n- p = 1 - q = 0.9.\n\n- Carriers are Aa, frequency is 2pq = 2 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.18 or 18%.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the frequencies add up properly.\n\nAccording to Hardy-Weinberg, the sum of all genotype frequencies should be 1.\n\nSo, frequency of AA is p\u00b2 = 0.9\u00b2 = 0.81.\n\nFrequency of Aa is 2pq = 0.18.\n\nFrequency of aa is q\u00b2 = 0.01.\n\nAdding them up: 0.81 + 0.18 + 0.01 = 1.\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\nSo, the percentage of the population that are carriers (Aa) but do not express the trait is 18%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 18%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
