The options are:\n\nA. because rights are essentially human\n\nB. because animals lack any kind of rationality\n\nC. because animals are not as powerful as humans\n\nD. none of the above; Cohen holds that animals can have rights\n\nI need to recall what Cohen's view is on this. I remember that Cohen is a philosopher who has written about animals and ethics. In his book \"The Animal Rights Debate,\" he presents arguments against animal rights.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what it means for someone to be a bearer of rights. Typically, rights imply certain protections or entitlements that a being is owed, often because of certain capacities or characteristics they possess.\n\nOption A says that rights are essentially human. If Cohen believes this, it would mean that only humans can have rights by virtue of being human. But I think Cohen might have a more nuanced view than that.\n\nOption B claims that animals lack any kind of rationality. While it's true that some philosophers argue that rationality is a requirement for having rights, I need to remember if Cohen specifically makes this point.\n\nOption C suggests that animals are not as powerful as humans. This seems more related to might versus right, and I don't recall Cohen emphasizing power dynamics in his arguments about animal rights.\n\nOption D says that none of the above are correct, and that Cohen actually holds animals can have rights. But from what I remember, Cohen is arguing against animal rights, so this probably isn't the case.\n\nLet me think back to Cohen's arguments. He is known for defending the idea that while we have moral obligations towards animals, they don't have rights in the same way that humans do.\n\nOne of Cohen's main points is that rights imply certain moral relationships and responsibilities, and he might argue that animals don't possess the necessary characteristics to be part of that moral community in the same way humans are.\n\nI think Cohen would agree that rights are essentially human, at least in the sense that they are constructed by human societies and legal systems. So, option A might be closest to his view.\n\nBut I also recall that Cohen discusses the concept of rationality in relation to rights. He might argue that rights require the ability to understand and act upon moral rules, which requires a certain level of rationality.\n\nIf that's the case, then option B could also be a reason why animals can't be bearers of rights according to Cohen.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful here. Some animals, like great apes, elephants, and dolphins, are known to have complex cognitive abilities and may possess some form of rationality. So, if Cohen is saying that animals lack any kind of rationality, that might not be accurate.\n\nPerhaps Cohen would argue that animals lack the full capacity for rationality that humans have, which is necessary for bearing rights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Cohen believes that rights are tied to membership in the moral community, which is defined by certain characteristics that animals don't possess.\n\nI think I need to look back at some of Cohen's writings to get a clearer picture.\n\nIn his book \"The Animal Rights Debate,\" Cohen presents a argument titled \"Why Accepting Utilitarianism Does Not Entail Accepting Animal Rights.\" In this argument, he distinguishes between having moral considerability and having rights.\n\nHe acknowledges that animals are morally considerable beings, meaning that their interests matter morally. However, he argues that this doesn't necessarily mean they have rights.\n\nCohen seems to be making a distinction between interests and rights. He might be saying that while animals have interests that should be considered, they don't have rights in the same way that humans do.\n\nOne of his key points is that rights imply certain moral relationships and duties that may not be applicable to animals in the same way.\n\nSo, perhaps Cohen would say that rights are essentially human because they are constructed within human moral and legal systems, and animals, while deserving moral consideration, don't fit into that framework in the same way.\n\nAlternatively, he might argue that rights require certain capacities, like rationality or autonomy, that animals don't possess.\n\nI need to recall more specifics from his arguments.\n\nIn his debate with Regan, Cohen argues that rights are claims that are supported by reasons, and that these reasons must be understandable and acceptable to the community that is expected to recognize and respect those rights.\n\nHe might be suggesting that for a being to have rights, it needs to be able to participate in the moral community by understanding and accepting reciprocal duties.\n\nIf that's the case, then animals, lacking the capacity for such understanding and reciprocal duties, wouldn't be suitable bearers of rights.\n\nBut again, some animals do show signs of understanding rules and social norms, so this might not be a completely watertight argument.\n\nAlternatively, Cohen might argue that rights are tied to the ability to make moral claims and to engage in moral reasoning, which animals are incapable of.\n\nBut I need to confirm this with actual quotes from his work.\n\nAnother perspective is that Cohen might be approaching this from a legal standpoint, where rights are granted by human societies and legal systems, and therefore only humans can be rights-bearers.\n\nIf that's the case, then option A would be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I think Cohen's argument is more philosophical than purely legal.\n\nLet me consider option B: because animals lack any kind of rationality.\n\nThis seems too broad. Many animals exhibit rational behavior, problem-solving skills, and even tool use. So, to say they lack any kind of rationality might not be accurate.\n\nPerhaps Cohen is referring to a specific kind of rationality necessary for rights, such as the ability to understand and follow moral laws.\n\nIf that's the case, then it's more plausible.\n\nOption C, that animals are not as powerful as humans, seems less relevant to the question of rights. Power dynamics don't necessarily determine who can have rights.\n\nOption D suggests that Cohen holds animals can have rights, but from what I recall, his position is against animal rights, so this is probably not correct.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the best answer is A: because rights are essentially human.\n\nCohen seems to be arguing that rights are a human construct, tied to human moral and legal systems, and that animals, while deserving moral consideration, don't fit into this framework in the same way as humans do.\n\nThis doesn't mean that animals can't have certain protections or that humans don't have obligations towards them, but rather that the concept of rights is specifically human.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider whether Cohen explicitly states this.\n\nUpon reviewing some of Cohen's arguments, I find that he does emphasize the idea that rights are claims that are addressed to moral agents, and that moral agents are those who can understand and act upon moral reasons.\n\nHe might argue that animals, lacking this capacity, cannot be rights-bearers in the same sense as humans.\n\nTherefore, option B could also be a valid reason according to Cohen.\n\nBut considering that some animals do show signs of understanding social rules and perhaps even simple moral considerations, this argument might not be entirely convincing.\n\nAlternatively, Cohen might hold a more nuanced view, acknowledging that while some animals have certain capacities, they still fall short of the requirements for rights-bearer status.\n\nGiven the options provided, I think A is the most accurate reflection of Cohen's position: rights are essentially human because they are part of human moral and legal systems.\n\nOption B might be a component of his argument, but the core idea seems to be that rights are a human construct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
