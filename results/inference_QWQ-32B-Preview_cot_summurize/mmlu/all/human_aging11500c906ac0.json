It's asking about a specific type where a person outlines the kinds of medical interventions they do and don't want. The options are a living will, DNH, DNR, and durable power of attorney. I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these terms means.\n\nA living will is a type of advance directive that allows a person to document their wishes for medical treatment in situations where they are unable to communicate. It specifies the types of medical interventions they desire or do not desire, particularly in end-of-life situations.\n\nDNH probably stands for \"Do Not Hospitalize,\" but I'm not entirely sure. I think it might be similar to a DNR, which I know stands for \"Do Not Resuscitate.\" A DNR order instructs medical personnel not to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if a person's heart stops or they stop breathing. So, DNR is more specific to resuscitation efforts.\n\nA durable power of attorney for health care is a legal document that appoints someone else to make medical decisions on behalf of the person if they become unable to do so themselves. It's different from a living will because it designates a proxy decision-maker rather than outlining specific treatment preferences.\n\nGiven these definitions, the option that best fits the description of specifying types of medical intervention that are and are not desired is the living will. It directly addresses the person's wishes regarding medical treatments in advance.\n\nDNH and DNR are more specific instructions, and DNR is limited to resuscitation efforts. A durable power of attorney is about appointing a decision-maker, not specifying treatment preferences directly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Living will.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
