                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: (Z,*) is a group with a*b = a + b + 1 for all a, b in Z. I need to find the inverse of a. The options are A. 0, B. -2, C. a-2, D. (2+a)*-1. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that in a group, every element has an inverse such that when you apply the group operation with the element and its inverse, you get the identity element. So, I need to find what the identity element is for this group first, because without knowing that, I can't really find the inverse.\n\nWait, the problem says (Z,*), where * is defined as a*b = a + b + 1. Is this really a group? I need to check if it satisfies the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.\n\nClosure: Since a and b are in Z, and addition and addition of integers is closed, a + b + 1 is also an integer. So, closure holds.\n\nAssociativity: Let's check if (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).\n\nCompute (a*b)*c:\n\na*b = a + b + 1\n\nThen (a*b)*c = (a + b + 1)*c = (a + b + 1) + c + 1 = a + b + c + 2\n\nNow, a*(b*c):\n\nb*c = b + c + 1\n\nThen a*(b*c) = a*(b + c + 1) = a + (b + c + 1) + 1 = a + b + c + 2\n\nSo, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c) = a + b + c + 2. Therefore, the operation is associative.\n\nIdentity element: I need to find an element e in Z such that for any a in Z, a*e = e*a = a.\n\nFrom a*e = a + e + 1 = a, solving for e: a + e + 1 = a \u21d2 e + 1 = 0 \u21d2 e = -1.\n\nSimilarly, e*a = e + a + 1 = a \u21d2 e + 1 = 0 \u21d2 e = -1.\n\nSo, the identity element is -1.\n\nInverse element: For each a in Z, there exists an element b in Z such that a*b = b*a = e, where e is the identity element, which is -1.\n\nSo, a*b = a + b + 1 = -1.\n\nI need to solve for b: a + b + 1 = -1 \u21d2 b = -1 - 1 - a \u21d2 b = -2 - a.\n\nTherefore, the inverse of a is -2 - a.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. -2\n\nC. a - 2\n\nD. (2 + a)*-1\n\nHmm, none of these look like -2 - a.\n\nWait, let's see if any of these options equal -2 - a.\n\nOption C is a - 2, which is a - 2, not -2 - a.\n\nOption B is -2, which is not equal to -2 - a.\n\nOption A is 0, not equal to -2 - a.\n\nOption D is (2 + a)*-1. Wait, what does that mean? Is it (2 + a) multiplied by -1, which would be -2 - a? That seems promising.\n\nSo, (2 + a)*-1 = -2 - a, which matches the inverse we found.\n\nBut wait, in the group operation, * is defined as a*b = a + b + 1, not as multiplication. So, does (2 + a)*-1 mean (2 + a)*(-1) using the group operation?\n\nIf * is the group operation, then (2 + a)*-1 = (2 + a) + (-1) + 1 = 2 + a - 1 + 1 = 2 + a.\n\nThat's not equal to -2 - a.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (2 + a)*-1 means the inverse of (2 + a), which we've already determined is -2 - (2 + a) = -2 - 2 - a = -4 - a, which doesn't match.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should double-check my earlier steps.\n\nI found that the identity element e is -1, and the inverse of a is b such that a + b + 1 = -1, which gives b = -2 - a.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them directly match this.\n\nOption D is (2 + a)*-1. If * is the group operation, then (2 + a)*-1 = (2 + a) + (-1) + 1 = 2 + a - 1 + 1 = 2 + a.\n\nBut we need -2 - a, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe *-1 denotes the inverse of the element.\n\nIf that's the case, then (2 + a)*-1 would mean the inverse of (2 + a), which we've already found to be -2 - (2 + a) = -4 - a, which still doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the operation.\n\nLet me try to recompute the inverse.\n\nWe have a*b = a + b + 1, and we want a*b = e = -1.\n\nSo, a + b + 1 = -1 \u21d2 b = -1 - 1 - a = -2 - a.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, looking at option D again: (2 + a)*-1.\n\nIf *-1 denotes the inverse, then (2 + a)*-1 should be the inverse of (2 + a), which is -2 - (2 + a) = -4 - a, which is not equal to -2 - a.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe *-1 is just multiplication by -1, not the group operation.\n\nIn that case, (2 + a)*-1 = -(2 + a) = -2 - a, which matches the inverse we found.\n\nIf that's the case, then option D is correct.\n\nBut I'm not sure if *-1 means multiplication by -1 or the inverse in the group operation.\n\nGiven the context, it's possible that * is used for the group operation, and *-1 is used to denote multiplication by -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a standard notation I'm missing.\n\nGiven that, if *-1 means multiplication by -1, then (2 + a)*-1 = -2 - a, which matches the inverse.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if *-1 denotes the inverse in the group, then (2 + a)*-1 would be the inverse of (2 + a), which is -2 - (2 + a) = -4 - a, which doesn't match.\n\nSo, it's more likely that *-1 means multiplication by -1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. (2 + a)*-1, which equals -2 - a.\n\nBut to confirm, let's see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nSuppose I try to compute the inverse directly.\n\nWe have a*b = a + b + 1 = -1.\n\nSo, b = -1 - 1 - a = -2 - a.\n\nNow, option D is (2 + a)*-1.\n\nIf *-1 is multiplication by -1, then (2 + a)*-1 = -2 - a, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, if *-1 is the inverse operation, then (2 + a)*-1 would be the inverse of (2 + a), which is -2 - (2 + a) = -4 - a, which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, it's more plausible that *-1 means multiplication by -1, making option D correct.\n\nSo, the answer is D. (2 + a)*-1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
