                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about direct and indirect representations in programming languages, particularly focusing on how they affect compilation time, access time, and recompilation needs when storage sizes change.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what direct and indirect representations mean in this context.\n\n- **Direct representation:** This means that an object's name is bound at runtime to stack storage for its component values. So, the components are stored directly on the stack.\n\n- **Indirect representation:** Here, the object's name is bound to a stack pointer that references heap storage for its component values. So, there's an extra level of indirection because you have to follow the pointer to access the components.\n\nNow, let's look at the statements one by one.\n\n**Statement I:** Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time.\n\n- With indirect representation, since there's a pointer involved, the compiler might need to generate additional code to handle the indirection. This could include loading the pointer and then accessing the heap memory.\n\n- However, the increase in compilation time might not be noticeable unless the code is extremely large or the compiler is very inefficient.\n\n- In general, the difference in compilation time between direct and indirect representations is likely to be minimal, especially with modern compilers that are highly optimized.\n\n- Therefore, I'm inclined to think that statement I is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement II:** Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable.\n\n- In direct representation, since the components are stored directly on the stack, accessing them should be faster because there's no indirection overhead.\n\n- With indirect representation, you have to first load the pointer from the stack and then access the heap memory, which introduces an extra memory access.\n\n- So, direct representation should indeed decrease the time needed to access components compared to indirect representation.\n\n- Therefore, statement II seems to be true.\n\n**Statement III:** When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed.\n\n- This is an interesting point related to modularity and encapsulation.\n\n- In indirect representation, since the object's components are accessed through a pointer, the actual layout of the heap memory can change without affecting the modules that use the object, as long as the interface remains the same.\n\n- This is because the modules only know about the pointer and the methods to access the object's components, not the internal layout.\n\n- Therefore, if the storage size of a private component changes, only the module that defines the class needs to be recompiled, and other modules that use the class do not need to be recompiled.\n\n- In direct representation, if the size of the object changes, it might affect the stack layout in the modules that use the object, potentially requiring recompilation of those modules.\n\n- So, indirect representation does minimize the number of recompilations needed when internal storage sizes change.\n\n- Therefore, statement III is also true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement I is likely not true.\n\n- Statement II is true.\n\n- Statement III is true.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. II and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
