So, national sports teams, flags, national anthems, and national holidays\u2014these are all symbols and practices that countries use to represent themselves and foster a sense of unity among their citizens. Now, the question is asking what these promote.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Nationalism.\n\nNationalism is the idea of pride in one's country and a sense of national identity. National sports teams represent the country in competitions, flags are symbols of the nation, national anthems are played to honor the country, and national holidays celebrate important events or figures in a country's history. All of these seem to align with promoting nationalism.\n\nB. Sectarianism.\n\nSectarianism refers to the divisive behavior between different sects or groups, often within a religion. While flags and national anthems might sometimes be points of division between different sectarian groups, especially in diverse countries, they are generally intended to promote unity rather than division.\n\nC. Political unrest.\n\nPolitical unrest is characterized by public disorder or violence as a result of political tensions or dissatisfaction with the government. While national symbols can sometimes be points of contention, especially if certain groups feel excluded or misrepresented, their primary purpose is to promote unity and pride, not unrest.\n\nD. Functional disputes.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what \"functional disputes\" refers to in this context. It might be a typo or an unclear term. Perhaps it's meant to refer to disputes over the functions or roles of these symbols, but that seems less likely.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems that option A, nationalism, is the most appropriate answer. These elements promote a sense of national identity and pride, which are key aspects of nationalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
