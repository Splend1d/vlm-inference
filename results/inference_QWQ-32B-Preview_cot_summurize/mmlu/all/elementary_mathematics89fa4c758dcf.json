                    "text": "So I've got this equation to solve: -6x = -36. I need to find the value of x that makes this equation true. Let's see how to do that.\n\nFirst, I remember that to solve for x, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. The equation says -6 times x equals -36. To get x by itself, I should divide both sides of the equation by -6. That way, the -6 on the left side cancels out, and I'm left with x.\n\nSo, starting with:\n\n-6x = -36\n\nI divide both sides by -6:\n\n(-6x) / (-6) = (-36) / (-6)\n\nOn the left side, -6 divided by -6 is 1, so I have:\n\n1x = (-36) / (-6)\n\nNow, -36 divided by -6 is 6, because dividing two negative numbers gives a positive result.\n\nSo, x = 6\n\nWait, but let's check if that's correct. Maybe I should consider if there are other possible answers or if I made a mistake in my steps.\n\nLet me think again. Starting with -6x = -36.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as multiplying both sides by -1 to make the negatives go away.\n\nSo, multiply both sides by -1:\n\n(-1)(-6x) = (-1)(-36)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n6x = 36\n\nNow, divide both sides by 6:\n\n6x / 6 = 36 / 6\n\nWhich gives:\n\nx = 6\n\nOkay, same answer as before. So, x = 6 seems to be correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check my answer by plugging it back into the original equation.\n\nOriginal equation: -6x = -36\n\nPlug in x = 6:\n\n-6*(6) = -36\n\n-36 = -36\n\nYes, that checks out. The left side equals the right side when x = 6.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 1 over 6\n\nB. 6\n\nC. 1 over 216\n\nD. 216\n\nOption B is 6, which matches the answer I got.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's quickly consider the other options.\n\nOption A is 1 over 6, which is approximately 0.1667. If I plug that into the original equation:\n\n-6*(1/6) = -1, which is not equal to -36. So, that's not correct.\n\nOption C is 1 over 216, which is approximately 0.00463. Plugging that in:\n\n-6*(1/216) = -1/36, which is approximately -0.0278, not -36.\n\nOption D is 216. Plugging that in:\n\n-6*216 = -1296, which is not equal to -36.\n\nSo, clearly, only option B satisfies the equation.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret the equation or if there are any tricks here.\n\nIs there any possibility that x could be negative? Let's see.\n\nSuppose x were negative, say x = -6.\n\nPlugging into the original equation:\n\n-6*(-6) = 36, which is not equal to -36.\n\nSo, x cannot be negative in this case.\n\nAlternatively, is there a possibility of x being a fraction or a decimal? Well, in this case, x = 6 is an integer, and it satisfies the equation, and the other options don't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider dividing both sides by 6 instead of -6.\n\nStarting again with -6x = -36.\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\n(-6x)/6 = (-36)/6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n- x = -6\n\nThen, multiply both sides by -1:\n\nx = 6\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to divide both sides by -6, as I did earlier, I get x = 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could add 6x to both sides to get:\n\n-6x + 6x = -36 + 6x\n\n0 = -36 + 6x\n\nThen, add 36 to both sides:\n\n36 = 6x\n\nThen, divide both sides by 6:\n\n36/6 = x\n\n6 = x\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed enough that x = 6 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could graph the equation -6x = -36 and see where it intersects the x-axis, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of multiplication.\n\nIf -6 times x equals -36, then x must be the number that, when multiplied by -6, gives -36.\n\nSo, x = -36 / -6 = 6.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possible methods to solve this equation, and all of them point to x = 6 being the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option B. 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
