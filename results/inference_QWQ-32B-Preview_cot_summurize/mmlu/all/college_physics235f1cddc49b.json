So, Li++ has Z=3 and A=7, and the question says its emission spectrum is identical to hydrogen's, but all wavelengths are changed by some factor. I need to find out by what factor and whether they are decreased or increased.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the emission spectrum of hydrogen works. Hydrogen has Z=1, and its emission spectrum is governed by the Rydberg formula, which relates the wavelengths of the spectral lines to the energy levels electrons transition between. The general formula for the wavelength is:\n\n1/\u03bb = R * (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)\n\nWhere R is the Rydberg constant, n1 and n2 are integers representing the energy levels, with n2 > n1.\n\nNow, for hydrogen-like atoms, which are atoms with only one electron, the Rydberg formula can be generalized to include the atomic number Z:\n\n1/\u03bb = R * Z^2 * (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)\n\nSo, for Li++, which is doubly ionized lithium, it has Z=3, meaning it has three protons and only one electron, making it similar to hydrogen but with a higher nuclear charge.\n\nComparing the two formulas, for Li++, the expression would be:\n\n1/\u03bb_li = R * 3^2 * (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2) = R * 9 * (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)\n\n\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6c22\u539f\u5b50\uff1a\n\n1/\u03bb_h = R * (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c1/\u03bb_li = 9 * (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2) = 9 * (1/\u03bb_h)\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u03bb_li = \u03bb_h / 9\n\n\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u9502\u7684\u6ce2\u957f\u662f\u6c22\u7684\u6ce2\u957f\u76841/9\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e869\u500d\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u786e\u8ba4\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd9\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u9898\u76ee\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u201cidentical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are...\u201d\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8c31\u7ebf\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u76f8\u540c\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u6ce2\u957f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\n\n\u518d\u770b\u770b\u9009\u9879\uff0cA. decreased by a factor of 9\uff0c\u8fd9\u548c\u6211\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u518d\u60f3\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n\n\u539f\u5b50\u8d28\u91cfA=7\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u5e94\u8be5\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u6ce2\u957f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6ce2\u957f\u4e3b\u8981\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6838\u7535\u8377Z\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6570n\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\u5728\u6c22-like\u539f\u5b50\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ce2\u957f\u4e0eZ\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eLi++\uff0cZ=3\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6ce2\u957f\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6c22\u7684\u6ce2\u957f\u9664\u4ee59\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u5e94\u8be5\u662fA. decreased by a factor of 9\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u6211\u518d\u770b\u770b\u5176\u4ed6\u9009\u9879\uff0cB. decreased by a factor of 49\uff0cC. decreased by a factor of 81\uff0cD. increased by a factor of 9\u3002\n\n49\u548c81\u662f9\u7684\u500d\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e2a\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6709\u4eba\u4f1a\u9519\u7b97Z\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n\n\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6709\u4eba\u4f1a\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6ce2\u957f\u4e0eZ\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e0eZ\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u4e0eZ\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662fA. decreased by a factor of 9\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
