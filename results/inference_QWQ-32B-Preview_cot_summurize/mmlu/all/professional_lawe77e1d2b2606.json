                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a debtor who owes a creditor $750 for an old debt. This debt is barred by the statute of limitations, which means that legally, the creditor can't enforce the debt because too much time has passed. But then, something interesting happens. The debtor overhears the creditor badmouthing him at a party and, feeling guilty, decides to orally agree to pay the $750 debt on September 1st.\n\nNow, the debtor doesn't pay up on September 1st, and the creditor decides to sue to recover the $750. We need to figure out which option provides the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says it was not supported by new consideration. In contract law, consideration is something of value that each party promises to exchange. For a promise to be enforceable, it usually needs to be supported by consideration. Here, the debtor is promising to pay $750, but what's the consideration from the creditor? Well, the creditor isn't really promising anything new in return. So, it seems like there might be a lack of consideration, which could make the promise unenforceable.\n\nOption B mentions that it's violative of the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, like promises to pay someone else's debt or agreements that can't be performed within one year. Here, the promise to pay an existing debt might fall under the statute of frauds, especially since it's a debt payment promise. So, if this promise isn't in writing, it might be unenforceable under the statute of frauds.\n\nOption C states that the debt was already barred by the statute of limitations. That's true; the debt was barred when the statute of limitations ran out on July 1st. But the debtor still chose to orally agree to pay it on August 1st. So, does the fact that the original debt was barred make this new promise unenforceable? It's a bit tricky because the debtor is voluntarily choosing to pay a debt that can no longer be enforced legally.\n\nOption D says there was no mutuality of obligation. Mutuality of obligation means that both parties are bound by the agreement. In this case, the debtor is promising to pay, but the creditor isn't promising anything in return. So, there might be a lack of mutuality, which could make the promise unenforceable.\n\nNow, to determine which one is the strongest ground, we need to think about which argument is most likely to hold up in court.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: lack of consideration. As I mentioned, the debtor is promising to pay, but the creditor isn't promising anything new in return. This could be a valid reason for the promise to be unenforceable because without consideration, it's just a gratuitous promise, which generally isn't enforceable.\n\nOption B: statute of frauds. This could also be a strong argument because promises to pay debts are often within the statute of frauds' requirements to be in writing. Since this was an oral promise, it might not satisfy the statute of frauds, making it unenforceable.\n\nOption C: the debt being barred by the statute of limitations. This is an interesting point. Even though the debt is barred, the debtor voluntarily promised to pay it. In many jurisdictions, a debtor can't use the statute of limitations as a defense if they've voluntarily reaffirmed the debt. So, this might not be the strongest ground to argue that the promise is unenforceable.\n\nOption D: lack of mutuality. Similar to lack of consideration, if there's no mutuality because the creditor isn't promising anything in return, then the promise might be unenforceable.\n\nBetween options A, B, and D, which one is the strongest? Option B, the statute of frauds, might be the most compelling because it's a specific legal requirement that contracts of this nature must be in writing. If the promise isn't in writing, it violates the statute of frauds and is therefore unenforceable.\n\nOption A, lack of consideration, is also a strong argument, but courts sometimes find ways to imply consideration in certain situations. However, in this case, it seems clear that there is no new consideration from the creditor.\n\nOption D, lack of mutuality, is similar to lack of consideration and could also be a valid reason.\n\nBut comparing all three, the statute of frauds is a more definitive rule that requires certain contracts to be in writing. Since the promise to pay the debt was oral, and assuming it falls under the statute of frauds, this would provide a strong ground for the promise being unenforceable.\n\nOption C, the debt being barred by the statute of limitations, might not be as strong because the debtor voluntarily promised to pay despite the bar. In many places, this voluntary promise can revive the debt.\n\nTherefore, I think option B, violative of the statute of frauds, provides the strongest grounds that the debtor's oral promise was unenforceable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
