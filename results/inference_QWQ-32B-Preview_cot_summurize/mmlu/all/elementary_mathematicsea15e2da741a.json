Let me check.\n\nFirst, I know that 7 squared is 49, and 7 cubed should be 7 times 49. Let's see, 7 times 40 is 280, and 7 times 9 is 63, so 280 plus 63 is 343. So, 7^3 equals 343. That means option B is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is 3^7. What's 3 to the power of 7? 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, and 3^7 is 2187. That's way bigger than 343, so A is not correct.\n\nOption C is 7^49. That's 7 raised to the 49th power, which is an incredibly large number, much larger than 343. So, C is not correct.\n\nOption D is 294^49. That's 294 raised to the 49th power, which is an even larger number. Definitely not 343.\n\nSo, the only correct option is B, 7^3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
