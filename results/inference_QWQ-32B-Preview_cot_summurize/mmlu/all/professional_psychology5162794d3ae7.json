It is characterized by several distinct features, including:\n\n1. **Mental Retardation**: Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome often have intellectual disabilities, ranging from mild to moderate.\n\n2. **Extreme Obesity**: One of the most notable features is an insatiable appetite and a constant craving for food, which can lead to severe obesity if not managed properly.\n\nOther features of Prader-Willi syndrome include:\n\n- **Hypotonia (low muscle tone)**: This is often present in infancy and can contribute to delayed motor development.\n\n- **Short stature**: Many individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome are shorter than average.\n\n- **Small hands and feet**: Compared to their body size, their hands and feet may appear small.\n\n- **Behavioral issues**: Such as stubbornness, temper tantrums, and obsessive behaviors.\n\n- **Sleep disturbances**: Including sleep apnea due to obesity.\n\nPrader-Willi syndrome is caused by the loss of function of several genes on chromosome 15. This can occur due to a deletion in the paternal copy of chromosome 15, maternal uniparental disomy (where both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the mother), or imprinting disorders.\n\nIn contrast:\n\n- **Down Syndrome** (Trisomy 21) is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 and is characterized by intellectual disability, a specific facial appearance, and often other health issues like heart defects.\n\n- **Turner Syndrome** affects females and is characterized by the partial or complete absence of one X chromosome. Features include short stature, lack of ovarian development, and other physical characteristics.\n\n- **Klinefelter Syndrome** affects males and is characterized by an extra X chromosome (47, XXY). Features can include small testes, infertility, gynecomastia, and variable cognitive and behavioral issues.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Prader-Willi syndrome."
