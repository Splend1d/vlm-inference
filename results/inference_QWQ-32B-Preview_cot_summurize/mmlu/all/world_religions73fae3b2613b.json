I think I remember from my studies that Islam means submission, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look it up to confirm.\n\nSo, Islam is one of the world's major religions, and I know it has specific practices and beliefs. But what does the word itself mean in Arabic? I recall that Arabic is a Semitic language, and sometimes the meanings of words can be a bit different from English.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Worship - Worship is an act of revering or honoring a deity. While worship is certainly a part of Islam, I don't think that's what the word \"Islam\" specifically means.\n\nB. Submission - This seems familiar. I think Islam teaches that believers should submit to the will of Allah. So, maybe this is the correct answer.\n\nC. Obedience - Obedience is similar to submission, but perhaps more about following rules and commands. Maybe this is also a aspect of Islam, but is it the direct meaning of the word?\n\nD. Faith - Faith is a belief in something, especially a religion. While Islam certainly involves faith, I'm not sure if that's the literal meaning of the word.\n\nI think I need to recall the root of the word \"Islam\" in Arabic. In Arabic, words are built from root letters, and \"Islam\" comes from the root \"S-L-M,\" which can mean peace, submission, or surrender.\n\nSo, the word \"Islam\" is derived from the trilateral root S\u012bn-L\u0101m-M\u012bm, which is also the root for the Arabic term \"sal\u0101m,\" meaning peace.\n\nIn the context of religion, \"Islam\" is often translated as \"submission\" or \"surrender\" to the will of Allah. So, option B, submission, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check if \"obedience\" is a closer translation. Obedience implies following orders or rules, which is part of submitting to Allah's will, but \"submission\" seems more encompassing.\n\nAlso, \"faith\" is a component of Islam, but again, it's not the direct translation of the word itself.\n\n\"Worship\" is something that is done as part of submitting to Allah, but again, it's not the core meaning of the word \"Islam.\"\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. Submission.\n\nJust to make sure, I might look it up online or in a textbook to confirm.\n\nYes, according to various sources, \"Islam\" in Arabic indeed means \"submission\" or \"surrender\" to the will of Allah. So, I can be confident that option B is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
