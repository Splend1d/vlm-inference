Euclidean\n\nIn Euclidean geometry, which is the geometry most people are familiar with from school, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is exactly 180 degrees. This is a fundamental property of flat, two-dimensional space.\n\nIn elliptical geometry, which is a type of non-Euclidean geometry that deals with curved surfaces like spheres, the sum of the angles in a triangle is greater than 180 degrees.\n\nIn hyperbolic geometry, another type of non-Euclidean geometry that deals with saddle-shaped spaces, the sum of the angles in a triangle is less than 180 degrees.\n\n\"Linear\" is not a type of geometry in this context, so it's not the correct answer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. Euclidean."
