So, Michael Walzer is a political philosopher known for his work on just war theory and political ethics. When it comes to terrorism, I recall that he has some specific thoughts on how to respond ethically.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. We make an effort to convince the terrorists that they are acting wrongly.\n\nHmm, that seems like a noble goal, but in the heat of a terrorist threat, I'm not sure if that's the primary concern. Maybe in the long term, but probably not in the immediate response.\n\nB. We avoid harming terrorists to the same extent that we would avoid harming innocent civilians.\n\nThis one sounds a bit confusing. Typically, in warfare, there's a distinction between combatants and non-combatants, where non-combatants should be protected as much as possible. Terrorists usually target civilians, which blurs this line. Walzer might argue that terrorists, by their nature, forfeit some protections, but still, harming them should be proportional and necessary.\n\nC. We attack the lower-ranking terrorists first.\n\nI don't recall Walzer specifying a hierarchy in targeting terrorists. In just war theory, the principle of discrimination is important, which means targeting only those who are directly involved in hostilities. But I don't think he prescribes starting with lower-ranking members.\n\nD. We do not repeat the wrongs of terrorism in the process.\n\nThis seems consistent with Walzer's emphasis on maintaining moral standards even in the face of immoral acts by others. He argues that in responding to terrorism, we should not adopt the same tactics or violate the same principles that the terrorists are flouting.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think option D is the most accurate reflection of Walzer's view. He would likely stress the importance of upholding ethical standards in our response to terrorism, ensuring that our actions do not mirror the injustices we are trying to combat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
