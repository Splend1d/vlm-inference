The term \"homely\" might be a bit outdated, but it generally means someone who isn't conventionally attractive. So, the person is friendizing this girl not because they like her or want to be her friend, but solely to make themselves feel better.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, this seems pretty self-centered and not very nice. The person is using someone else for their own emotional benefit without concerning themselves with the other person's feelings or well-being. This could be seen as manipulative or even exploitative.\n\nIn contrast, Scenario 2 is about staying home because the person knows they have a fever. This seems like a responsible decision. By staying home when they're sick, they're preventing the spread of illness to others, which is considerate and aligns with public health guidelines.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 involves behavior that is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not wrong at all.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
