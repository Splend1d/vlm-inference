They're currently using 6-bit sequences and planning to switch to 7-bit sequences. I need to figure out what the benefit of that change is, specifically how many more items they can uniquely identify.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how binary sequences work. Each bit in a binary sequence can be either a 0 or a 1. So, for a 6-bit sequence, there are 2 options for each bit. To find the total number of unique sequences, I multiply the number of options for each bit together. That means for 6 bits, it's 2^6.\n\nLet me calculate that: 2^6 is 64. So, with 6-bit sequences, they can uniquely identify 64 different items.\n\nNow, if they switch to 7-bit sequences, it's 2^7, which is 128 unique sequences.\n\nSo, by moving from 6 bits to 7 bits, they can go from identifying 64 items to 128 items.\n\nThe question is, which option best describes this result?\n\nA. 2 more items can be uniquely identified.\n\nWell, 128 - 64 is 64, not 2. So that's not right.\n\nB. 10 more items can be uniquely identified.\n\nAgain, it's 64 more, not 10.\n\nC. 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified.\n\n128 is indeed twice 64, so that's correct.\n\nD. 10 times as many items can be uniquely identified.\n\nThat would be 640, which is not the case.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 2 times as many items can be uniquely identified.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nI know that each additional bit doubles the number of possible sequences because you're adding another layer of 0s and 1s.\n\nSo, going from 6 to 7 bits should double the number of unique identifiers, which aligns with option C.\n\nAlternatively, if they wanted to know the exact number of additional items, it would be 64 more, but that's not offered as an option.\n\nTherefore, C is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
