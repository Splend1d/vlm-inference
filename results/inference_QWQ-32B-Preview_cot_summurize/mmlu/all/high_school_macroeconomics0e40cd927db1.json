It means that the resource is limited in supply compared to the demand for it. Basically, there's not enough to go around, so people have to make choices about how to use it.\n\nOkay, so let's look at each option:\n\nA. Labor - That's the work people do. Now, labor is definitely scarce because there are only so many hours in a day that people can work, and there are limits to how much work the population can do. So, people have to decide how to use their time and energy.\n\nB. Capital - This refers to things like machinery, buildings, and other man-made resources used in production. Capital is also scarce because it costs money and resources to create, and there's a limited amount available at any given time. Companies have to decide how to invest and use their capital efficiently.\n\nC. Human wants - These are the desires and needs that people have. Now, human wants are essentially unlimited. People always want more things, better quality, etc. Because wants are unlimited, but resources to satisfy those wants are limited, that's why we have scarcity in economics.\n\nD. Land - This is the natural resources, like land, water, minerals, and so on. Land is scarce because there's only so much of it available. For example, arable land for farming is limited, and natural resources can be depleted.\n\nSo, thinking about it, scarcity is about limited supplies. Now, among these options, labor, capital, and land are all limited resources that have to be allocated carefully. Human wants, on the other hand, are unlimited; they're not scarce, they're abundant.\n\nWait a minute, but in economics, scarcity is often defined in relation to human wants. Since wants are unlimited and resources are limited, that's why we have scarcity. So, in a way, human wants are the counterpart to scarce resources.\n\nBut the question is asking which of these is NOT a scarce economic resource. So, if resources are scarce and wants are unlimited, then human wants aren't scarce; they're abundant.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Human wants.\n\nLet me double-check. If I consider the definition of scarcity in economics, it's about limited availability relative to demand. Human wants aren't limited; they're insatiable. So, they don't fit the definition of scarce resources.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is tricky, and it's considering human wants as a resource in some way, but that doesn't make sense to me. Wants are what drive demand, but they're not resources themselves.\n\nSo, I think C. Human wants is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
