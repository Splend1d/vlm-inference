I know that radioactive elements are those that undergo radioactive decay, emitting particles or energy in the process.\n\nFirst, I recall that sodium (Na) is a common element, used in many compounds and even in our bodies. I don't think it's radioactive.\n\nNext, chromium (Cr) is another element I've heard of, often used in metals and alloys. I don't believe it's radioactive either.\n\nAmericium (Am) sounds familiar, and I think it's used in some types of smoke detectors. I think it might be radioactive.\n\nLastly, aluminum (Al) is widely used in packaging and machinery. It's not radioactive.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the periodic table to confirm. Americium is indeed a transuranic element, which means it's beyond uranium in the periodic table, and these elements are typically synthetic and radioactive.\n\nSodium, chromium, and aluminum are all stable elements found naturally, although some isotopes of them might be radioactive, the common forms are stable.\n\nSo, among the options given, americium (Am) is the radioactive element.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
