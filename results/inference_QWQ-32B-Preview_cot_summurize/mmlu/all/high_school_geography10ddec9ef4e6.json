                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these urban US settings is most likely to have planned communities. The options are ghettos, suburbs, CBDs, and transition zones. I think I need to understand what a planned community is first.\n\nA planned community, I believe, is a residential area that's designed and built with a specific plan in mind. It often includes features like controlled access, common areas, and sometimes even rules or covenants that govern how the community is maintained. Examples might include suburban developments where all the houses are built in a certain style or with certain amenities.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Ghettos: Ghettos are typically areas of a city where a particular group, often defined by ethnicity or race, lives. These areas often face social and economic challenges. I don't think ghettos are known for planned communities. In fact, they might be more associated with unplanned or informal housing.\n\nB. Suburbs: Suburbs are residential areas that surround cities. They often feature single-family homes and are known for their more spread-out, lower-density development compared to the city center. Suburbs are where I've heard a lot about planned communities, like master-planned developments or suburban enclaves with their own amenities.\n\nC. CBDs: CBD stands for Central Business District. These are the commercial hearts of cities, filled with offices, shops, and businesses. While there might be some residential areas in CBDs, they're primarily focused on commerce and work. I don't think planned communities are typical in CBDs.\n\nD. Transition zones: These are areas that are changing from one type of land use to another, often from commercial to residential or vice versa. They might be in the process of development or redevelopment. While there could be planning involved, I'm not sure if they specifically refer to planned communities.\n\nBased on this, I think suburbs are the most likely setting for planned communities. But let me double-check.\n\nI recall that suburbs emerged in the mid-20th century, especially after World War II, as places where middle-class families could afford homes with yards, often facilitated by government policies and the growth of the automobile. Many suburbs were built with a plan, including streets, parks, and sometimes even schools.\n\nIn contrast, ghettos often develop due to social and economic pressures, not planned development. CBDs are focused on business and may have some residential areas, but not typically planned communities. Transition zones are areas in flux, but not necessarily planned in the same way as a residential community.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Suburbs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
