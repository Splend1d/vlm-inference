                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Which of the following conditions is caused by a trinucleotide (triplet) repeat expansion?\" and the options are A. Cystic fibrosis, B. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, C. Huntington disease, and D. Osteogenesis imperfecta. I need to figure out which one is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion.\n\nFirst, I should remember what a trinucleotide repeat expansion is. I think it's when there are repeated sequences of three nucleotides in DNA, and sometimes these repeats can expand, leading to genetic disorders. So, these are also known as triplet repeats or trinucleotide repeats.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Cystic fibrosis. I know that cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which affects the production of mucus, sweat, and digestive juices. But I don't think it's related to trinucleotide repeats. I think it's more associated with deletions or other types of mutations.\n\nOption B: Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This is a muscle-wasting disease, and I believe it's caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Again, I don't recall it being related to trinucleotide repeats. Maybe it's caused by deletions or mutations in the gene, but not specifically triplet repeats.\n\nOption C: Huntington disease. Now, Huntington disease is a neurological disorder that gets worse over time. I think this one is associated with trinucleotide repeat expansions. I recall that it's caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene, which codes for the huntingtin protein. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption D: Osteogenesis imperfecta. This is a genetic disorder that affects collagen production, leading to brittle bones. I think it's usually caused by mutations in the genes coding for collagen, but not by trinucleotide repeats.\n\nBased on what I remember, Huntington disease is the one caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. To be sure, maybe I should quickly review what trinucleotide repeat disorders are.\n\nTrinucleotide repeat disorders occur when there is an abnormal expansion of repeating sequences of three nucleotides in DNA. These expansions can lead to changes in gene function and protein production, causing various diseases. Some examples include Huntington disease, fragile X syndrome, and spinocerebellar ataxias.\n\nIn Huntington disease specifically, there is an expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene, which leads to an abnormal huntingtin protein. This protein accumulates in cells and causes damage over time, particularly in the brain.\n\nCystic fibrosis, on the other hand, is most commonly caused by a deletion mutation in the CFTR gene, leading to a defective protein that affects ion transport.\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is usually caused by deletions or duplications in the dystrophin gene, which is very large, spanning multiple exons.\n\nOsteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the genes coding for type I collagen, such as COL1A1 and COL1A2, but not by trinucleotide repeats.\n\nSo, to summarize, among the options given, Huntington disease is the condition caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
