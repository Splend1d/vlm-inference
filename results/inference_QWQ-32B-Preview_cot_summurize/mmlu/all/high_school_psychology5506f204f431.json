                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Georgia and Kathy working in the hospital, but for different reasons. Georgia wants to help others, and Kathy is there just to make money. The question is asking about the difference in their motivations and gives a few options: primary and secondary drives, positive and negative loci of control, sympathetic and autonomic motivation, and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means so I can see which one fits best with Georgia and Kathy's situations.\n\nLet's start with primary and secondary drives. I think primary drives are basic biological needs, like hunger or thirst, and secondary drives are learned through experience or conditioning. But I'm not entirely sure how that applies here.\n\nNext, positive and negative loci of control. I believe this has to do with whether people think they have control over their lives or if external factors control them. Positive might be internal control, and negative external, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.\n\nSympathetic and autonomic motivation\u2014wait, the autonomic nervous system is divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic branches, but I'm not sure how that relates to motivation. Maybe I'm confusing terms here.\n\nLastly, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation comes from inside, like doing something because you enjoy it or find it satisfying, and extrinsic motivation is doing something to get an external reward, like money or praise.\n\nLooking back at Georgia and Kathy, Georgia is helping others because she wants to, which sounds like she's getting satisfaction from within. That seems intrinsic. Kathy, on the other hand, is working to make money, which is an external reward. That sounds extrinsic.\n\nSo, it seems like the difference between their motivations is intrinsic versus extrinsic.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nPrimary and secondary drives: Georgia's helpfulness might not be a primary drive like hunger; it's more of a psychological need. Kathy's desire for money could be related to fulfilling primary drives, but her motivation is still external. Maybe not the best fit.\n\nPositive and negative loci of control: This seems more about whether people believe they can control their own lives or not. It doesn't directly relate to why they're working in the hospital.\n\nSympathetic and autonomic motivation: Autonomic is a part of the nervous system, which doesn't seem relevant to motivation types.\n\nTherefore, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation seem to be the most appropriate terms to describe the difference between Georgia and Kathy's motivations.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
