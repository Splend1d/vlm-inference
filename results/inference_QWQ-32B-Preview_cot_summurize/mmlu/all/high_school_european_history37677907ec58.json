                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Herbert Spencer talking about government roles and poverty, and I need to figure out which social philosophy he's advocating. The options are Utopian socialism, social conservatism, Romanticism, or Social Darwinism. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these philosophies is about.\n\nUtopian socialism is about creating ideal societies where wealth and resources are shared equally, often through collective ownership and planning. It's like trying to build a perfect community where everyone is equal and taken care of.\n\nSocial conservatism is about preserving traditional social institutions and moral values. It usually supports established norms and resists change, favoring stability and order.\n\nRomanticism is more of an artistic and cultural movement that emphasizes emotion, individualism, and nature, often reacting against industrialization and rationalism.\n\nSocial Darwinism applies the principles of natural selection and survival of the fittest to human society. It suggests that only the strongest and most adaptable individuals or groups should thrive, and that government shouldn't interfere with this natural process.\n\nOkay, now looking back at Spencer's passage.\n\nHe says that the government shouldn't take on the role of relieving the poor because it goes against the principle of protecting individual freedom. He believes that enforcing fundamental laws to protect people's freedom is one thing, but ensuring their satisfaction is another.\n\nHe also mentions that the poverty of the incapable, the distress of the imprudent, and the starvation of the idle are \"harsh fatalities\" but are part of a larger, farseeing benevolence. He seems to suggest that these hardships serve a higher purpose for universal humanity.\n\nThe phrase \"survival of the fittest applied to humankind\" in the title also hints at his view.\n\nThis sounds a lot like Social Darwinism. He's arguing that allowing natural selection to occur in human society\u2014letting the strong thrive and the weak fail\u2014is beneficial in the long run for humanity as a whole.\n\nHe doesn't seem to be advocating for equal distribution of wealth or ideal societies, so it's not Utopian socialism. He's not emphasizing traditional values or resisting change, so it's not social conservatism. And he's not focusing on emotions or nature; he's discussing social policies and economics, so not Romanticism.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer is Social Darwinism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
